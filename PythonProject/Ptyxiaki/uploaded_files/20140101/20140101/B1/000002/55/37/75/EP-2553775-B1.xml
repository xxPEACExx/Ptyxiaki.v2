In this construction, a plurality of terminals of conductive metal are disposed in parallel in a circuit-board-side connector so as to be exposed to an inside of a mating connector insertion port. A terminal of a flat circuit element is fixedly held between upper and lower guide members of a flat-circuit-element-side connector. At the same time as both the connectors are fitted together, the terminals of the circuit-board-side connector are brought into elastic contact with a plurality of exposed conductors of the flat circuit element within the mating connector insertion port, and a projection on a flexible lock arm of the flat-circuit-element-side connector is brought into elastic engagement within a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> hollow portion in an upper wall of the circuit-board-side connector.

In this construction, an opening and an inclined guide rib are provided in an upper wall of one of connectors for not a flat circuit element but a wiring harness connection connectors, and a flexible arm which follows the guide rib and a mark at a distal end of the arm are provided in the other connector, so that when connectors are fitted together, the mark is caused to be positioned within the opening for recognition by the worker who fits the connectors together. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2004363044A"><text>JP-A-2004-363044</text></patcit> also describes a fitting confirmation construction in which when connectors are fitted together, a different colored portion of the other connector is positioned within an opening in one connector.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US2008009171A1"><text>US-2008/009171 A1</text></patcit> describes a fitting confirmation construction according to the preamble of claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0003">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0004">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the conventional fitting confirmation constructions described in the above mentionned documents, however, like an example shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 12</figref>, for example, when circuit-board-side connectors 18 are fixedly placed at one end of a hard circuit board 38, since an other circuit board package part 41 is disposed in front of the connectors 18, and additionally, like an example shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 13</figref>, when at least two upper and lower circuit boards 38, 38' are disposed one above the other, since the upper and lower circuit boards 38, 38' are connected together by connecting walls 42 at left- and right-hand side portions, when a flat-circuit-element-side connector 1' of a mating flat circuit element is fittingly connected to the lower circuit-board-side connector 18, the visual confirmation from the top or the front or sides as indicated by arrows C, D cannot be implemented due to the upper circuit board 38', the other circuit board package part 41 and the connecting walls 42. Thus, like an example shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 14</figref>, whether or not both the connectors 1', 18 are fitted together properly has to be confirmed visually from a direction indicated by arrow E, that is, from the rear in an inserting direction of the flat-circuit-element-side connector 1', causing a problem that the visual confirmation on whether or not both the connectors 1', 18 are fitted together properly is difficult.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In addition, the way of confirming the proper connectors fitting connection by visually confirming the movement of the marked arm as described in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP5343133A"><text>JP-A-5-343133</text></patcit> or the differently colored housing as described in <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP2004363044A"><text>JP-A-2004-363044</text></patcit> has<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> caused a problem that costs involved become high. The "rear" is referred to as so when the distal end side of the flat-circuit-element-side connector 1' is referred as "front" and the direction in which the flat circuit element 22 is led out is referred to as "rear."</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is therefore one advantageous aspect of the present invention to provide a fitting confirmation construction which enables a visual confirmation of proper connectors fitting connection, for example, in fittingly connecting one connector such as a flat-circuit-element-side connector to the other connector such as a circuit-board-side connector in the fittingly connecting direction or from the rear of the one connector simply and in an ensured fashion and moreover, with a simple and low-cost construction.</p><heading id="h0005">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fitting confirmation construction for confirming a connection between a first connector and a second connector, the fitting confirmation construction comprising:
<ul><li>a lock arm, provided in a housing of the first connector, and including:
<ul><li>a lock wall inclined and disposed at a front end of the lock arm in a direction from the first connector toward the second connector;</li><li>a deflection space formed at a rear of the lock wall in the direction; and</li><li>an operation plate disposed on the deflection space;</li></ul></li><li>a confirmation opening, provided in a rear wall of the housing, and having a height equal to a height of the deflection space; and<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></li><li>a lock projection, provided on the second connector, and configured to be brought into engagement with the lock wall,</li><li>wherein a rear end face of the operation plate is exposed to a rear outside of the housing of the first connector through the confirmation opening, only in a state where the lock arm is deflected.</li></ul></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The fitting confirmation construction may be configured such that: the lock arm includes a right arm and a left arm which connect the lock wall with the operation plate respectively; and lower inclined faces of the right arm and the left arm are exposed to the rear outside through the confirmation opening at a lower end side of the confirmation opening, only in the state where the lock arm is deflected.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The confirmation opening may be a mold removal cavity.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The fitting confirmation construction may be configured such that: the first connector is a flat element circuit side connector; and the second connector is a circuit board side connector.</p><heading id="h0006">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to the present invention, when both the connectors are fitted together incompletely, the lock projection is situated in an intermediate position on the inclined face of the lock arm of the lock arm, and the lock arm is deflected within the deflection space. Then, the operation plate portion of the lock is lowered, and a rear end face of the operation plate portion approaches to be situated very close to the confirmation opening in the housing of the one connector in front thereof, whereby the rear end face of the operation plate portion can be visually confirmed within the confirmation opening from the rear<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> (directly rear) of the one connector. When both the connectors are fitted together completely, the lock projection is brought into engagement with a rear side of the lock wall, and at the same time the lock arm is restored, whereby the operation plate portion is raised so that the rear end face of the operation plate portion is situated in a position lying above the confirmation opening. Thus, the rear end face of the operation plate portion cannot be visually confirmed within the confirmation opening from the rear. By visually confirming these facts, the incomplete or complete fitting connection of both the connectors can easily be detected in an ensured fashion.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to the present invention, even when the worker stands in an inappropriate position or even when obstacles such as other package parts are lying in front of, above or to sides of the lock are of the connector, by visually confirming the locked condition of the lock arm within the confirmation opening from the rear of the connector and moreover, by visually confirming the rear end face of the operation plate portion which lies right close to the confirmation opening, whether both the connectors are fitted together properly or improperly can be determined easily and in an ensured fashion. Since the confirmation opening results from a mold removal cavity when molding the lock arm of resin, no additional cost has to be incurred, thereby making it possible to confirm that the connectors are fitted together properly with the simple construction and in low cost.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the present invention, when both the connectors are fitted together incompletely, the lock arm is deflected, whereby the lower inclined faces of the pair of arm portions are lowered and the lower inclined faces are situated at the lower end side of the confirmation opening. Thus,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the lower inclined faces can visually be confirmed at the lower end side of the confirmation opening from the rear or the just rear of the one connector. The rear end face of the operation plate portion is positioned on an upper side of the pair of arm portions within the confirmation opening. When both connectors are fitted together completely, the lock arm is restored, and the lower inclined faces of the pair of arm portions rise to be situated at an upper end side of the confirmation opening, whereby the lower inclined faces of the pair of arm portions can visually be confirmed at the upper end side of the confirmation opening from the rear. This ensures that both the connectors are fitted together.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to the present invention, by confirming the position of the pair of arm portions within the confirmation opening in addition to the visual confirmation of the rear end face of the operation plate portion as done according to the first aspect, the confirmation of the proper fitting connection of both the connectors can be implemented in a further ensured fashion.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the present invention, for example, when, with circuit boards disposed in a plurality of stages, a flat-circuit-element-side connector is fittingly connected to a circuit-board-side connector of a lower circuit board from the rear, even in the event that the confirmation of fitting connection or lock of both the connectors cannot be implemented from the front, top and sides, the proper fitting connection of both the connectors can facilitated and ensured by visually confirming what is occurring within the confirmation opening from the rear.</p><heading id="h0007">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --><p id="p0019" num="0019"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a perspective view showing an embodiment of a flat-circuit-element-side connector in a fitting confirmation construction according to the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> is a sectional view taken along the line A-A showing the same flat-circuit-element-side connector.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is a rear view of the same flat-circuit-element-side connector.
