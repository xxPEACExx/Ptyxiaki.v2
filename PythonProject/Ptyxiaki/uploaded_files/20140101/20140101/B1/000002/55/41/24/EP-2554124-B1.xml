The ultrasonic probe 2 may be the one that allows an ultrasonic vibrator to mechanically scan, or the one that allows plural ultrasonic vibrators to electronically scan.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The transmission/reception unit 3 is electrically connected to the ultrasonic probe 2, transmits the pulse signal to the ultrasonic probe 2, and receives an echo signal, which is a reception signal, from the ultrasonic probe 2. Specifically, the transmission/reception unit 3 generates a pulse signal based upon a waveform and transmission timing, set beforehand, and transmits the generated pulse signal to the ultrasonic probe 2.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The transmission/reception unit 3 is electrically connected to the ultrasonic probe 2, transmits the pulse signal to the ultrasonic probe 2, and receives an echo signal from the ultrasonic probe 2. Specifically, the transmission/reception unit 3 generates a pulse signal<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> based upon a waveform and transmission timing, set beforehand, and transmits the generated pulse signal to the ultrasonic probe 2. The transmission/reception unit 3 performs a process such as an amplification or filtering to the received echo signal, and then, generates a digital RF signal through an A/D conversion. Then, it outputs the digital RF signal. When the ultrasonic probe 2 is configured to electronically scan plural ultrasonic vibrators, the transmission/reception unit 3 has a multichannel circuit for synthesizing beams corresponding to the plural ultrasonic vibrators.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The computation unit 4 includes a frequency analyzing unit 41 that performs fast Fourier transform (FFT) to the digital RF signal outputted from the transmission/reception unit 3 so as to analyze a frequency of the echo signal, a feature data extracting unit 42 that performs an attenuation correction process for reducing a contribution of an attenuation generated according to the reception depth and the frequency of the ultrasonic wave, and an approximation process to the frequency spectrum (power spectrum) calculated by the frequency analyzing unit 41 during the propagation of the ultrasonic wave, in order to extract a feature data of a specimen, and a degree-of-association calculating unit 43 that calculates a degree of association between the feature data extracted by the feature data extracting unit 42 and each of the plural groups stored in the storage unit 8.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The frequency analyzing unit 41 calculates the frequency spectrum of each sound ray (line data) by performing the fast Fourier transform to a FFT data group including predetermined amount of data. The frequency spectrum indicates a different tendency depending upon a tissue characterization of the specimen. This is because<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the frequency spectrum has a correlation with the size of the specimen serving as a scattering substance scattering the ultrasonic wave, a density, and an acoustic impedance.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The feature data extracting unit 42 includes an approximation unit 421 that calculates a pre-correction feature data, which is an amount before the execution of the attenuation correction process, by performing the approximation process to the frequency spectrum calculated by the frequency analyzing unit 41, and an attenuation correction unit 422 that extracts the feature data by performing the attenuation correction process to the pre-correction feature data approximated by the approximation unit 421.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The approximation unit 421 approximates the frequency spectrum with a primary expression according to a regression analysis, thereby extracting the pre-correction feature data characterizing the approximated primary expression. Specifically, the approximation unit 421 calculates a slope a<sub>0</sub> and an intercept b<sub>0</sub> of the primary expression according to the regression analysis, and calculates the intensity of a specific frequency within a frequency band of the frequency spectrum as the pre-correction feature data. In the first embodiment, the approximation unit 421 is supposed to calculate an intensity (Mid-band fit) c<sub>0</sub> = a<sub>0</sub>f<sub>MID</sub> + b<sub>0</sub> at a center frequency f<sub>MID</sub> = (f<sub>LOW</sub> + f<sub>HIGH</sub>)/2. However, this is only one example. The "intensity" here means any one of parameters including a voltage, power, sound pressure, and acoustic energy.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Among the three feature data, the slope a<sub>0</sub> has a correlation with the size of the scattering body of the ultrasonic wave, and it is generally considered that the slope has a smaller value, as the size of the scattering<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> body is large. The intercept b<sub>0</sub> has a correlation with the size of the scattering body, the difference in the acoustic impedance, and the density (concentration) of the scattering body. Specifically, it is considered that the intercept b<sub>0</sub> has a larger value, as the size of the scattering body is large, as the acoustic impedance is large, and as the density (concentration) of the scattering body is large. The intensity at the center frequency f<sub>MID</sub> (hereinafter merely referred to as "intensity") c<sub>0</sub> is an indirect parameter derived from the slope a<sub>0</sub> and the intercept b<sub>0</sub>, and it gives a spectrum intensity at the center in the effective frequency band. Therefore, it is considered that the intensity c<sub>0</sub> has not only a correlation with the size of the scattering body, the difference in the acoustic impedance, and the density of the scattering body, but also a correlation with the brightness of the B-mode image to a certain extent. The approximate polynomial calculated by the feature data extracting unit 42 is not limited to the primary expression, but a second-order or higher-order approximate polynomial may be used.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The correction executed by the attenuation correction unit 422 will be described. An attenuation amount A of the ultrasonic wave can be expressed as: <maths id="math0001" num="(1)"><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">A</mi><mo>=</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">αzf</mi></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="141" he="9" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
Here, α is an attenuation rate, z is a reception depth of the ultrasonic wave, and f is a frequency. As is apparent from the equation (1), the attenuation amount A is in proportion to the frequency f. The specific value of the attenuation rate α for a living body is 0 to 1.0 (dB/cm/MHz), and more preferably 0.3 to 0.7 (dB/cm/MHz). The attenuation rate is determined according to a type of an organ to be observed. For example, when the organ to be<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> observed is pancreas, it is determined that α = 0.6 (dB/cm/MHz). It can be configured in the first embodiment that the value of the attenuation rate α can be changed by the input from the input unit 6.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The attenuation correction unit 422 corrects the pre-correction feature data (slope a<sub>0</sub>, intercept b<sub>0</sub>, intensity c<sub>0</sub>) extracted by the approximation unit 421 as described below. <maths id="math0002" num="(2)"><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">0</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">αz</mi></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="143" he="8" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> <maths id="math0003" num="(3)"><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">b</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">b</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">0</mn></msub></math><img id="ib0003" file="imgb0003.tif" wi="143" he="9" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> <maths id="math0004" num="(4)"><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">0</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">αzf</mi><mi>MID</mi></msub><mspace width="1em"/><mfenced separators=""><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>af</mi><mi>MID</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">b</mi></mfenced></math><img id="ib0004" file="imgb0004.tif" wi="143" he="8" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
As is apparent from the equations (2) and (4), the attenuation correction unit 422 makes a correction with a large correction amount, as the reception depth z of the ultrasonic wave is larger. According to the equation (3), the correction involved with the intercept is an identical transformation. This is because the intercept is not subject to the attenuation, since the intercept is the frequency component corresponding to the frequency 0 (Hz).</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The degree-of-association calculating unit 43 calculates the degree of association between the feature data extracted by the feature data extracting unit 42 and each of the groups by using a statistic of a population including at least the feature data of the respective groups stored in the storage unit 8. More specifically, the degree-of-association calculating unit 43 sets a feature data space, which has at least any one of the plural feature data extracted by the feature data extracting unit 42 as a component, and calculated, as the degree of association, the distance on the feature data space between a specimen point having the feature data, serving as the component in the set feature data space, out<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> of the feature data of the frequency spectrum of the specimen as a coordinate in the feature data space, and a known specimen average point having an average of the feature data serving as the component in the feature data space out of the feature data of the plural groups of the known specimens as the coordinate of the feature data space.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The average and standard deviation of the feature data of the frequency spectrum of the ultrasonic reception signal reflects a change in a cell level such as an enlarged nucleus, and heteromorphy of nucleus in a specimen, or a change in a tissue such as increased fibra in interstitium, or replacement of a parenchymal tissue into a fiber, and it indicates a unique value according to the tissue characterization. The "tissue characterization" here means any one of a cancer, endocrine tumor, mucinous tumor, normal tissue, and vessel channel. When the specimen is a pancreas, the tissue characterization includes chronic pancreatitis, and autoimmune pancreatitis. In view of the above circumstance, the groups stored in the storage unit 8 are desirably determined according to the type of the tissue characterization. Therefore, it is supposed in the description below that the groups stored in the storage unit 8 are determined according to the type of the tissue characterization.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The image processing unit 5 includes a B-mode image data generating unit 51 that generates B-mode image data from the echo signal, and a calculation result display image data generating unit 52 that generates calculation result display image data that is ultrasonic image data for displaying the calculation result of the degree of association by using the calculation result of the degree of association calculated by the degree-of-association calculating unit 43 and the B-mode image data generated by<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> the B-mode image data generating unit 51.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The B-mode image data generating unit 51 performs, to the digital signal, a signal processing using a known technique such as a bandpass filter, logarithmic conversion, gain process or contrast process, and generates the B-mode image data by decimating the data according to a data step width determined by a display range of the image on the display unit 7.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The calculation result display image data generating unit 52 generates the calculation result display image data by using the B-mode image data generated by the B-mode image data generating unit 51, the feature data extracted by the feature data extracting unit 42, and the result calculated by the degree-of-association calculating unit 43.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The storage unit 8 includes a known specimen information storage unit 81 that stores information of the known specimen, a window function storage unit 82 that stores a window function used for the frequency analyzing process executed by the frequency analyzing unit 41, and a correction information storage unit 83 that stores correction information referred to during the execution of the process by the attenuation correction unit 422.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The known specimen information storage unit 81 stores the feature data of the frequency spectrum extracted from the known specimen in association with the tissue characterization of the known specimen.

The feature data of the known specimen is extracted in the same manner as in the first embodiment. It is to be noted that the process of extracting the feature data of the known specimen is not necessarily executed by the ultrasonic observation apparatus 1. It is desirable that the information of the known specimen stored in the known specimen information storage unit 81 has high reliability for the tissue characterization. The window function storage unit 82 stores at least any one of window functions of Hamming, Hanning, and Blackman. The correction information storage unit 83 stores information involved with the transformation of the equations (2) to (4).</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The storage unit 8 is realized by ROM that preliminarily stores an operating program of the ultrasonic observation apparatus according to the first embodiment or a program of starting a predetermined OS, and RAM that stores operation parameters or data for each process.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The components, other than the ultrasonic probe 2, of the ultrasonic observation apparatus 1 thus configured are realized by using a computer provided with a CPU having a computation and control functions.

In <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the ultrasonic observation apparatus 1 firstly measures a new specimen by the ultrasonic probe 2 (step S1).</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Then, the B-mode image data generating unit 51 generates the B-mode image data by using the echo signal for the B-mode image outputted from the transmission/reception unit 3 (step S2).</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Next, the control unit 9 makes control to display the B-mode image corresponding to the B-mode image data generated by the B-mode image data generating unit 51 onto the display unit 7 (step S3). <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a view illustrating a display example of the B-mode image on the display unit 7. The B-mode image 100 in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a grayscale image in which values of R (red), G (green), and B (blue), which are variables when an RGB color system is employed as a color space, are matched to one another.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Then, the frequency analyzing unit 41 calculates the frequency spectrum by performing the frequency analysis according to the FFT calculation (step S4). The process (step S4) executed by the frequency analyzing unit 41 will be described in detail with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>. Firstly, the frequency analyzing unit 41 sets a sound ray number L of a sound ray that is a subject to be analyzed to an initial value L<sub>0</sub> (step S21). The initial value L<sub>0</sub> may be applied to a sound ray that the transmission/reception unit 3 receives first, or may be applied to a sound ray corresponding to one of boundary positions on the left and on the right of a region of interest set by the input unit 6.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Next, the frequency analyzing unit 41 calculates<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> all frequency spectrums on plural data positions set on one sound ray. Firstly, the frequency analyzing unit 41 sets an initial value Z<sub>0</sub> on a data position Z (corresponding to the reception depth) representative of a series of data group (FFT data group) acquired for the FFT calculation (step S22). <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a view schematically illustrating a data array of one sound ray.

In <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, the first data on the sound ray LD is set as the initial value Z<sub>0</sub> on the data position Z. <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates only one example, and any position can be set as the position of the initial value Z<sub>0</sub>. For example, the data position Z corresponding to the upper end of the region of interest may be set as the initial value Z<sub>0</sub>.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Then, the frequency analyzing unit 41 acquires the FFT data group on the data position Z (step S23), and allows the window function stored in the window function storage unit 82 to work on the acquired FFT data group (step S24). Allowing the window function to work on the FFT data group as described above avoids that the FFT data group becomes discontinuity on the boundary, and can prevent the occurrence of artifacts.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Next, the frequency analyzing unit 41 determines whether the FFT data group on the data position Z is a normal data group or not (step S25). The FFT data group has to have a power-of-2 data number. The data number of the FFT data group is supposed to be 2<sup>n</sup> (n is a positive integer) hereinafter. The case where the FFT data group is normal means that the data position Z is on the 2<sup>n-1-</sup>th<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> position from the head of the FFT data group. In other words, the case where the FFT data group is normal means that there are 2<sup>n-1</sup> - 1 (= N) data before the data position Z, and there are 2<sup>n-1</sup> (= M) data after the data position Z.

Therefore, even if the zero data is inserted to the FFT data group, a data discontinuity does not occur.

When the data position Z is larger than the final data position Z<sub>max</sub> as a result of the determination (step S29: Yes), the frequency analyzing unit 41 increments the sound ray number L by 1 (step S30). On the other hand, when the data position Z is not more than the final data position Z<sub>max</sub> (step S29: No), the frequency analyzing unit 41 returns to step S23.

Therefore, a two-dimensional space having any two of the three feature data as components can be set as the feature data space. Alternatively, a one-dimensional space having any one of the three feature data as a component can be set as the feature data space.

When any two of the distances d<sub>µ</sub>, d<sub>ν</sub>, and d<sub>ρ</sub> assume the minimum value, the degree-of-association calculating unit 43 may select all tissue characterizations corresponding to the minimum value as candidates, or may select any one of the tissue characterization according to a prescribed rule.
