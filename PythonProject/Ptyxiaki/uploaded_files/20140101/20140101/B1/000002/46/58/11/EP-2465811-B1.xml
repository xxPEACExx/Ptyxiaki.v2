front and rear wheel support frames at their lower ends, and extended guide rails for guiding a platform are provided being connected to the guide portion of the platform at the front and rear support rods.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The conventional stacker crane disclosed in the Japanese Patent Preliminarily Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2003237909A"><text>2003-237909</text></patcit> is arranged such that the front and rear support rods are mounted to and supported by the connecting frame at their lower ends. Therefore, the weights of the front and rear support rods, the upper frame, and the platform and the weight of articles held by the platform would act against the connecting frame which connects the front and rear wheel support frames for supporting the running wheels.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Since such heavy weight acts on the connecting frame, the connecting frame should have sufficient strength, which made the connecting frame expensive and therefore it was difficult to make the cost for the lower frame itself cheaper.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The conventional stacker crane disclosed in the Patent Preliminarily Publication No. 2006-76715 is arranged such that the front and rear support rods are mounted on the top surface of the front and rear wheel support frames at their lower ends. Therefore, the front and rear<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> wheel support frames have to bear the weights of the front and rear support rods, the upper frame, the platform and the weight of articles held by the platform.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Since such heavy weight does not act on the connecting frame for connecting the front and rear wheel support frames, the connecting frame does not need to be so strong and therefore could be manufactured cheaper.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, as mentioned above, the stacker crane disclosed in the Patent Preliminarily Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US200676715B"><text>2006-76715</text></patcit> includes extended guide rails for guiding a platform, which are connected to the guide portion of the platform at the front and rear support rods, on the side surfaces of the front and rear wheel support frames.

Whereby:
<ul><li>the lower frame is comprised of the front and rear wheel support frames for supporting running wheels and a connecting frame, wherein these wheel support frames are connected to the lower frame via the connecting frame;</li><li>a flange for holding and mounting the lower end surface of the front support rod of the front and rear support rods is provided at a lower end of the front wheel support frame of the front and rear wheel support frames, and a flange for holding and mounting the lower end surface of the rear support rod of the front and rear support rods is provided at the lower end of the rear wheel support frame of the front and rear wheel support frames;<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></li><li>the front support rod is arranged in such a manner that the lower end surface thereof is held on the flange of the front wheel support frame and the side surface of the front support rod is connected and supported by the front wheel support rod; and</li><li>the rear support rod is arranged in such a manner that the lower end surface thereof is held on the flange of the rear wheel support frame and the side surface of the rear support rod is connected and supported by the rear wheel support rod.</li></ul></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">That is to say, according to the invention, the lower end surface of the front support rod is held on the flange of the front wheel support frame, while the lower end surface of the rear support rod is held on the flange of the rear wheel support frame. Therefore, the weight of the front and rear support rods, the upper frame, the platform and the articles to be held by the platform is born by the front and rear wheel support frames, so that heavy weight acting on the connecting frame which connects the front and rear running wheels support frames for supporting the running wheels can be prevented.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In addition, since the side surface of the front support rod is connected and supported by the front wheel support frame and the side surface of the rear support rod is connected and supported by the rear wheel support frame, the conditions that the lower end surface of the front support rod is supported by the flange of the front wheel support frame and that the lower end surface of the rear support rod is supported by the flange of the rear wheel support frame can be accurately maintained. Therefore, even if making the flange provided at the lower end of the front wheel support frame or the flange at the lower end of the rear wheel support frame compact, it is possible to support the lower end surfaces of the front and rear support rods appropriately on the flange of the front and rear wheel support frames, respectively.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Further, the flange for holding and mounting the lower end surface of the front support rod is formed at the lower end portion of the front wheel support frame, and, the flange for holding and mounting the lower end surface of the rear support rod is formed at the lower end of the rear wheel support frame, so that the front and rear support rods can be positioned over the whole moving range of the platform. Therefore, the platform can be guided by the front and rear support rods over the whole moving range of the platform.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As a result, heavy weight acting on the connecting frame, which connects the front and rear wheel support frames for supporting running wheels can be prevented with the aid of the construction that the lower end surfaces of the front and rear rods are held by the flanges formed with the front and rear wheel support frames. Thus, the flanges can be made cheaper. In addition, since the size of the flanges to be formed<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> with the front and rear wheel support frames can be made compact, increases to the costof manufacturing the front and rear wheel support frames, which is caused by forming the flanges, can be avoided. Furthermore, since the platform can be guided by the front and rear support rods over the whole moving range of the platform, the guiding structure for the platform does not become so complex.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In short, according to the first characteristic structure of the present invention, a stacker crane can be provided where the weight of the front and rear support rods, the upper frame, the platform and the articles to be held by the platform is appropriately supported and the platform can be suitably guided over the whole moving range of the platform, while the cost for manufacturing the lower frame can be kept low.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The second characteristic structure of the present invention, in addition to the first characteristic structure mentioned above, is:
<ul><li>a mount for the front support rod, which is for holding and mounting a portion other than the portion of the lower end surface of the front support rod to be held by the flange of the front wheel support frame in, and a mount for the rear support rod, which is for holding and mounting a portion other than the portion of the lower end surface of the rear support rod to be held by the flange of the rear wheel support frame are provided on the connecting frame.</li></ul></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">That is to say, in addition to the fact that the lower end surfaces of the front and rear support rods are held by the flanges formed with the front and rear wheel support frames, the portions, which are different from the portions of the lower end of the front and rear support rods, which are held by the flange, are held by the mounts provided on the connecting frame for the front and rear support rods.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In other words, the lower end surface of the front support rod and the lower end surface of the rear support rod are held and supported both by the flange formed with the front and rear wheel support frames and by the mount for front support rod and the mount for rear support rod which are provided on the connecting frame, respectively.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Since the different portions on the lower end surface of the front support rod are held and supported both by the flange formed on the front wheel support frame and by the mount for the front support rod provided on the connecting frame, it is possible to hold the lower surface of the front support rod while inhibiting the inclination of the front support rod; and since the different portions on the lower end surface of the rear support rod are held and supported both by the flange formed on the rear wheel support frame and by the mount for the rear support rod provided on the connecting frame, it is possible to hold the lower surface of the rear support rod while inhibiting the inclination of the rear support rod. Therefore, the correct attitude of the front and rear support<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> rods can be maintained.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Incidentally, in the case of rectangular shaft type front and rear support rods, for instance, by arranging such that one side of the lower end surface of the rod is supported by the flange formed with the wheel support frame and the other side of the lower end surface, which is adjacent to the one side being supported by the flange, is supported by the another mount for the front support rod or the mount for the rear support rod, the inclination of the front and rear support rods can be appropriately and easily controlled in the back and forth and left and right directions.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Thus, according to the second characteristic structure of the present invention, a stacker crane can be provided by which the front and rear support rods can be held and supported in a condition in which the front and rear support rods are hard to be inclined, in addition to the function and effect in accordance with the first characteristic structure.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The third characteristic structure of the stacker crane according to the present invention, in addition to the first and second characterized structures mentioned above, is:
<ul><li>a first support for the front support rod, which is connected to a portion different from the portion being connected and supported by the front wheel support frame of the side surfaces of the front support rod, and a second support for the rear support rod, which is connected to the another portion different from the portion being connected to and supported by the rear wheel support frame of the side surfaces of the rear support rod, are provided with the connecting frame.</li></ul></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">That is to say, in addition to the fact that the side surfaces of the front and rear support rods are connected to the front and rear wheel support frames, the portions other than those connected to the front and rear wheel support frames of the side surfaces of the front and rear support rods are connected to the first and second supports for the front and rear support rods, respectively, which are provided with the connecting frame.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In other words, the side surfaces of the front and rear support rods are connected to both the front and rear wheel support frames and to both the first and second supports for the front and rear support rods, respectively, which are provided with the connecting frame.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Therefore, since the side surfaces of the front and rear support rods are supported by the front and rear wheel support frames and by the first and second supports for the front and rear wheel support at different portions, rotation of the front and rear support rods about the shaft center along the longitudinal direction of the rods or inclination of the front and rear support rods can be appropriately prevented, so that the correct attitude of the front and rear support rods can be maintained.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Incidentally, in the case of rectangular shaft type front and rear support rods, rotation of the front and rear support rods about the shaft center along the longitudinal direction of the rods or back and forth/left and right inclination of the front and rear support rods can be appropriately prevented by an arrangement such that one of the four surfaces of the shaft is connected to the front and rear wheel support frames, respectively, and another one of the four surfaces, which is adjacent to the one of the four surfaces, is connected to the front and rear support for the front and rear support rods,</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Thus, according to the third characteristic structure of the present invention, a stacker crane can be provided by which the rotation of the front and rear support rods about the shaft center along the longitudinal direction of the rods or the inclination of the front and rear support rods can be prevented.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The fourth characteristic structure of the stacker crane according to the present invention, in addition to the first to third characteristic structures mentioned above, is:
<ul><li>the front support rod is arranged on the back side of the front wheel support frame; and</li><li>the rear support rod is arranged on the front side of the rear wheel support frame.</li></ul></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">That is to say, since the front support rod is positioned on the back side of the front wheel support frame and the rear support rod is positioned on the front side of the rear wheel support frame, the front running wheels and the front support rod are lined up along the back and forth direction of the stacker crane and the rear running wheels and the rear support rod are lined up along the back and forth direction of the stacker crane. Therefore, the load acting on the front wheel support frame via the front support rod can be suitably carried by the front running wheels, and the load acting on the rear wheel support frame via the rear support rod can be suitably carried by the rear running wheels.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In other words, the weight of the front and rear support rods, the upper frame, the platform, and the articles held on the platform can be supported by the front and rear running wheels in balance and therefore the lower frame becomes hard to incline back and forth and around; as a result, the attitude of the front and rear support rods can be stabilized.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In short, according to the fourth characteristic structure of the present invention, a stacker crane can be provided by which the attitude of the front and rear support rods is stabilized, in addition to the function and effect in accordance with any one of the first to third characteristic structures.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The fifth characteristic structure of the stacker crane according to the present invention, in addition to the first to fourth characterized structures mentioned above, is:
<ul><li>said connecting frame is provided at one of the lateral sides of the front and rear wheel support frames.</li></ul></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">That is to say, since the connecting frame is provided at one of the lateral sides of the front and rear wheel support frames, the structure of the lower frame can be made simple in comparison to the case in which the connecting frame is arranged at both the lateral sides of the front and rear wheel support frames.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">That is to say, by adopting the structure in which the connecting frame is provided at one of the lateral sides of the front and rear wheel support frames, focusing attention on the fact that for the weight of the front and rear support rods, the upper frame, the platform, and the articles held on the platform can be supported by the front and rear running wheels support frames, no heavy load acts on the connecting frame, the cost for manufacturing the lower frame can be made cheaper.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In short, according to the fifth characteristic structure of the present invention, a stacker crane can be provided by which the cost for manufacturing the lower frame can be reduced, in addition to the function and effect of the first to fourth characteristic structure.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The sixth characteristic structure of the stacker crane according to the present invention, in addition to the first to fifth characteristic structures mentioned above, is:
<ul><li>one of the running wheels on the front and rear end of the lower frame is constituted as a driving wheel and the other running wheel is constituted as an idling wheel; and</li><li>the idling wheel is equipped in the wheel support frame therefor in a manner that the vertical position of the idling wheels are adjustable.</li></ul></p><p id="p0041" num="0041">That is to say, since one of the running wheels on the front and rear end portions of the lower frame is constituted as a driving wheel and the other of the running wheel is as an idling wheel, the structure of these wheels can be made simpler, in comparison to a case in which both front and rear running wheels are arranged as driving wheels.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Further, since the idling wheel which is not connected to any driving means, such as an electric motor, is rigged to the wheel support frame therefor so that the vertical position of the idling wheel is adjustable, the inclination of the lower frame in a back and forth direction can be controlled by the vertical position adjustment of the idling wheel.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In a condition in which the front and rear support rods and the upper frame are<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> mounted on the lower frame, the front and rear support rods will sometimes be inclined in a back and forth direction by some manufacturing error such as an assembling error. In such a case, according to the invention, it can be possible to put the front and rear support rods into an appropriate posture where the rods do not incline in a back or forth direction by adjusting the vertical position of the idling wheel with respect to the wheel support frame.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Since the idling wheel is not connected to any driving means, such as electric motor, it is easy to rig the idling wheel with respect to the wheel support frame in a manner such that the vertical position of the wheel is adjustable. Therefore, even if the idling wheel is rigged to be adjustable in a vertical direction, the construction of the lower frame will not be so complex.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In other words, when rigging driving wheels, to which a driving means, such as an electric motor, is connected, in a vertically adjustable manner with respect to the wheel support frame, it will be necessary to arrange special measures to the driving means. For instance, in such a case in which the driving means, such as an electric motor, is integrally rigged with the driving wheels, special wiring for controlling the driving means should be arranged such that the driving wheels are movable in a vertical direction. Then, the structure of the lower frame will be complex.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In short, according to the sixth characteristic structure of the present invention, a stacker crane can be provided by which the posture of the front and rear support rods can be controlled, in addition to the function and effect in accordance with anyone of the first to fifth characteristic structures.
