<ul><li>a support mounting for mounting the device on a frame,</li><li>a first and a second seat, which are each provided with a covering element which is adapted to lie against the object,</li><li>a first carrier element which is connected via at least a first rotation mounting to the support mounting, which first carrier element is connected via a second and a further second rotation mounting to respectively the first and the second seat.</li></ul></p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Such a device is known in the field and marketed at least by applicant. Document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US7025531B"><text>US 7025531</text></patcit> constitutes the closest prior art. This device is used for supporting on either side a vessel, the hull of which generally has a double curve. The weight of the vessel is at least partially carried by the first and the second seat of each supporting device. Each seat loaded by the weight of the vessel thus produces a concentration of stress in the hull of the vessel. There is a trend to manufacture vessels more cheaply, for instance by saving on material costs. In order to achieve this object, hulls of the vessels are given a thinner form, whereby greater stresses occur in the hull when the vessel is supported with the known device. Because of the trend of manufacturing vessels more cheaply by applying a minimal wall thickness, it occurs increasingly more often that a seat causes concentrations of stress exceeding a maximum acceptable value in the hull of the vessel, whereby damage to the hull of the vessel occurs.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The present invention has for its object to prevent damage to vessels, which damage is the result of the vessel being supported via the hull thereof, particularly the damage which occurs in vessels whose hull comprises a very thin wall.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The device according to the invention has for this purpose the feature that a second carrier element is connected via the second rotation mounting to the first carrier element, which second carrier element is connected via a third rotation mounting to the first seat, and that a third seat is connected via a fourth rotation mounting to the second carrier element, and that a further<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> second carrier element is connected via the further second rotation mounting to the first carrier element, which further second carrier element is connected via a further third rotation mounting to the second seat, and that a fourth seat is connected via a further fourth rotation mounting to the further second carrier element, wherein the third and the fourth seat are each provided with a covering element which is adapted to lie against the object.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">This makes possible a device for supporting an object such as the vessel, which device is adapted to lie over a greater surface area against the hull, wherein the position of the seats of the supporting device can further be adjusted to the shape of the hull in order to reduce stress concentrations on the hull of the object, thereby decreasing the chance of damage to the vessel at the position of the hull with a very small wall thickness.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">This enables a very stable embodiment of the device according to the invention in which the first, second, third and fourth seats are each adjustable under the influence of the shape of the object via two mutually dependently coupled rotation mountings. The device according to the invention has the advantage that the magnitude of the load is distributed more uniformly. In the known device it may occur that the seats are unequally loaded, and in an extreme case it may even be the case that at least one of the seats is even not loaded because the shape of the object does not extend to the seat and is situated a distance therefrom. The first and the second carrier element can be forced into a determined position under the influence of the shape of the object, wherein the device according to the invention is adaptive and able to position the seats such that the position thereof is adjusted to the shape of the object.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In a favourable embodiment the first rotation mounting comprises first elements which are fixedly connected to the support mounting and comprises second elements which are fixedly connected to the first carrier element, and the first elements are disposed rotatably relative to the second elements for a rotation of the first carrier element relative to the support mounting about an axis extending substantially in the longitudinal direction of the device. It hereby becomes possible for the device arranged on a frame to be adjustable for the purpose of adjusting the position of the seats relative to the shape of the object. When a cross-section of the object, which cross-section<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> is directed transversely of the longitudinal direction of the object, has a first parabolic form, the device can lie on either side of the object with the seats lying against the first parabolic hull, wherein the load on the device is distributed over the seats in the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In a further favourable embodiment the first rotation mounting comprises a further first rotation mounting for a rotation of the first carrier element relative to the support mounting about an axis extending substantially transversely of the longitudinal direction of both the device and the support mounting. It hereby becomes possible for the device to be adjustable to the shape of the hull in the longitudinal direction of the object along a second parabolic hull, whereby the seats can lie against the second parabolic hull, wherein the load on the device is distributed over the seats in longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In a general embodiment the first, second, third and fourth rotation mounting each provide a rotation about an axis, wherein the axes run substantially parallel to each other, and the axes are directed substantially transversely of the first axis. It hereby becomes possible for the device arranged on a frame to be further adjustable for the purpose of adjusting the position of the seats relative to the shape of the object. A line which runs on the hull in the longitudinal direction of the object and along which the device is adapted to engage on the object generally has a second parabolic form, which is generally weaker than the first parabolic form. When present on either side of the object, the device is adapted to lie against the second parabolic form of the hull, wherein the load on the device is uniformly distributed in longitudinal direction over the seats. The stress concentrations occurring when the object lies against the seats of the device according to the invention are hereby minimized so that the wall thickness, and so the weight of the object, is further minimized.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The invention will be elucidated hereinbelow on the basis of a preferred embodiment, with reference to the accompanying figures.
