Said known tyre building drum comprises a base spindle for the folding units, about which base spindle a hollow second spindle for the bead core clamping units is coaxially arranged. The base spindle can be coupled to the hollow second spindle by means of a connectable coupling, so that both spindles can be coupled to each other (for moving the entire drum half) and be detached from each other. Although with respect to other tyre building drums that use a pneumatic drive for the folding arm carrier bodies, said known tyre building drum provides a considerable improvement regarding the synchronous lifting of the two folding arm units due to use of in particular the base spindle, the known tyre building drum has some drawbacks. For instance the connectable coupling is not only a relatively expensive and complex additional part, in case of failure it is also difficult to repair this connectable coupling. Furthermore due to use of the two coaxial spindles in the drum shaft, the tyre building drum is relatively long and bulky.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In addition, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2009070020A"><text>WO 2009/070020</text></patcit> discloses two threaded spindles, which are arranged in parallel inside the drum main shaft. The folding arm units can be moved synchronously with respect to each other in axial direction of the tyre building drum by rotating a first one of the two spindles, and the two drum halves can be moved synchronously with respect to each other in axial direction by rotating the second one of the two spindles.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is among others an object of the invention to provide a tyre building drum for building an unvulcanised tyre that is maintenance friendlier and that can be designed in a more compact manner.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For that purpose according to the invention a tyre building drum as defined in claim 1, for building an unvulcanised tyre of the type mentioned in the preamble is characterised in that the tyre building drum comprises a main housing wherein the drum shaft projects from the main housing, wherein at least two pull/push rods are arranged in the drum shaft which pull/push rods are movable in axial direction and extend up into the main housing and in the main housing are coupled to a drive mechanism, wherein a first pull/push rod of the at least two pull/push rods is coupled to the folding arm unit of the first drum half, and a second pull/push rod of the at least two pull/push rods is coupled to the folding arm unit of the second drum half. The tyre building drum according to the invention is thus provided with an external actuator for a movement and turning up of the folding arms, which actuator is placed outside of the drum shaft. In that way, at least for these actions, it will no longer be necessary to place spindles in the hollow drum shaft, as a result of which the tyre building drum can be designed in a maintenance friendlier and more compact way.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A further advantage of the use of pull/push rods is that in that way a low play or even a play-free transmission from the drive mechanism to the folding arm units of the drum halves can be realised.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">All other driven movements of the drum halves and/or parts thereof, for instance shoulder supports or bead clamping mechanisms, can on the one hand be driven by means of known actuators, such as one or more spindles or one or more pneumatically driven cylinders. On the other hand in one embodiment of the building drum according to the invention, one or more of these drives of the drum halves and/or parts thereof can also be driven by means of pull/push rods that are placed in the drum shaft. In an advantageous embodiment the at least two pull/push rods further comprise a third pull/push rod that is coupled to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the first drum half, and a fourth pull/push rod that is coupled to the second drum half.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In one embodiment the at least two pull/push rods are placed concentrically in the drum shaft. The external drive mechanism is coupled to the drum halves and/or their folding arm units via the at least two tubular pull/push rods that are telescopically retractable in a concentric way, and are preferably placed substantially in the centre line of the drum shaft.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the manufacturing of an unvulcanised tyre using rubber tyre components, it is common to let the drum shaft with the building drum halves rotate. In one embodiment the main housing comprises a bearing device, wherein with a first outer end the drum shaft is rotatably placed in the bearing device. In one embodiment the pull/push rods are substantially rotation-fixedly placed in the drum shaft. In that way the pull/push rods will rotate along with the drum shaft, as a result of which friction between the pull/push rods and the drum shaft is considerably reduced.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In order to couple the rotatable pull/push rods with a drive mechanism in the main housing, the at least two pull/push rods in one embodiment extend beyond the first outer end of the drum shaft and are rotatably coupled to the drive mechanism. The rotatable coupling ensures that the pull/push rods that are rotatable around the centre line of the drum shaft, can be coupled to a substantially stationary and/or fixed drive mechanism in the main housing.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In one embodiment the main housing comprises a drum shaft driving motor which by means of a transmission is coupled to the drum shaft, wherein the transmission is placed at a side of the bearing device that extends away from the drive mechanism. In one embodiment the transmission is placed outside of the main housing. Examples of such transmissions are a belt transmission, a gear wheel transmission, a quill drive motor, etc. The placement of the transmission according to this embodiment makes it easy to keep the transmission in good repair.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In one embodiment the transmission comprises a belt transmission. In that case the transmission from the motor to the drum shaft is ensured by a drive belt, such as a toothed belt. The drive belt can easily be removed from the drum shaft driving motor, be passed over the drum shaft, and be discharged at an outer end of the drum shaft that faces away from the bearing device. In a comparable manner a new drive belt can be supplied via the outer end of the drum shaft that faces away from the bearing device, be passed to the main housing along the drum shaft, and be placed over the drum shaft and the drum shaft driving motor.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In one embodiment the drive mechanism is provided with a separate drive for each pull/push rod of the at least two pull/push rods. In one embodiment the separate drives each preferably comprise a linear motor or a spindle drive. In that way all pull/push rods can be individually driven.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In an alternative embodiment the drive mechanism comprises a first spindle, wherein the first spindle comprises thread which on either side of the middle of the drive mechanism has an equally large pitch but of an opposite direction, wherein on the first spindle on either side of the middle of the drive mechanism a first flight nut and a second flight nut are arranged, wherein the first and second flight nut are coupled to the first pull/push rod and the second pull/push rod, respectively. In this way a swivelling of the folding arms of both first and second drum halves is driven via the first and second pull/push rod, respectively, that are both coupled to the first spindle. In that way an improvement regarding the synchronous lifting of the folding arms is achieved.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In one embodiment the first pull/push rod is coupled to the first flight nut in a substantially axially adjustable manner. In that way the position of the folding arms of the first drum half is adjustable, particularly with respect to the position of the folding arms of the second drum half. The second pull/push rod can be fixedly connected to the second flight nut.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In a further embodiment the drive mechanism comprises a second spindle, wherein the second spindle comprises thread which on either side of the middle of the drive mechanism has an equally large pitch but<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> of an opposite direction, wherein on the second spindle on either side of the middle of the drive mechanism a third flight nut and a fourth flight nut are arranged, wherein the third and fourth flight nut are coupled to the third pull/push rod and the fourth pull/push rod, respectively. In this way a shifting of both first and second drum halves along the drum shaft is driven via the third and fourth pull/push rod, respectively, that are both coupled to the second spindle. In that way an improvement regarding the synchronous shifting of the drum halves is achieved.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In a further embodiment the third pull/push rod is coupled to the third flight nut in a substantially axially adjustable manner. In that way the position of the first drum half is adjustable, particularly with respect to the position of the second drum half. The fourth pull/push rod can be fixedly connected to the fourth flight nut.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In one embodiment the first spindle and the second spindle are each individually drivable. It is noted that for shifting the drum halves without turning up the folding arms, on the one hand the first and third pull/push rod are substantially jointly driven and on the other hand the second and fourth pull/push rod are substantially jointly driven. This can be achieved by driving the first and second spindle jointly. For turning up the folding arms without shifting the drum halves, on the one hand the first pull/push rod is moved with respect to the third pull/push rod and on the other hand the second pull/push rod is moved with respect to the fourth pull/push rod. This can be achieved by driving just the second spindle.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In an advantageous embodiment of a tyre building drum according to the invention each spindle is driven by its own servomotor. In particular two servomotors can be accurately synchronously driven for shifting the drum halves without turning up the folding arms. In this way also the first spindle can be accurately moved with respect to the second spindle for driving the folding arms. In this way a highly accurately functioning tyre building drum can be realised.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In a further advantageous embodiment of a tyre building drum according to the invention the spindles are driven by means of a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> hydraulic drive. Up until now it was not common to provide tyre building drums with a hydraulic drive because the fluids used for the hydraulic drive are not compatible with unvulcanised rubber. However, as the tyre building drum according to the invention uses a drive placed outside of the drum shaft, particularly placed in the main housing, use can be made here of a hydraulic drive.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In one embodiment the first spindle and the second spindle are placed substantially on either side of a centre line of the drum shaft. In that way the drive mechanism can be designed substantially compact, wherein the spindles and the pull/push rods placed in between them are situated substantially in one plane.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In one embodiment the drum shaft is provided with a first drum shaft slot for accommodating a first connecting part for connecting the first pull/push rod to the folding arm unit of the first drum half.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In one embodiment the drum shaft is provided with a second drum shaft slot for accommodating a second connecting part for connecting the second pull/push rod to the folding arm unit of the second drum half.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In a further embodiment the first drum shaft slot is adapted for accommodating a third connecting part for connecting the third pull/push rod to the first drum half.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In a further embodiment the second drum shaft slot is adapted for accommodating a fourth connecting part for connecting the fourth pull/push rod to the second drum half.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to a second aspect the invention provides a tyre building drum for building an unvulcanised tyre using rubber tyre components, wherein the tyre building drum comprises a main housing having a drum shaft extending from the main housing and two first and second drum halves arranged at least almost substantially symmetrical with respect to the centre of the tyre building drum and around the drum shaft, which drum halves can be moved in axial direction along the drum shaft, wherein each drum half comprises a folding arm unit having<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> folding arms, that are connected to the drum half in question in a swivelling manner, wherein the folding arm unit is movable in axial direction along the drum shaft, wherein the main housing comprises a bearing device and wherein with a first outer end the drum shaft is rotatably placed in the bearing device, wherein the main housing comprises a drum shaft driving motor which by means of a belt transmission is coupled to the drum shaft, wherein the belt transmission is placed near a side of the bearing device that faces a second outer end extending away from the first outer end. In one embodiment the belt transmission is placed outside of the main housing. The drive belt can then easily be removed from the drum shaft driving motor as described before, as a result of which building up the tyre building drum according to the invention and maintenance is made easier.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In one embodiment of the tyre building drums described above, the drum shaft comprises a first and a second drum shaft portion, wherein the first drum shaft portion comprises the first outer end that is rotatably placed in the bearing device, wherein a second outer end of the first drum shaft portion that extends away from the first outer end comprises a coupling member for substantially axially and detachably coupling the first drum shaft portion to the second drum shaft portion. In one embodiment the coupling member comprises a screwed joint or a flanged joint. In that way the main housing including the first drum shaft portion can be transported to clients as a unity, which makes transportation of the tyre building drum to the client easier.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">According to a further aspect the invention provides a main housing with drive mechanism suitable and intended for a tyre building drum as described above.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">According to a further aspect the invention provides as defined in claim 14, for a use of a tyre building drum as described above for building an unvulcanised tyre using rubber tyre components, wherein during building the tyre a turning up of the folding arms of the two drum halves is driven by shifting at least the first and second pull/push rod, wherein the shifting of the first and second pull/push rod is driven by a drive mechanism placed in the main housing.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In one embodiment during building the tyre a shifting of the two drum halves is driven by shifting at least the third and fourth pull/push rod, wherein the shifting of the third and fourth pull/push rod is driven by a drive mechanism placed in the main housing.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In one embodiment for shifting the drum halves without turning up the folding arms, on the one hand the first and third pull/push rod are substantially jointly driven and on the other hand the second and fourth pull/push rod are substantially jointly driven.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In one embodiment for turning up the folding arms on the one hand the first pull/push rod is shifted with respect to the third pull/push rod and on the other hand the second pull/push rod is shifted with respect to the fourth pull/push rod.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The aspects and measures described in this description and the claims of the application and/or shown in the drawings of this application may where possible also be used individually.</p><heading id="h0003">SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0035" num="0035">The invention will be elucidated on the basis of a number of exemplary embodiments shown in the attached drawings, in which:

Building an unvulcanised tyre with rubber tyre components takes place on a first drum half 2 and a second drum half 3, that have been arranged at least almost substantially symmetrical with respect to the centre of the tyre building drum and around the drum shaft 1. The first and second drum halves 2, 3 can be moved in axial direction along the drum shaft 1.
