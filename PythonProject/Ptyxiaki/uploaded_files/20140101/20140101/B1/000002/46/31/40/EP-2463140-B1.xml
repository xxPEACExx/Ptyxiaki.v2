load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a vehicle seat which is provided with a seat height adjustment mechanism or what is generally known as "seat lifter mechanism". In particular, the invention is directed to an improvement of link elements included in such seat lifter mechanism, which is designed to protect the link elements in the case of a rear-end collision.</p><heading id="h0002">2. Description of Prior Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Typically, the seat lifter mechanism includes a pair of front links and a pair of rear links, which such an arrangement that the front links are pivotally connected between the forward underside of a vehicle seat and a floor of vehicle, whereas the rear links are pivotally connected between the rearward underside of the seat and the floor. Vertical synchronized rotation of those four links allows the seat to be adjustably raised and lowered to a desired level or height by means of the associated interlocking mechanisms, parts and control lever, and so forth.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2009286237A"><text>JP 2009-286237 A1</text></patcit> shows the above-stated seat lifter mechanism including two front links and two rear links.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">According thereto, the two front links are pivotally connected between a forwardly facing portion of seat cushion frame of a vehicle seat and a forwardly facing portion of upper rail of seat slide rail fixed on a floor of vehicle, wherein the upper rail is slidably engaged with a lower rail fixed on the floor. On the other hand, the two rear links are pivotally connected between a rearwardly facing portion of the seat cushion frame and a rearwardly facing portion of the upper rail. A connecting rod is horizontally extended and connected between the two rear links to allow synchronized rotation of both two rear links relative to the axis of the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> connecting rod in vertical direction. One of the two rear links is formed with a sector gear portion therein. Such sector gear portion is in meshed engagement with a pinion rotatably supported in the seat cushion frame, the pinion being connected to a drive element or a manual operation lever having a brake device incorporated therein. By raising the manual operation lever, the pinion is rotated in normal direction, thereby causing rotation of the sector gear portion, so that both two rear links are rotated upwardly, which in turn causes upward displacement of the seat cushion frame or seat. Reversely, lowering of the manual operation lever causes reverse rotation of the pinion, thus resulting in downward rotation of both two rear links to cause downward displacement of the seat.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the foregoing conventional seat, as stated above, only one rear link (hereinafter, a first rear link) is provided with the sector gear portion and pivotally connected, via the pinion and brake device, between the seat and floor. But, the other rear link (hereinafter, a second rear link) is not formed as such, but simply pivotally connected between seat and floor. Due to that structure, in the case where a rear-end collision occurs, with a backward great excessive load being applied from a seat occupant under inertia to the seat, the excessive backward load is intensively exerted upon the second rear link, as a result of which, that second rear link is deformed and therefore one lateral side of the seat where the second rear link exists is lowered or inclined downwardly relative to the other lateral side of seat where the first rear link exists. This is because, in the first rear link, the excessive great load is dispersed in the sector gear portion and pinion and thus reduced to avoid deformation of the link, whereas the load is straightly exerted upon the second rear link without being dispersed and reduced, hence deforming the second rear link only. Consequently, in that case, the seating posture of seat occupant becomes unstable, and moreover, both first and second rear links are not smoothly moved in synchronized manner via the connected rod connected therebetween.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A seat according to the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="FR2806675A"><text>FR-A-2806675</text></patcit>.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">In view of the above-stated drawbacks, it is a primary purpose of the present invention to provide an improved vehicle seat of the type including link elements movable for raising and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> lowering the seat, which prevents the above-described lowering of the seat or the inclination of one side of the seat in the case of rear-end collision</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In order to achieve such purpose, in accordance with the present invention, a seat to be mounted in a vehicle is basically comprised of:

Such gear portion (13a) naturally assumes an arcuate shape extending along a circle, the center of which is at the central axis of connecting rod (8).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Likewise, formed in the forwardly facing end region of the left-side rear link's upper portion (6A-1) is an arcuate hole (12) which also basically extends in a direction vertically of the rear link (6A) as well as vertically of the seat cushion frame (CF). The arcuate hole (12) is situated at a point forward of the connecting rod (8) and extends along the circumference of a circle having its center at the central axis of that connecting rod (8). Designation (12a) denotes an inwardly-toothed arcuate gear portion defined integrally in and along the forwardly facing arcuate edge of the arcuate hole (12). Such gear portion (13a) naturally assumes an arcuate shape extending along a circle, the center of which is at the central axis of connecting rod (8). Note that those arcuate hole (12) and gear portion (12a) are respectively identical in shape and size to the previously stated arcuate hole (13) and gear portion (13a) associated with the right-side rear link (6B).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">It is also noted that the sector gear portion (6a) formed in the left-side rear link (6A) is situated forwardly of the afore-said arcuate hole (12), with the arcuate periphery of the sector gear portion (5a) extending along the circumference of a circle having its center at the central axis of the connecting rod (8). It is still further noted that the left- and right-side arcuate holes (12) and (13) are arranged so as to be in correspondence with each other, so that, during vertical synchronized displacement of both two rear links (6A) (6B), those two holes (12) (13) are synchronously displaced, while being maintained in alignment with each other.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Designation (7) denotes a drive pinion gear which is in meshed engagement with the sector gear portion (6a) stated previously. The drive pinion gear (7) has a support shaft (not designated) fixed in the center thereof. Although not clearly shown, one end of such support shaft is rotatably supported in the left-side lateral frame member (3A) and connected integrally with a drive shaft of a drive source (M), a part of seat lifter mechanism, whereas the other end of the support shaft is rotatably supported by a bracket (11) having a base end portion fixed by a pin (11B) to the left-side lateral frame member (3A). Thus, the drive<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> pinion gear (7) is rotatably disposed between the lateral frame member (3A) and the bracket (11). In this respect, the drive source (M) may be an electric motor with reduction gear in the case of the seat lifter mechanism used being of a powered type, or alternatively be a manual handle having a brake device provided therewith in the case of the seat lifter mechanism used being of a manually operated type.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In accordance with the present invention, a reinforcing transmission shaft (10) is provided for the purpose of protecting the right-side rear links (6B) against deformation and insuring synchronized movement of both two rear links (6A) and (6B). Specifically, as seen from <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 3 and 4</figref>, the reinforcing transmission shaft (10) has: a first pinion (14) fixed on and about the left-side end portion thereof; and a second pinion (15) fixed on and about the right-side end portion thereof. Briefly stated, the reinforcing transmission shaft (10) is rotatably journalled between the left- and right-side lateral frame members (3A) (3B) in a parallel relation with the connecting shaft (8), with the two end portions of that shaft (10) passing through the respective two arcuate holes (12) (13) respectively of the left- and right-side rear links (6A) (6B). In this regard, the first pinion (14) is meshed with the inwardly toothed gear portion (12a) formed in the arcuate hole (12), while the second pinion (15) is meshed with the inwardly toothed gear portion (13a) formed in the arcuate hole (13). As shown, it is important that the reinforcing transmission shaft (10) is disposed forwardly of the connecting rod (8) for the purpose of allowing a load (F) to be first applied to that reinforcing transmission shaft (10) and dispersed therethrough to the seat cushion frame, as will be described later.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Referring particularly to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref> in conjunction with <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, the left-side end portion of the reinforcing transmission shaft (10) is also rotatably received in a bearing hole (11A) formed in the bracket (11), Hence, the bracket (11) is supported by the following two points: the pin (11B) and the reinforcing transmission shaft (10), which advantageously disperses a part of load (F) applied to the drive pinion (7), as will be described later.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Further, as best seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref>, one distal end region of the reinforcing transmission shaft (10) is rotataly received in a bearing hole (3Ah) formed in the left-side lateral frame member (3A) and retained by a securing ring (10A) against removal therefrom. The other<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> distal end region of reinforcing transmission shaft (10) is likewise rotatably received in another bearing hoe (3Bh) formed in the right-side lateral frame member (3B) and retained by a securing ring (10A) against removal therefrom.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The reinforcing transmission shaft (10) has a pair of left- and righ-side detent rings (16) and (17) fixed thereon, which are adapted for preventing the shaft (10) against lateral dislocation in a direction along the longitudinal axis thereof. As depicted in both <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 3 and 4</figref>, the left-side detent ring (16) is fixed on and about the left-side end portion of the shaft (10) so as to slightly contact the surface of the bracket (11), whereas the right-side detent ring (17) is fixed on and about the right-side end portion of the shaft (10) so as to slightly contact the inward wall of the right-side rear link (6B). With such arrangement, the reinforcing transmission shaft (10) is positively prevented against dislocation in any of left and right directions along the longitudinal axis thereof.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As constructed above, looking at <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, when a seat occupant operates the drive sources (M) to raise the seat (S) for instance, the drive pinion (7) is rotated clockwise, the sector gear portion (6a) meshed with that drive pinion (7) is rotated anticlockwise relative to the connecting shaft (8), which in turn causes the left-side rear link (6A) per se to rotate forwardly and upwardly relative to the lower pivot point (P1). At this moment, both of the following actions are simultaneously effected:
<ol><li>(i) the afore-said forward and upward rotation of left-side rear link (6A) is simultaneously transmitted via the connecting rod (8) to the right-side rear link (6B), thereby causing synchronized forward and upward rotation of the two rear links (6A) and (6B) relative to the receptive two lower pivot points (P1) and (P2); and</li><li>(ii) simultaneous therewith, the inwardly toothed gear portion (12a) formed in the left-side rear link (6A) is rotatively displaced anticlockwise relative to the connecting shaft (8), thereby causing simultaneous anticlockwise rotation of the first pinion (14) meshed with that gear portion (12a). With the anticlockwise rotation of first pinion (14), the reinforcing transmission shaft (10) is simultaneously rotated in the likewise anticlockwise direction, so that the anticlockwise rotation of first pinion (14) is transmitted via the reinforcing transmission shaft (10) to the second pinion (15) which is therefore simultaneously rotated<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> anticlockwise, whereupon the inwardly toothed gear portion (13a) meshed with that second pinion (15) is rotatively displaced anticlockwise relative to the connecting rod (8), which in turn causes the right-side rear link (6B) per se to rotate forwardly and upwardly relative to the lower pivot point (P2) in synchronism with the lift-side rear link (6A) being rotated in the likewise forward and upward directions relative to the lower pivot point (P1).</li></ol></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Of course, both two front links (5A) (5B) are also simultaneously rotated forwardly and upwardly in synchronism with the above-described two rear links (6A) (6B), since those four links assume a parallel linkage structure as stated previously.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Accordingly, with the foregoing movement of all the links (5A, 5B, 6A and 6B), the seat (S) is displaced upwardly away from the slide rail device (SL) or floor (FL). When the seat occupant stops operation of the drive source (M), all the four links (5A, 5B, 6A, and 6B) are stopped and positioned at a given angle of inclination relative to the seat slide devices (SL) or floor (FL), so that the seat (S) is set to a desired level. At this time, those four links are retained against movement by a brake effect which may be given by a reduction gear of electric motor in the case of the electric motor being employed as the drive source (M), or by a brake unit provided in a manual handle in the case of the manual handle being employed as the drive source (M). If it is desired to lower the seat (S), in brief, the drive source (M) may be operated reversely to cause anticlockwise rotation of the drive pinion (7) for clockwise rotative displacement of the sector gear portion (6a) and also for clockwise synchronized rotative displacement of the two inwardly toothed gear portions (12a) (13a) via the reinforcing transmission shaft (10), thereby causing backward and downward movement of all the four links (5A, 5B, 6A and 6B), so that the seat (S) may be adjustingly lowered to a desired level.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">It is noted that the entire length of both two arcuate holes (12) (13) defines the range and limit of vertical displacement of both two rear links (6A) (6B) and thus serves as a stopper for preventing the two rear links (6A) (6B) against excessive vertical displacement. Namely, for example, suppose that the drive source (M) is operated to cause upward displacement of the links (6A) (6B) to raise the seat (S). In that instance, if a seat occupant continues on operating the drive source (M), the two arcuate holes (12) (13) are<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> rotatively displaced downwardly to the extent that the two upper edges respectively of the two arcuate holes (12) (13) are brought to contact with the respective two pinions (14) (15), as a result of which, the operation of the drive source (M) is forcibly blocked, whereby the rear links (6A) (6B) are forcibly prevented against further upward displacement. Reversely, if the seat occupant continues operation of the drive source (M) to cause downward displacement of the links (6A) (6B) to lower the seat (S), the two lower edges respective of the two arcuate holes (12) (13) come to contact with the respective two pinions (14) (15), thereby forcibly blocking the operation of drive source (M) and thus preventing further downward displacement of the rear links (6A) (6B).</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">By virtue of the above-described arrangement and structure, it is to be appreciated that, when a rear-end collision occurs, with an excess great load (F) (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) being applied backwardly and downwardly form a seat occupant (not shown) under inertia to the seat cushion frame (CF), most of the load (F) is intensively exerted upon the reinforcing transmission shaft (10) prior to being applied to the connecting rod (8) and both two rear links (6A) (6B). Thus, the load (F) is transmitted through that reinforcing transmission shaft (10) equally to each of the left- and right-side lateral frame members (3A) (3B) and dispersed therein, without being directly applied to the two rear links (6A) (6B). With such arrangement, the excessive great load (F) is not directly applied to the right-side rear link (6B) which is not robust structurally in comparison with the left-side rear link (6A), thereby insuring to protect the relatively weak rear link (6B) against deformation, and therefore solving such conventional problems as undesired lowering of the seat or inclination of one lateral side of the seat which are caused by deformation of one relatively brittle rear link in the case of rear-end collision.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Also, it is to be appreciated that, in addition to being synchronously displaceable via the connecting rod (8), both two rear links (6A) (6B) are assisted by the combination of pinions (14 and 15) and inwardly toothed gear portions (12a and 13b) as well as the reinforcing transmission shaft (10) to insure synchronized vertical displacement of the two rear links (6A and 6B). Moreover, the meshed engagement of two pinions (14 and 15) with the respective two gear portions (12a and 13a) in effect establishes a great robust<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> structure in cooperation with the reinforcing transmission shaft (10), which provides a stable passage through which the load (F) is to be smoothly and equally transmitted to and dispersed in each of the left- and right-side lateral frame members (3A) and (3B). Consequently, the two rear links (6A and 6B) are not damaged by the excessive great load (F) in the case of rear-end collision, and that, even if a slight deformation and distortion is caused in and/or between the seat cushion frame (CF) and connecting rod (8) due to the excessive great load (F), the meshed engagement of the two pinions (14 and 15) with the respective two gear portions (12a and 13b) is still maintained, thus insuring to allow both two rear links (6A and 6B) bo be moved together in a synchronized manner, without being influenced by the rear-end collision.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Additionally, by virtue of such meshed engagement of pinions (14 and 15) with the respective gear portions (12a and 13a) and the reinforcing transmission shaft (10), the brake effect stated previously, which is normally given by the drive source (M), such as a reduction gear of electric motor used as the drive source or a brake unit provided in a manual handle used as the drive source, is also transmitted through the pinions (14 and 15), gear portions (12a and 13a) and reinforcing transmission shaft (10) in a direction from the left-side rear link (6A) to the right-side rear link (6B). Hence, the brake effect is equally given to both of the two rear links (6A and 6B), which effectively insures stable automatic stoppage of those two particular rear links (5A and 6B) at the same time, every time a seat occupant stops operation of the drive source (M). Accordingly, in accordance with the present invention, the right-side rear link (6B), which is not so robust relative to the left-side rear link (6A), is protected against deformation in the case of rear-end collision, while insuring a smooth synchronized displacement of both two rear links (6A and 6B). It is therefore materially possible to prevent lowering of the seat or inclination of one side of the seat which is caused by the rear-end collision as found in the conventional vehicle seats.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56978609" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Ein Sitz (S) zum Einbau in ein Fahrzeug, umfassend:
