notebook computers, netbook computers, cell phones, smartphones, mobile internet devices, and so on, utilize radio modules to communicate over wireless networks. Often, such devices may include two radio modules, for example a wireless local area network (WLAN) radio module operating in compliance with an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 standard, and a personal area network (PAN) radio module operating in compliance with a Bluetooth protocol. Wireless local area networks are certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance, and are typically referred to as Wi-Fi networks. Alternatively, a wireless wide area network (WWAN) such as a Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) compliant network or a Third Generation (3G) compliant cellular network may be used in combination with a Bluetooth (BT) network. Users of these devices typically will operate both radios simultaneously, for example by streaming music to the device via the WLAN network and listening to the streamed music with Bluetooth connected headphones.</p><heading id="h0002">Coexistence of wireless radios</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">According to the prior art is shown in document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20080247445A1"><text>US 2008/024 7445 A1</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Due to channel adjacency, simultaneous operation of WLAN and Bluetooth radio modules may result in collisions on the transmission medium, thereby causing interference and/or packet loss. One of the common approaches to mitigate such issues is by using a media access control (MAC) coordination interface, often referred to as "coexistence interface," that attempts to coordinate the operation of the two radios in a manner that minimizes collisions by partitioning the medium usage between radios. Current coexistence interfaces are typically designed as point-to-point interfaces to coordinate between two distinct radio technologies. Such designs may differ by the semantics of the signals in the interface, and/or by the behavior of the MAC layer or higher network layer. For example, a Bluetooth radio should behave differently when working with different types of radios, for example using different parameters for voice calls depending on the technology with which it cooperates.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Increasingly, mobile devices are incorporating three or more radios into a single device which should be designed to coexist in a similar manner as a two radio device. However, as multiple radios are combined into single modules, the pin count for a multiple radio interface may be greater than desired for a practical module. Typically, a two wire<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> interface may be utilized to implement a coexistence interface between two unique radio modules. Adding a third radio module would then involve a four wire interface, thereby leading to a higher pin count, especially as additional radio modules are added. Furthermore, routing complexity may increase with additional wires used in the coexistence interface. When trying to reduce the number of pins, it may become a challenge to have different semantics on the wires between the two or more interfaces. As a result, the wires cannot be easily combined using simple logic gates or the like. An additional challenge is controlling the direction of the signals. While a Wi-Fi-BT coexistence interface may have two wires with two signals going in opposite directions, a WiMAX-BT coexistence interface may have two wires going from the WiMAX module to the BT module with two signals going in the same direction. This means if a Wi-Fi and WiMAX combination module were provided, to share a wire that functions in different directions, the correct timing between the Wi-Fi and WiMAX combination module and the BT module would have to be accommodated to ensure that the wire is never being driven at both ends simultaneously which might cause electrical malfunctions and/or render a module non-functional.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention refers to a method according to claim 1 and to an apparatus according to claim 5.</p><heading id="h0004">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Claimed subject matter is particularly pointed out and distinctly claimed in the concluding portion of the specification.

In particular embodiments, connected may be used to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical and/or electrical contact with each other. Coupled may mean that two or more elements are in direct physical and/or electrical contact. However, coupled may also mean that two or more elements may not be in direct contact with each other, but yet may still cooperate and/or interact with each other.

Finally, the terms "on," "overlying," and "over" may be used in the following description and claims. "On," "overlying," and "over" may be used to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical contact with each other. However, "over" may also mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other.

In the following description and/or claims, the terms "comprise" and "include," along with their derivatives, may be used and are intended as synonyms for each other.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a block diagram of an electronic device having multiple radios including a coexistence controller in accordance with one or more embodiments will be discussed. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, electronic device 100 may comprise any electronic device utilizing multiple radios. For example, electronic device 100 may comprise a personal computer, notebook computer, netbook computer, cell phone, smartphone, and/or a mobile internet device, or the like, although the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect. In one particular embodiment as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, electronic device 100 may include a combination radio module 110 having two or more radio modules such as a WiMAX radio module 112 and a Wi-Fi radio module 114 disposed in a single module or single chip or chipset. Furthermore, electronic device 100 may comprise an additional radio module such as Bluetooth radio module 116. It should be noted that the particular communication standards for the radio modules of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> discussed herein are merely for purposes of example, and other types of radio modules compliant with other communication standards may be utilized without providing substantial change to the claimed subject matter or without limiting the scope thereof. In the example embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, Bluetooth module 116 may be disposed on a separate card, separate module, and/or separate chip or chipset in electronic device 100 from the card or device on which combination radio module 110 is disposed, and the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one or more embodiments, combination radio module 110 and Bluetooth radio module 116 may operate as follows. Typically, either one or the other of WiMAX radio module 112 and Wi-Fi radio module 114 may operate at a given time such that one module may be active and the other module may be shut off and/or in a standby state. The active radio module coordinates its operation with Bluetooth radio module 116 which may operate at the same time as the active one of WiMAX radio module 112 and Wi-Fi radio module 114. However, in some embodiments, all three radio modules may operate simultaneously or nearly simultaneously such that all three radio modules may be active at a given time, although the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect. Since WiMAX radio module 112 and Wi-Fi radio module 114 may be disposed together on a single combination radio module 110, coordination between the WiMAX radio module 112 and the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Wi-Fi radio module 114 may be handled internally within the combination radio module 110. However, regardless of which of the radio modules of the combination radio module 110 is active, coordination is made between combination radio module 110 and Bluetooth radio module 116 via external wires and pins on the respective modules. Typically, coordination allows simultaneous operation of at least one of the modules of combination radio module 110 and Bluetooth radio module 116, and further may involve four wires and four respective pins on each module. In such an arrangement, coordination between WiMAX radio module 112 and Bluetooth radio module 116 may involves a first set of two wires and two pins, and coordination between Wi-Fi radio module 114 and Bluetooth radio module may involve another set of two wires and two pins. However, as shown in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the total number of wires and/or pins utilized for coordinating operation between combination radio module 110 and Bluetooth radio module 116 may be reduced by keeping the signal direction static regardless of whether the Wi-Fi radio module 114 or the WiMAX radio module 112 is driving the interface at any given moment. This constraint allows a reduction of wire count from a total of four wires for the two independent interfaces to three wires in the combined interface.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a coexistence controller 118 in combination radio module 110 may be utilized to control the coordination between WiMAX radio module 112 and Bluetooth radio module 116, and/or between Wi-Fi radio module 114 and Bluetooth radio module 116. Coordination may be accomplished by receiving a channel clock (CH_CLK) signal and/or a Bluetooth priority (BT_PRI) signal on line 120 from Bluetooth module 116. The channel clock signal allows Wi-Fi radio module 114 to synchronize with Bluetooth radio module 116, and the Bluetooth priority signal indicates that the Bluetooth radio module 116 is active and priority should be given to Bluetooth communications. Likewise, coexistence controller 118 of combination radio module 110 may provide a WiMAX active (WIMAX_ACT) signal and/or a channel data (CH_DATA) signal and/or a WLAN priority (WLAN_PRI) signal on line 122. The WiMAX active signal indicates that the WiMAX radio module 112 is active so priority should be given to WiMAX communications. The channel data signal is provided by the Wi-Fi radio module 114 to indicate which channel is being used for Wi-Fi communications. The WLAN priority signal is used to indicate that Wi-Fi radio module 114 is active so priority should be given to Wi-Fi communications. It should be noted that in such an arrangement, lines 120 and 122 are sufficient to handle coordination between Wi-Fi radio module 114 and Bluetooth radio<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> module 116. To further accommodate WiMAX radio module 112, coexistence controller 118 provides a frame sync (FRAME_SYNC) signal to Bluetooth radio module 124 on line 124. The frame sync signal provides a further indication that WiMAX activity is occurring so the Bluetooth radio module 116 knows when to stop and start its own communications to accommodate WiMAX communications. The combination of line 122 and line 124 is sufficient to accommodate coordination between WiMAX radio module 112 and Bluetooth radio module 116. Thus, the functionality of the WiMAX-Bluetooth coexistence scheme and functionality of the Wi-Fi-Bluetooth coexistence scheme may be provided and operate independently. It should be noted that in the arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, signal direction on line 120, line 122, and line 124 remains fixed throughout operation regardless of which radio module is active in combination radio module 110. That is, no switching of the signal direction is involved or required.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In one or more embodiments, Wi-Fi radio module 114 and WiMAX radio module 112 may not be associated, i.e., active, although the association state may switch dynamically between the two modules. The Bluetooth radio module 116 detects which radio is associated at a given time, and then switches its operation mode accordingly, including interpretation of the interface semantics. In one or more embodiments, this detection of the associated radio module may be achieved by Bluetooth radio module 116 by monitoring FRAME_SYNC activity on line 124. Upon detection of a certain activity pattern or characteristic, for example detection of a rising edge on the FRAME_SYNC signal, Bluetooth radio module 116 is capable of deducing that WiMAX radio module 112 is associated, in which case Bluetooth radio module 116 may switch to a WiMAX coexistence mode in response to the FRAME_SYNC signal characteristic. Such a deduction may be made since the FRAME_SYNC signal is utilized by WiMAX radio module 112 but not by Wi-Fi radio module 114. Likewise, detection of another pattern or characteristic in the FRAME_SYNC signal, for example long inactivity of the signal on line 124 may imply that WiMAX is unassociated, and as a result Bluetooth radio module 116 should switch to Wi-Fi coexistence mode in response to the FRAME_SYNC signal characteristic. Further details regarding the coordination of the radio modules by coexistence controller 118 and by Bluetooth radio module 116 are shown in and described with respect to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, below. An example WiMAX network on which WiMAX radio module 112 may communicate is shown in and described with respect to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, below. An example WLAN/Wi-Fi network on which<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> Wi-Fi radio module 114 may communicate is shown in and described with respect to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, below.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, a block diagram of a wireless wide area network capable of utilizing a coexistence interface for multiple radio modules using a reduced number of connections with one or more embodiments will be discussed. In one or more embodiments, WiMAX radio module 112 may communicate on network 200 by being tangibly embodied in one or more of the network elements of network 200. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, network 200 may be an internet protocol (IP) type network comprising an internet 210 type network or the like that is capable of supporting mobile wireless access and/or fixed wireless access to internet 210. In one or more embodiments, network 200 may be in compliance with a Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) standard or future generations of WiMAX, and in one particular embodiment may be in compliance with an Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers 802.16e standard (IEEE 802.16e). In one or more alternative embodiments network 100 may be in compliance with a Third Generation Partnership Project Long Term Evolution (3GPP LTE) or a 3GPP2 Air Interface Evolution (3GPP2 AIE) standard. In general, network 100 may comprise any type of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based wireless network, and the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in these respects. As an example of mobile wireless access, access service network (ASN) 212 is capable of coupling with base station (BS) 214 to provide wireless communication between subscriber station (SS) 216 and internet 210. Subscriber station 216 may comprise electronic device 100 as shown in and described with respect to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, above, for example via WiMAX radio module 112.

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, method 400 may be implemented by combination radio module 110 to coordinate with Bluetooth radio module 116. In some embodiments, WiMAX radio module 112 and Wi-Fi radio module 114 may be implemented on separate radio modules rather than being arranged in a single radio module 110, however the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect. Furthermore, although method 400 is not limited to the order and/or number of blocks as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, and may include more or fewer blocks in various other orders, and the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in these respects. In some embodiments, method 400 may be implemented by coexistence controller 118, although the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, a determination may be made at decision block 410 by coexistence controller 118 to determine whether WiMAX radio module 112 is active. If WiMAX radio module 112 is active, then the frame sync signal will be active at block 412 which will indicate to Bluetooth radio module 116 via line 124 that WiMAX radio module 112 is associated and active. Furthermore, the WiMAX active signal will signal WiMAX activity at block 414 to Bluetooth radio module 116 via line 122. Whenever WiMAX is associated, activity will be indicated on line 124 via the frame sync signal at least once every maximum idle period for the frame sync signal (FRAME_SYNC_MAX_IDLE time, measured in milliseconds) which is a configurable parameter. This will continue so long as WiMAX radio module 112 is active. If there is no activity in the frame sync signal for a time greater than the maximum idle period, coexistence controller 118 may determine that WiMAX radio module 112 is no longer associated and active.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the event WiMAX radio module 112 is not active, as determined at decision block 410, the frame sync signal will be idle at block 416. A determination may be made at decision block 418 if Wi-Fi radio module 114 is active. If not, coexistence controller will continue to monitor WiMAX radio module 112 and Wi-Fi radio module 114 to determine which one next becomes active. If Wi-Fi radio module 114 becomes active, Wi-Fi activity<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> may be signaled on line 122 at block 420 via a channel data signal and/or a WLAN priority signal depending on the particular Wi-Fi-Bluetooth coexistence scheme being utilized. It should be noted that line 122 may be alternately utilized to signal to Bluetooth radio module 116 activity of WiMAX radio module 112 and Wi-Fi radio module. As a result, line 122 may be shared by both radio modules in combination radio module 110, rather than having a separate line for each of the radio modules for their respective coexistence schemes. As a result, the pin count in combination radio module 110 may be reduced at least from four to three to accommodate the coexistence schemes of both radio modules. It should be further noted that the signal direction on line 122 from both radio modules remains the same regardless of which radio module is active, so that direction-switching arrangements or circuits are not required. If Wi-Fi radio module 114 is associated and active, activity of Bluetooth radio module 116 may be monitored on line 120 at block 422 to implement a Wi-Fi-Bluetooth coexistence scheme. Activity on line 120 will continue to be monitored and interpreted when Wi-Fi radio module 114 is associated, however WiMAX radio module 112 doesn't necessarily need to monitor activity on line 120. Coexistence controller 118 of combination radio module 110 may continue to operate accordingly until Wi-Fi is no longer active, and method 400 may continue based on which of the radio modules is associated and active.

In one or more embodiments, Bluetooth radio module 116 may be in a Wi-Fi coexistence mode at block 510, or alternatively may not be in either a Wi-Fi coexistence mode or a WiMAX coexistence mode, and may be waiting for the next radio module to become associated and active. In any event, Bluetooth radio module 116 monitors the frame sync signal on line 124 for an activity pattern. A determination is made at decision block 514 if activity is detected. For example, an activity pattern that may be detected may include a rising edge on the frame sync signal. In the event activity is detected in the frame sync signal on line 124, Bluetooth radio module 116 may switch to a WiMAX coexistence mode at block 516. While in a WiMAX coexistence mode, Bluetooth radio module 116 may receive and monitor signals on lines 122<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> and 124 received from WiMAX radio module 112 to coordinate operation between WiMAX radio module 112 and Bluetooth radio module 116 according to the WiMAX-Bluetooth coexistence scheme. Bluetooth radio module 116 may continue to monitor the frame sync signal at block 512 until activity is no longer detected, for example when the frame sync signal is inactive for a period longer than a maximum idle period. In the event activity of the frame sync signal is no longer detected, Bluetooth radio module 116 may switch to a Wi-Fi coexistence mode at block 510, and method 500 may continue accordingly. While in a Wi-Fi coexistence mode, Bluetooth radio module 116 may receive and monitor signals on line 122, and may provide its own signal on line 120 to Wi-Fi radio module 114 via coexistence controller 118.
