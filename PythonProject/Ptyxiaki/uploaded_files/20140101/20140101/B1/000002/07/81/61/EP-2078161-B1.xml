The wind turbine comprises a tower and a wind turbine nacelle positioned on top of the tower. A wind turbine rotor, comprising one or more wind turbine blades, is connected to the nacelle through a low speed shaft, which extends out of the nacelle front.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Controlling the temperature of electrical and mechanical components - particularly during operation of the components - has always been a problem and especially within the art of wind energy converters, this problem has been profound. Often the same wind energy converter type has to be able to operate in both extremely hot and extremely cold areas of the globe, which makes heavy demands on the wind energy converters system for controlling the temperature of especially wind turbine components such as gear, generator, power handling equipment, bearings and other.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Even though modern wind turbines often become more and more efficient in converting the rotation of the wind turbine rotor to power, the process will always result in some of the energy being converted to heat in some of the wind turbine components.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">This excess heat must be removed from the components to protect the components and for them to function properly. Traditionally this has been done by means of one<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> or more cooling systems, which by means of a cooling medium can transport the heat from the components to a radiator, which can give off the heat to the air outside the wind turbine and/or by creating an air flow of air from the outside of the wind turbine which passes the components.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">But the quality of the outside air is difficult to control both in temperature, humidity, purity and other. Furthermore, modern wind turbines get bigger and bigger in power output and thereby often also in production of excess heat and this matched with the fact that air is a relatively poor conductor of heat, make these types of cooling systems very large, expensive and heavy.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Even further, the fact that the temperature of the air outside the wind turbine varies a lot from site to site, from day to night and from season to season - in extreme cases from -30° to +50° Celsius - will in some cases result in wind energy converters with an over-dimensioned and expensive cooling system. This problem could of course be overcome by adapting the temperature control system of the wind energy converter to the specific erection site, but this would be logistically difficult, expensive and prolong the time of delivery of the wind energy converters.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Another way of controlling the temperature of wind turbine components is disclosed in American patent No <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6676122B1"><text>US 6,676,122 B1</text></patcit>, where the cooling system cools the components in the nacelle and the tower by circulating air inside the tower and the nacelle, making it give off heat through the surface of the tower and nacelle. But such a system is both complex and difficult to implement and since wind energy converters usually produce the majority of the power during the day (because of more wind during the day), it usually also needs the most cooling during the day, where the sun and the ambient temperature will heat up the surface of the wind turbine. Such a system will therefore have to have a very large cooling capacity to be able to work properly, making the system itself very large and expensive.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Regarding offshore wind energy converters it is known to use seawater to cool different components of the wind turbine, but if the cooling system is open there are serious problems regarding ice, clogging, corrosion and other, which are difficult and expensive to solved, and if the system is closed e.g. by circulating a cooling medium through a hose placed in the seawater there is ice, storm, overgrowing and other to be solved. The problems of both these systems being complicated and expensive to overcome and no matter how it is done, this technique is only feasible in relation to offshore wind energy converters.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Another way of controlling the temperature in a wind turbine is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="DE102004061391A1"><text>DE 10 2004 061 391 A1</text></patcit> where air is being drawn through cable canals in the wind turbine foundation to lower the temperature of the air before it is used to cool equipment in the tower of a wind turbine. But this cooling system is not very efficient and is contains several of the previously mentioned drawbacks such as difficulties in controlling the quality and other.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is therefore an object of the invention to provide for a wind energy converter without the above mentioned disadvantages.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Especially it is an object of the invention to provide for an advantageous and cost-efficient technique for controlling the temperature of one or more areas of a wind energy converter, particularly regarding where and how to give off excess heat and/or absorb needed heat.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>The invention</b></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">The invention provides for a wind energy converter comprising a wind turbine, a wind turbine foundation and temperature control means for controlling the temperature of one or more areas of the wind turbine. The temperature control means including means for exchanging heat. The wind energy converter is characterized in<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> that the means for exchanging heat is positioned in the ground outside the foundation.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The temperature of the ground surrounding the foundation will vary within a relatively little range and at a certain depth the temperature is substantially constant all over the globe. It is therefore advantageous to integrate the means for exchanging heat in the ground outside the foundation, in that this environment is more predictable and constant.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In an aspect of the invention, said temperature control means comprising a cooling fluid for transporting heat to or from said one or more areas of said wind turbine, one or more pumps for creating a flow of said cooling fluid and one or more heat sinks for giving off heat from or supplying heat to said cooling fluid.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">By creating a flow of cooling fluids to or form the areas of the wind turbine that needs heating or cooling is an efficient way of transporting heat in a temperature control system, particularly over large distances as in a wind energy converter.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">It should be emphasised that by the term "heat sink" is to be understood any kind of structure or device that absorbs or dissipates heat.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In an aspect of the invention, said means for exchanging heat is a heat sink of said temperature control means.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">By making the means for exchanging heat a heat sink of the temperature control means the part of the temperature control means placed in the ground surrounding the wind turbine foundation becomes a heat sink of the temperature control means.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">This is advantageous in that the ground surrounding the wind turbine foundation has an enormous heat capacity and in that it is a relatively good conductor of heat,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> making it very suitable as the location of a heat sink of the temperature control means of a wind energy converter, in that the ground outside the foundation presents a very controlled environment, making it possible to dimension the temperature control system very exactly and ensuring that the heat sinks capacity is maintained throughout the entire life of the wind energy converter.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In an aspect of the invention, said heat sink comprises means for dissipating the bulk of said areas excess heat to said ground outside said foundation and/or said heat sink comprises means for absorbing the bulk of said areas needed heat from said ground outside said foundation.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">By dissipating or absorbing the main part of the heat in the ground outside said foundation, it is possible to make a more cost-efficient temperature control system, in that the capacity of the heat sink of the temperature control means thereby becomes more constant and predictable, no matter the location on the globe or the time of day or year.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In an aspect of the invention, said temperature control means comprise one or more fluid conduits for guiding a cooling fluid in and/or between said one or more areas of said wind turbine and said ground outside said foundation.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Using fluid conduits for guiding the cooling fluid in and/or between the areas of the wind turbine and the heat sink running in the ground outside said foundation is advantageous, in that it provides for a simple and efficient way of moving the fluids.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In an aspect of the invention, said one or more fluid conduits are formed as one or more closed circuits making said cooling fluid circulate in said temperature control means.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">It is complex and expensive to pump a cooling fluid from beneath ground level to a height of more than 50 meters. By making the cooling fluid circulate in a closed system the fluid on the way down will assist in pushing, the fluid on the way up, up. Hereby the pump substantially only have to overcome the flow resistance in the fluid conduits.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Furthermore, by making the fluid circuit closed, direct interaction with the surroundings can be avoided. This is advantageous in that it hereby is possible to avoid the introduction of unwanted foreign objects and other such as humidity, bugs, sand, dirt, salt and other to the inside of the wind turbine. It is hereby possible to obtain as much more controlled environment inside the wind turbine, hereby prolonging the life of the different wind turbine components and due to the controlled environment also enabling, that the life of the components can be predicted more exactly.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In an aspect of the invention, said ground outside said foundation comprise two or more separate fluid conduits of said temperature control means.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Fluid conduits placed in the ground outside the foundation can be very hard to access once installed and even though this underground position provides a high degree of protection against external wear and tear, no system can ever be completely failsafe. It is therefore advantageous to provide the part or the temperature control means running in the ground outside the foundation with at least two separate fluid conduits, in that it hereby is possible to provide the temperature control system with redundancy. E.g. if three individual fluid conduits in the ground of three individual closed circuits was enough to provided sufficient cooling or heating to the wind turbine, the ground could be provided with six individual fluid conduits of six individual closed circuits, hereby providing the part or the temperature control means running in the ground outside the foundation with a 100% overcapacity and thereby<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> substantially eliminating the risk of the temperature control systems capacity being reduced to an unwanted level during the life of the wind turbine.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In an aspect of the invention, said one or more fluid conduits passes substantially the entire length of the interior of a wind turbine tower of said wind turbine.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">By making the fluid conduits extend through the tower of the wind turbine, some of the heat transferred to or from the ground can be used for heating or cooling the tower or wind turbine components located in the tower. This is particularly advantageous if the temperature control means primarily is used for cooling the nacelle and/or components in the nacelle, in that some of the heat hereby will have been dissipated before the heat is transferred to the ground, hereby enabling that the size/capacity of the means for exchanging heat in the ground can be reduced.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In an aspect of the invention, said cooling fluid is a liquid such as an anti-freeze and water solution, methanol, propylene glycol or potassium acetate.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Liquids such as anti-freeze solution and other is relatively simple and inexpensive to move over large distances, it has a relatively high heat capacity and relatively good heat conducting qualities and it is therefore advantageous to use a liquid as cooling fluid in a temperature control system for a wind energy converter.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In an aspect of the invention, said ground outside said foundation is the ground immediately surrounding said foundation.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The ground immediately surrounding the foundation is usually dug up when establishing the foundation. By establishing the means for exchanging heat in this free space during the making or installing of the foundation it is possible to install the means for exchanging heat in a simple and inexpensive manner.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Furthermore, if the means for exchanging heat is placed close to the foundation the risk of the means for exchanging heat being damaged by ships trying to ride at anchor near the wind turbine, by soil tillage form agricultural machinery or other, by digging or other is reduced because the means for exchanging heat is somewhat protected by the foundation.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In an aspect of the invention, said means for exchanging heat extends substantially vertically into the ground beneath and/or around said wind turbine.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Usually, the deeper you dig into the earth the hotter it gets and even in arctic areas of the globe frost free depth is only a few meters down.

The union is provided with a number of annular passageways 30 between the two part and the passageways 30 are separated by a<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> form of sealing 31 e.g. in the form of O-rings. The fluid conduits 22 are through both the upper part and the lower part connected to the passageways 30 enabling that the fluid can pass the rotating joint without the fluid in the different fluid conduits being mixed.</p><p id="p0120" num="0120">In this embodiment of the invention the centre of the union 32 is hollow enabling that power cables and other can be guided through the union 32.</p><p id="p0121" num="0121">Usually the nacelle 3 only rotates a limited number of times in one direction before it is forced to rotate in the opposite direction. In another embodiment of the invention it is therefore also feasible that the fluid conduits 22 are lead from the nacelle 3 to the tower 2 and back by means of flexible hoses or the like hanging more or less freely from the nacelle 3 down into the tower 2 like power cables does in many wind turbines 1.</p><p id="p0122" num="0122">The invention has been exemplified above with reference to specific examples of temperature control means 10, wind energy converters 7, foundations 6, heat sinks 21 and other. However, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the particular examples described above but may be designed and altered in a multitude of varieties within the scope of the invention as specified in the claims.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --></p><heading id="h0006"><b>List</b></heading><p id="p0123" num="0123"><dl id="dl0002"><dt>1.</dt><dd>Wind turbine</dd><dt>2.</dt><dd>Tower</dd><dt>3.</dt><dd>Nacelle</dd><dt>4.</dt><dd>Rotor</dd><dt>5.</dt><dd>Blade</dd><dt>6.</dt><dd>Foundation</dd><dt>7.</dt><dd>Wind energy converter</dd><dt>8.</dt><dd>Floor</dd><dt>9.</dt><dd>Ground outside the wind turbine foundation</dd><dt>10.</dt><dd>Temperature control means</dd><dt>11.</dt><dd>Wind turbine components</dd><dt>12.</dt><dd>Power converter</dd><dt>13.</dt><dd>Power resistor</dd><dt>14.</dt><dd>Motherboard</dd><dt>15.</dt><dd>Main radiator</dd><dt>16.</dt><dd>Means for exchanging heat</dd><dt>17.</dt><dd>Pump</dd><dt>18.</dt><dd>Cabinet fan driven air inlet</dd><dt>19.</dt><dd>Bidirectional valve</dd><dt>20.</dt><dd>Cooling fluid heater</dd><dt>21.</dt><dd>Heat sink</dd><dt>22.</dt><dd>Fluid conduit</dd><dt>23.</dt><dd>Area of the wind turbine needing heating or cooling</dd><dt>24.</dt><dd>Plinth</dd><dt>25.</dt><dd>Mono pile foundation</dd><dt>26.</dt><dd>Pile</dd><dt>27.</dt><dd>Gravitation foundation</dd><dt>28.</dt><dd>Cooling fluid circuit<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --></dd><dt>29.</dt><dd>Valve</dd><dt>30.</dt><dd>Annular passageway</dd><dt>31.</dt><dd>Sealing</dd><dt>32.</dt><dd>Union</dd><dt>33.</dt><dd>Reinforcement</dd><dt>34.</dt><dd>Trench</dd><dt>35.</dt><dd>Wall</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56980436" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Windenergiewandler (7), welcher Folgendes umfasst:
