load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method of operating membrane separators for subjecting water to be treated (hereinafter referred to as untreated water) including river water, lake water, ground water, seawater, domestic wastewater, industrial effluent and secondary treated water of sewage to membrane separation and clearing it of turbidity and germs by using a tank type membrane separator or a chamber type membrane separator of water head difference system or suction system.</p><heading id="h0002">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally , in the process of treating water, such as clean water treatment, sewage treatment and industrial effluent treatment, the untreated water used to undergo separation into solid and liquid contents in a coagulating sedimentation chamber or a gravity sedimentation chamber. However, along with the advancement of membrane technology, the membrane separation process has come to be used in various filtering apparatuses because it is superior in filtering accuracy and occupies less space for installation and it is easier to control its operation.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> In recent years, there has come into use a method by which membrane modules are arranged in the untreated water fed to each of the various chambers mentioned above and the water undergoes separation into solid and liquid contents. Thus, membrane modules are arranged in the untreated water containing suspended matter fed into the chamber, the water is filtered with these membrane modules by a sucking action or water head difference, and the filtered water having gone through the membrane module is drawn out of the chamber. Such a process leaves suspended matter in the liquid phase within the chamber as solid contents on the feeding side of the membrane modules, and clean filtered water cleared of turbidity and germs is obtained on the output side of the membrane modules.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In such a membrane separator, as suspended matter in the untreated water sticks to the membrane surface along with the continuation of filtering and clogs its pores, its filtering performance gradually deteriorates, eventually making the separator incapable of filtering. To stabilize filtering against this clogging, it is necessary to perform physical washing, such as gas cleaning by introducing air or some other gas to the untreated water side of the separation membrane (hereinafter referred to as air washing) and back-pressured water washing by ejecting a backwash medium such as filtered water or clean water from the filtered liquid side in the direction reverse to that<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> of filtering so as to remove what has accumulated on the separation membrane surface (hereinafter referred to as backwashing), thereby peel off the suspended matter having accumulated on the membrane surface, and further discharge the peeled-off suspended matter out of the system. In this process, if the quantity of untreated water in the chamber (held-up quantity) is large, discharging the whole quantity of suspended matter peeled off by the physical washing out of the system will be accompanied by a large quantity of untreated water, resulting in a drop in the ratio of the filtered water quantity to the quantity of the untreated water used, namely the yield of the separator.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In view of this problem, there has been proposed an operating method of a plug flow system by which the yield is controlled by constantly feeding a fixed quantity of untreated water into the chamber in which membrane modules are arranged, and at the same time discharging part of the untreated water out of the system (see Patent Document 1 for instance). However, by the above-described operating method of the conventional membrane separator disclosed in the Patent Document 1, if a high yield of 99% or more, for instance, is to be attained, only 1% or less of the untreated water in the chamber can be discharged out of the system and all the suspended matter peeled off by the physical washing or otherwise cannot be discharged<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> out of the system with the result that the concentration of the suspended matter in the chamber will gradually rise. For this reason, in order to accomplish stable membrane filtration, it is necessary to operate at a low membrane filtration flux or to increase the out-of-the-system discharged quantity of untreated water containing suspended matter (to lower the yield).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Other known methods include one by which the liquid level on the untreated water side of the filter membrane is lowered while ejecting bubbles from underneath the membrane module to strengthen the effect of air washing (see Patent Documents 2 and 3, for instance) and another by which ozonized air is injected in the form of bubbles into the untreated water side of the filter membrane (see Patent Document 4 for instance). The air washing methods shown in the Patent Documents 4 and 5 utilizing the effect of disappearance of bubbles on the gas-liquid interface or the large oscillation of the liquid surface by the rupture of bubbles are useful for enhancing the washing effect, but they involve a problem of halving the washing effect of cross flows ensuing from the rise of bubbles or the washing effect of the vibration of the filter membrane accompanying the effect of excluding an equivalent to the volume of bubbles. Moreover, as the lowering of the liquid level eliminates water around the filter membrane, the direct contact and friction<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> between the filter membranes caused by the vibration of bubbles may invite damage to or breaking of the filter membranes. Furthermore, as the suspended matter once peeled off the membrane surface by air washing sticks again to the membrane surface when the liquid level lowers, there is a problem that the concentrated suspended matter cannot be completely discharged out of the system and the washing effect is thereby halved.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Furthermore, as the distance from the filter membranes near the treated water inlet of the membrane module to the inlet is short and accordingly the pressure loss of the fluid (treated water) on the treated water side of the filter membranes is small, there arises an increase in the pressure difference between the untreated water side and the treated water side of the filter membranes, namely the membrane differential pressure, with the result that the filter membranes in the aforementioned position filter a greater quantity of untreated water than the filter membranes elsewhere, are contaminated rapidly and deteriorate in filtering performance. In view of this problem, there is proposed a method by which filtering is performed while keeping part of the filter membranes out of being immersed in the untreated water (see Patent Document 5). However, the operating method for membrane separators disclosed in the Patent Document 5, when applied to the conventional separators described above, invites drying of the filter membranes as they<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> are always partly exposed to the atmosphere. Moreover, as the whole filter membranes are not used, there is a problem that the effective membrane area is reduced.

<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> -->a physical washing step of gas washing by ejecting a gaseous washing medium onto the primary side of the membrane module and of back-pressured water washing by feeding a backwashing medium from the secondary side of the hollow fiber membranes and letting it pass to the untreated water side of the hollow fiber membranes and a drain step of discharging waste water in the chamber out of the system after repeating twice or more the filtering step and the physical washing step.</li><li>(2) The method of operating a membrane separator according to (1) above may be <b>characterized in that</b> the filtering step further includes a filtering step (hereinafter referred as the filtering step B) comprising a substep of filtering untreated water, after the completion of the physical washing step, without feeding untreated water into the chamber until the hollow fiber membranes constituting the membrane module are partly immersed, and an ensuing substep of feeding untreated water into the chamber and filtering the untreated water in a state that the whole hollow fiber membranes constituting the membrane module are immersed.</li><li>(3) The method of operating a membrane separator according to (1) or (2) above may be characterized in that the physical washing step is a combination of a step to be executed in a state in which the whole hollow fiber membranes constituting the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> membrane module are immersed (hereinafter referred as physical washing step A) and another step to be executed in a state in which the hollow fiber membranes constituting the membrane module are partly immersed (hereinafter referred as physical washing step B).</li><li>(4) The method of operating a membrane separator according to any of (1) through (3) above may be characterized in that both ends of the membrane module are composed of a large number of immersed hollow fiber membranes fixed by adhesion, with the hollow fiber membranes at the top end being open and the hollow fiber membranes at the bottom end being closed.</li><li>(5) The method of operating a membrane separator according to any of (1) through (4) above may be characterized in that, after the filtering step A and the physical washing step are executed and the filtering step B and the physical washing step are repeated once or more, the waste water in the chamber is discharged out of the system.</li></ol></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the invention, it is possible to perform effective physical washing while alleviating the loads on filter membranes and to reduce the quantity of the untreated water in the chamber, namely the held-up quantity, thereby enabling membrane filtering to be stably operated while securing a high yield by discharging out of the system the suspended matter peeled off by the physical washing together with a small quantity of untreated water.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><heading id="h0004">[Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention]</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention will be described in detail below with focus on some of the best modes for carrying it out.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Untreated water to which the invention is relevant is for example river water, lake water, ground water, improunded water, secondary treated water of sewage, industrial effluent or sewage. Filtering raw water of any of the kinds mentioned above with membranes in a conventional way involves blocking of suspended matter or any other substance greater in grain size than the pore size of the membranes contained in the raw water, and thus, tends to invite so-called polarization of concentration or formation of a cake layer, and at the same time the membranes are clogged by such suspended matter or the substances or retiform tissues in the membranes adsorb such substances. As a result, the filtering flow velocity of the membranes when filtering raw water drops to only a fraction of or a few tenths of the flow velocity when filtering clean water, and the filtering flow velocity progressively drops with the continuation of filtering.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In such a membrane separator, in order to stabilize filtering, it is necessary to peel off the suspended matter having accumulated on the membrane surface by physical washing of flowing back transmitted water or air from the secondary to the primary side of<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the filter membrane, and further to discharge the whole quantity of the peeled-off suspended matter out of the system. In this process, if the quantity of untreated water in the chamber (held-up quantity) is large, discharging the whole quantity of suspended matter peeled off by the physical washing out of the system will be accompanied by a large quantity of untreated water, resulting in a drop in the ratio of the filtered water quantity to the quantity of the untreated water used, namely the yield of the separator. Moreover, as the distance from the filter membranes near the treated water inlet of the membrane module to the inlet is short and accordingly the pressure loss of the fluid (treated water) on the treated water side of the filter membrane is small, there is an increase in the pressure difference between the untreated water side and the treated water side of the filter membranes, namely the membrane differential pressure, with the result that the filter membranes in the aforementioned position filter a greater quantity of untreated water than the filter membranes elsewhere, are contaminated rapidly and deteriorate in filtering performance.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The method of operating membrane separators according to the invention is a method whereby the liquid level of untreated water in the chamber is controlled above the upper end face of the membrane module disposed in the chamber, a filtering step A including a filtering step at which, apart from a<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> normal filtering step at which filtering is performed with all the filter membranes, the untreated water is fed into a chamber and suspended matter is stuck to the lower portions of the filter membranes constituting the membrane module by starting filtering of untreated water in a state in which filter membranes constituting the membrane module are partly immersed, and a filtering step B including a filtering step at which, after the completion of a physical washing step, suspended matter is stuck to the lower portions of the filter membranes constituting the membrane module by filtering untreated water until the filter membranes constituting the membrane module are partly immersed without feeding of untreated water into the chamber is performed and, after the filtering steps and the physical washing step are repeated twice or more, concentrated suspended matter is discharged out of the system.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Now, in a case that hollow fiber membranes of 2 m in effective length are used as the filter membranes, theoretical calculation of the pressure losses of the hollow fiber membranes indicates that filter membranes of about 20% in length from the treated water inlet of the membrane module perform filtering of about 50% of the required water to undergo filtering treatment, which means that the former filters a greater volume of untreated water than what is filtered by filter membranes in other regions, resulting in rapid progress of membrane contamination<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> and deterioration in filtering performance.
