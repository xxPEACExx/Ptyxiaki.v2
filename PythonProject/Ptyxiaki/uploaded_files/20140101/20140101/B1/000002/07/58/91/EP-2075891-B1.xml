The load 103 is, for example, a DC device or an AC device, such as an electric light, an air conditioner,<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> a refrigerator, an electromagnetic cooking device, a rice cooker, and the like.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, by way of example, the electric power supply and demand control device 104 has a control unit 104b which detects a time when electric power surplus is occurred in the electric power supplier and demander 11, for example, a time when the amount of electric power use of the load 103 is reduced and the electrical storage device 102 is near full charge or full charge and can supply electric power generated by the power generation device 101 from an electric power sending and receiving unit 104a to other electric power supplier and demander or the electric power supplier and demander 15, which is connected to the electric power supply and demand line W. There is also a case where this supply of electric power is performed by movement of the power generation device 101 or movement of the electrical storage device 102 without using the electric power supply and demand line W. Furthermore, the electric power supply and demand control device 104 has the control unit 104b which detects a time when electric power shortage is occurred in the electric power supplier and demander 11, for example, a time when the amount of electric power use of the load 103 is rapidly increased. Then, the electric power supply and demand control device 104 has the electric power sending and receiving unit 104a which receives electric power via the electric power supply and demand control devices of other electric power suppliers and demanders 12, 13, and 14 in which electric power surplus is occurred, the electric<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> power suppliers and demanders being connected to the electric power supply and demand line W, or via an electric power supply and demand control device 153 (to be described later) of the electric power supplier and demander 15 and can drive the load 103 through control of the control unit 104b, or can store in the electrical storage device 102.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The electric power supplier and demander 15 includes a power generation device 151, an electrical storage device 152, and the electric power supply and demand control device 153. Incidentally, the electric power supplier and demander can include only either the power generation device or the electrical storage device. The power generation device 151 is typically a middle scale facility for thermal power, hydraulic power, wind power and the like including a co-gene and a biomass generation facility; and the electrical storage device 152 is typically a secondary battery; however, there is also one which is combined by the storage battery (secondary battery) and the electric double layer capacitor. The electric power supplier and demander 15 can supply electric power to the electric power supplier and demander 11 (or, other electric power suppliers and demanders 12 to 14 and the like) as described above via the electric power supply and demand control device 153. Furthermore, conversely, the electric power supplier and demander 15 can receive supply of electric power from the electric power supplier and demander 11 (or, other electric power suppliers 12 to 14 and the like). Delivery and receipt of electric power in the electric power supplier and demander<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> 15 is also performed via the electric power supply and demand control device; however, as described before, the delivery and receipt of the electric power may be performed by introducing the movable power generation device and electrical storage device of other electric power supplier and demander to the supplier and demander 15.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Electric power in which the electric power supplier and demander 15 supplies to the electric power supplier and demander 11 and the like is electric power generated by the power generation device 151 or electric power stored in the electrical storage device 152; and electric power in which the electric power supplier and demander 15 is supplied from the electric power supplier and demander 11 and the like is stored in the electrical storage device 152. In the electric power system of the present invention, a plurality of power generation devices including a co-gene and a biomass generator in respective power suppliers and demanders can be controlled both automatically and manually on the basis of weather forecast, electric power demand prediction, values based on heat demand prediction, values set by each electric power supplier and demander, or the like in the delivery and receipt of electric power via the electric power supply and demand control device of each electric power supplier and demander (refer to 104c shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>). Further, each electric power supplier and demander refers to various information from the electric power supply and demand control device in other electric power supplier and demander and can set or change operating conditions<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> of the electric power supply and demand control device of the electric power supplier and demander on the basis of the amount of electric power consumption which is estimated by the electric power supplier and demander (refer to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>).</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the above respective power generation devices 101 and 151, control may be made individually for each power generation device, for example, a solar generator is controlled by a conditioner; and a fuel cell and a micro generator are controlled by a power conditioner. However, in the electric power system of the present invention, a control element common to each power generation device is overall controlled by the electric power supply and demand control devices 104 and 153 and a control element specific to an individual power generation device is individually controlled; accordingly, the power generation devices 101 and the same 151 in a handful of the electric power supplier and demander 11 and the same 15 can be optimally controlled as a whole.<br/>
Incidentally, each power generation device such as a known solar generator and a fuel cell only performs control of full output control and system connection by each power conditioner; however, in the present invention, electric power to be supplied and demanded by utilizing a flywheel unit or the like is equalized between output of each power generation device from zero to full output, so that control can be made freely by the electric power supply and demand control devices 104 and 153.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">On the other hand, the above electrical storage<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> devices 102 and 152 typically use a secondary battery independently as a DC power supply.

However, in the electric power system of the present invention, a starting preferential order and the size of starting electric power (descending order, or reverse order thereof) of an individual electrical device such as a refrigerator, an air conditioner, a TV, or the like, which constitutes the load 103 in the electric power supplier and demander 11, are set in the electric power supply and demand control device 104; for example, control is made so as to be an order in which a starting order (or a cutting off order) or an order in which an electromotive force is in a descending order; accordingly, it becomes possible to equalize electric power consumption. Furthermore, when an electrical device with large starting electric power is started, the electric power supply and demand control device 104 can be actuated so that electric power at a time of starting of a device with large starting electric power is supplied from the storage battery provided with the electric double layer capacitor and the flywheel unit.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">When electric power consumption can be equalized by controlling priority order at a time of starting as described above, there can be performed dispersion control of an excess current which is easy to flow to the electric power supply and demand control device 104 and the respective electrical devices 103 at a time of starting of the respective electrical devices 103; therefore, there can be prolonged duration of life of the control device 104 itself, the respective electrical devices,<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> or wiring components such as wiring for connecting therebetween.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In addition, control can be made so as not to cause a large pulsation in which current becomes maximum or minimum by the electric power supply and demand control device 104; therefore, it is useful for ensuring more stable operation of the electric power supply and demand control device 104 and the individual electrical device 103.<br/>
Further, for example, the elimination of a TV standby state and a standby operation of other device can be achieved by changing the electric power supply and demand control device 104 and applied electric power to DC, and therefore, unnecessary electric power consumption can be suppressed.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the electric power system shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, in the case where the electric power supply and demand control device 104 performs supply and demand of electric power with other electric power suppliers and demanders 12 to 15, the electric power supply and demand control device 104 exchanges information with electric power supply and demand control devices of the other electric power suppliers and demanders and determines supply and demand conditions or the like.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the electric power system shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the supply and demand of electric power among the electric power suppliers and demanders can be performed by AC or can be performed by DC; however, in either case, construction can be made as a local electric power system or construction can be made as a large electric power system in which these electric<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> power systems are combined.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In the electric power system shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, although not shown in the drawing, there is also a case where the electric power supplier and demander made up of only loads is connected to the electric power supply and demand line W.

In this case, it is preferable that electric power suppliers and demanders different in time slot electric power consumption pattern (for example, houses and business establishments) exist together in the electric power system 1.
