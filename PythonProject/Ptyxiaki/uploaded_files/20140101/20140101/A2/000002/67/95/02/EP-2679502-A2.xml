For example, while the discussion below focuses on the example of an indicator light located in or near the window of the passenger entry door of an aircraft, the disclosure and its various embodiments are not limited to such use. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a directionally filtered indicator light 10 according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. In the illustrated embodiment, the directionally filtered indicator light 10 comprises a light source 20 in combination with a directional filter 30. The light source 20 further comprises a display surface 22, which may comprise, for example, an image. In some embodiments, the directional filter 30 comprises a light control film. The directional filter 30 further includes orientation marks 35, which may take the form of indentations, as shown in the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. The directional filter 30 is arranged adjacent to the display surface 22 of the light source 20. In the illustrated embodiment, the directional filter 30 is placed directly on the display surface 22 using an adhesive layer 25.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a passenger aircraft 1, in which the directionally filtered indicator light 10 is installed, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. In the illustrated embodiment, the passenger aircraft 1 comprises a passenger entry door 5 having a window 3, and a passenger seating area 7. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, the directionally filtered indicator light 10, which comprises a "Closed/Latched/Locked" indicator, is installed on the passenger entry door 5 near the window 3. In some embodiments, the directionally filtered indicator light 10 is secured into place by a retaining ring (not shown). Because of the spatial constraints of aircraft design, the directionally filtered<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> indicator light 10 is in the immediate vicinity of the passenger seating area 7. However, the directionally filtered indicator light 10 advantageously emits approximately no light that is directly visible from the passenger seating area 7, even though the location of the indicator light 10 is otherwise visible from said passenger seating area 7.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a control system 40 that may provide command and power signals to the directionally filtered indicator light 10 when in use. In the illustrated embodiment, the control system 40 comprises a "door closed" switch 44 and a "door locked" switch 45 coupled to a logic controller 42, which is in turn coupled to a light source 20. In some embodiments, the logic controller 42 comprises a computer processor, one or more logic gates, or the like. The control system 40 may also be connected to an Emergency Power Assist System (EPAS) module of the passenger aircraft 1. In operation, when the "door closed" switch 44 and the "door locked" switch 45 are both closed, logic controller 42 sends power to the light source 20, which is shown as a Light Emitting Diode (LED) in the illustrated embodiment.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to the present disclosure, the light source 20 may be chosen from any number of suitable light sources. The LED light source 20 shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> advantageously exhibits relatively long life and reliability, which are significant considerations when used as an aircraft component. In other embodiments, the light source 20 may comprise LCD, incandescent, fluorescent, or any other suitable source of light. The light surface 22, may be chosen from any number of available materials and shapes, which may correspond to the type of light source 20 chosen. Alternatively, the directionally filtered indicator light 10 may be employed in connection with a wide variety of control systems, which, for example, supply power when a particular condition or set of conditions are met.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In operation, the directional filter 30 operates to prevent the light emitted by the light source 20 from being transmitted outside of a selected trajectory range or viewing angle. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4A</figref>, the light from the light source 20 alone is transmitted in all directions. In comparison with <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4B</figref>, however, where the directional filter 30 is placed over the display light source 20, the light emitted by the directionally filtered indicator light 10 is substantially constrained to the right and to the left of the light source 20. At the same time, the light is relatively unconstrained above and below the indicator light 10, as shown by the arrows, as well as being highly visible in the normal direction (perpendicular to the display surface).<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As stated above, in some embodiments the directional filter 30 comprises a light control film, which may be selected from a number of available materials, including, for example, VIKUITI™ light control films manufactured by 3M™ Optical Systems. These and similar light control films operate like a set of fixed louvers embedded in a structure such as, for example, a polycarbonate film. When placed over a display surface or image, the display or image appears unobstructed at normal incidence (viewing angle = 0°; perpendicular to the light control film), but as the viewing angle increases along an orthogonal plane the amount of light transmitted through the film decreases until reaching a cutoff angle where the film blocks approximately all of the transmitted light.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As explained in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20100271721A"><text>U.S. Patent Publication 2010/0271721</text></patcit>, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, light control films are designed to regulate light transmission to fall within or without a specific viewing angle θ. In the embodiment illustrated by <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref>, the viewing angle θ of the light control film is about 60°; i.e., the image underlying the light control film is viewable within in a 60° range, or within an angle ϕ f about ±30° (plus or minus about 30°), along orthogonal plane XZ. At the normal incidence N, perpendicular to the directional filter 30, the indicator light 10 of the illustrated embodiment emits 100% of the maximum light transmitted through the directional filter. Outside of the viewing angle, however, the directionally filtered indicator light of the present embodiment emits no more than about 5% of the maximum light transmitted in the normal direction N. Light control films are also commonly designed with a viewing angle of 48°. Many other trajectory ranges are possible, and some embodiments of the present disclosure contemplate viewing angles of about 40° to about 60°, though some embodiments may require other viewing angles to receive consideration. The chosen viewing angle for some embodiments may, for example, be selected to consider the location of the indicator light with respect to the passenger seating area of a vehicle, which may be a passenger aircraft, or the relative position of a security system to a public walkway or metal detector.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As discussed above, light control films are generally constructed to regulate the emission of light along a plane that is orthogonal to the display surface 22. In alternative embodiments, however, the light control film may be constructed to regulate transmission of light in multiple planes. For example, a light control film could be constructed that would allow the directionally filtered indicator light to be viewed from a range of about 48°, within a first plane that is orthogonal to the display surface 22, and within a range of about 60° along a second plane that is orthogonal to both the display surface 22 and the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> first plane. It may also be possible to define the viewing angle in terms of a polar coordinate system or other coordinate system.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a method for arranging the directional filter 30 on the display surface 22 of the light source 20, wherein the directional filter 30, such as a light control film, is cut to a size and shape that approximates the size and shape of the display surface 22. Further, as seen from the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 6A</figref>, the properly sized directional filter 30 may also be prepared with orientation marks, such as indentations 35 or the like, to indicate, for example, the direction of the orthogonal plane in which the light transmission is regulated by the filter 30. In the illustrated embodiment, the film is prepared with indentations 35 at the top and the bottom of the directional filter 30, which are intended to indicate to the individual or machine performing the installation that the orthogonal plane XZ in which light is regulated runs perpendicular to an axis 38 running between the two indentations 35, as well as perpendicular to the display surface 22. This may facilitate proper alignment of the directional filter 30 in instances in which the orientation of the individual 'louvers' 31 may not be visibly apparent to the individual or machine handling the directional filter 30. Thus, by turning the directional filter 30 about on the axis 38 to an angle outside the viewing range θ, light passing through the film is substantially eliminated.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">A directional filter 30 that has been prepared with orientation markings 35, according to the aspect of the disclosure above, is in some embodiments retrofit to a previously installed light source 20 and display surface, such as for example in the passenger entry door 5 of an aircraft1, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>. The directional filter with orientation marks 35 that is retrofit to the indicator light source 20 may be applied using an adhesive layer 25.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> illustrate another embodiment of the present disclosure, wherein the directional filter 30 is comprises a light cover 130. Light cover 130 is a mechanical structure used to regulate light transmission. The light cover 130 is comprised of a plurality of mechanical louvers 134 arranged in a frame 130, the frame and the mechanical louvers approximating the two or three dimensional shape of the display surface 22. The light cover regulates light in a manner similar to that of the light control film, wherein the dimensions and spacing of the mechanical louvers may be selected to result in a desired trajectory range of transmitted light. For example, the illustrated embodiment shows an angle ϕ of approximately 45°, which corresponds to a viewing<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> angle θ of approximately 90°. An adhesive layer 25 may be used in connection with the light cover 130 as with the light control film discussed above.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In yet other embodiments, the directionally filtered indicator light 10 may be used in connection with other passenger vehicles, security systems, or any other open or controlled environment, such as for example, where the indicator light 10 is relevant to a first group of individuals, or first location, and where the indicator light could present a nuisance or a security issue if the indicator light became visible to a second group of individuals, or second location. The first group of individuals may, for example, represent individuals with service or security responsibilities for those in the second group. Alternatively, for example, the directionally filtered indicator light 10 may be applied to individual indicator lights that are relevant to a single passenger of an aircraft and service personnel, without disturbing the remaining passengers.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments of the present apparatus and process are merely possible examples of implementations and merely set forth for a clear understanding of the principles of the disclosure.
