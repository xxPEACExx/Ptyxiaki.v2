Typically the baby bottle is composed of a body part for containing infant formula, a nipple with a tap, and a coupling means for coupling the body part and the nipple to each other.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The body part is made of a transparent plastic material (i.e., synthetic resin) which is inexpensive, lightweight, and durable. The nipple is made of a soft material so that a baby can suck the infant formula via the nipple. The coupling means is coupled to the outside surface of an upper portion of the body part generally in a screw manner in order to seal the nipple to the body part.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Since germs easily stick to the baby bottle and bacteria multiply fast on the surface of the baby bottle once the baby bottle is used, the baby bottle is boiled to be sterilized so that babies will not be infected.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">When sterilizing the baby bottle made of a plastic material in a boiling water, environmental hormones hazardous to babies' health are generated. The environmental hormones are transferred to baby's bodies along with the formula in the bottle, having a negative impact on the babies. The environmental hormones are also likely to be generated when hot water is poured into a synthetic resin bottle to prepare infant formula.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Meanwhile, a baby bottle made of glass is disadvantageous in that it is heavy, is not good for baby's emotional<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> development due to its hardness, and it easily breaks even when it is made of tempered glass or heat-resistant glass.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In order to prevent hazardous environmental hormones from being generated from baby bottles, silicone-based baby bottles are proposed, such as a "silicone baby battle" disclosed in Korean Patent Registration No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="KR0621163"><text>0621163</text></patcit>. That is, baby bottles made of silicone are increasingly being marketed. Silicone is comparatively expensive but it is highly resistant to heat and does not generate environmental hormones. For this reason, the demand for silicone baby bottles is increasing.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The baby bottle is provided with an air inlet, through which external air in a volume corresponding to the volume of formula fed to a baby is introduced in order to maintain a constant internal pressure. In conventional baby bottles, the air inlet is exposed to the outside.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">When a baby is fed from the baby bottle, the tap is put into baby's mouth and the baby bottle is disposed upside down so that the formula in the baby bottle can flow into the baby's mouth. In this instance, since the air inlet is formed in the nipple and exposed directly to the outside, when the baby incidentally pauses sucking the formula during feeding, the formula in the baby bottle is usually discharged outside by backflow through the air inlet due to the increased pressure of the infant formula in the nipple. This discharged formula flows along the surface of the baby bottle and drops<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> onto the baby's face, surprising or displeasing the baby. This discharged formula is easily exposed to germs and the baby is likely to be infected by the germs by accidentally consuming the formula on the surface of the baby bottle.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Accordingly, it is necessary to minimize the outflow of the formula through the air inlet when the baby pauses sucking the formula in the baby bottle during feeding and to prevent the formula from flowing along the surface of the baby bottle and dropping to the baby's face or mouth even when the backflow of the formula occurs.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is also necessary to provide components of the baby bottle, i.e. body part, nipple and coupling means, as separate members in order for easy removal of foreign substances sticking to the baby bottle, and easy cleaning and boiling for disinfection. Furthermore, it is preferable that the components can be easily reassembled after being disassembled for cleaning and can be tightly sealed without allowing a gap between the component so that the formula will not leak through the gap after being reassembled.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Furthermore, since silicone is soft and easily deformable by external force, it is difficult to tightly reassemble the components of the baby bottle and thus unintended gaps may occur between the components after being reassembled.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Especially in the case of a baby bottle such as the "silicone baby bottle" disclosed in Korean Patent Registration<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="KR0621163"><text>0621163</text></patcit> in which a coupler as the coupling means simply couples to the outer circumference of an opening of a body part of the bottle made of silicone in an inserted manner and a tap cover as the coupling means couples to the coupler in a screw manner, the opening of the body part of the baby bottle is simply inserted into the coupler and there are no other means to tightly couple the coupler and the body part to each other. Accordingly, when the coupler and the cover are screwed together or unscrewed from each other, the coupler and the body part are not tightly fitted to each other. That is, in even a state in which the opening portion of the body part is inserted into the coupler, the body part can be rotated. This hinders not only tight coupling between the coupler when assembling the baby bottle but also separation of the coupler and the body part when disassembling the baby bottle.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Furthermore, when assembling a baby bottle, a user holds a body part with one hand and rotates a cover with other hand in order to couple the body part and the cover in a screw manner. At this time, the body part is deformed by external force applied from user's hand and the cover is coupled to the body part in the deformed state. Accordingly, there is a possibility that a gap may occur in the contact site of the body part and the cover.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Furthermore, since silicone is soft, when the body part is pressed by user's hand, the cover or the coupler screwed<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> with the body part is likely to be easily separated from the body part.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">If this happens during feeding, the safety of the infant or young child cannot be secured.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Accordingly, when the baby bottle is made of silicone, the body part and the nipple need to be easily and simply coupled and decoupled by the coupling means, while ensuring secure coupling without allowing a gap between the body part and nipple when the body part and the nipple are coupled to each other. However, the conventional silicone baby bottle is not provided with such a coupling means.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Disclosure</b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b>Technical Problem</b></heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a silicone baby bottle in which tight coupling between components and safety are ensured because a body part and a nipple are made of silicone which does not generate environmental hormones, and because the body part and nipple are structured to be in tight contact with each other in consideration of the limitations of silicone representing elastomer, in order to prevent the components, except for the body part, from being separated from the body part by incidental external force, preventing<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> formula in the silicone baby bottle from leaking and flooding which results in an infant or a young child becoming dirty or burned.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Another object of the present invention is to provide a silicone baby bottle not only which has a good appearance and can be produced in mass production with good productivity but also which has a structure in which a body part and a nipple can come into tight contact with each other.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A further object of the present invention is to provide a silicone baby bottle in which an air inlet is not formed in a nipple but in a body part in order to lower the inside pressure near the air inlet and thus lower a possibility that formula in the body part is discharged through the air inlet, and in which the air inlet is covered by a first coupling ring in order to prevent the formula from flowing along the surface of the body part even if the formula is discharged through the air inlet. This prevents an infant or a young child from being displeased or from being infected by germs.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a silicone baby bottle in which all components can be separated from each other in order to ensure easy cleaning and disinfection in boiling water, and all the components can be tightly reassembled after the cleaning and disinfection process.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><heading id="h0005"><b>Technical Solution</b></heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">In order to accomplish the above objects, the present invention provides a silicone baby bottle including: a body part made of elastomer and composed of a neck portion with an upper locking portion and a shoulder portion provided at a lower portion of the neck portion; a nipple made of elastomer and composed of a flange coming into contact with an upper surface of the body part, a waist portion extending from an upper portion of the flange, and a tap extending from an upper portion of the waist portion; and a coupling part which tightly couples the body part and the nipple to each other and is composed of a first coupling ring and a second coupling ring screwed with the first coupling ring and configured to cover an upper surface of the flange of the nipple, the first coupling ring being provided between the shoulder portion of the body part and the upper locking portion of the neck portion.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the silicone baby bottle, the nipple may be provided with a recess between the flange and the waist portion and the second coupling ring has a pushing portion to be inserted into the recess.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The waist portion of the nipple may be thicker than the other portions of the nipple in order to impart rigidity and reinforce supportability, and the pushing portion of the second ring may protrude inward from the inside surface and<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the pushing portion is disposed between a lower portion of the waist portion of the nipple and the recess.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the silicone baby bottle according to the present invention, the upper locking portion of the neck portion includes a side extension extending from an upper end of the body part in the radial direction and a lower extension extending downward from an end of the side extension and surrounding an upper end of the first coupling ring.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The upper end of the first coupling ring is locked by the upper locking portion of the body part.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The shoulder portion of the body part is thicker than the remaining portion of the body part in order to impart rigidity and reinforce supportability.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The first coupling ring includes an insertion portion at an upper end.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The upper locking portion of the body is provided with a recessed portion into which the insertion portion is inserted.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">An inside surface of the second ring is provided with a pressing portion which directly presses the upper locking portion of the neck portion of the body part when the first coupling ring is coupled.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The first ring is provided with a coupling direction indicating mark, and an air inlet through which air is externally introduced into the body part during feeding is formed in a mounting recess of the neck portion of the body<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> part which is surrounded by the first coupling ring.</p><heading id="h0006"><b>Advantageous Effects</b></heading><p id="p0032" num="0032">According to the silicone baby bottle having the structure described above according to the present invention, since the body part and the nipple are made of silicone, an infant or young child can be protected from environmental hormones.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Especially when the first coupling and the second coupling are coupled to each other, the pressing portion of the second coupling presses the upper surface of the lower extension (or the side extension, or the lower extension and the side extension) of the body part and simultaneously the pushing portion of the second coupling ring presses the upper surface of the flange of the tap. Accordingly, the body part and the nipple come into tight contact with each other inside the baby bottle.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Components except for the body part are not easily separated from each other by an external force because of the advantageous properties of silicone representing elastomer, and the silicone baby bottle is safe in terms of user's health.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Since this silicone baby bottle is excellent in sealing above all, there is no risk that the contents in the bottle leak or flood, preventing the user from becoming dirty or<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> burned.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Furthermore, since only the body part and nipple made of silicone come into contact with infant or young child formula or baby's mouth, the infant or young child using the baby bottle is not exposed to environmental hormones which are generated from synthetic material or similar hazardous substances. Yet furthermore, the silicone provides the infant or young child with mother's skin-like feel due to its flexibility and softness, so the baby bottle contributes to emotional development of the infant or young child.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Since the silicone baby bottle according to the present invention has a simple structure, it can be produced with good productivity even while it has a good appearance. In addition, the silicone baby bottle according to the present invention do not cause safety accidents which often occur during use of a conventional baby bottles made of silicone(decoupling between the body part and the other components during use, etc).</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Since the air inlet is formed in the body part, there is little possibility that the formula is discharged through the air inlet by backflow because the internal pressure in the body part very slightly increases. Furthermore, since the air inlet is covered by the first coupling ring, even if the formula is discharged through the air inlet, the discharged formula may remain between the body part and the first<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> coupling ring, so that the discharged air will not flow along the surface of the body part. Even if the amount of formula discharged through the air inlet is beyond a volume of the formula which can remain in a gap between the body part and the first coupling ring, when an infant or young child sucks the formula again, the formula between the body part and the first coupling ring is reintroduced into the body part.
