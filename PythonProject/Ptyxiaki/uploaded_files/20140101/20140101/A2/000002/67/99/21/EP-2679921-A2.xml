Unlike a conventional HCFC refrigerant such as R22, this R410A has an ozone depletion potential ODP of zero and does not destroy the ozone layer, but has a high global warming potential GWP. For this reason, it is currently being considered, as part of prevention of global warming, to change the refrigerant from a high-GWP HFC refrigerant, such as R410A, to a low-GWP HFC refrigerant.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">R32 (CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>; difluoromethane) is a candidate for such a low-GWP HFC refrigerant. Also, halogenated hydrocarbon having a double bond of carbon in a composition, such as HFO-1234yf (CF<sub>3</sub>CF=CH<sub>2</sub>; tetrafluoropropane) and HFO-1234ze (CF<sub>3</sub>-CH=CHF), is a similar candidate refrigerant. While each of the HFC refrigerants is a kind of HFC refrigerant similar to R32, it is often referred to as HFO including O of olefin in order to distinguish it from an HFC refrigerant, such as R32, having no double bond of carbon in a composition, because unsaturated hydrocarbon having a double bond of carbon is referred to as olefin.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">While such a low-GWP HFC refrigerant (including an HFO refrigerant) is not as highly flammable as an HC refrigerant such as R290 (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>; propane), it is slightly flammable unlike non-flammable R410A. For this reason, it is necessary to pay<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> attention to refrigerant leakage. Hereinafter, a refrigerant having flammability is referred to as a flammable refrigerant.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In conventional refrigeration cycle apparatuses, highly flammable refrigerants, such as propane, are considered as flammable refrigerants that may leak. There is a refrigeration cycle apparatus, in which at least one of activated carbon, gas adsorbing resin, clay, activated alumina, molecular sieve, bone char, white clay, silica gel, and a mixture of two or more of them is provided as a refrigerant adsorbing substance on an inner wall surface of a machine chamber in an outdoor unit, and a leakage refrigerant is adsorbed by the refrigerant adsorbing substance to suppress diffusion of the leakage refrigerant to the outside (for example, see Patent Literature 1).</p><heading id="h0003">[Citation List]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Patent Literature]</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006"><ul><li>[Patent Literature 1] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2000105003A"><text>2000-105003</text></patcit> (columns 0011 to 0020, <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>)</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">[Summary of Invention]</heading><heading id="h0006">[Technical Problem]</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, among the substances given as refrigerant adsorbing substances in Patent Literature 1, especially, silica gel and molecular sieve are commonly known as desiccants for adsorbing water (water vapor) in the air, and are widely used as desiccants. While the machine chamber of the outdoor unit is physically separated from the outside, new outside air is introduced into and passed through the machine chamber from a vent hole or the like by utilizing rotation of an air-sending fan in a fan chamber in order to cool electrical components set in the machine chamber during operation of the refrigeration cycle apparatus.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">For this reason, the refrigerant adsorbing substance formed of silica gel or molecular sieve, although provided on the inner wall surface of the machine chamber,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> is frequently exposed to the flow of outside air, and positively adsorbs water from the outside air (outdoor air). Hence, after a predetermined time, which is not so long, elapses from installation of the outdoor unit, the refrigerant adsorbing substance is saturated with adsorbed water. Thus, even if the refrigerant leaks in the machine chamber, the refrigerant adsorbing substance cannot adsorb the refrigerant, and this makes it difficult to improve safety.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">If the volume concentration of the refrigerant in the air is within a flammable concentration range and the flammable refrigerant is ignited by some sort of ignition source, the refrigerant catches fire and combusts. The combustion scale differs according to the kind of refrigerant. Since the low-GWP HFC refrigerant is slightly flammable, the combustion scale thereof is smaller than that of the highly flammable HC refrigerant such as propane. Here, a large combustion scale means that the reciprocal of the combustion time is large, for example, that flames quickly propagate, the pressure greatly increases, and large flames are produced.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In relation to flammability, from recent study and evaluation of a combustion phenomenon of a slightly flammable HFC refrigerant, whose combustion scale is smaller than that of a highly flammable refrigerant such as propane, it has been found that the combustion scale increases as the absolute humidity increases under the same conditions in combustion of R32 and the HFO refrigerant. For this reason, in a refrigeration cycle apparatus using, as a refrigerant, a low-GWP, but slightly flammable HFC refrigerant such as R32 or an HFO refrigerant, it is necessary to improve safety against unexpected leakage of the refrigerant in consideration of such a correlation between the combustion scale and the absolute humidity, although the refrigerant is slightly flammable.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention has been made to overcome the above-described problems, and an object of the invention is to provide a refrigeration cycle apparatus that improves safety against unexpected refrigerant leakage when an HFC refrigerant<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> that has a low GWP but is flammable, such as R32 or an HFO refrigerant, is used as a refrigerant.</p><heading id="h0007">[Solution to Problem]</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">A refrigeration cycle apparatus according to the present invention includes a refrigerant circuit, a compressor provided in the refrigerant circuit, having a compression mechanism section in an enclosed container, and configured to compress and discharge a refrigerant so as to circulate the refrigerant in the refrigerant circuit, and an outdoor unit installed outdoors and having a housing divided by a partition plate into a fan chamber including an outdoor air-sending fan and an outdoor heat exchanger and a machine chamber including the compressor. The refrigerant is a flammable HFC refrigerant. The refrigeration cycle apparatus further includes a desiccant attached in thermal contact with a surface of the enclosed container of the compressor whose temperature is increased by a gas refrigerant compressed by the compression mechanism section during operation of the compressor.

Hence, even if a flammable HFC refrigerant leaks into the machine chamber and the leakage refrigerant is ignited by some sort of ignition source when the concentration of the leakage refrigerant is within a flammable range, the combustion scale can be kept down.

When an operation start command is transmitted from the user to the air-conditioning apparatus 100, the control device operates the four-way valve 4 to switch the flow passage of the refrigerant circuit according to an instructed operation mode (cooling operation or heating operation). Then, each of the fan motors 8a is energized to rotate the outdoor air-sending fan 8, and the compressor 3 is started to circulate a refrigerant in the refrigerant circuit.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The control device starts the compressor 3 at a predetermined low start rotation speed, and gradually increases the rotation speed of the compressor 3 toward a target rotation speed determined according to the air conditioning load. After the rotation speed reaches the target rotation speed, when the difference between the preset temperature and the room temperature decreases, the rotation speed of the compressor 3 is decreased. Basically, the rotation speed of the outdoor air-sending fan 8 is also changed in accordance with the rotation speed of the compressor 3.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> By the rotation of the outdoor air-sending fan 8, outside air is sucked from the rear and side directions of the outdoor air-sending fan 8 formed by the propeller fan, and an air flow to be blown out from the air outlet 21 opening in the fan-chamber front panel 14 and opposing the front side of the outdoor air-sending fan 8 is produced. When this air flow passes through the outdoor heat exchanger 5, it exchanges heat with the refrigerant flowing in the outdoor heat exchanger 5. The air that has passed through the outdoor heat exchanger 5 is heated by heat of condensation of the refrigerant in cooling operation and is cooled by evaporation heat removed by the refrigerant in heating operation. After heat exchange, the air is blown outdoors from the air outlet 21 again.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">During operation of the air-conditioning apparatus 100, the electric and electronic components on the electric component board 26 set in the electrical component unit 24 need to be cooled because part of the flowing current is converted into heat energy and heat is generated to increase the temperature. For this reason, in the outdoor unit 2, an air flow for cooling the interior of the electrical component unit 24 is produced by the rotation of the outdoor air-sending fan 8, separately from the air flow that performs heat exchange in the outdoor heat exchanger 5. <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is a schematic explanatory view illustrating the flow of cooling air in the electrical component unit 24, and arrows in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> indicate the cooling air flow.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The suction operation with the outdoor air-sending fan 8 also acts on the interior of the electrical component unit 24 that communicates with the fan chamber F via the communication hole 29 of the partition plate 20 and the vent hole 28 in the left side wall of the housing of the electrical component unit 24. Air in the electrical component unit 24 flows through the vent hole 28 and the communication hole 29, and is sucked to the outdoor air-sending fan 8 in the fan chamber F.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">To supplement air to be sucked in the fan chamber F, air flows from the machine chamber M into the electrical component unit 24 through the vent hole 27<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> provided in the right side wall of the housing of the electrical component unit 24. Further, the machine chamber M communicates with the outdoors via the air inlet 19 provided in the lower part of the machine-chamber side panel 16, and new outdoor air flows into the machine chamber M through the air inlet 19 to supplement the air flowing in the electrical component unit 24.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In this way, when the outdoor air-sending fan 8 rotates, the suction operation of the rotating outdoor air-sending fan 8 produces an air flow that flows in from the air inlet 19, rises in the machine chamber M, crosses the electrical component unit 24 in the right-left direction, and flows out to the fan chamber F (an air flow for cooling the interior of the electrical component unit 24), separately from the air flow passing through the outdoor heat exchanger 5.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The cooling air flow for the electrical component unit 24 originates from outside air introduced, by the rotation of the outdoor blower fan 8 in the fan chamber F, into the machine chamber M through the air inlet 19 provided in the lower part of the machine-chamber side panel 16. The cooling air flow flows from the machine chamber M into the electrical component unit 24 through the vent hole 27 provided in the right side wall of the housing to serve as an air inlet to the electrical component unit 24, crosses the electrical component unit 24 in the right-left direction, and is guided from the vent hole 28 of the left side wall into the fan chamber F via the communication hole 29 of the partition plate 20. While crossing the electrical component unit 24, the cooling air flow passes by the electric component board 26 in the right-left direction. For this reason, the cooling air flow diffuses heat generated by the electric and electronic components (for example, a smoothing condenser) on the electric component board 26 during operation, and cools the heat-generating electric and electronic components.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In this way, while the cooling air flow for the electrical component unit 24 crosses the electrical component unit 24 in the right-left direction and flows into the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> fan chamber F, it cools the electric and electronic components, including the electric component board 26, provided in the electrical component unit 24. The cooling air flow that has flowed in the fan chamber F is blown outdoors from the air outlet 21 together with the air (main air flow) that is sucked by the outdoor air-sending fan 8 and is subjected to heat exchange in the outdoor heat exchanger 5. Only the communication hole 29 through which the cooling air passes is a portion of the partition plate 20 that communicates between the machine chamber M and the fan chamber F, and only the cooling air flow is an air flow guided from the machine chamber M to the fan chamber F by the rotation of the outdoor blower fan 8.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The above is the basic structure and operation of the outdoor unit 2. As described above, the air-conditioning apparatus 100 uses, as the refrigerant flowing in the refrigerant circuit, a low-GWP HFC refrigerant (here, R32) which is effective in preventing global warming. Since such an HFC refrigerant is slightly flammable, the air-conditioning apparatus 100 is required to have high safety against unexpected leakage of the refrigerant.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">As described above, recent study of HFC refrigerants (R32, HFO), which have a low GWP, but are slightly flammable, particularly, evaluation of the combustion scale has found that the combustion scale tends to increase as the absolute humidity under the same conditions (the same kind of refrigerant, the same gas refrigerant concentration, and ignition with the same ignition source) except for the absolute humidity. A gas refrigerant is sealed in an experimental box. At this time, a quantity of gas refrigerant such as the gas refrigerant concentration in the box becomes a specific value within a flammable range (14.4 to 29.3 vol% for R32, 6.2 to 12.3 vol% for HFO1234yf) is sealed, the gas refrigerant concentration distribution in the box is uniformized by an agitation fan set in the box.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Then, current is supplied to a nichrome wire heater set in the box, and the heater is heated until the refrigerant in the experimental box is ignited. A process in<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> which the refrigerant is ignited and combusted and naturally stops combustion is observed, and the combustion range, combustion time, and increase in pressure are evaluated. The combustion scale is determined from these results. The absolute humidity in the experimental box is measured with an absolute humidity sensor. To confirm that the gas refrigerant concentration is not changed, it is confirmed with an oximeter instead that the oxygen concentration in the box is not changed.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">When such evaluation of the slightly flammable HFC refrigerant was conducted a plurality of times by using the absolute humidity in the experimental box as a parameter, it was found that the combustion scale tended to increase as the absolute humidity increased. The absolute humidity is changed according to the weather, season, time, etc. From the result obtained by this evaluation, it is conceivable that, when an R32 or HFO refrigerant, whose refrigerant concentration in the air is within the flammable range, is ignited by an ignition source supplied (provided) for some reason, the combustion scale can decrease and the safety against unexpected refrigerant leakage can increase as the absolute humidity decreases.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Accordingly, to increase the safety against unexpected leakage of the refrigerant from the group of refrigerant pipes 23 and so on in the machine chamber M, in the outdoor unit 2, a desiccant 30, such as silica gel, which adsorbs water from the air is provided in the machine chamber M so as to maintain a low absolute humidity in the machine chamber M. Further, as a characterizing structure of the outdoor unit 2, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the desiccant 30 is provided in contact with an outer side surface of the high-pressure shell compressor 3, more specifically, an outer side surface of the cylindrical container 3b that forms a part of the enclosed container of the compressor 3.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The desiccant 30 is obtained by storing granulated silica gel serving as a desiccating substance in a net bag made of a breathable metal or a heat-resistant resin.

The fixed bands 40 press the desiccant 30 against the outer side surface of the cylindrical container 3b with elastic force of the coil springs. The desiccant 30 is clamped between the bands 40 and the cylindrical container 3b by the elastic force of the bands 40. Since the desiccant 30 has a structure in which the granulated silica gel is contained in the net bag, it is deformed along a curved surface (outer shape) of the cylindrical container 3b by the pressing force of the bands 40, and is brought into contact on the outer side surface of the cylindrical container 3b in a wide area.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The bands 40 are not limited to the coil springs, and it is satisfactory as long as the bands 40 can press the desiccant 30 against the outer side surface of the cylindrical container 3b with a tightening force while being fixed around the cylindrical container 3b.

A desiccating substance like silica gel has the properties of releasing adsorbed water when heated and becoming operable (capable of adsorbing water from the air) as a desiccating substance again.

Heat radiation from the compressor 3 is utilized as a heat source for heating the desiccant 30 to release water adsorbed by the desiccant 30 during operation of the outdoor unit 2.

For that purpose, the position of the vent hole 50 in the up-down direction is set above the desiccant 30 and below the electrical component unit 24.

Hence, the gas refrigerant concentration does not fall within the flammable range.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100"><!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> Since the enclosed container of the compressor 3 has a wide area whose temperature becomes high during operation, such as the outer side surface of the cylindrical container 3b and the upper surface of the upper lid 3a, the desiccants 30 to 32 can be attached thereto in a wider area than when they are attached in contact with the surface of the discharge pipe 12 through which the high-temperature gas refrigerant flows. For this reason, since both the exposed areas to the machine chamber M and the contact areas with the heat source (compressor 3) of the attached desiccants 30 to 32 increase, the desiccants 30 to 32 can adsorb much water from the air in the machine chamber M and maintain a low absolute humidity in the machine chamber M during non-operation, and are heated by heat of the compressor 3 to reliably release much adsorbed water, and restore the water adsorption function during operation.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">While R32 is used here as the HFC refrigerant that has a low GWP but is flammable, an HFO refrigerant (a kind of HFC refrigerant), such as HFO-1234yf, formed of halogenated hydrocarbon having a double bond of carbon in a composition, tends to have a relationship between the absolute humidity and the combustion scale similar to that of R32. Also, the HFO refrigerant has a density more than that of air, similarly to R32. Hence, when the HFO refrigerant is used as the refrigerant that circulates in the refrigerant circuit, or when a mixture of R32 and the HFO refrigerant is used, application of the present invention can obtain advantages similar to those of R32.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">The desiccants 30 to 32 do not always need to be in direct contact with the outer surface of the enclosed container of the compressor 3. It is satisfactory as long as the desiccants 30 to 32 are in thermal contact therewith so that heat is transferred from the compressor 3 to the desiccants 30 to 32 and releases adsorbed water as the heat source. For example, the desiccant 30 to 32 may be heated by heat transferred from the compressor 3 via a metallic member that is provided between the<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> compressor 3 and the desiccants 30 to 32 and is formed of a metallic material having high thermal conductivity.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">Since the adsorption capacity (water adsorption ability) of the desiccants 30 to 32 may decrease owing to aging degradation, the desiccants 30 to 32 are preferably attached such as to be replaceable periodically. When the desiccants 30 to 32 are attached to the outer side surface of the cylindrical container 3b of the compressor 3, they are preferably provided on the front side of the compressor 3, that is, on the machine-chamber front panel 15 side. The desiccants 30 to 32 can be attached and detached without taken the compressor 3 out of the machine chamber M, by temporarily releasing the elastic force of the above-described bands 40 or holders 43 and giving elasticity thereto again, or by being simply put in and out from the pocket 41 or the net pocket 42. This allows new and old desiccants 30 to 32 to be exchanged easily.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">While the embodiment of the present invention has been described above in conjunction with the outdoor unit 2 in the air-conditioning apparatus 100, the present invention is applicable not only to the air-conditioning apparatus 100 but also to other refrigeration cycle apparatuses, such as a heat-pump water heater and a refrigerator, as long as the refrigeration cycle apparatus includes an internal compressor having an enclosed container that at least partially increases in temperature during operation and an outdoor unit set outdoors, and uses R32, an HFO refrigerant, or a mixture thereof as a refrigerant to circulate in the refrigerant circuit. In this case, similar operational advantages can be obtained, and safety against unexpected refrigerant leakage can be enhanced.</p><heading id="h0012">[Reference Signs List]</heading><p id="p0105" num="0105">2: outdoor unit, 3: compressor, 3a: upper lid (enclosed container), 3b: cylindrical container (enclosed container), 3c: bottom lid (enclosed container), 5: outdoor heat exchanger, 8: outdoor air-sending fan, 13: top panel (housing), 14: fan-chamber<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> front panel (housing), 15: machine-chamber front panel (housing), 16: machine-chamber side panel (housing), 17: bottom plate (housing), 19: air inlet, 20: partition plate, 21: air outlet, 24: electrical component unit, 26: electric component board, 30: desiccant, 31: desiccant, 32: desiccant, 40: band, 41: pocket, 42: net pocket, 43: holder.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56976666" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="1"><claim-text><b>1.</b><br/>
