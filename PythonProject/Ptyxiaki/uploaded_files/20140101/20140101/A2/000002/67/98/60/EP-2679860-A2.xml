However, it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical, mechanical, and electrical changes may be made. Furthermore, the method presented in the drawing figures and the specification is not to be construed as limiting the order in which the individual steps may be performed. The following description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1A</figref> is a perspective view of a system 100, <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 1B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the system 100, and <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 1C</figref> is an exploded view of the system 100. The system 100 includes an isolated portion 102 mechanically coupled to a non-isolated portion 104 with a passive isolator 106. The isolated portion 102 can include a protected sensitive instrument such as an inertial sensor assembly (ISA). The isolator 106 comprises one or more components composed of an elastomer that are disposed between the isolated portion 102 and the non-isolated portion 104 and mechanically couple the isolated portion 102 to the non-isolated portion 104. The isolator 106 allows displacement (i.e., relative motion) between the isolated portion 102 and the non-isolated portion 104. The isolator 102 acts as a passive isolation system to absorb motion related energy from non-isolated portion 102 in order to reduce energy transfer from the non-isolated portion 104 to the isolated portion 102.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figures 1A-1C</figref>, the isolator 106 has a generally annular shape with the isolated portion 102 connected to the inner side of the annular shape and the non-isolated portion 104 connected to the outer side of the annular shape. In other examples, the positions of the isolated portion 102 and non-isolated portion 104 can be different (e.g., opposite) than shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figures 1A-1C</figref>. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figures 1A-1C</figref>, the isolated portion 102 comprises a generally disk shaped structure; however, in other examples, the isolated portion 102 and/or isolator 106 can have other shapes. For example, the isolator 106 can be rectangular or triangular.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figures 1A-1C</figref>, the isolator 106 is a monolithic structure having the desired features and shape (e.g., annular). In other examples, the isolator 106 is composed of multiple sections disposed between the isolated portion 102 and the non-isolated portion 104. The multiple sections can be disposed such that the multiple sections (e.g., discrete and discontinuous elements) collectively form the desired shape of the isolator (e.g., a generally annular shape).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figures 1A-1C</figref>, an inner ring 108 and an outer ring 110 are used to support the isolator 106 during assembly and to aid in mounting the isolator 106 to the isolated portion 102 and the non-isolated portion 104. The outer ring 110 is mounted to the non-isolated portion 104, and the inner ring 108 is mounted to the isolated portion 102. In an example, the inner ring 108 and outer ring 110 are composed of a metal. The system 100 can be constructed by mounting the isolated portion 102, inner ring 108, isolator 106, and outer ring 110 to the non-isolated portion 104. When the system 100 is constructed the rings 108, 110 are mechanically fixed to the isolated portion 102 and non-isolated portion 104 respectively. The rings 108, 110, therefore, displace with their respective portion 102, 104 and the elastomer of the isolator 106 couples the rings 108, 110 together.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As discussed herein, in examples including an inner and outer ring 108, 110 to hold the isolator 106, the inner ring 108 is considered part of the isolated portion 102 and the outer ring 110 is considered part of the non-isolated portion 104, since the inner ring 108 and outer ring 110 are mechanically fixed to the isolated portion 102 and the non-isolated portion 104 respectively when the system 100 is constructed. Thus, in examples including an inner ring 108 and an outer ring 110, the isolator 106 (or portions thereof) can be connected to the isolated portion 102 by being connected to the inner ring 108, and the isolator 106 (or portions thereof) can be connected to the non-isolated portion 104 by being connected to the outer ring 110. In other examples, the system 100 does not include an inner ring 108 and/or outer ring 110, and the elastomer of the isolator 106 is mounted to the isolated portion 102 and/or the non-isolated portion 104 without an inner ring 108 and/or outer ring 110.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The system 100 defines a sway space 107 which is a distance between the isolated portion 102 and the non-isolated portion 104 when no force is on the system 100. The length of the sway space 107 depends on the geometry of the isolated portion 102, non-isolated portion 104, and the isolator 106. The sway space 107 and<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> can have a different distance or the same distance in different locations and/or directions. In an example, a portion of the sway space 107 can be less than 0.25 inches across, although other distances are possible.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 2A</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0005">2B</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0006">2C</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0007">2D</figref> are further illustrations of the example isolator 106 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figures 1A-1C</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 2A</figref> is a perspective view, <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 2B</figref> is a magnified cut-away view, <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 2C</figref> is a cross-sectional view, and <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 2D</figref> is an exploded view of the isolator 106. In this example, the isolator 106 is mounted between the inner ring 108 and outer ring 110. The inner ring 108 is concentric and in plane with the outer ring 110.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The isolator 106 which is composed of an elastomeric material includes a main portion 202 and a plurality of secondary features 204. The main portion 202 is connected to both the non-isolated portion 104 and the isolated portion 102 and is the portion of the isolator 106 that mechanically couples the non-isolated portion 104 to the isolated portion 102. Although the main portion 202 is illustrated herein (i.e., in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 1B</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">2A-2D</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0009 f0010 f0011 f0012">5A-5D</figref>) as including a diagonally disposed portion connecting the isolated portion 102 to the non-isolated portion 104, other geometries and/or orientations can be used as known to those skilled in the art of isolator design.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The plurality of secondary features 204 are disposed on both the non-isolated portion 102 and the isolated portion 104 within the annular shape formed by the main portion 202. The features 204 can comprise protrusions composed of elastomer that extend from the isolated portion 102 and non-isolated portion 104. A secondary feature 204 is configured to engage with an opposing secondary feature 204 or an opposing surface to provide increased resistive force for further displacement. In an example, the features 204 have a shape and disposition that increasingly engages as the isolated portion 102 further displaces and increasingly increases the resistive force as the features 204 further engage. In this example the main portion 202 and the plurality of features 204 are portions of a monolithic elastomeric structure that is the isolator 106. The main portion 202 and the plurality of features 204 can be epoxied or molded onto the inner ring 108 and outer ring 110. In other examples, the main portion 202 and the plurality of features 204 can be mounted directly to the isolated portion 102 and the non-isolated portion 104.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">Figures 2A-2D</figref> the features 204 are disposed opposing one another such that they can engage during displacement of the isolated portion 102. That is, a feature 204 on the non-isolated portion 104 is disposed generally opposite a feature 204 on the isolated portion 102. Secondary features 204 that are configured to engage with one another (e.g., that disposed opposite one another) define a set of features 204. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">Figures 2A-2D</figref>, the isolator 106 can include multiple sets of features 204. In an example, the isolator 106 includes an odd number multiplied by two (e.g., 2, 6, 10, 14, 18) sets of opposing features. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figures 1A-1C</figref>, ten sets of opposing features are shown. This example includes two features 204 in each set; however, in other examples more than two features 204. The isolator 106 can also include individual secondary features 204. In an example, the annular shaped isolator 106 includes at least three sets of features. Different sets of features 204 can be disposed around the annular shape to attenuate energy in different directions. For example, the sets of features 204 can be generally evenly spaced around the annular shape to generally evenly dissipate energy in all directions parallel to the plane of the annular ring. Disposing the sets of features 204 around the annular shape can also aid in dissipating energy in other directions (e.g., at varying angles with respect to the annular shape).</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Additionally, in the example shown, the opposing features are offset from one another in a direction perpendicular to a plane of the annular shape formed by the isolator 106. Thus, the opposing features 204 will engage when the isolated portion 102 displaces in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the annular shape in combination with displacement of the isolated portion 102 towards the non-isolated portion 104 at the location of the opposing features 204. The opposing features 204, therefore, can provide secondary damping for movement in this perpendicular direction in addition to damping in directions within the plane of the annular shape. In this manner, the relative positions of the opposing features 204 can be selected to damp displacement in a desired direction.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The main portion 202 is configured to function as the main spring mass damper for the isolator 106. As the main spring mass damper, the main portion 202 provides spring and damper effects for the isolated portion 102 at all times, regardless of the position of the isolated portion 102 with respect to the non-isolated portion 104. Force applied to the system 100 can cause displacement between the isolated portion<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> 102 and the non-isolated portion 104. Absent any secondary features 204, if the displacement of the isolated portion 102 in any direction is equal to the sway space 107 in that direction, the isolated portion 102 will make contact with the non-isolated portion 104. Depending on the force of this contact, the isolated portion 102 could be damaged and/or the performance of devices (e.g., IMU or sensor) on the isolated portion 102 could be degraded. Accordingly, it is desirable to reduce or eliminate contact between the isolated portion 102 and the non-isolated portion 104.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Design of the isolator 106 involves a tradeoff between the vibration damping and displacement damping due to directional force (e.g., a shock). Vibration damping by the isolator 106 can be increased by designing the isolator 106 to have a more compliant spring constant. Displacement damping, however, can be increased by designing the isolator 106 to have a less compliant spring constant. Moreover, the spring mass damper effects provided by the main portion 202 can change during displacement of the isolated portion 102 with respect to the non-isolated portion 104, due to changes in the geometry of the main portion 202 as the isolated portion 102 displaces.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">With no or little directional force on the system 100, the plurality of features 204 are disengaged allowing the lower spring constant of the main portion 202 to damp or filter the vibrational energy. At a threshold distance of displacement of the isolated portion 102 with respect to the non-isolated portion 104, however, one or more of the plurality of features 204 begin engaging. Engagement of the plurality of features 204 increases the total spring constant of the isolator 106 and increases the amount of force required to continue displacement. The features 204, therefore, act like a secondary spring to the main portion 202 to attenuate a shock event faster than the main portion 202 alone. Thus, the isolator 106 can have good vibration damping and good displacement damping in the same design. In an example, the geometry of the plurality of features 204 is selected such that as the displacement of the isolated portion 102 increases, the plurality of features 204 engage further and the total spring constant of the isolator 102 increases as the plurality of features 204 engage further resulting in further force damping. That is, the amount of force required to continue displacement increases as the plurality of features 204 engage. In some examples, the geometry of the plurality of features 204 can be selected such that the amount of force exponentially increases as the plurality of features 204 further engage. Accordingly,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> during displacement of the isolator portion 102 that is smaller than required to engage the plurality of features 204, the spring mass damper of the isolator 106 is based on the main portion 202 without effects from the plurality of features 204. During displacement of the isolator portion 102 that is large enough to engage the plurality of features 204, the spring mass damper of the isolator 106 is based on the main portion 202 and the plurality of features 204. As used herein, a feature 204 begins to engage when the features 204 contacts an opposing surface, such as when the feature 204 contacts an opposing feature 204.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 3</figref> is a graph illustrating an example force-deflection response of the main portion 202 of the isolator 106 without effects from the plurality of features 204. As shown, once an initial magnitude of displacement occurs, the force required to continue displacement of the isolated portion 102 is about the same as displacement increases. <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 4</figref> is another graph illustrating an example response of the isolator 206 including the effects of both the main portion 202 and the plurality of features 204. In this example, the plurality of features 204 begin to engage at around 0.04 magnitude of displacement on the graph of <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 4</figref>. As shown, during displacement less than required to engage the plurality of features 204 (i.e., displacement less than 0.04 inches), the magnitude of force required to continue displacement beyond approximately 0.04 is about the same. Once the isolated portion 102 has displaced enough to engage the plurality of features 204 at 0.04 magnitude displacement, the engagement of the plurality of features 204 causes the amount of force required to continue displacement of the isolated portion 102 to increase. As shown, the plurality of features 204 cause the amount of force required to increase exponentially. This increase in the force required can reduce the likelihood that the isolated portion 102 will contact the non-isolated portion 104 during large amplitude shocks.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The design of the isolator 106 and the sway space 107 provides the isolation for the isolated portion 102. The sway space 107 can be selected to be of a particular distance so that in normal operation, the isolated portion 102 does not make rigid contact with the non-isolated portion 104. The sway space 107 and the varying spring constant of the isolator 106 can be selected such that the isolated portion 102 can displace relative to the non-isolated portion 104 under most environmental conditions, but reduce the likelihood that rigid contact will be made with the non-isolated portion 102 during some environmental conditions.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The distance of the sway space 107 is also selected small enough to minimize the differential velocity of the isolated portion 102 relative to the non-isolated portion 104 if an impact occurs. The physical geometry and material characteristics of the plurality of features 204 are selected such that as opposing features 204 engage, the effective dampening by the features 204 increases rapidly, such as exponentially, linearly, or parabolically, to quickly attenuate the force. The plurality of features 204 can be designed to compress during engagement in order to achieve the increase in the spring constant. Having a more effective dampening that increases rapidly allows the system 100 to be designed with limited sway space 107.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The material characteristics of the isolator 106 can be selected to achieve the desired shock and/or vibration attenuation and damping, Q, from the non-isolated portion 104. As mentioned above, the main portion 202 and the secondary features 204 can be composed of an elastomeric material, such as vulcanized rubber, resin, silicon, elastomer, polymer, plastic, styrofoam, metal, or memory foam that tends to absorb the impact energy, deform and attenuate the shock and/or vibration. In some examples, the secondary features 204 may be a relatively harder material with less elasticity (e.g. higher Young's modulus) than the main portion 202. In an example, the main portion 202 could be made of a phenyl-methyl vinyl silicone material and the features 204 made of another material having a higher Young's modulus (i.e. stiffer material), or they can both be made of the same material. It may be easier and more cost-effective to use one material. In some examples, the material for either the main portion 202 or the features 204 has a Young's modulus lower than 0.15 GPa. In some examples, the main portion 202 and/or secondary features 204 can be constructed of multiple materials.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As mentioned above, the geometry of the main portion 202 and the features 204 can also be selected. In an example, the diameter of the annular ring formed by the isolator 106 may be about 2 inches and its depth (perpendicular to the plane of the ring) less than about 0.2 inches. In an example, the inner and outer rings 108, 110 can have a thickness of less than about 0.07 inches. In an example, the sway space 107 can range from 0.010 inches to 0.250 inches. In an example, the features 204 can extend to a height from surrounding surfaces in the range of 0.02 to 0.07 inches. The thickness, depth, width, and geometry of the features 204 can vary depending on the distance of the sway space 107 at their location, and/or based on design objectives.

For example the geometry of one or more features 204 can vary in all 3-dimensions, such as in a pyramid or dome shaped, or can vary in 2-dimensions and be uniform in 1-dimension such as the rounded triangular shapes illustrated, triangular with a sharp corner. More complex geometries can also be used as discussed in more detail with respect to 6A-6G. Moreover, in some examples, different features 204 of an isolator 106 can have different geometries.

In this example, the secondary features 204 are disposed within these circumferential gaps 206. The main portion 202 can define multiple circumferential gaps 206, and the gaps 206 can be evenly spaced about the annular shape. Different sets of features 204 can be disposed in different gaps 206.

There are an inner ring feature 602 mounted to the portion of the system 100 connected to the inside of the isolator 106 (e.g., the isolated portion 102) and an outer ring feature 604 mounted to the portion of the system 100 connected to the outside of the isolator 106 (e.g., the non-isolated portion 104).</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The example outer ring feature 604 of <figref idrefs="f0013">Figure 6A</figref> is a triangular projection that is aligned with a trough-like region defined by the inner ring feature 602.

The trough-like region of the outer ring feature 604 is defined by two half-triangle portions on either side of the trough-like region. In an example, there are multiple (e.g., ten) such sets of features 602, 604 around the circumference of the isolator 106. As the features 602, 604 include projections outward from the isolated portion 102 and non-isolated portion 104 of the system 100, during displacement of the isolated portion 102 in the requisite direction, the features 602, 604 will come into contact before the rigid structure of the isolated portion 102 comes into contact with the rigid structure of the non-isolated portion 104. Thus, the sway space 107 is larger than the distance between the features 602, 604. The surfaces of the triangular and half-triangle projections in the features 602, 604 are smooth and have substantially no smaller bumps as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0013 f0014">Figs. 6D - 6F</figref>.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In an example, the inner ring features 602 are oriented such that the two half-triangle projections are apart from one another in a direction perpendicular to the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> plane of the annular ring formed by the isolator 106 in order to protect against motion in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the annular ring. Accordingly, the first projection can contact the projection of the outer ring feature 604 during motion occurring at an "upward" angle and the second projection can contact the projection of the outer ring feature 604 during motion occurring at a "downward" angle to damp different angled motions partially perpendicular to the plane of the annular ring of the isolator 106. In other embodiments, the inner ring features 602 and outer ring features 604 are oriented in different directions such as being spaced apart from one another in a circumferential direction with respect to the annular ring formed by the isolator 106.

The trough defined by the inner ring feature 602 is defined between and walled by two right triangles. The narrowest lateral distance X of the sway space 107 is located where the apex of each triangle is directly opposite a point on the other ring. One advantage of the configuration of <figref idrefs="f0013">Fig. 6A</figref> is that the distances between features 602, 604 are better defined because sharp edges and straight sections face opposite each other and there is little ambiguity as to where the shortest distances exist.

In an example, the trough<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> of the outer ring feature 604 is defined by a first projection that is located above a middle of the cross-section, and a second projection that is located below the middle of the cross-section. Accordingly, the first projection can contact the projection of the outer ring feature 604 during motion occurring at an "upward" angle and the second projection can contact the projection of the outer ring feature 604 during motion occurring at a "downward" angle to damp different angled motions partially perpendicular to the plane of the annular ring of the isolator 106.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Since the projection on the inner ring feature 602 and the trough of the outer ring feature 604 are rounded, the lateral distance is substantially the same across the cross-section when no force is on the system 100. <figref idrefs="f0013">Figure 6C</figref> is generally similar to <figref idrefs="f0013">Figure 6B</figref>, but there is a nub 606 at the "bottom" of the trough in the inner ring feature 602.

The first point of contact between the inner ring feature 602 and the outer ring feature 604 is likely to be at the apex of the nub 606. The nub 606 increases the rapidity with which the damping and attenuation engages. Having a nub 606 also provides an easy way to determine the narrowest lateral distance between the features 602, 604.

The rapidity of increasing force can depend on the material; if the elastomeric material of the isolator 106 is stiffer, then the curve in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 4</figref> would be steeper.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Stated in somewhat different terms, regardless of a particular embodiment, when a high performance isolation system, designed to protect in six-degrees of freedom, is used to attenuate energy that could normally reach sensitive devices, there is a relative displacement between the non-isolated 104 and isolated portions 102 of the system 100. The amount and type of displacement experienced by the isolated portion 102 depend on the nature of the shock event to which the device is exposed. The protection afforded by the isolation system depends on the material and structure that are characterized by a natural frequency and transmissibility. Where the isolation system can be characterized by an elastomer-based spring mass damper, the amount of displacement has a direct effect on the natural frequency of the isolation system. When the elastomer is deflected, the spring constant of the elastomer is effectively<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> reduced due to the elastomer cross-sectional area decreasing due to impact as well as due to the reduction in its elastomer Young's modulus that is dynamic and exhibits a non-linear behavior. When the spring constant (k) decreases and the mass (M) is maintained, the natural frequency (Fo) of the system decreases (Fo = (1/(2*pi) x squareroot (k/M)). As the natural frequency is reduced, the amount of delta displacement increases due to a less stiff system that is characterized by a lower k. By implementing a design according to the various embodiments disclosed herein, the secondary features 204 engage and add, effectively, a secondary spring to the system. And at some determined amount of displacement, controlled by geometry, the secondary features will engage. These secondary features 204 can be designed to reduce the disturbance at engagement and to effectively increase or maintain the natural frequency of the system as the displacement increases. In an example, the increase provided by the secondary features 204 occurs at a greater rate of change than the main spring's natural frequency is decreasing. In this example, as displacement continues, the overall, net system frequency is still one of increase; thus, an isolation system with this combination of carefully designed primary and secondary springs may require less sway space 107 for a given shock event.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051"><figref idrefs="f0017">Figure 9</figref> is a flowchart illustrating one exemplary method 900 of manufacturing and assembling the embodiments. In practice, the exact method of manufacture depends on the existing system. In an example, an injection molding process is used to manufacture the embodiments. At block 910, the designed geometry of isolator 106 with its main portion 202 and secondary features 204 is molded to form a mold (cast) design. The molds can be metallic such as made of hardened steel. A high tonnage injection press can close the mold that has cavities with the geometry of the desired isolator. At block 920, a liquid form of the elastomeric material is injected into the mold cavities. Once the cavities are filled, at block 930, a high tonnage holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage or to squeeze out excess material. At block 940, once the elastomeric material is sufficiently cool, the mold opens and the solid elastomeric material of the isolator 106 is ejected. Alternatively, if the isolator material is rubbery enough, the elastomeric material could be pulled out of the mold. At block 950, the solid elastomeric material is attached to the surface of the isolated portion 102 and the non-isolated portion 104. Epoxy or other fastening mechanisms hold the elastomer<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> material to the isolated portion 102 and non-isolated portion 104. In examples where the isolator is composed of multiple pieces of elastomer, the multiple pieces can be molded at the same or different times. If molded at different times, the multiple pieces can be individually molded and then arranged to form the annular shape. If molded at the same time, the multiple pieces can be molded as a single piece with thin sections of elastomer connecting different pieces. After molding, the thin sections of elastomer can be removed before or after attaching the elastomer to the rings 108, 110 or isolated and non-isolated portions 102, 104. With respect to the mechanical attachments, an inside of the annular ring formed by the isolator 106 is mounted to the isolated portion 102 and an outside of the annular ring formed by the isolator 106 is mounted to the non-isolated portion 104. The method of mounting depends on a variety of factors such as the environmental conditions to which these objects are subjected, and the texture, curvature or shape. Epoxy, other types of adhesives, clips, fasteners, straps, screws, and nails are some example ways to mount the isolator 106 to its respective structures. For example, the elastomeric material can galvanize or bond to the surfaces (e.g., metal) of the rings 108, 110 or isolated portion 102 and non-isolated portion 104.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In examples where the elastomeric material is mounted between rings 108, 110, the rings 108, 110 can be fabricated or otherwise provided to act as a holder for the elastomeric material. After molding, the elastomeric material can be placed between the rings 108, 110. The inside of the inner ring 108 can be mounted around the isolated portion 102 by, for example, welding, screwing, clamping, gluing or other means of fastening to a desired location. Likewise, the outside of the outer ring 110 can be mounted to the non-isolated portion 104.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">There are many advantages of the various embodiments described above. They are cost-effective devices because material such as elastomer are fairly inexpensive. There are some tooling costs to form the molds and casts to manufacture the rings 108, 110, main portion 202, and secondary features 204, but these casts can be re-used many times. Assembling the product is also fairly low cost because assembly can be done in normal environmental conditions at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Given the relatively low manufacturing and production costs, it should be possible to also apply the embodiments to applications other than protecting inertial sensor systems. The structures should also work for protecting precision<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> semiconductor manufacturing equipment, oil and gas drilling equipment, automobile parts, train parts, agricultural machinery, industrial machinery, high-end electronics, certain artillery equipment, medical instruments, and so on. The embodiments should be particularly effective near industrial or drill sites, airports and train stations, in earthquake prone environments, and anywhere where the ground rattles or where the environment entails vibrations or sharp movements. The embodiments allow an isolation system to be designed to operate where there is limited sway space 107 that would normally be overcome by a high force event and cause performance degradation and/or hardware damage.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The orientation and directions stated and illustrated in this application should not be taken as limiting. For example, the directions, e.g. "top," are merely illustrative and do not orient the embodiments absolutely. That is, a structure formed on its "side" or "bottom" is merely an arbitrary orientation in space that has no absolute direction. Also, in actual usage, a packaged and isolated object may well be turned on its "side" because, for example, aircrafts and vehicles travel and turn in all directions. Thus, the stated directions in this application are arbitrary designations.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described above, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that any arrangement, which is calculated to achieve a same purpose, may be substituted for the specific embodiments shown.
