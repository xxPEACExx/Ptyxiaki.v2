Correspondingly, the so-called longitudinal method is also known, in which the sawn pieces pass the imaging apparatus in their longitudinal direction, in which case the apparatus images the sawn pieces at one time over their entire width. In the longitudinal method, the transportation of sawn timber through the apparatus takes longer however, as pieces of sawn timber are typically considerably longer than they are wide.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the apparatus described in publication <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO0062011A1"><text>WO 00/62011 A1</text></patcit>, the object being measured is examined in transverse measurement in a single measurement station using the same illumination arrangement, by means of colour-line cameras from three different directions, preferably using colour-line cameras.

The measurement conveyor 2 is, for its part, typically a belt conveyor.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The system of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> also comprises a measurement station 4, which in turn comprises cameras 5 and mirrors 6, the positioning of which defines the measurement station's 4 measurement area 7, within which measurement area 7 the pieces of sawn timber 3 can be imaged.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the system of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is viewed from the side, i.e. from the direction of the end of a piece of sawn timber 3 in the measuring area 7. The figure shows from the side direction the elements shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. In addition, the figure shows the lights 8, for illuminating the sawn timber 3, which belong to the measuring station 4. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the lights 8 illuminate the piece of sawn timber 3 from two different directions.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> shows the creation of an image in the measuring station 4 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> shows the matrix-camera element 9, the lens 10, and the surface 11 of the object being imaged (the top surface or bottom surface of the piece of sawn timber 3), as well as the image 12 of the object being imaged on a CCD or CMOS matrix of the matrix-camera element 9.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> shows one possible variation of the arrangement of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>. Common to both arrangements is that the cameras 5 image the piece of sawn timber 3 from directly between the mirrors 6 and, in addition, as two mirror images through the mirrors 6. The arrangements differ from each other in that, in the device of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the mirror images are reflected from between the mirrors 6, and, in the device of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>, from the opposite sides of the mirrors 6. In the device of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the imaging areas formed by the direct imaging and the mirror images can partly overlap, the measurement area 7 being thus more compact. In the device of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> on the other hand, the direct imaging area and the mirror images are located at a distance from each other, so that the measurement area 7 is spread over a wider area.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Seen on the plane of the cross-sections of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>, the cameras 5 image the piece of sawn timber 3 at essentially right angles. A possible variation is one in which the cameras 5 image the timber 3 being examined in the plane of the cross-sections of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref> at other than essentially right angles, i.e. the cameras' imaging direction is deviated by tilting and moving the cameras towards the arrival or departure directions of the pieces of sawn timber.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">One further possible variation to all of the embodiments described above is one in which only one mirror 6 or line of mirrors is used instead of two mirrors 6 or lines of mirrors.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Generally, sawn goods are imaged with the intention of automatically grading their quality and optimizing the pieces of sawn timber. By means of imaging, it is wished to determine, for example, each piece's width, thickness, length, and the width and depth of any waney edges. In addition, knots, resin pockets, splits, rot, bluing, and other factors affecting the quality and value of a sawn piece can be imaged from the faces and edges.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the embodiments of the figures, the pieces of sawn timber 3 are transported on a main conveyor 1, i.e. a transverse scraper conveyor, which pushes the pieces forwards with the aid of chains and slats attached to them. The belts of the measurement conveyor 2 pull the pieces 3 off the slats of the main conveyor 1, so that their edges can be imaged unobstructedly. Nowadays, a typical speed is 100 - 200 pieces per minute. The traditional way is to image the pieces at two measuring stations and rotate the pieces of sawn timber mechanically between the stations. Using a three-direction measuring station, both sides and the end face of a piece can be imaged.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the arrangement according to the embodiments, the pieces of sawn timber are imaged in three directions in a measuring station 4, using a single matrix camera, in such a way that the measuring areas 7 cover directly the upper surface of the piece and, with the aid of mirrors 6, both of its sides. The imaging matrices 9 of the camera can be, for example, CCD or CMOS or corresponding types.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">With the aid of the embodiments described above a system can be implemented for the imaging of pieces of sawn timber 3 travelling transversely past the system, in which each piece 3 comprises a top surface and a bottom surface, as well as sides that connect them, the system being arranged to image the top surface and at least one side as the piece 3 travels past the measuring area 7 of the system.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In one embodiment, the system comprises at least one matrix camera 5, which is positioned in a first position relative to the path of the pieces of sawn timber 3, for imaging a piece of sawn timber 3. In addition, the system comprises at least one mirror<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> 6, which is positioned in a second position relative to the path of the pieces 3 and the said first position. According to the embodiment, the first and second positions are selected in such a way that each piece of sawn timber 3 passing transversely can be imaged using the said at least one matrix camera 5 directly from a first direction and through the said at least one mirror 6 as a mirror image from at least one second direction, which is a different direction to the first direction.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to one embodiment, the said at least one matrix camera 5 comprises two, three, or more matrix cameras 5, which are located in a transverse row. In this case, the transverse direction refers to the direction transverse to the direction of travel of the pieces of sawn timber, i.e. the longitudinal direction of the row is essentially parallel to the longitudinal direction of the pieces 3 being imaged.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">According to one embodiment, the said at least one mirror 6 comprises two, three, or more mirrors, which are located in a transverse-direction row. In this case, the transverse direction refers to a direction corresponding to that described in the previous paragraph.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">According to an embodiment, the mirrors 6 are placed out of the path of travel of the pieces of sawn timber, as is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. For example, the mirrors 6 are located above a level of the main conveyor 1 and also above the measurement conveyor 2 at a first height that is more than a designed greatest thickness of the pieces of sawn timber 3. At the same time, the height is also greater than the height of the slats 1. The first height is measured up to the lowest edge or part of the mirrors 6. The purpose of this design is to allow the pieces of sawn timber 3 to transversely pass the measuring station 4 without any obstruction by the mirrors 6.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">According to an embodiment, the mirrors 6 are conventional mirrors including a reflecting metal surface and the path of light from the pieces of sawn timber 3 to the at least one matrix camera 5 comprises substantially one single reflection.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">According to one embodiment, the system comprises at least one second mirror 6, which is positioned in a third position relative to the path of the pieces of sawn timber 3 and to the said first position. The third position is selected in such a way that each piece of sawn wood 3 travelling transversely past can be imaged using at least one matrix<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> camera 5 through the said at least one second mirror 6, as a second mirror image from at least one third direction, which is a different direction to the first direction and the second directions.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">According to one embodiment, the said at least one second mirror 6 comprises two, three, or more second mirrors 6, which are located in a transverse row in a corresponding manner to the first mirrors, but situated in a different location.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">According to one embodiment, the first direction is substantially perpendicular to the direction of travel of the pieces of sawn timber and to at least a portion of the top surface of the piece 3, when the piece is in the measuring area of a respective at least one matrix camera 5. Positioning of this kind is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">According to a second embodiment, the first direction is tilted towards the direction of approach or departure of the piece of sawn timber 3 from the direction which is substantially perpendicular to the direction of travel of the piece and at least a portion of the top surface of the piece 3, when the piece is in the measuring area 7 of the corresponding at least one matrix camera 5.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">According to one embodiment, the second direction is tilted at an angle, relative to the first direction, facing the direction of approach or departure of the sawn piece 3.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">According to one embodiment, the said at least one matrix camera 5 comprises two, three, or more matrix cameras 5, which are situated in a first transverse row, and correspondingly the said at least one mirror 6 also comprises two, three, or more mirrors 6, which are situated in a second transverse row. In addition, the system comprises second two, three, or more mirrors 6, which are situated in a third transverse row, and the first, second, and third rows are positioned in such a way that the measuring area 7 is situated substantially between the second and third rows, seen from the direction of the first row. One such embodiment is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">According to one embodiment, the system comprises lights 8, which are arranged to illuminate a sawn piece 3 in the measuring area 7.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">According to one embodiment, the lights 8 are positioned in a single row of lights, which illuminates the sawn piece 3 from one direction. Such an embodiment is suitable<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> for use, for example, when the measuring station 4 comprises a single row of mirrors. Of course, in that case the entire system preferably comprises two measuring stations 4, between which the sawn piece 3 is rotated. I.e., in the system's two measuring stations, the upper face and one side are measured in both stations (the sawn piece being rotated between the measuring stations).
