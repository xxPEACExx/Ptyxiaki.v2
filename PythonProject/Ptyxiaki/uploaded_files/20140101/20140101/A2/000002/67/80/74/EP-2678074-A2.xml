for providing asymmetric irradiation. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">BACKGROUND </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> [0003] The current standard of care for women with early stage breast cancer is breast conserving surgery followed by radiation therapy to the tumor bed. Lumpectomy, or tylectomy, is the surgical removal of a localized tumor from a patient with invasive breast cancer. Historically, radiation treatment has involved external beam radiation delivered to the whole breast, 5 days a week for 5 weeks or more. This time intensive course of therapy has led to poor compliance rates and some 15-30% of women do not start or complete radiation therapy. Further, damage to the heart, lungs, ribs and contralateral breast are all potential consequences of whole breast irradiation. Acute skin toxicity is also a common and uncomfortable side effect of external beam therapy. See Pignol JP, Olivoto I, Rakovitch E, et al. "A multicenter randomized trial of breast intensity -modulated radiation therapy to reduce acute radiation dermatitis." J Clin Oncol vol. 26, pp. 2085-2092 2008. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">[0004] To speed radiation treatment delivery and avoid some radiation side effects, high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy techniques have been developed as adjuvant therapy after breast conserving surgery. HDR brachytherapy techniques for breast treatment involve 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 the temporary placement of catheters or balloons into the breast at the site of the lumpectomy. The catheters or balloons provide an enclosure for a highly radioactive substance, such as 192-Iridium. The radioactivity is typically placed inside the enclosures for one hour twice a day for five days. The enclosures remain in the breast over this period. The enclosures can be intercavity devices such as the Mamosite (Hologic, Bedford, MASS) or the SAVI </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Applicator (Cianna, Inc., Aliso Viejo, CA), or they can be interstitial devices custom built using standard brachytherapy catheters. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> [0005] HDR brachytherapy is only appropriate for lumpectomy sites sufficiently deep in the breast so that the skin is spared the intense radiation dose delivered by the HDR source. In addition, because the catheters or balloons remain in the patient for five days and are frequently exposed to the environment outside of the patient for HDR source delivery, there is a non-negligible risk of infection from using the HDR technique. To reduce patient inconvenience and overcome these limitations, Pignol et al. developed a low-dose rate brachytherapy technique that involves the permanent implantation of radioactive 103- Palladium seeds in the breast tissue near the lumpectomy cavity.

Rad. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Oncology*Biology*Physics, Vol. 73, pp. 1482-1488, April 2009. With this technique, the palladium seeds are implanted in a one hour procedure and permanently remain in the patient. The breast tissue is treated continuously over the lifetime of the radioactive palladium. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">However, the seeds generally irradiate tissue in all directions around the seeds such that some healthy tissue is also irradiated. Moreover, the seeds remain in the patient even after the palladium is no longer radioactive, and may complicate further imaging of the tissue. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Moreover, patients may not wish to have a permanently implanted device. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015">SUMMARY </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> [0006] According to some embodiments of the present invention, a brachytherapy device includes a sealed housing having a radioactive material therein, and at least one shielding member extending away from the housing and configured to provide radiation shielding on at least one side of the housing.

The at least one shielding member may include at least two shielding members extending in generally opposite directions in the open position. The housing and/or the at least one shielding member in the closed position may have an asymmetrical cross-section indicating a direction of irradiation. The housing may have a triangular cross-section, and the triangular cross-section may define a shielded side of the housing having a shielding layer and two irradiation sides configured to emit radiation from the radioactive material, wherein the two shielding members are attached to opposite ends of the shielding side of the triangular cross-sectional housing. The housing may be configured for implantation via an implantation needle, and the implantation needle may have a corresponding cross-sectional shape that is configured to indicate an implantation direction. In some embodiments, one or more markers are positioned on the implantation needle to indicate an implantation direction. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019"> [0009] In some embodiments, the housing comprises a bioabsorbable material. The radioactive material may have an initial radiation activity and the bioabsorbable material may be configured to seal the radioactive material therein for a sealed source time period and to thereafter exhibit sufficient bioabsorption so as to release the radioactive material into the body. The sealed source time period may be at least as long as a duration during which the radioactive material decays to less than about 10% of the initial radiation activity. </p><p id="p0020" num="0020">[0010] In some embodiments, the device includes an imaging marker in the housing.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The imaging marker is selected from the group consisting of a gas in an amount sufficient to be detected in an ultrasound image, a ferromagnetic marker in an amount sufficient to be seen on a magnetic resonance image, and a soluble, high density salt in an amount sufficient to be detected on an x-ray image.

In some embodiments, the globules can be spaced apart by about 500-1000 μιη. </p><p id="p0045" num="0045"> [0030] As shown in Figure 1 , a brachytherapy device 10 according to embodiments of the present invention includes a sealed housing or casing 12 and a radioactive material 14. The radioactive material 14 may be a non-soluble radioactive material. The sealed casing 12 may be a biocompatible and/or bioabsorbable material. According to some embodiments, the type of bioabsorbable material in the casing 12 may be evaluated to ensure that the radioactive material 14 is sealed for a sufficient period of time, such as until the radioactive material 14 decays to a safe level, such as less than 10%, less than 5% or even less than 1% of the original radioactivity. </p><p id="p0046" num="0046"> [0031] Methods and devices for forming non-soluble radioactive materials are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application No. 12/434,131 , filed May 1 , 2009 and published as U.S. Publication No. 2009/0275793 on November 5, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </p><p id="p0047" num="0047"> [0032] Any suitable bioabsorbable or biodegradable material may be used, such as copolymers and homopolymers of glycolic acid (GA) and L-lactic acid (LA) or combinations thereof, including copolymers having a blend of these two base materials (e.g. , Vicyrl (Polyglactin 910), for instance, is formed with a 90: 10 GA-to-LA blend). Another example is a mixture of 18:82 GA-to-LA blend to achieve longer-term stability in the body.

As illustrated in Figure 3, a planar device 30 includes a radioactive material 32 in a planar sealed casing 34. The sealed casing 34 may include two planar members 34A and 34B with the radioactive material 32 positioned there between. </p><p id="p0049" num="0049"> [0034] In some embodiments, one of the planar member 34A and 34B in Figure 3 includes a radiation shielding material, such as gold. The radiation shielding material may be dispersed throughout one of the planar member 34A and 34B or it may be concentrated or deposited adjacent the radioactive material 32. The radiation shielding material may be useful in applications in which radiation is desired on only one side of the device 30. For example, the device 30 may implanted adjacent a tumor or tumor excision site or other tissue that is identified to be irradiated such as the lung so that one side emits radiation from the radioactive material 32 in a direction toward the tissue that is identified for irradiation and the other side of the device 30 is shielded to protect healthy adjacent tissue. </p><p id="p0050" num="0050">[0035] Further embodiments are shown in Figure 5A-5G. As shown in Figure 5 A, a substrate 200 includes a plurality of microwells 202. A deposition device 250A, such as a micropipette or micro syringe, deposits a radioactive material 204 in the form of a solution in the micro well 202. The volume of the solution of radioactive material 204 can be calculated to match the desired amount of radioactivity in the well 202. </p><p id="p0051" num="0051"> [0036] The solution of the radioactive material 204 may be converted into a non- soluble form, for example, by a plasma decomposition process, a chemical decomposition process, and/or a thermal decomposition process as described in U.S. Patent Application No. 12/434,131, filed May 1, 2009. For example, as shown in Figure 5B, a chemical precipitation solution 206 is deposited in the well on the radioactive material 204 by a deposition device 250B, such as an ink jet deposition device. If the solution of the radioactive material 204 is tetraamine palladium chloride in ammonium hydroxide or palladium chloride in hydrochloric acid, the precipitation solution 206 may be a mixture of sodium borohydride and sodium hydroxide in sufficient amounts for a reaction to occur to precipitate out the palladium metal, which is then insoluble. The solution 206 and any remaining amounts of the solution containing the radioactive material 204 may be allowed to dry.

 [0037] Although the formation of the non-soluble radioactive material 204 is described in Figure 5B, with respect to the precipitation solution 206, it should be understood that the precipitation solution 206 may be omitted and other techniques may be used to form the non-soluble radioactive material 204. For example, the soluble form of the radioactive material 204 may be a salt of Pd-103, such as tetraamine palladium chloride, which may be dried and then exposed to a plasma treatment (e.g., hydrogen or oxygen plasma) and/or the salt solution may be thermally treated to form non-soluble palladium metal. As described in U.S. Patent Application No. 12/434,131 , filed May 1 , 2009, a plasma treatment may be performed at a pressure of 75-100 mTorr with a power setting of 230 Watts for 2-5 minutes, such as for about 3 minutes. In some embodiments, the radioactive salt solution can be thermally converted to a water-insoluble form at relatively low temperatures. For example, when Pd(NH<sub>3</sub>) Cl<sub>2</sub> solution dries thoroughly it forms Pd(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> , which can be thermally decomposed at about 290°C leaving palladium metal. This processing temperature is consistent with certain polymers, such as silicone, and thus presents a format whereby a polymer can be used as the substrate for the conversion of Pd salt into water insoluble Pd metal. </p><p id="p0052" num="0052"> [0038] In Figure 5C-5D, the wells 202 are filled with a sealant 208, such as medical grade epoxy or resin. Bioabsorbable epoxies, resins or sealants may be used, such as is discussed in U.S. Patent No. 7,241 ,846, the disclosure of which is herby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The sealant 208 may then be cured, for example, by thermal or UV curing based on the type of sealant used. The radioactive material 204 is in a water insoluble state and sealed by the sealant 208 to reduce or prevent leakage into the body. As shown in Figures 5E-5G, the substrate 200 can also be inserted into a sheath 214 to further reduce the risk of radiation leakage. </p><p id="p0053" num="0053"> [0039] As illustrated in Figures 5E-5G, the substrate 200 may be inserted into a tube</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">214.

For example, one of the wells 202 may be a void having a gas therein (e.g. , air) that is in an amount sufficient to be detected in an ultrasound image. As another example, very small amounts of ferromagnetic metal may be added to one or more of the wells 202 so that an MRI visibility is enhanced without creating visibility in CT or mammography scans. As yet another example, one or more of the wells may be filled with a soluble, high density salt, such as potassium iodide, that may be visible on x-rays, but also dissolve in bodily fluids when an encapsulating bioabsorbable polymer has broken down. </p><p id="p0058" num="0058"> [0043] Although embodiments according to the invention are illustrated with respect to a tubular enlongated body as illustrated in Figures 2, 5E and 7A-7C, it should be understood that the device could have any suitable non-linear shape.

 sectional device 300 is shown. The device 300 includes a housing or sealed casing 312 and a radioactive material 314. The radioactive material 314 may be deposited as spaced-apart globules along the length of the device 300 as discussed above or the radioactive material 314 may be deposited in a continuous layer. In addition, shielding members or wings 316 may be attached at one end of the sealed casing 312 to provide additional radioactive shielding and to indicate an irradiation direction to a medical professional during an implantation procedure. As illustrated, the wings 316 include a radiation shielding layer 320 that extends along one of the sides 318 of the device. As shown, the shielding layer 320 is a layer on a bottom side of the wings 316 and the side 318; however, it should be understood that a shielding material may be embedded in the device or otherwise attached to the device 300 to provide a radioactive shield that extends generally across one side of the device for controlling a direction of irradiation. Accordingly, asymmetrical irradiation may be provided so that irradiation is increased in some regions around the device 300 (i. e. , the direction of arrow R) and reduced in other directions. </p><p id="p0061" num="0061"> [0046] Accordingly, the wings 312 and (optionally) a side 318 of the casing 312 adjacent the wings 316 may include a radiation shielding material, such as the layer 320 so that, when the device 300 is implanted, the wings 316 extend to provide additional radiation shielding as shown in Figure 8. The radiation shielding material may be a gold layer or other shielding material embedded in the side 318 and in the wings 316 or deposited on the outside of the side 318 and wings 316. Radiation from the radioactive material 314 is emitted in the direction indicated by the arrow R. When the device 300 is inserted in tube, such as a needle, for implantation, the wings 316 may be folded against the sides of the sealed casing 3 12 as shown in Figure 9. The wings 316 may be formed of a flexible material, such as a flexible polymer, or have a flexible joint portion adjacent the sealed casing 312 to facilitate movement between the open position (after implantation) shown in Figure 8, and the closed position (when the device 300 is inserted into an implantation tube) as shown in Figure 9. </p><p id="p0062" num="0062">[0047] In this configuration, the wings 316 provide a visual indication to the medical professional that the radiation is emitted in the direction of arrow R based on the shape of the device 300. Therefore, the medical professional who is implanting the device 300 may orient the device 300 according to a treatment protocol so that the direction of the arrow R faces the tumor or other region identified for irradiation when the wings 316 are folded against the

 casing 312 for implantation, After implantation, the proper orientation of the device 300 may be verified, e.g., by medical imaging, to determine if the direction of the arrow R is properly facing the region of tissue in which irradiation is desired. Radiographic markers may also be used that may have an asymmetric shape that indicates the direction of the arrow R. For example, the radiographic markers may be cones or pyramids. An array of markers of different sizes located along a line parallel to the arrow R may be used to indicate the direction of the arrow. Markers in the wings 316 and the casing 312 that indicate the direction of the arrow R may also be used. Thus, it should be understood that other cross-sectional shapes and marker placements may be used to indicate the direction of irradiation and/or the orientation of a shielding member with or without using wings. In some embodiments, any asymmetrical cross-sectional shape may be used to visually indicate the direction of irradiation and/or the orientation of a shielding member. Medical imaging markers, including those described herein, may also be used to indicate a direction of irradiation after implantation, for example, by creating a visual indication on a medical image, such as a CT scan, an MRI, or an ultrasound image. </p><p id="p0063" num="0063"> [0048] In this configuration, the wings 316 may also serve as anchoring devices to stabilize the device 300 in the patient and reduce or prevent subsequent rotation or motion within the patient's body. </p><p id="p0064" num="0064"> [0049] As illustrated in Figure 10, the device 300 may be implanted using an implantation needle 400 and plunger 500. The needle 400 includes a handle 410 and a needle body 420 having an aperture 430 therethrough. The needle body 420 has a cross-section that is asymmetric with respect to at least one axis. As illustrated, the cross-sectional shape of the needle body 420 is also indicated by the shape of the handle 410 so that the handle 410 indicates a general direction of irradiation to the medical professional. As illustrated, the needle body 420 forms an isosceles triangle with sides 440 of one length and a side 442 of a different length. In this configuration, the device 300 has a corresponding isosceles triangle- shaped cross section that cooperates with the aperture 430 in one orientation. Accordingly, the needle body 420 may be used to define the implantation orientation such that the direction or irradiation (arrow R in Figure 8) is readily apparent to the medical professional who is implanting the device 300. The device 300 is positioned in the aperture 430, and the needle body 420 is inserted into the body tissue, and the plunger 500 is used to hold the device 300

The plunger 500 may have a corresponding cross-sectional shape and/or the handle 410 may be labeled and/or have a shape that indicates which direction corresponds to the radioactive side of the device 300 after implantation. Labels and other indicia such as colors may be used to indicate the radioactive side of the device 300, the needle 400, the handle 410 and/or the plunger 500 during implantation. </p><p id="p0065" num="0065">[0050] The needle 400 may be inserted into the patient tissue based on a treatment protocol designed to deliver a given amount of radiation to identified regions of tissue. For example, a plurality of elongated devices 300 may be implanted using a plurality of corresponding needles 400. The needles 400 may be inserted via a standard template, which typically uses round apertures, or a customized template may be used in which the apertures have a size and shape that accepts the needles 400 based on the particular treatment protocol and radiation direction to provide a desired three-dimensional radiation dose. </p><p id="p0066" num="0066">[0051] Wearable radiation shielding may also be provided in particular embodiments of the present invention to reduce radiation exposure to others. For example, an adhesive may be used to adhere a shielding material to the patient's skin in a region adjacent the implanted brachytherapy device. Radiation shielding may be incorporated into clothing or other wearable items, such as items formed from a flexible material. For example, in the case of breast cancer, the patient could wear a bra that is infused with gold or other high density shielding material. </p><p id="p0067" num="0067"> [0052] In some embodiments, some elements or the entire resulting device 300 may be formed of bioabsorbable material, including but not limited to the substrate 312, the wings 316 and the shielding 320.

In addition, such a device may increase the number of patients eligible for LDR brachytherapy for the breast by reducing the anatomical </p><p id="p0071" num="0071">requirements for this form of treatment.

A generally unidirectional source may significantly limit the potential for unnecessary exposure to healthy organs or tissues. The availability of a unidirectional, patient specific device may increase the number of patients amenable to the limited surgical approach and decrease the risks associated with the brachytherapy treatment.
