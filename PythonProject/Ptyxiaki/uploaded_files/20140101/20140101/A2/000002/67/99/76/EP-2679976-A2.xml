In particular, the temperature compensation system relates to detecting leakage in the cooling system.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">A closed-loop liquid aircraft cooling system includes a motor-driven pump that circulates coolant through a cooling loop. Some desired coolants may have a density that varies with temperature. As liquid temperatures change throughout the system, the system volume will also change. Typically, the cooling loop includes a reservoir to accommodate thermal expansion and contraction of the coolant, among other things. The volume change is detected by a level sensor within the system reservoir.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">In one example embodiment, a cooling system includes a cooling loop that includes a reservoir. The reservoir has a level sensor that is configured to provide a level signal indicative of a coolant level within the reservoir.

<ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a schematic view of an example cooling system having temperature compensation.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is a graph depicting a coolant having a temperature-variable density.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 3</figref> is a flowchart depicting a temperature compensation method.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0004"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> schematically depicts a cooling system, for example, an aircraft refrigeration system 10. The system 10 includes a cooling loop 12 having a reservoir 14 with an amount of coolant. In one example, the coolant is a propylene glycol, such as DOWFROST 60.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A pump 18 circulates the coolant within the coolant loop 12. The coolant flows to first and second heat loads 22, 24, which may correspond to power electronic cooling plates or aircraft galley chillers, for example. The first and second heat loads 22, 24 reject heat to the coolant in the cooling loop 12. The hot coolant flows to a heat exchanger 26, which may be arranged in a ram air duct. The heat exchanger 26 rejects heat from the coolant to the surrounding environment. The cooled coolant is returned to the reservoir 14. A temperature control valve 28 may be provided in the coolant loop 12 to selectively permit coolant to bypass the heat exchanger 26 and maintain the coolant at a higher or lower temperature, if desired. It should be understood that the above cooling loop arrangement is exemplary. There may be more or fewer components than described or the components may be arranged differently.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The reservoir 14 may include a level sensor 30 configured to provide a level signal indicative of a volume of coolant 16 within the reservoir 14. The volume of the coolant 16 may vary based upon the temperature. Thus, although the cooling system 10 may be without leaks, the fluctuating level signal may give the impression that the volume or mass within the cooling system 10 has changed.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">An accurate calculation of the amount of fluid, either volume or mass, within the system is needed in order to ensure that the system has enough fluid to operate<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> throughout its full operating envelope (temperature, leak allocation, etc.). This function supports system maintenance. Additionally, it is important to be able to identify if a slow leak exists within the closed-loop system. An accurate calculation of the amount of fluid mass within the system is needed to differentiate whether a decrease in system volume is due to normal thermal contraction or a slow fluid leakage.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is desirable to accurately determine the amount of coolant within the cooling system 10 for any given operating condition. To this end, a controller 36 communicates with the level sensor 30 and first and second temperature sensors 32, 34. It should be understood that any number of temperature sensors may be used.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In order to ensure that a closed-loop liquid system has sufficient fluid to operate throughout its operating envelope and is able to detect very slow leaks, for example, one drop per second, a temperature compensated liquid level algorithm 38 is provided. The algorithm 38 determines the threshold for detecting slow leaks to prevent nuisance leak detection. Therefore, the more accurate algorithm yields improved capability for slow leak detection. The accuracy of the algorithm 38 is a function of temperature sensor accuracy, level sensor accuracy, temperature sensor location, and temperature variability within the system.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The controller 36 includes the algorithm 38, which receives density data 40. The algorithm 38 corrects the level signal based upon one or more temperature signals from the temperature sensors 32, 34 and provides a leakage detection 42. The corrected level signal adjusts for the changing volume of coolant in the system due to varying temperatures. In one example, the corrected level signal corresponds to the mass of coolant in the system.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The temperature sensors 32, 34 are placed in the system 10 for increased accuracy. In designing the system 10, coolant volume is calculated between system heating and cooling nodes in order to calculate mass as a function of liquid temperature (note: density is a function of temperature) separately for each volume segment. The cooling loop 12 may be analyzed in terms of segments, each segment exposed to a different temperature differential that affects the density of the coolant. In the example in illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the cooling loop 12 includes first, second, third, fourth, fifth segments 46-54 separated by heating nodes 18, 22, and 24 and cooling node 26. It may be desirable to place the temperature sensors 32, 34 along segments that experiences the most amount of temperature differential throughout a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> given operating condition, for example, compared to at least half of the segments. In one example, the first and third segments 44, 48 may be desirable locations for the temperature sensors 32, 34.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Worst-case accuracy of the algorithm 38 is determined by comparing the use of the algorithm 38 to all operating conditions, which includes the heat load amounts and aircraft altitude temperatures. The worse-case accuracy is used to bias the algorithm 38 to center the error. In one example analysis, unbiased the minimum total volume error is 5.83 oz. and the maximum total volume error is 13.37 oz. A bias is then added to the algorithm 38 to center the error at +/- 9.60 oz., as determined below. <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mfenced separators=""><mi>maximum total volume error</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>minimum total volume error</mi></mfenced><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mi>bias amount</mi><mspace width="1em"/><mfenced separators=""><mn>13.37</mn><mspace width="1em"/><mi>oz</mi><mn>.</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>5.83</mn><mspace width="1em"/><mi>oz</mi><mn>.</mn></mfenced><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>3.77</mn><mspace width="1em"/><mi>oz</mi></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="147" he="24" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> <maths id="math0002" num=""><math display="block"><mfenced separators=""><mi>maximum total volume error</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>minimum total volume error</mi></mfenced><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mo>+</mo><mo>/</mo><mo>-</mo><mi>centered error amount</mi><mspace width="1em"/><mfenced separators=""><mn>13.37</mn><mspace width="1em"/><mi>oz</mi><mn>.</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>5.83</mn><mspace width="1em"/><mi>oz</mi><mn>.</mn></mfenced><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mo>+</mo><mo>/</mo><mo>-</mo><mn>9.60</mn><mspace width="1em"/><mi>oz</mi></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="147" he="29" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Thermistors may be used as the temperature sensors 32, 34.
