num="0003">The present invention relates to the production of enzymes capable of hydrolysing chlorophyll and chlorophyll derivatives. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004">BACKGROUND </p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Chlorophyll is a green-coloured pigment widely found throughout the plant kingdom, in algae and cyanobacteria. Chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis and is one of the most abundant organic metal compounds found on earth. Thus many products derived from plants, including foods and feeds, contain significant amounts of chlorophyll. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For example, vegetable oils derived from oilseeds such as soybean, palm or rape seed (canola), cotton seed, sunflower seed, grape seed and peanut typically contain some chlorophyll. However the presence of high levels of chlorophyll pigments in vegetable oils is generally undesirable. This is because chlorophyll imparts an undesirable green colour and can induce oxidation of oil during storage, leading to a deterioration of the oil. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Various methods have been employed in order to remove chlorophyll from vegetable oils. Chlorophyll may be removed during many stages of the oil production process, including the seed crushmg, oil extraction, degummmg, caustic treatment and bleaching steps. However the bleaching step is usually the most significant for reducing chlorophyll residues to an acceptable level. During bleaching the oil is heated and passed through an adsorbent to remove chlorophyll and other colour-bearing compounds that impact the appearance and/or stability of the finished oil. The adsorbent used in the bleaching step is typically clay. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the edible oil processing industry, the use of such steps typically reduces chlorophyll levels in processed oil to between 0.02 to 0.05 ppm. However the bleaching step increases processing cost and reduces oil yield due to entrainment in the bleaching clay. The use of clay may remove many desirable compounds such as carotenoids and tocopherol from the oil. Also the use of clay is expensive, this is particularly due to the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 treatment of the used clay (i.e. the waste) which can be difficult, dangerous (prone to self-ignition) and thus costly to handle. Thus attempts have been made to remove chlorophyll from oil by other means, for instance using the enzyme chlorophyllase. hi plants, chlorophyllase (chlase) is thought to be involved in chlorophyll degradation and catalyzes the hydrolysis of an ester bond in chlorophyll to yield chlorophyllide and phytol. WO 2006009676 describes an industrial process in which chlorophyll contamination can be reduced in a composition such as a plant oil by treatment with chlorophyllase. The water-soluble chlorophyllide which is produced in this process is also green in colour but can be removed by an aqueous extraction or silica treatment. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Chlorophyll is often partly degraded in the seeds used for oil production as well as during extraction of the oil from the seeds. One common modification is the loss of the magnesium ion from the ροφΐιντίη (chlorin) ring to form the derivative known as pheophytin (see Figure 1). The loss of the highly polar magnesium ion from the ροφΐχγτϊη ring results in significantly different physico-chemical properties of pheophytin compared to chlorophyll. Typically pheophytin is more abundant in the oil during processing than chlorophyll. Pheophytin has a greenish colour and may be removed from the oil by an analogous process to that used for chlorophyll, for instance as described in WO 2006009676 by an esterase reaction catalyzed by an enzyme having a pheophytinase activity. Under certain conditions, some chlorophyllases are capable of hydrolyzing pheophytin as well as chlorophyll, and so are suitable for removing both of these contaminants. The products of pheophytin hydrolysis are the red/brown-colored pheophorbide and phytol. Pheophorbide can also be produced by the loss of a magnesium ion from chlorophyllide, i.e. following hydrolysis of chlorophyll (see Figure 1). WO 2006009676 teaches removal of pheophorbide by an analogous method to chlorophyllide, e.g. by aqueous extraction or silica adsorption. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Pheophytin may be further degraded to pyropheophytin, both by the activity of plant enzymes during harvest and storage of oil seeds or by processing conditions (e.g. heat) during oil refining (see "Behaviour of Chlorophyll Derivatives in Canola Oil Processing", JAOCS, Vol, no. 9 (Sept. 1993) pages 837-841). One possible mechanism is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the methyl ester bond of the isocyclic ring of pheophytin followed by the non-enzymatic conversion of the unstable intermediate to 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 pyropheophytin. A 28-29 kDa enzyme from Chenopodium album named pheophorbidase is reportedly capable of catalyzing an analogous reaction on pheophorbide, to produce the phytol-free derivative of pyropheophytin known as pyropheophorbide (see Figure 1). Pyropheophorbide is less polar than pheophorbide resulting in the pyropheophoribe having a decreased water solubility and an increased oil solubility compared with pheophorbide. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Depending on the processing conditions, pyropheophytin can be more abundant than both pheophytin and chlorophyll in vegetable oils during processing (see Table 9 in volume 2.2. of Bailey's Industrial Oil and Fat Products (2005), 6<sup>lh</sup> edition, Ed. by Fereidoon Shahidi, John Wiley and Sons). This is partly because of the loss of magnesium from chlorophyll during harvest and storage of the plant material. If an extended heat treatment at 90°C or above is used, the amount of pyropheophytin in the oil is likely to increase and could be higher than the amount of pheophytin. Chlorophyll levels are also reduced by heating of oil seeds before pressing and extraction as well as the oil degumming and alkali treatment during the refining process. It has also been observed that phospholipids in the oil can complex with magnesium and thus reduce the amount of chlorophyll. Thus chlorophyll is a less abundant contaminant compared to pyropheophytin (and pheophytin) in many plant oils. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">There is therefore a need for methods for large-scale production of chlorophyllases and related enzymes, particularly for use in oil refining. A chlorophyllase from Triticum aestivum (wheat) has been expressed recombinantly in Escherichia coli, as described in Arkus et al. (2005), Arch. Biochem. Biophys 438:146-155. However, the yield of recombinant chlorophyllase obtained by such bacterial expression methods is low, typically in the order of a few milligrams per liter. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">There is a still a need for an improved method for the production of chlorophyllases and related enzymes, in particular for rapid large-scale expression of enzymes suitable for use in refining of plant oils.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION </p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In one aspect, the present invention relates to intracellular expression of enzymes such as chlorophyllases in microbial and/or eukaryotic cells. It has been surprisingly found that intracellular expression in eukaryotes such as fungi rapidly results in a high yield of active enzyme, for example compared to known prokaryotic (bacterial) expression methods. In particular, it has been shown that in eukaryotes such as fungi, intracellular expression is faster and produces a higher enzyme yield than secretion into the extracellular medium. </p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The fungal cell membrane is surrounded by a thick, tough and rigid cell wall which can hinder extraction of intracellular recombinant products. The cell wall consists of different polymers (chitin, glucans and mannoproteins) surrounding the plasma membrane. Extraction techniques may be considered to involve harsh conditions, which could potentially damage desired recombinant products (reduce their functionality) or reduce the recovery and yield of the recombinant protein (reducing industrial efficiency and raising cost in use of the desirable recombinant products). Moreover, some extraction methods such as enzymatic digestion of the cell walls may be perceived to be expensive, while physical disruption such as bead beating and agitation can cause foaming and sample heating. Sonication may be considered to be sub-optimal due to noise, sample heating and free radical formation damaging the protein of interest. </p><p id="p0041" num="0041">If a recombinant protein is secreted following expression in a host cell, no cell lysis is required and the enzyme can be recovered directly from the culture medium. For these reasons, secretory expression is often considered to be the preferred method for producing recombinant proteins in microbes such as fungi. In contrast, the present invention surprisingly demonstrates that recombinant chlorophyllases can be produced rapidly and in high yield using intracellular expression in eukaryotes such as fungi, and that the fully functional enzyme can easily be recovered from the cells using simple and straightforward methods. </p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In one aspect, the present invention relates to a method for producing a recombinant enzyme capable of hydrolyzing chlorophyll or a chlorophyll derivative.

Chlorophyll and (phytol-containing) chlorophyll derivatives are typically greenish in colour, as a result of the porphyrin (chlorin) ring present in the molecule. Loss of magnesium from the porphyrin ring means that pheophytin and pyropheophytin are more brownish in colour than chlorophyll. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The enzymes produced in the present method may hydrolyse chlorophyll and phytol- containing chlorophyll derivatives to cleave the phytol tail from the chlorin ring.

Consequently, most sequence comparison methods are designed to produce optimal alignments that take into consideration possible insertions and deletions without penalising unduly the overall homology score.

"Affine gap costs" are typically used that charge a relatively high cost for the existence of a gap and a smaller penalty for each subsequent residue in the gap. This is the most commonly used gap scoring system. High gap penalties will of course produce optimised alignments with fewer gaps. Most alignment programs allow the gap

By this it is meant that when introduced into a eukaryotic host cell, the vector leads to cytoplasmic translation of a recombinant enzyme which is not targeted for secretion, e.g. the recombinant enzyme accumulates predominantly within the cell (rather than being secreted or becoming membrane-bound). In some embodiments, some of the recombinant enzyme may be present outside the cell, for example due to the enzyme diffusing across the cell membrane or due to partial cell lysis. However, "intracellular expression" typically refers to embodiments where the encoded enzyme is not targeted for extracellular secretion via the cell's intrinsic secretory pathway. </p><p id="p0149" num="0149">Thus the expression vector typically does not comprise a signal peptide coding region, such that the encoded recombinant enzyme is expressed without a signal peptide.

The various nucleic acids and control sequences described above may be joined together to produce a recombinant expression vector which may include one or more convenient restriction sites to allow for insertion or substitution of the nucleotide sequence encoding the enzyme at such sites.

In one embodiment, one or more of the above acids may be used to lower the pH of the medium comprising the host cell to, for example, less than pH 5, e.g. pH 3 to 5. Typically the host cell may be exposed to the organic acid at reduced pH for 12 hours to 5 days, e.g. about 24 hours to about 3 hours, at a temperature of 20°C to 40°C, e.g. about 30°C. some embodiments, treatment with organic acids results in cell killing, and a subsequent step (e.g. heat treatment step) may be used in order to produce cell lysis. Methods for cell kill without cell lysis using organic acids are disclosed in, for example, US 5,801,034 in connection with secreted proteins.

The active site residues have been previously identified by site directed mutagenesis of BoCLH2 (J Agric Food Chem. 2010 Aug l l ;58(15):8651-7). Sequence alignment of both known putative uncharacterized chlorophyllases showed the presence of conserved blocks around the active site residues. Three signature motifs: GHSXGG (SEQ ID No:36), DPVXG (SEQ ID NO:37), YGHXD (SEQ ID NO:38) could be used to identify new members of the chlorophyllase superfamily either by searching sequenced genome databases, screening metagenomic libraries or by using these amino acids as degenerate oligonucleotide primer/probes in a PGR to identify new genes present in different chlorophyll containing organisms such as plants, algae and chlorophyll containing bacteria. The GHSXGG motif contains the active site serine residue which is a motif common to lipolytic enzymes (lipases) but the 2 other motifs, DPVXG, YGHXD containing the active sites aspartate and histidine, are unique to chlorophyllases.

 The transformed Trichoderma strain expressing the highest amount of recombinant wheat chlorophyllase in shake flask cultures was subjected to large scale fermentation in 14 litre scale for 150 hours. This strain harboured a wheat chlorophyllase intracellular gene construct. Whole cell broth was centrifuged and both intracellular and extracellular protein fractions from the cell pellet and supernatant respectively were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. </p><p id="p0265" num="0265">Cell free extracts of culture supernatant from 14 litre scale fermentation showed the presence of recombinant wheat chlorophyllase both extracellularly and intracellularly. Wheat chlorophyllase was the most abundant protein accumulating outside of fungal cells (see Figure 5). The extracellular accumulation of chlorophyllase in the culture medium could be explained by the following possibilities: 1. chlorophyllase proteins can cross plasma membranes and cell walls, 2. The occurrence of cell lysis with age of the mycelia being more prone to cell breakage. The cell pellet was lysed using celLytic buffer to check the intracellular protein fraction for the accumulation of chlorophyllase intracellularly. As shown in Figure 6, SDS-PAGE indicated the presence of a 34kDa wheat chlorophyllase as the predominant protein expressed inside the fungal cells. </p><p id="p0266" num="0266">All publications mentioned in the above specification are herein incorporated by reference.
