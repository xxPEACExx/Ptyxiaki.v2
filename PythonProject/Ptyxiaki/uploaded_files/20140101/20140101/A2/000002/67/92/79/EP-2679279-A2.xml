Such systems are used to supply oxygen to passengers in case of a pressure drop within the cabin or other emergency or critical situations, where the oxygen present in the cabin of the aircraft is not sufficient for the vital functions of the passenger within said cabin.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">An emergency oxygen breathing device is known from the European patent application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP2143469A1"><text>EP 2 143 469 A1</text></patcit>. According to this reference, an oxygen breathing device provides<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> oxygen flow from an oxygen source to an oxygen mask of a passenger or crew member. The oxygen flow is controlled by a control unit to ensure that the passenger is supplied with an exact amount of oxygen. The control unit receives pressure signals corresponding to the ambient pressure from a pressure sensor and temperature signals corresponding to the oxygen temperature passing through the breathing device from a temperature sensor. Generally, with such a device, it is possible to supply an amount of oxygen to a passenger in an emergency case which ensures that the passenger receives enough oxygen for maintaining all vital functions.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">One important aspect of such oxygen breathing devices, however, is the desire to reduce the weight and the size of such devices in order to reduce the overall weight of the aircraft and to provide additional space for entertainment systems or the like. This size and weight reduction, however, shall not effect a reduction of the time period of supply of oxygen to a passenger. Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an emergency oxygen system for passengers of an aircraft with reduced size and weight.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A further aspect of existing known assistance systems is the need to periodically maintain these systems and to adapt them to enhanced requirements or regulations in the aircraft industry. In the course of such maintenance it is a desire to be able to improve existing known oxygen systems in order to save weight and or space or to improve the characteristics of such systems in order to adapt them to existing requirements or regulations. It is a further object of the invention to provide a method and device which allows improvement of existing maintenance procedures in an efficient way.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is another object to install modern oxygen masks which provide for low oxygen consumption at heights between 15.000 and 30.000 feet. Therefore, the oxygen flow at these heights needs to be adapted accordingly.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">These and other objects are achieved by an oxygen breathing device according to the introductory function having an oxygen source, in particular a chemical oxygen generator or an oxygen pressure tank, at least one oxygen mask connected via an oxygen supply line to said oxygen source, a flow control unit adapted to receive a signal indicating ambient pressure or to detect ambient pressure and to control the flow of oxygen through the oxygen supply line depending on said ambient pressure, wherein the flow control unit is adapted to provide a low oxygen flow at a first ambient pressure, provide a higher oxygen flow at a second ambient pressure which is lower than said first ambient pressure<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> and to increase said oxygen flow in at least two steps, preferably to increase said oxygen flow constantly, wherein a bypass valve is arranged in the oxygen supply line and comprises a first flow path and a second flow path comprising a bypass channel in a parallel flow arrangement to said first flow path, wherein said bypass valve is adapted to direct the flow of oxygen through said first flow path at an ambient pressure above a predetermined level according to a first flow condition and direct the flow of oxygen through said second flow path at an ambient pressure below a predetermined level according to a second flow condition, wherein said first flow path has a smaller flow cross section than said second flow path.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The oxygen breathing device provides for a weight saving means for life support of passengers in an aircraft. The device can be integrated in existing oxygen breathing systems without the need to redesign such existing systems. Moreover, the oxygen breathing device according to the invention is adapted to be used for currently used oxygen masks providing reduced oxygen consumption. Thereby, a reduced overall system weight can be achieved.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Preferably, the first ambient pressure is a system pressure corresponding to an altitude of the aircraft below 30.000 feet, e.g. intermediate altitudes between 15.000 and 30.000 feet. Still further it is preferred that the second ambient pressure is a system pressure corresponding to an altitude of the aircraft above 30.000 feet. The term smaller flow cross section reflects the fact that a smaller amount of oxygen per unit time can flow through the first flow path compared to the second flow path.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to a first preferred embodiment, said first flow path comprises a calibrated orifice. Thereby, a predetermined maximum amount of oxygen flow to the passenger can be achieved. Preferably, the calibrated orifice can be a channel with a predetermined cross section which is arranged in the first flow path in a way that oxygen flowing through the first flow path has to flow through the calibrated orifice. Depending on the size of the cross section the maximum oxygen flow to a passenger or crew member can be adjusted.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">If the amount of oxygen entering the bypass valve exceeds the amount of oxygen leaving the bypass valve at the outlet due to the calibrated orifice, the pressure in the oxygen supply line increases. This pressure increase can be utilized as a signaling condition for the bypass valve to switch to the second flow condition.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to a further embodiment said first flow path consists of a flow through a calibrated orifice only and said second flow path consists of a flow through said bypass channel only or said bypass channel and said calibrated orifice. This provides for a flexible and reliable embodiment of oxygen supply to the passenger.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A further preferred embodiment is <b>characterized in that</b> said bypass valve comprises a first flow channel comprising an orifice with a predetermined cross-section and a second flow channel, wherein a spring biased valve member engages a valve seat and a pressure inside the oxygen supply line acting against said spring to switch the valve member to switch the bypass valve between said first and second flow condition. This provides for an automatic and pressure controlled way of switching the bypass valve between the first and second flow condition.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The spring biased valve member preferably comprises an adjustable spring comprising an adjustment screw which can be mounted in a housing of the bypass valve. By adjusting the screw, the load of the spring and, accordingly, the pressure inside the oxygen supply line which is sufficient for lifting the valve member can be adjusted.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In another preferred embodiment a plurality of oxygen masks are connected to said oxygen source via a manifold, the oxygen supply line comprises a first central oxygen line section directing oxygen from the oxygen source to said manifold and a plurality of second oxygen line sections each directing oxygen from the manifold to an oxygen mask, said bypass valve is arranged in flow direction between said flow control unit and said oxygen masks. This provides for a central supply of oxygen from the oxygen source to the plurality of oxygen masks.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In another embodiment said bypass valve is arranged in said first central oxygen line section, in particular in flow direction between said flow control unit and said manifold. This provides for further weight saving, since a centralized bypass valve is provided for a plurality of oxygen masks, i.e. for the oxygen supply of a plurality of passengers.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A further embodiment of the aforementioned oxygen breathing device comprises a plurality of bypass valves, wherein at least a number of said plurality of second oxygen line sections comprises one of said plurality of bypass valves. Thereby, a decentralized arrangement of the bypass valves is achieved which provides for an increased liability of the oxygen breathing device. If one of the bypass valves does not function sufficiently, which would lead to a malfunction of the oxygen supply to one of the oxygen masks, the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> other remaining oxygen masks will still work sufficiently. In such an emergency case two passengers are able to share one oxygen mask.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to a further embodiment of the oxygen breathing device, said bypass valve comprises a first and a second calibrated orifice, said second calibrated orifice having a larger flow cross section than said first calibrated orifice, wherein in said first flow condition the oxygen is flowing through said first calibrated orifice and in said second flow condition the oxygen is at least partially circumventing said first calibrated orifice and is flowing through said second calibrated orifice. This provides for a predetermined maximum oxygen flow in the second flow condition. Thereby, the oxygen flow to the passenger breathing mask can be calibrated both for the first and second flow condition. Hence, there is no need for a further calibrated orifice arranged in the passenger breathing mask.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to a further embodiment of the breathing device, in said second flow condition a first part of the oxygen is flowing through said first calibrated orifice and a second part of the oxygen is flowing through a bypass channel arranged in parallel to said first calibrated orifice.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to another embodiment, in said first flow condition the oxygen is flowing through said first and second calibrated orifice in a serial arrangement.
