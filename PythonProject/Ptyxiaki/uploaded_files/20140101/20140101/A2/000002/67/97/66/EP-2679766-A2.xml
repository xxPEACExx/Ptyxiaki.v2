More precisely, the present invention refers to improved apparatuses and methods for operating a subsea compression system configured for this purpose.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Offshore gas production involves installations on the seabed which are controlled and powered from a land-based or sea-based terminal or host facility. Well fluid is transported via pipelines from a subsea production system to a receiving terminal to be further processed before the products are supplied to market. In the initial phases of production, the fluid reservoir pressure is usually sufficient for feeding the hydrocarbon fluids through the pipeline. Later in production, or in the case of very long distance between the well fluid reservoir and the receiving terminal, boosting of fluid pressure and flow may be required in one or more compression systems along the pipeline in order to maintain flow rate and production level.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In compression systems, gas in the well stream is fed to a compressor that is configured for discharging the gas downstream at a compressed state. Excess liquid may be extracted from the well stream and fed to a pump configured for pumping the liquid downstream, typically by injecting the liquid into the compressed gas that is discharged from the compressor. A re-mixed bi-phase well stream this way leaves the compression system at a raised pressure level and flow. Nevertheless, the subsea compression system may optionally be arranged for discharge of boosted gas and liquid flows via separate export lines.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The well stream may be collected in a separator vessel located upstream of the compressor and pump and configured for separation of gas from liquid, the separator providing predictable operating points for both the compressor and the pump with respect to liquid volume fraction or liquid level in the system.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Compressors used in subsea compression systems may be adapted to process wet gas containing a certain ratio of liquid. Thus in some applications, the separator may be replaced by a mixer that is configured for mixing of gas and liquid and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> feeding a homogenized wet gas to the compressor. However, a subsea centrifugal compressor, e.g., can normally not start liquid filled. Above a certain liquid level in the compression system, pumps will be required to drain the compressor system prior to start-up of the compressor.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Conventionally, each compressor and pump is typically driven by an electrical motor which is supplied operation and control power via an umbilical connecting the compression system with its host facility. Thus, each pump motor in the conventional compression system requires for its operation an individual setup of power and control gear such as subsea switchgear, wet-mate electrical connectors, high voltage electrical jumpers and electrical control system components, cooling and lubrication circuits including valves and flow and pressure control, etc.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention aims to simplify the power distribution from shore or surface to equipment located subsea.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The invention also aims at providing a distributed power generation scheme in a subsea compression system comprising a compressor and an electromotor pump, wherein the compressor is operable for compression of gas and the pump is operable for pumping liquid from the compression system.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Another object of the present invention is to provide for removal of collected liquid from a wet gas compressor before start-up of the compressor, in other words providing for drainage of the compressor without the compressor running.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">At least one of the objects is met in a method for operation of the subsea compression system in a well stream, the compression system comprising a compressor and an electromotor pump, the compressor operable for compressing gas and the pump operable for pumping liquid from the compression system, the method comprising:

Expanded gas is discharged from the turbo-expander unit 10 and recycled to the upstream side of the compressor via expanded gas return line 12, over a flow regulation valve 13.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The flow regulation valve 13, which alternatively can be installed on the gas feed line 11 to the turbo-expander unit 10, may be controllable in response to a liquid volume level in the vessel 3 detected by sensor means S and applied in a subsea control unit 14 which controls the setting of the flow regulation valve 13. A one way valve 15 in the gas return line 12 prevents back flow into return gas line 12.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In alternative to returning the expanded gas from the turbo-expander unit 10 to the gas feed line 8 on the upstream side of the compressor 1 as illustrated by continuous lines in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, the expanded gas may be returned further upstream on the upstream side of the compressor, such as to the vessel 3 or to the well stream upstream of the vessel 3, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> by dash-dot lines extending the gas return line 12 to the upstream side of the vessel 3. The latter alternative may be advantageous, e.g., in a case where liquid is precipitated from the expanded gas on the discharge side of the turbo-expander unit 10.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The expansion turbine 16 in the turbo-expander unit 10 is drivingly connected to a rotor or stator in a generator 17. The generator 17 is connected to a set of batteries 18, the generator in operation supplying charging current to the batteries in result of feeding compressed gas to the turbo-expander unit 10 via the gas recycling loop 11, 12. The set of batteries may be incorporated in an uninterruptable power supply (UPS) system 19.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The pump motor 5 is powered from the battery/batteries 18, or in an alternative powered directly by the generator 17. In operation, the pump draws liquid from the vessel 3 via liquid feed line 20 for injection into the compressed-gas discharge line 9, via liquid injection line 21 which connects to the discharge line 9 at a liquid injection point. If appropriate, recycling of liquid back to the vessel 3 can be accomplished via liquid return loop 22 and flow control valve 23, connecting the vessel 3 with the liquid injection line 21 on the discharge side of the pump.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In the above described embodiment which processes a homogenized bi-phase fluid, the pump 2 may be operating as a drainage pump that is only intermittently powered to drain the compression system from excess liquid. To this purpose, liquid that is collected in the compressor and in any auxiliary equipment may be returned<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> to the vessel 3 via a drainage line 24. Operation of the pump 2, may be initiated in response to a measured liquid level in the vessel 3 and/or compressor.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Excess liquid may alternatively be collected in a separate drainage tank, such as a sump 25 arranged on the compressor or a drain pot 26 arranged in flow connection with the compressor. Operation of the pump may then be initiated in response to a measured liquid level in the compressor, in the sump or in the drain pot. The pump will then only run, on battery power, if the compressor is filled with liquid, and run until the liquid in the compressor casing and in any auxiliary equipment is at an acceptable level where it is safe to start the compressor.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In other embodiments, such as embodiments wherein the pump is operated more frequently e.g., the pump may be stopped in the event of reaching a low liquid set point/liquid level in the vessel 3 or compressor. The pump may also have an external liquid service line typically supplying methanol or glycol which can be used for continuous and/or intermittent priming of the pump.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Utility and control power may be supplied to the compressor motor 4 via VSD-block 6 and umbilical head end block 27 representing the necessary high and low voltage circuits, wet mate connectors, switchgear, circuit breakers, etc.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Compressors used in subsea compression systems may be designed for a substantial elevation of gas pressure, such as from about 40 bar at compressor intake to about 120 bar at compressor discharge, e.g. Heavy duty centrifugal wet gas compressors are generally used in this connection, typically operating at power ranging from about one to several tens of megawatt and at rotational speeds in the order of 8-12 000 rev per min.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The subject pumps when used in subsea compression systems are designed for boosting the liquid up to a pressure required for injection of the liquid into the compressed gas that is discharged from the compressor. Positive displacement pumps are useful in this connection, dimensioned for operating at power ranging from some tens of kilowatt to hundreds of kilowatt, and at rotational speeds of about 1500-4000 rev per min. In the implementation as a drainage pump, e.g., the pump may be designed for flow rates in the order of about 100 m<sup>3</sup> per hour.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Compressors, positive displacement pumps or centrifugal pumps rotating at other operational speeds and operating power may however alternatively be used.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> Nevertheless, the present invention provides great freedom in the choice of rotating components in the compression station since the drive gas flow and resulting output torque and rotational speed can be controlled through the flow regulation valve 13.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">A speed reduction or regulation device, indicated through a symbolic representation 28 in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, such as a hydrodynamic torque converter or an electrical hysteresis clutch, e.g., can optionally be inserted between the turbo-expander unit and the generator and controlled between zero and 100 % lockup between driving and driven components, depending on the output torque required.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The distributed power supply and subsea power generation as disclosed above provides several advantages, among which are
<ul><li>a simplified power distribution from topside/shore to pump,</li><li>space and cost savings in result of less complex equipment and power control,</li><li>drainage of the compressor made possible without the compressor running,</li><li>simplified control by use of turbo-expander unit which can run at a wide range of rotational speeds,</li><li>simplified pump control,</li><li>a smooth anti-surge system, a better flow margin to compressor surge,</li><li>charging of UPS batteries by utilizing excess power/pressure differential at periods when pump is not running.</li></ul></p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The invention is not restricted to the embodiments described above. On the contrary, many possibilities to modifications thereof may appear to a skilled person from the teachings provided herein, without departing from the basic idea of the invention. Such modification may include, for example, a plurality of compressors and pumps arranged in the subsea compression system. Another modification foresees that two or more compressors or compressor stages are arranged in a series. In such embodiment, an intercooler may be installed between the compressors or compressor stages arranged in series.
