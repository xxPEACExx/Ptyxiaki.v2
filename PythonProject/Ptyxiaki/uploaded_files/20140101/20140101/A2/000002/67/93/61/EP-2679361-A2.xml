Moreover, the ceramic honeycomb structure is also used as a filter for purification of an exhaust gas. Such a ceramic honeycomb structure has excellent heat resistance and corrosion resistance, and is<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> employed in various use applications as described above. The honeycomb structure is a structure having partition walls with which a plurality of cells extending from one end surface to the other end surface are formed to become through channels of a fluid.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Heretofore, the honeycomb structure having an outer diameter dimension smaller than 150 mm has been manufactured by the following method. First, a kneaded material including a forming raw material is formed into a honeycomb-like shape, to obtain a formed honeycomb body. The formed honeycomb body is a cylindrical body in which the plurality of cells extending from the one end surface to the other end surface are formed with the partition walls. This formed honeycomb body is cut so that a length of the formed honeycomb body in a direction in which the cells extend is larger than a length of a finished dimension, and furthermore, the formed honeycomb body is dried, to obtain the dried honeycomb body. Next, finishing step is performed so that the length of the dried honeycomb body in the cell extending direction becomes the finished dimension, to obtain the finished dried honeycomb body. Next, the finished dried honeycomb body is fired, to obtain the honeycomb structure (see, e.g., Patent Document 1). Moreover, the honeycomb structure manufactured by such a method is inspected so as to judge whether or not an outer diameter dimension of the honeycomb structure satisfies an<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> outer diameter dimension tolerance as a reference, and the honeycomb structure which has passed the inspection is shipped as a product.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">On the other hand, when the honeycomb structure having an outer diameter dimension of 150 mm or more is manufactured, a step of separately preparing an outer wall is added sometimes (see, e.g., Patent Document 2). An example of the step of separately preparing the outer wall is a step of firing the finished dried honeycomb body, grinding an outer periphery of the obtained fired body, and coating a ground outer peripheral portion with an outer periphery coat to separately prepare the outer wall. The honeycomb structure having an outer diameter dimension of 150 mm or more will be called "the large honeycomb structure" sometimes.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Hereinafter, the above example of the manufacturing method of manufacturing the honeycomb structure by drying, finishing and firing the formed honeycomb body will be called "the manufacturing method by integral forming" sometimes. Moreover, the manufacturing method to which the step of separately preparing the outer wall is added will be called "the manufacturing method by outer periphery coating" sometimes. Furthermore, as a method of finishing step of end surfaces of the honeycomb structure, there is disclosed a method of correcting a posture of the honeycomb<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> structure to perform the finishing step in this state, or the like (see, e.g., Patent Document 3).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><ul><li>[Patent Document 1] <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2002046856A"><text>JP-A-2002-046856</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 2] <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP3275309A"><text>JP-A-3-275309</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 3] <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2006231475A"><text>JP-A-2006-231475</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, in a conventional manufacturing method of a honeycomb structure, there has been the problem that sufficient perpendicularities of one end surface and the other end surface of the obtained honeycomb structure is not achieved (hereinafter "the perpendicularities of the one end surface and the other end surface" will simply be called "the perpendicularity" sometimes). Especially, in the above-mentioned manufacturing method by the integral forming, the above perpendicularity remarkably deteriorates. Moreover, in recent years, an allowable range of the perpendicularity of the honeycomb structure has been strict, and enhancement of the perpendicularity of the honeycomb structure has been required. The allowable range of the perpendicularity means a range in which a reference value of the perpendicularity required for a ceramic honeycomb structure as a product is satisfied. In a processing method disclosed in, for example, Patent Document 3, a honeycomb structure is grasped by a clamp, a shape of the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> honeycomb structure is measured, and a posture of the honeycomb structure is corrected to perform finishing step. However, an outer wall of the honeycomb structure has a concave/convex portion and the like, and hence the above-mentioned clamp is not stable sometimes. Moreover, in the processing method disclosed in Patent Document 3, the shape measurement for correcting the posture of the honeycomb structure is performed at four points of 0°, 45°, 90° and 135° in a circumferential direction, which causes the problem that the measurement points are coarsely disposed to deteriorate precision of the processing.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Furthermore, the manufacturing method by the outer periphery coating has the problem that a manufacturing process is laborious. For example, a large honeycomb structure is manufactured mainly by using the manufacturing method by the outer periphery coating, because distortion or the like of a formed body noticeably occurs. However, from the viewpoint of decrease of manufacturing cost or the like, it has been considered that the large honeycomb structure is manufactured by the manufacturing method by the integral forming. However, when the large honeycomb structure is manufactured by the manufacturing method by the integral forming, the perpendicularity of the honeycomb structure more remarkably deteriorates. For example, when the large honeycomb structure is manufactured by the conventional manufacturing method by the integral forming,<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> a perpendicularity yield is below 50% sometimes. In consequence, heretofore it has been considered to be remarkably difficult that the large honeycomb structure is manufactured by the manufacturing method by the integral forming.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention has been developed in view of the above-mentioned problem, and according to the present invention, there is provided a manufacturing method of a ceramic honeycomb structure which has an excellent productivity and in which it is possible to manufacture the ceramic honeycomb structure having an excellent perpendicularity irrespective of a size of an outer diameter dimension of the ceramic honeycomb structure.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the present invention, there is provided a manufacturing method of a ceramic honeycomb structure as follows.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">[1] A manufacturing method of a ceramic honeycomb structure including a finishing step of finishing one end surface and the other end surface of a cylindrical

<ul><li>One embodiment of a manufacturing method of a ceramic honeycomb structure of the present invention includes a finishing step A and a firing step B as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1. Fig. 1</figref> is a perspective view schematically showing a process to form the ceramic honeycomb structure in the one embodiment of the manufacturing method of the ceramic honeycomb structure of the present invention. The finishing step A is a step of finishing one end surface 61 and the other end surface 62 of a cylindrical dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 having the one end surface 61 and the other end surface 62, to obtain a finished dried ceramic honeycomb body 70. The dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is the cylindrical body in which a plurality of cells 52 extending from the one end surface 61 to the other end surface 62 are formed with partition walls 51. The firing step B is a step of firing the finished dried ceramic honeycomb body 70 obtained in the finishing step A, to obtain a ceramic honeycomb structure 100. Hereinafter, the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 will simply be called "the dried honeycomb body 50" sometimes. The finished dried ceramic honeycomb body 70 will simply be called "the finished dried honeycomb body 70" sometimes. The ceramic honeycomb structure 100 will simply be called "the honeycomb structure 100".</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">According to the manufacturing method of the ceramic honeycomb structure of the present embodiment, the finishing step A is performed by the following method.

Specifically, first, two positions away from each other in a direction from the one end surface 61 toward the other end surface 62 of the surface of an outer wall 63 of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 are a contour measurement start point P1 and a contour measurement start point P2. The two points of the contour measurement start point P1 and the contour measurement start point P2 are reference points of the measurement of the contour. The contour is measured at a plurality of measurement points while shifting a measurement position from each of the respective contour measurement start points P1 and P2 in a circumferential direction, around the whole circumferences including the contour measurement start points P1 and P2 in the respective circumferential directions. That is, in a first measuring portion Q1 disposed around a periphery including<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> the contour measurement start point P1 in a circumferential direction R, the contour of the diametrical dimension of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is measured at a plurality of measurement points while shifting the measurement position from the contour measurement start point P1 in the circumferential direction R. Moreover, in a second measuring portion Q2 disposed around a periphery including the contour measurement start point P2 in the circumferential direction R, the contour of the diametrical dimension of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is measured at a plurality of measurement points while shifting the measurement position from the contour measurement start point P2 in the circumferential direction R. In a cross section of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 which is substantially perpendicular to a direction from the one end surface 61 toward the other end surface 62, "the circumferential direction R" is a direction of a peripheral edge of "the cross section" along the surface of the outer wall 63 of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 around a periphery. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref> shows an example where the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is mounted on a measurement table 65 on which an object to be measured can horizontally be mounted, to measure the contour. Moreover, in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref>, the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 mounted on the measurement table 65 is rotated in a rotating direction 80, to measure the contour.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> From the measurement result (see, e.g., <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 3</figref>) of the contour measured in this manner, there are determined support positions of a first fixture and a second fixture on which the dried ceramic honeycomb body is mounted in the finishing step. Here, <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 3</figref> is a graph showing an example of the result obtained by measuring the contour, to explain a calculating method of a total value of absolute values.

On the other hand, "the contour C2x" is the contour measured at "a third measurement point P2x" of the second measuring portion Q2 "which is present at a position of the same phase as the first measurement point P1x".

When such a dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is mounted on a first fixture 68a and a second fixture 68b as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2C</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 2D</figref>, the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is considered to move from the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b. That is, when the outer peripheral shape of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is deformed, the dried ceramic honeycomb body cannot be mounted on the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b in a stable state. Therefore, when the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is mounted on the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b and then fixed to an auxiliary fixture 69, the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 moves to tilt sometimes. When the tilted dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is cut, a perpendicularity of the finished dried ceramic honeycomb body deteriorates. In the manufacturing method of the ceramic honeycomb structure of the present embodiment, the positions to be fixed by the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b are determined from the above-mentioned contour measurement result, to perform the finishing step. It is to be noted that when the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is mounted on the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b, a point on the first measuring portion Q1 of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is fixed by an end of the first fixture 68a on a side provided with a cutting<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> tool 75a. Then, a point of the second measuring portion Q2 of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is fixed by an end of the second fixture 68b on a side provided with a cutting tool 75b. Consequently, in the manufacturing method of the ceramic honeycomb structure of the present embodiment, "the position to be fixed by the end of the first fixture 68a on the side provided with the cutting tool 75a" in a direction L from the one end surface 61 toward the other end surface 62 of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is present in the first measuring portion Q1. Similarly, "the position to be fixed by the end of the second fixture 68b on the side provided with the cutting tool 75b" in the direction L from the one end surface 61 toward the other end surface 62 of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is present in "the second measuring portion Q2". According to such a constitution, the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is mounted on the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b at the position where "the total of the absolute values of the contours" is minimum. Furthermore, the dried ceramic honeycomb body is mounted on the cutting tool 75a side of the first fixture 68a and the cutting tool 75b side of the second fixture 68b, and hence the perpendicularity further enhances. A distance n1 or n2 between each of the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b and each cutting tool is preferably minimum in a region where the cutting tool does not interfere with the fixture, and is specifically preferably 10 mm or less.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The above-mentioned "total of the absolute values of the differences between the respective values of the contours C1x, C1y, C2x and C2y" is calculated in accordance with the following equation (1).

In this finishing step, the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is processed so that the length from the one end surface 61 to the other end surface 62 of the dried ceramic honeycomb body becomes the finished dimension m. In this case, as described above, the contour of the diametrical dimension of the dried ceramic honeycomb body prior to performing the finishing step is measured.</li></ul></p><p id="p0060" num="0060">There is not any special restriction on a measuring method of the contour. For example, the contour can be measured by a laser displacement meter 67 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref>. As the laser displacement meter 67, a reflective type<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> non-contact laser displacement meter can suitably be used. By such a laser displacement meter, the contour of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 can more accurately be measured.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">There is not any special restriction on the number of the measurement points of the contour in the circumferential direction of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50. However, when the number of the measurement points increases, it is further possible to obtain such a measurement point that the total of the absolute values of the differences between the respective values of the four contours further decreases. In consequence, the ceramic honeycomb structure having a more excellent perpendicularity can be manufactured with a higher yield.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">The contour of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is measured as follows. That is, the contour is measured at a plurality of measurement points of the first measuring portion Q1 while shifting a measurement position from the contour measurement start point P1 around the whole periphery of the circumferential direction (i.e., the first measuring portion Q1) including the contour measurement start point P1 in this circumferential direction. Similarly, the contour is measured at a plurality of measurement points of the second measuring portion Q2 while shifting the measurement position from the contour<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> measurement start point P2 around the whole periphery of the circumferential direction (i.e., the second measuring portion Q2) including the contour measurement start point P2 in this circumferential direction.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">There is not any special restriction on a temperature of the dried ceramic honeycomb body at the measurement of the contour, but the temperature of the dried ceramic honeycomb body is preferably from 20 to 150°C. The temperature of the dried ceramic honeycomb body is more preferably room temperature, if possible. The temperature of the dried ceramic honeycomb body obtained by drying the formed ceramic honeycomb body is from about 50 to 150°C, and it is also possible to measure the contour after cooling this dried ceramic honeycomb body to room temperature once. However, when the dried ceramic honeycomb body is cooled to room temperature, a heat efficiency and an operation efficiency deteriorate. Conversely, when the dried ceramic honeycomb body obtained by drying the formed ceramic honeycomb body can immediately be used in the measurement of the contour, the operation efficiency can further be enhanced. In the measurement of the contour, the measurement result may or may not be subjected to temperature correction. In the manufacturing method of the ceramic honeycomb structure of the present embodiment, "the total of the absolute values of the differences between the respective values of the four<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> contours" is obtained, and hence there are not any essential conditions on the temperature correction. When the temperature correction is performed, "a reference diametrical dimension" of the formed ceramic honeycomb body is corrected to "the reference outer diameter dimension corresponding to the temperature", by beforehand measuring thermal expansion coefficients of the ceramic material and the forming auxiliary agent.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref>, the measurement of the contour is preferably performed by mounting the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 on the measurement table 65 on which the object to be measured can horizontally be mounted. When the measurement table 65 is used, the contours of the first measuring portion Q1 and the second measuring portion Q2 can easily be measured. When the laser displacement meter 67 is, for example, a fixed type, two laser displacement meters 67 are preferably arranged to simultaneously measure the contours of the first measuring portion Q1 and the second measuring portion Q2. By rotating the measurement table 65, on which the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is mounted, one revolution in a horizontal plane, it is possible to continuously measure the contours of the first measuring portion Q1 and the second measuring portion Q2. The laser displacement meter 67 may be a movable type. Moreover, spacers 66 are preferably arranged between the measurement table 65 and the one end surface 61 of the<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> dried ceramic honeycomb body 50. In the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50, flatness of the end surface 61 deteriorates by cutting and drying steps at forming, and hence when the measurement table 65 rotates, the dried honeycomb body 50 might move by a centrifugal force. To acquire a measurement precision of the contour, the spacers 66 are preferably arranged in three portions.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">At the end of the measurement of the contour, "the total of the absolute values of the differences between the respective values of the four contours" is obtained, the fix positions to be supported by the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b are determined, and then the measurement table 65 may further be rotated by a predetermined angle. More specifically, first, "the totals of the absolute values of the differences between the respective contours" calculated at the respective measurement points are compared, to find a position where a value of the total is minimum. When a plurality of such "minimum values of the values of the totals" are present, for example, the measurement point closest to the contour measurement start point P1 is selected. When the measurement point is selected in this manner, a time to rotate the measurement table by the predetermined angle can be shortened. Next, a phase between the second measurement point P1y and the contour measurement start point P1 at the four measurement points at which "the total of the absolute<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> values of the differences between the respective values of the four contours" is minimum is "an optimum chuck angle". Then, the measurement table 65 is rotated by the phase from the contour measurement start point P1 to the optimum chuck angle. In consequence, the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 on the measurement table 65 rotates by the optimum chuck angle, and the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 in this state is chucked by a conveyance chuck, and conveyed to the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b. According to such a constitution, the four measurement points at which "the total of the absolute values of the differences between the respective values of the four contours" is minimum are fixed as follows. That is, the above-mentioned four measurement points at which the total is minimum are fixed at the first fix position C1yny and second fix position C1xnx of the first fixture 68a and the third fix position C2yny and fourth fix position C2xnx of the second fixture 68b.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">When the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is conveyed to the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b, a clearance f is preferably disposed between the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 and each of the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b. The clearance f is disposed to prevent collision. Here, <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 6</figref> is a plan view showing a state immediately after the dried ceramic honeycomb body is mounted on the first fixture and the second fixture. The<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is mounted on the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 6</figref>. Afterward, when the auxiliary fixture 69 moves to the left side on paper surface, the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 rotates counterclockwise. By this rotation, the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is fixed by two portions of each of the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b. However, when the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 rotates as described above, the optimum chuck angle after shape measurement shifts, so that the dried ceramic honeycomb body is fixed by the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b. Therefore, when the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is conveyed via the clearance f disposed between the dried ceramic honeycomb body and each of the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b, it is necessary to perform correction in consideration of the rotation at the fixing of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50. Specifically, when the measurement table 65 is rotated by the optimum chuck angle after the end of the shape measurement shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref>, the correction is performed as much as a rotation angle at the fixing (i.e., as much as the rotation angle in accordance with the clearance f). According to such a constitution, the four measurement points at which "the total of the absolute values of the differences between the respective values of the four contours" is minimum can be fixed at the first fix position C1yny and second fix position C1xnx of the first fixture<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> 68a and the third fix position C2yny and fourth fix position C2xnx of the second fixture 68b.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Even when the direction L from the one end surface toward the other end surface of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 mounted on the measurement table 65 slightly tilts from the vertical direction, an influence on the value of the contour is remarkably small. Therefore, even when the bottom surface of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 mounted on the measurement table 65 tilts to the surface of the measurement table 65, the above influence due to the tilt of the bottom surface is remarkably small even at the calculation of the total of the absolute values of the differences between the respective values of the contours. That is, when the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is mounted on the measurement table 65, the end surfaces of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 may slightly tilt to the horizontal plane, on the assumption that the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 does not move during the rotation of the measurement table 65. When the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is mounted on the measurement table 65, a height difference of the tilt of the bottom surface of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 to the horizontal plane is preferably 4 mm or less. Here, the above "height difference of the tilt of the bottom surface" is a distance at which a distance difference between the bottom surface of the dried honeycomb body 50 and the surface of the<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> measurement table 65 is maximum. The dried honeycomb body 50 is disposed on the measurement table 65 so that "the direction L from the one end surface 61 toward the other end surface 62" turns to the vertical direction.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">When the measurement table 65 on which the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is mounted is rotated one revolution in the horizontal plane, the rotation center of the measurement table 65 may slightly shift from a central axis in the direction from the one end surface toward the other end surface of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50. The shift may be in an allowable range of the measurement of the laser displacement meter, and in a range in which the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 does not move at the rotation of the measurement table 65. When the respective contours are measured on the same conditions at the positions which match each other in the direction from the one end surface toward the other end surface, the above-mentioned optimum chuck angle can be found from "the total of the absolute values of the differences between the respective contours". The contour is a shape obtained by subjecting measurement data to best fit processing according to the reference diametrical dimension by a minimum square method, spline interpolation (an interpolating method) or the like (i.e., a processing making an amount shifted from a reference value minimum). Moreover, measured contour data (i.e., the measurement<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> result) is stored in an X-Y coordinate. That is, in the contour measurement of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50, measurement coordinate data is shifted and stored for reasons such as the following (1) and (2). (1) The dried ceramic honeycomb body is set in an arbitrary place of the measurement table 65, and the measurement coordinate data individually vary. (2) When the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 bends, the diametrical dimensions of the first measuring portion Q1 and the second measuring portion Q2 can be measured, but the measurement coordinate of the first measuring portion Q1 is different from that of the second measuring portion Q2. Therefore, the measurement coordinate data of the first measuring portion Q1 and the measurement coordinate data of the second measuring portion Q2 are individually subjected to the best fit processing according to the reference diametrical dimension by the minimum square method. In consequence, the data of the contours of the first measuring portion Q1 and the second measuring portion Q2 can be processed in the same coordinate, and it is possible to calculate "the total of the absolute values of the differences between the respective contours".</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">When the total of the absolute values of the differences between the respective values of the four contours is obtained for every measurement point, the first measurement point P1x and second measurement point P1y of<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> the first measuring portion Q1 are preferably in a range of 60 to 120° in the circumferential direction.

Similarly, the third measurement point P2x and the fourth measurement point P2y of the second measuring portion Q2 are also in a range of 60 to 120° in the circumferential direction. The first measurement point P1x and the second measurement point P1y are fix points by the first fixture, when the dried ceramic honeycomb body is fixed by the first fixture. When the phase between the first measurement point P1x and the second measurement point P1y is smaller than 60° or in excess of 120° in the circumferential direction, it is difficult to stably fix the dried ceramic honeycomb body sometimes.

Here, the measurement point present at the position shifted by the shift of 90° from the first measurement point P1x is the second measurement point P1y, because the fixing angle of each of the first fixture and the second fixture is 90°.

In consequence, when the dried<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> ceramic honeycomb body 50 is subjected to the finishing step in a state where the measurement point corresponding to the optimum chuck angle of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 is fixed by the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b, the ceramic honeycomb structure having an excellent perpendicularity can be obtained.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Here, <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 4</figref> shows a calculation result of the optimum chuck angle of the dried ceramic honeycomb body. <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 4</figref> is a graph showing a distribution of the optimum chuck angle of the dried ceramic honeycomb body.

In the manufacturing method of the ceramic honeycomb structure of the present embodiment, the optimum chuck angle is obtained for each<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> dried ceramic honeycomb body, and then the dried ceramic honeycomb body is subjected to the finishing step by the above-mentioned method, so that the perpendicularity can effectively be prevented from being deteriorated.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">There is not any special restriction on a method of disposing the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 on the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2B and Fig. 2C</figref>.

Consequently, in the manufacturing method of the ceramic honeycomb structure of the present embodiment, the first fixture 68a, the second fixture 68b, the cutting tools 75a and 75b and the like are not adapted to the difference in shape between the respective dried ceramic honeycomb bodies. In the manufacturing method of the ceramic honeycomb structure of the present embodiment, the optimum chuck angle of each dried ceramic honeycomb body is determined in accordance with the contour.

An example of such a filter is an exhaust gas purifying filter to remove a particulate matter in an exhaust gas. An example of the exhaust gas purifying filter is a diesel particulate filter to remove the particulate matter in the exhaust gas discharged from a diesel engine.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">The plugged portion preparing step can be performed in conformity to a step similar to a plugged portion preparing step in the heretofore known manufacturing method of the plugged ceramic honeycomb structure.

First, a slurry-like plugging material is filled into one open frontal area of each predetermined cell and the other open frontal area of each remaining cell of the finished dried ceramic honeycomb body. When the plugging material is filled into the open frontal areas of<!-- EPO <DP n="56"> --> the cells of the finished dried ceramic honeycomb body, first the plugging material is filled into the one open frontal area, and then the plugging material is filled into the other open frontal area.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">An example of a method of filling the plugging material into the one open frontal area is the following method. First, a sheet is attached to one end surface of the finished dried ceramic honeycomb body. Next, this sheet is provided with holes through which the plugging material is filled at such positions as to form a checked pattern. The holes through which the plugging material is filled correspond to positions where the cells to be provided with the plugged portions are present. The finished dried ceramic honeycomb body, to which the sheet is attached, is pressed into a container where the plugging material is stored. That is, an end of the finished dried ceramic honeycomb body to which the sheet is attached is pressed into the above container. In consequence, the plugging material is filled into the predetermined cells through the holes of the sheet.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">After filling the plugging material into the one open frontal area of each of the cells, the plugging material is filled into the other open frontal area of each of the remaining cells by a method similar to the above-mentioned method.

It is to be noted that the plugging material may be dried every one open frontal area.

To prepare the dried ceramic honeycomb body, a cordierite forming raw material was used as a ceramic raw material. A predetermined amount of a forming auxiliary agent was added to the cordierite forming raw material, and water was also added, to prepare mixed powder.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094"><!-- EPO <DP n="58"> --> Next, the obtained mixed powder was extruded by using a die to obtain a formed ceramic honeycomb body. The extrusion-forming was performed by continuous forming, to prepare the cylindrical formed ceramic honeycomb body provided with a plurality of cells extending from one end surface to the other end surface. Next, the formed ceramic honeycomb body was cut in a cell extending direction so that a length in the cell extending direction was larger than a finished dimension.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">Next, the formed ceramic honeycomb body was dried, to prepare a dried ceramic honeycomb body. As the drying, a combination of dielectric drying and hot air drying was performed.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref>, an obtained dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 was mounted on a rotatable measurement table 65 in a horizontal plane. A contour of the surface of an outer wall 63 of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 in a circumferential direction was continuously measured by a laser displacement meter 67. Specifically, first, two positions away from each other in a direction from one end surface 61 toward the other end surface 62 of the surface of the outer wall 63 of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 were a contour measurement start point P1 and a contour measurement start point P2. Moreover, in a first measuring portion Q1 disposed around a periphery including the<!-- EPO <DP n="59"> --> contour measurement start point P1 in a circumferential direction R, the contour of an diametrical dimension of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 was measured at a plurality of measurement points while shifting a measurement position from the contour measurement start point P1 in the circumferential direction R. Furthermore, also in a second measuring portion Q2 disposed around a periphery including the contour measurement start point P2 in the circumferential direction R, the contour was measured at a plurality of measurement points while shifting a measurement position from the contour measurement start point P2 in the circumferential direction R. As the laser displacement meter 67, a reflective type non-contact laser displacement meter was used. The contour was measured at 3000 points per circumference in the circumferential direction. That is, the contour at each point of the surface of the outer wall 63 of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 was measured every 0.12° from the contour measurement start point. Additionally, in Example 1, spacers 66 in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref> were not arranged between the measurement table 65 and the one end surface 61 of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50, but the contour was measured. Moreover, in Example 1, as each of a first fixture and a second fixture for use in finishing step, a fixture having a fixing angle of 90° was used.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">From the obtained measurement result, a total of<!-- EPO <DP n="60"> --> absolute values of differences between respective values of four contours was obtained for each of 3000 measurement points. Here, the contour measured at the contour measurement start point P1 was "a contour C1 (0°)", and the contour measured at the contour measurement start point P2 was "a contour C2 (0°)". Moreover, the contour measured at the measurement point moved by n° from the contour measurement start point P1 in the circumferential direction was "the contour C1 (n°)". The above "n°" was a contour measurement angle (°) when the contour measurement start point P1 was 0° (see <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 3</figref>). Similarly, the contour measured at the measurement point moved by n° from the contour measurement start point P2 in the circumferential direction was "the contour C2 (n°)". For example, the contour measured at the measurement point moved by 0.12° from the contour measurement start point P1 in the circumferential direction was "the contour C1 (0.12°)".</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">First, a total No of absolute values of differences between respective values of the four contours, i.e., the contour C1 (0°), the contour C1 (90°), the contour C2 (0°), and the contour C2 (90°).

Subsequently, the totals of the absolute values of the differences between the respective values of the four contours at 3000 points were obtained while successively moving, in the circumferential direction, the measurement point to obtain the total value of the absolute values of the differences between the respective values of the four contours. Hereinafter, "the total of the absolute values of the differences between the respective values of the four contours" will simply be called "the total of the differences between the contours" sometimes.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">Next, all the obtained "totals of the differences between the contours" were compared, to find a minimum total value where "the total of the differences between the contours" was minimum. Here, an angle obtained by adding 90° to the contour measurement angle at which "the total of<!-- EPO <DP n="62"> --> the differences between the contours" was minimum was "the optimum chuck angle". Additionally, when the four contours used in the calculation of the minimum total value at which "the total of the differences between the contours" was minimum were "the contour C1 (n°)", "the contour C1 ((n+90)°)", "the contour C2 (n°)", and "the contour C2 ((n+90)°)", the respective contour values were as follows. That is, "the contour C1 (n°)" was "the contour C1x measured at the first measurement point P1x". "The contour C1 ((n+90)°)" was "the contour C1y measured at the second measurement point P1y". "The contour C2 (n°)" was "the contour C2x measured at the third measurement point P2x". "The contour C2 ((n+90)°)" was "the contour C2y measured at the fourth measurement point P2y". Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2B and Fig. 2C</figref>, the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 subjected to the measurement was mounted on a first fixture 68a and a second fixture 68b. The conveyance of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 to the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b was performed by the following method. First, the measurement of the contour was ended, and the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 rotated one revolution to the contour measurement start point was further rotated by the optimum chuck angle. The dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 was rotated by rotating the measurement table 65. Next, the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 was disposed at a first fix position C1yny and a second fix position C1xnx of the first fixture 68a and a third fix position C2yny and a<!-- EPO <DP n="63"> --> fourth fix position C2xnx of the second fixture 68b.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 2E</figref>, the end surfaces of the dried ceramic honeycomb body 50 mounted on the first fixture 68a and the second fixture 68b were subjected to the finishing step by cutting tools 75a and 75b, to obtain the finished dried ceramic honeycomb body.
