Furthermore, the invention relates to an arrangement for transferring energy from a primary side conductor assembly that produces an electromagnetic field, while an electric current flows through the conductor assembly, to a secondary side receiving device, that receives the electromagnetic field and produces an electric current by magnetic induction. In addition, the invention relates to a method of detecting an object having an elevated temperature. The invention also relates to a method of manufacturing a detector arrangement for detecting an object having an elevated temperature and to a method of manufacturing the transfer arrangement mentioned before.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2010031595A2"><text>WO 2010/031595 A2</text></patcit> discloses an arrangement for providing a vehicle, in particular a track bound vehicle, with electric energy, wherein the arrangement comprises a receiving device adapted to receive an alternating electromagnetic field and to produce an alternating electric current by electromagnetic induction.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The present invention can be applied in particular to the field of energy transfer to any land vehicle, in particular track bound vehicles, such as rail vehicles (e.g. trams), but also to road automobiles, such as individual (private) passenger cars or public transport vehicles (e.g. busses). Preferably, the primary side conductor arrangement of the generating device which produces the alternating electromagnetic filed is integrated in the track, road or parking area of the vehicle so that the electric lines of the primary side conductor arrangement extend in a plane which is nearly parallel to the surface of the road, track or parking area on which the vehicle may travel or may be parked.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Unlike conventional transformers for transferring energy from a primary side to a secondary side, there is a gap between the primary side conductor assembly and the secondary side receiving device that receives the electromagnetic field produced by the conductor assembly. During operation of the arrangement, electrically conducting material may be present in the gap, such as metal coins. In this case, the electromagnetic field produced by the conductor assembly will induce electric currents (in particular eddy currents) in the material, the electric<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> currents will be damped due to the electric resistance of the material and, as a result, the temperature of the material will increase. In particular in case of high transfer power (such as in the range of more than 10 kW, especially of more than 100 kW), which may happen while the electrochemical energy storage of a parked vehicle is charged, the temperature of such material may increase to some hundred degrees centigrade. After charging, the vehicle may move on and there is a significant risk that the hot material causes damage and injuries.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a detector arrangement for detecting an object having an elevated temperature, a transfer arrangement for transferring energy from a primary side conductor assembly to a secondary side receiving device, a method of detecting an object having an elevated temperature, a method of manufacturing the detector arrangement and the transfer arrangement, which reduce or eliminate the risk of damage and injuries. In particular, the detector arrangement shall be suited for being operated in connection with a transfer arrangement for transferring energy from a primary side conductor assembly to a secondary side receiving device.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to a basic concept of the invention, thermochromic substances are used to detect an object having an elevated temperature. The temperature of the object is elevated if it is higher than the ambience temperature, in particular the temperature of the ambience of a transfer arrangement for transferring energy from a primary side conductor assembly to a secondary side receiving device. Especially, the temperature is elevated if it is increased to a pre-determined minimum temperature or to a pre-determined range of temperatures. It is preferred that the thermochromic properties of the substance or substances correspond to the elevated temperature or to the range of temperatures which are elevated. In particular, a thermochromic substance or thermochromic substances are chosen and its properties or their properties allow for detection of objects having corresponding elevated temperature. The heat which is transferred from the object having an elevated temperature causes a change of the light transmitting properties of the thermochromic substance or substances.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Generally speaking, thermochromic substances can change their colour due to a change in temperature. Therefore, for the purposes of the present invention, any thermochromic substance can be used in order to detect an object having an elevated temperature. As mentioned before, heat from the object is transferred to the thermochromic substance(s), in particular by radiation and/or by convection, and this causes a change in colour of the substance(s). Due to this change in colour, the thermochromic substance(s) has/have an opaque state, at least with reference to electromagnetic radiation in a specific range of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> wavelength. At other temperatures of the substance(s) it/they is/are no longer opaque with reference to the radiation at least within the mentioned range of wavelength.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In specific embodiments, a change in colour means that the thermochromic substance(s) is/are opaque for radiation in a first range of wavelengths before the change and is opaque for radiation in a second, other range of wavelengths after the change. For example, the colour may change from blue to yellow or red with increasing temperature. However, the present invention is not restricted to specific colour changes and is not restricted to the wavelength range of radiation which is visible to humans. For example, the property of a thermochromic substance to be transparent for infrared radiation at specific temperatures can be used for the purposes of the present invention. However, it is preferred that light in the visible wavelength range, which has passed a layer comprising thermochromic material, is detected for the purposes of the present invention. Therefore, a corresponding light detector is used, preferably. In this description, "light" is used as a synonym for electromagnetic radiation. Light in the visible range is the radiation which is preferred for the purposes of the present invention. Moreover, it is preferred that the detection of light which has passed through the thermochromic material is not sensitive to specific colour ranges in the visible range of light. Therefore, it is preferred that the thermochromic material (i.e. the thermochromic substance or substances) is/are opaque for visible light in a first state (the "opaque state") at temperatures when there is no object having an elevated temperature, and is in a transparent state for visible light when there is an object having an elevated temperature. For example, the thermochromic material may be black (i.e. it absorbs light) or may be white (i.e. reflects all light) in the opaque state. In any case, it is preferred that the change of colour is reversible, e.g. the opaque material can change its colour with increasing temperature and can cool down again to its initial opaque state. Alternatively, the heat which is transferred from the object may change the thermochromic material from being transparent to being opaque.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Thermochromic material in any available form can be used. For example, the thermochromic material may be a liquid crystal or a leuco dye or a mixture of leuco dyes. Especially leuco dyes can be used dispersed in a matrix of other material, in particular plastic material, such as thermoplastics, duroplastics, gels or other kind of plastic material. In particular, polymers are suitable as a matrix for carrying dispersed thermochromic material. Therefore, "matrix" is not to be understood having regular rows and columns. Rather, the matrix material only has the function of embedding the thermochromic material. Another form of using thermochromic material is an ink. Still another form is a lacquer. In both cases, the thermochromic material (in particular a leuco dye or mixture of dyes) is mixed with at least one other component of<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the ink or lacquer. As a result, the surface of a body made of other material can be coated with the ink or lacquer to form a layer comprising thermochromic material. Any liquid component of the ink or dye may dry, may be dried and/or may evaporate so that the coating hardens and forms a permanent solid layer comprising the thermochromic material. In addition or alternatively, the ink or lacquer may be cured, such as by using ultraviolet radiation. According to a further alternative, the ink or lacquer may be a mixture of at least two components additionally comprising the thermochromic material and the at least two components may form a compound during the time interval after applying the ink or lacquer on the surface or within a mould, thereby forming a layer or body of permanent shape. Still another form of using thermochromic material is a foil, for example a plastic film or plastic sheet, wherein the foil comprises the thermochromic substance(s).</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to alternative embodiments of the invention, thermochromic material is used which is adapted to change from an opaque state to a light transparent state with decreasing temperature, i.e. heat from an object having an elevated temperature changes the state of the thermochromic material from the light transparent state to the opaque state.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to a further aspect of the invention, light which has passed through the thermochromic material in the light transparent state is detected by a light detector, which comprises at least one sensor that produces a signal if light is incident to the sensor. Therefore, the invention comprises embodiments, which comprise a light detector having sensors at different locations. In particular, the different sensors may be placed on different sides of a light conducting body and/or may be connected to a light conducting body via different light conductors (such as glass fibre cables).</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Depending on the properties of the thermochromic material mentioned above, the light detector either detects light when there is an object having an elevated temperature and, therefore, the thermochromic material is in the transparent state, or the light detector detects light when there is no object having an elevated temperature and, therefore, the thermochromic material is in the transparent state. For example, the sensor or sensors may be photodiode(s).</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In particular, the thermochromic material and a light conducting body are arranged in such a manner that light incident on the light conducting body has to pass through the thermochromic layer. Although preferred, this does not necessarily mean that all light which is incident on the light conducting body has to pass through the thermochromic layer. For example, the thermochromic layer may be arranged on one side of the light conducting body<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> and other sides of the light conducting body may be covered by opaque material. Although not preferred, some light may pass though the opaque material to the light conducting body and/or some light may be incident on the light conducting body through gaps of the opaque material.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The light detector is coupled with the light conducting body so that light which is incident on the light conducting body is conducted by the light conducting body to the light detector.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In particular, the light conducting body may consist of a light transparent material which has a higher refractive index than neighbouring material, so that total reflection occurs. The use of a light conducting body has the advantage, that the light detector can be placed at a distance to the thermochromic material. Especially with respect to the transfer of electromagnetic energy to a vehicle, the light detector can be placed at a location where the flux density of the magnetic field is small (in particular smaller by a divisor of at least ten or preferably at least one hundred and most preferred at least one thousand) compared to the location of the highest magnetic flux density. Furthermore, the light conducting body in combination with the thermochromic material allows for a purely optical measurement procedure and is therefore independent of the electromagnetic or magnetic field.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">For example, in some of the embodiments and variants described above, it may happen that not all light which is incident on the light conducting body is conducted to the light detector. Furthermore, as mentioned above as well, some light may be incident on the light conducting body which has not passed through the thermochromic material. In order to reliably detect the transparent state of the thermochromic layer, it is preferred that it is decided that the thermochromic layer is in the transparent state if the light detector receives light having at least a predetermined minimum flux density (i.e. light intensity). According to an alternative embodiment, it is decided that the thermochromic layer is in the transparent state if the light detector receives light with a flux density within a predetermined range of possible flux densities (i.e. the minimum and the maximum value of the flux density is predetermined). For example, it may be decided that there is an error if the predetermined maximum flux density is exceeded. In any case, a predetermined minimum flux density guarantees that small flux densities are not recognized as indicating the transparent state. In the process of predetermining the minimum (and optionally also the maximum) flux density, typical illumination conditions and a typical object having a typical elevated temperature in an expected location relative to the thermochromic layer can be considered. In addition or alternatively, experiments can be made in order to set the predetermined value(s). The temperature of the object, the size of the object and the location of the object relative to the thermochromic<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> material may influence the optical properties of the thermochromic material with respect to the amount of light per time interval which passes through the thermochromic material at a given illumination. Of course, increased illumination will result in an increased amount of light per time interval. In particular, larger objects and higher temperatures of the object or objects will lead to larger areas of the thermochromic material becoming transparent (or according to the alternative embodiment, becoming opaque).</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Preferably, the light conducting body comprises a side (e.g. defined by a surface of the light conducting body) which is to be oriented toward an area, in which an object having an elevated temperature may be placed.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In particular, the following is proposed: A detector arrangement for detecting an object having an elevated temperature, the arrangement comprising:
<ul><li>● a light conducting body,</li><li>● a thermochromic layer comprising thermochromic material adapted to change from an opaque state to a light transparent state with increasing temperature or vice versa, the thermochromic layer being arranged in such a manner relative to the light conducting body that light incident on the light conducting body has to pass through the thermochromic layer and</li><li>● a light detector coupled with the light conducting body.</li></ul></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In addition, a method is proposed of detecting an object having an elevated temperature, the method comprising:
<ul><li>● allowing light to pass through a thermochromic layer comprising thermochromic material, wherein heat from the object changes the state of the thermochromic material from an opaque state to a light transparent state or vice versa,</li><li>● receiving the light, which passed through the thermochromic layer, by a light conducting body,</li><li>● guiding the light within the light conducting body toward a light detector coupled with the light conducting body and</li><li>● detecting the light using the light detector, thereby detecting the presence or absence of the object having an elevated temperature.</li></ul></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Furthermore, a method is proposed of manufacturing a detector arrangement for detecting an object having an elevated temperature, the method comprising:
<ul><li>● providing a light conducting body,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></li><li>● arranging a thermochromic layer on at least one side of the light conducting body,<br/>
wherein the thermochromic layer is provided with thermochromic material adapted to change from an opaque state to a light transparent state with increasing temperature or vice versa and</li><li>● coupling a light detector with the light conducting body.</li></ul></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The thermochromic layer comprising thermochromic material may be in any of the forms mentioned above. In particular, the layer (which does not necessarily, but preferably, have a constant layer thickness) may be mechanically connected to the light conducting body. It is preferred that the thermochromic layer is a layer carried by and covering a surface of the light conducting body.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to a specific embodiment which has a particularly flat configuration which is able to detect objects having an elevated temperature in a wide area, the light conducting body is preferably shaped as a plate having a planar surface covered by the thermochromic layer. If an object having an elevated temperature is placed in the area which is faced by the thermochromic layer, the thermochromic layer will be heated and will either become transparent or opaque in the region facing the object.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The light conducting body may be located on a first side of the thermochromic layer and a protective cover may be located on a second side, opposite to the first side, of the thermochromic layer. The protective cover protects the thermochromic layer from external influences, in particular mechanical damage by impacting parts. Optionally, the thermochromic layer may be in mechanical contact with the light conducting body and the protective cover, but there are other possible embodiments. The protective cover may form the outer surface of the arrangement which faces the area where objects having an elevated temperature can be detected.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to one embodiment, the cover is transparent for light. In this case, light from the ambience can pass through the cover and can also pass through the thermochromic layer, provided that the thermochromic layer or an area of the thermochromic layer is in the transparent state.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">An example of a protective cover is made from plastic material. The thickness of the protecting cover is preferably less than 3 mm, in particular less than 1 mm and most preferred less than 0.5 mm. A protective cover having a small thickness has two advantages. It does not significantly reduce the flux density of the passing light and it does not<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> significantly contribute to the thermal capacity of the arrangement, i.e. heat emitted by an object can pass the protective cover.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In any case, the thermochromic layer may be formed by the protective cover which covers the light conducting body on a first side, wherein the thermochromic material is dispersed in light transparent material of the protective cover. Therefore, there is no need for an additional protective cover. In particular, the protective cover may be a light transparent polymer.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In particular, a light emitting device can be located beyond the thermochromic layer, if viewed from the light conducting body. For example, the light emitting device may be an array of light emitting diodes (LEDs). During operation of the arrangement, light emitted by the light emitting device can pass through the thermochromic layer, if the thermochromic layer is in the transparent state. Using a light emitting device has the advantages that the illumination of the thermochromic layer can be controlled and objects having an elevated temperature can be detected which are located in dark or shaded area. In addition, not only the amount of light, which is produced by the light emitting device per time interval, can be controlled, but also the amount of light per time interval as a function of time. For example, the intensity of the light can be increased, decreased or both according to a predetermined function of time and it can be decided that the thermochromic layer is in the transparent state only, if the same or a similar time-dependent behaviour is observed with the detection signal produced by the light detector which is coupled with the light conducting body.
