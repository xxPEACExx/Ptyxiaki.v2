For example, a pressurized water reactor (PWR) generates high-temperature and high-pressure water which is not boiled throughout a reactor core, using light water as a nuclear reactor coolant and a neutron moderator. The steam generator exchanges heat between the high-temperature and high-pressure water (the primary cooling water) and the secondary cooling water to generate steam. The steam turbine drives a turbine by this steam, and the electric generator generates electricity by this driving power.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the steam generator, a hollow airtight body portion is provided therein with a tube bundle shroud at a predetermined distance with an inner wall face thereof, a plurality of reverse U-shaped heat transfer tubes are provided in the tube bundle shroud, end portions of the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> heat transfer tubes are supported by the tube plate, and thus an inlet side channel head and an outlet side channel head of the primary cooling water are formed at a lower end portion of a body portion. In addition, in the body portion, an inlet portion of the secondary cooling water is positioned and provided on the upside of the tube bundle shroud, a steam-water separator and a moisture separator are arranged up and down, and a steam outlet is provided on the upper side thereof.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Accordingly, the primary cooling water is supplied from the cooling water tube to the plurality of heat transfer tubes through the inlet side channel head, and the secondary cooling water is supplied from the inlet portion into the body portion. Then, since heat exchange is performed between the primary cooling water (hot water) flowing in the plurality of heat transfer tubes and the secondary cooling water (cold water) circulating in the body portion, the secondary cooling water absorbs the heat, and thus steam is generated. The water of the generated steam is removed by the steam-water separator, the steam from which the moisture thereof is removed by the moisture separator is discharged from the steam outlet, and the heat-exchanged primary cooling water is discharged from the outlet side channel head.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, in the steam generator, high-pressure water as the primary cooling water is supplied into the plurality of heat transfer tubes, the external secondary cooling water is heated to generate steam, and thus the heat transfer tubes easily vibrate. In this case, the lower end portions of the heat transfer tubes are supported by the tube plate, and an upper U bend portion is supported by an anti-vibration bar inserted between the heat transfer tubes. However, the heat transfer tube may partially deteriorate<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> due to the long use, abrasion occurs at a through-hole of a tube support plate or a contact portion with the anti-vibration bar, and thus the heat transfer tube may be thinned. When the heat transfer tube deteriorates or is thinned, a function thereof may be damaged. Accordingly, as unusable, a plug is fixed at each end portion of the heat transfer tubes to prevent the primary cooling water from flowing in, and a stabilizer (a wire or the like) is inserted therein to suppress vibration.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As such a technique, as a general vibration stabilizing method, there is a stabilizer including only one or a plurality of wires. In addition, for example, strengthening of a function is disclosed in Patent Documents as described below. In a heat exchange tube vibration stabilization method and device disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP60159595A"><text>60-159595</text></patcit>, a plurality of sleeves are fixed to cables at a predetermined distance in an axial direction, a leading end assembly is fixed to a leading end portion, to configure a tube plug attachment seal assembly, and the vibration stabilization device is inserted and fixed into the heat transfer tube, to stabilize the vibration of the deteriorating tube. In addition, an absorption method and device of vibration energy of a vibrating tube disclosed in Japanese Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2759090B"><text>2759090</text></patcit> are configured by connecting a cable end portion installation tool to a cable leading member through a plurality of cables, and the absorption device is inserted into a heat transfer tube, to absorb vibration energy of the tube.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, even when a function is strengthened as well as a simple structure of only a wire, in the heat exchange tube vibration stabilization device described above, since the plurality of sleeves are fixed to the cables, the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> vibration stabilization device may integrally vibrate when the heat transfer tube vibrates, and thus it is difficult to sufficiently suppress the vibration of the heat transfer tube. In addition, in the absorption device of the vibration energy of the tube, the plurality of cables are merely disposed in the tubes. Even in this case, when the heat transfer tube vibrates, the cable may integrally vibrate, and thus it is difficult to sufficiently suppress the vibration of the heat transfer tube.</p><heading id="h0003">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a vibration suppression device of a heat transfer tube including: a cord member that has flexibility and is disposed in a heat transfer tube;

However, since the second sleeve further moves relatively with respect to the heat transfer tube as much as the large second gap from a position where the first sleeve comes in contact with the inner face of the heat transfer tube, the second sleeve drastically vibrates in the reverse direction with respect to the vibration of the heat transfer tube, so that it is possible to efficiently dissipate the vibration energy of the heat transfer tube.<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --></p><p id="p0105" num="0105">According to the embodiments, since the first sleeve having the spherical shape is set with the diameter larger than that of the circular second sleeve, the second sleeve can move after the first sleeve moves and comes in contact with the inner face of the heat transfer tube when the heat transfer tube vibrates, so that it is possible to efficiently suppress the vibration of the heat transfer tube.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">According to the embodiments, it is possible to efficiently move the first sleeve and the second sleeve with respect to the vibration of the heat transfer tube.</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">According to the embodiments, the sleeve is movable relatively with respect to the heat transfer tube in an axial core direction. For this reason, when the heat transfer tube vibrates, each sleeve relatively moves in the axial core direction of the heat transfer tube, so that the sleeve and the heat transfer tube interfere with each other. Thus, vibration energy of the heat transfer tube is dissipated by vibration energy of the sleeve, so that it is possible to effectively absorb and suppress the vibration of the heat transfer tube.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">According to the embodiments, since a movement range of the sleeve is specified by the pair of positioning members, it is possible to specify the position of the sleeve with respect to the heat transfer tube, and thus it is possible to effectively dispose the sleeve in the vibration range of the heat transfer tube.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">According to the embodiments, the sleeve is movable relatively with respect to the heat transfer tube as much as the third gap in the axial core direction, between the pair of positioning members. For this reason, when the heat transfer vibrates, the sleeve moves relatively with respect to the heat transfer tube as much as the third gap,<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> and thus it is possible to effectively absorb and suppress the vibration of the heat transfer tube.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">According to the embodiments, when the heat transfer tube vibrates, the sleeve moves relatively with respect to the heat transfer tube. In addition, in this case, movement thereof is promoted by elastic force of the biasing member, and thus it is possible to effectively absorb and suppress the vibration of the heat transfer tube.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">According to the embodiments, since the sleeve is movable relatively with respect to the heat transfer tube in the radial direction and the axial core direction, the sleeve appropriately relatively moves irrespective of the vibration direction of the heat transfer tube, and thus it is possible to effectively absorb and suppress the vibration of the heat transfer tube.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">According to the embodiments, it is possible to easily dispose the sleeve at a predetermined position in the heat transfer tube through the cord member by the towing portion, and it is possible to easily close the end portion of the heat transfer tube by the closure member, so that it is possible to improve workability.</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">According to the embodiments, it is possible to appropriately suppress the vibration of the U-shape portion of the heat transfer tube by the relative movement of the plurality of sleeves.</p><p id="p0114" num="0114">According to the embodiments, the high-pressure water as the primary cooling water flows into the plurality of heat transfer tubes, and the secondary cooling water flowing in the body portion is heated to generate steam, so that the heat transfer tube easily vibrates. In this case, when the heat transfer tube vibrates, the cord member and each sleeve relatively move with respect to each other in the radial direction of the heat transfer tube, so that the<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> cord member, the sleeve, and the heat transfer tube interfere with each other. Thus, vibration energy of the heat transfer tube is dissipated by vibration energy of the cord member and the sleeve, so that it is possible to effectively absorb and suppress the vibration of the heat transfer tube.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">According to the vibration suppression device of the heat transfer tube and the steam generator of the invention, since the cord member having flexibility and the plurality of sleeves that are provided outside the cord member with the first gap and are disposed on the inner face of the heat transfer tube with the second gap are provided, the cord member and the sleeves move relatively with respect to the heat transfer tube, and thus it is possible to appropriately and effectively absorb and suppress the vibration of the heat transfer tube.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56976642" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A vibration suppression device of a heat transfer tube (100, 200, 300, 400, 500) comprising:
