It is an object of the present invention to provide an electric power steering apparatus that can resolve such a problem.</p><heading id="h0005">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention is applied to an electric power steering apparatus comprising a motor for generating steering assist power, a torque sensor for detecting steering torque of a steering wheel, means for storing a correspondence relationship between the steering torque and basic assist torque, and means for controlling the motor so that steering assist power is generated according to the basic assist torque corresponding to the detected steering torque.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The inventors have conceived the present invention based on the discovery that the control characteristic of the motor for generating the steering assist power according to the output signal of the torque sensor varies according to an assist gradient that is a rate of change of the basic assist torque to the steering torque. To be more precise, when the assist gradient increases, the phase margin in the open loop control system characteristic of the output to input of the torque sensor decreases, so that stability of the control system decreases. Therefore, the control<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> characteristic can be optimized by varying the correction amount of the output of the motor according to the assist gradient.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the present invention, the electric power steering apparatus preferably comprises means for determining the assist gradient corresponding to the detected steering torque, a low-pass filter for removing a high-frequency component from an output signal of the torque sensor, assist gradient response phase lead compensation means for advancing phase of the output signal of the torque sensor that passes through the low-pass filter according to decrease of the assist gradient, means for determining a rotation angular velocity corresponding value that corresponds to an angular velocity of rotation of the steering wheel or the motor, means for storing a correspondence relationship between the rotation angular velocity corresponding value and a motor output correction value that is in inverse correlation with this rotation angular velocity corresponding value, and means for correcting the output of the motor according to the motor output correction value corresponding to the determined rotation angular velocity corresponding value.<br/>
As a result, in a frequency response characteristic that is represented by the frequency of the disturbance torque inputted into the steering system from the ground surface via the wheels and the gain of the steering torque to the disturbance torque, the correspondence relationship between the rotation angular velocity corresponding value and the motor output correction value can be set such that the gain is decreased at a resonance frequency by the correction of the output of the motor. Therefore, the output of the motor for generating steering assist power is corrected according to a value that is in inverse correlation with the angular velocity of rotation of the steering torque or the motor, and the gain of the steering<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> torque to the disturbance torque is decreased at the resonance frequency, whereby the effect of disturbance on the steering operation can be reduced.<br/>
Moreover, in a range in which the assist gradient is small, the detected steering torque corresponding to the basic assist torque is increased relatively to the torque input into the torque sensor, the correction amount of the output of the motor is increased, and the gain of the steering torque to the disturbance torque is decreased in a frequency range where the filter gain is increased, whereby the effect of disturbance on the steering operation can be further decreased.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the present invention, the electric power steering apparatus preferably comprises means for determining the assist gradient corresponding to the detected steering torque, a low-pass filter for removing a high-frequency component from an output signal of the torque sensor, assist gradient response phase lag compensation means for delaying phase of the output signal of the torque sensor that passes through the low-pass filter according to increase of the assist gradient, means for determining a rotation angular velocity corresponding value that corresponds to an angular velocity of rotation of the steering wheel or the motor, means for storing a correspondence relationship between the rotation angular velocity corresponding value and a motor output correction value that is in inverse correlation with this rotation angular velocity corresponding value, and means for correcting the output of the motor according to the motor output correction value corresponding to the determined rotation angular velocity corresponding value.<br/>
As a result, in a frequency response characteristic that is represented<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> by the frequency of the disturbance torque inputted into the steering system from the ground surface via the wheels and the gain of the steering torque to the disturbance torque, the correspondence relationship between the rotation angular velocity corresponding value and the motor output correction value can be set such that the gain is decreased at a resonance frequency by the correction of the output of the motor. Therefore, the output of the motor for generating steering assist power is corrected according to a value that is in inverse correlation with the angular velocity of rotation of the steering torque or the motor, and the gain of the steering torque to the disturbance torque is decreased at the resonance frequency, whereby the effect of disturbance on the steering operation can be reduced.<br/>
Moreover, in a range in which the assist gradient is large, the assist gradient can be virtually decreased in an unstable frequency range, so that the stability of the control system can be increased, and the upper limit of the assist gradient can be increased to improve the steering assist characteristic.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the present invention, it is preferred that an upper limit value is set for the assist gradient that varies according to variation of the steering torque, and the correspondence relationship between the steering torque and the basic assist torque is set such that the set upper limit value of the assist gradient varies according to variation of vehicle velocity, in which there are provided means for detecting the vehicle velocity, means for determining the set upper limit value of the assist gradient at the detected vehicle velocity, a low-pass filter for removing a high-frequency component from an output signal of the torque sensor, and assist gradient response<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> phase compensation means for performing phase lead-lag compensation for the output signal of the torque sensor that passes through the low-pass filter in such a manner that a frequency of an end point of the phase lead and a frequency of a start point of the phase lag vary according to the set upper limit value of the assist gradient at the detected vehicle velocity, and the lead-lag compensation is performed in such a manner that the frequency of the end point of the phase lag decreases and the frequency of the start point of the phase lag increases according to increase of the vehicle velocity.<br/>
As a result, as the assist gradient decreases according to increase of the vehicle velocity, the phase margin in the open-loop control system characteristic of the output to input of the torque sensor increases, so that the stability of the control system improves. Further, when the vehicle velocity increases, the set upper limit value of the assist gain decreases and the detected steering torque corresponding to the basic assist torque increases relatively to the torque input into the torque sensor; therefore the responsiveness to the steering operation can be improved. Thus, both the stability of the control system and the responsiveness to the steering operation can be improved.</p><heading id="h0006">EFFECT OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0014"

As a result, because the gain of the torque input into the calculation part 41 to the torque input into the torque sensor 22 decreases in a range in which the assist gradient R is large, the detected steering torque corresponding to the basic assist torque To is reduced relatively to the torque input into the torque sensor 22, whereby the stability of the control system can be improved by decreasing the correction amount of the output of the motor 10, and the steering assist characteristic can be improved by increasing the upper limit of the assist gradient R.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">As a modification example of the first embodiment, or as a modification example of the second embodiment, the output of the motor 10 can be corrected according to the angular velocity dθ<sub>h</sub>/dt of rotation of the steering wheel 2 instead of the angular velocity dθ<sub>m</sub>/dt of rotation of the motor 10. In this case, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0021">Fig. 21</figref>, the steering angle sensor 23 instead of the angle sensor 27 is connected to the controller 20, and as<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> shown in <figref idrefs="f0022">Fig. 22</figref>, the angular velocity dθ<sub>h</sub>/dt of rotation is determined as a rotation angular velocity corresponding value in the calculation part 31 by the differential of the steering angle θ<sub>h</sub> detected by the steering angle sensor 23, and a set correspondence relationship between the angular velocity dθ<sub>h</sub>/dt of rotation and the correction basic current ia is stored. The correspondence relationship between the angular velocity dθ<sub>h</sub>/dt of rotation and the correction basic current ia is set such that the correction basic current ia is in inverse correlation with the angular velocity dθ<sub>h</sub>/dt of rotation, and the correction basic current ia corresponding to the determined angular velocity dθ<sub>h</sub>/dt of rotation is calculated in the calculation part 31 based on the stored correspondence relationship. The effect of disturbance on the steering operation can be inhibited by replacing the rotation angle θ<sub>m</sub> with the steering angle θ<sub>h</sub> in the abovementioned Formula (15), and replacing the control gain Kdo of the angular velocity dθ<sub>m</sub>/dt of rotation with the control gain of the angular velocity dθ<sub>h</sub>/dt of rotation in the Formulas (15), (16), (17). Other features of the modification example of the first embodiment are similar to those of the first embodiment, and the modification example is able to have functions and effects identical to those of the first embodiment; and other features of the modification example of the second embodiment are similar to those of the second embodiment, and the modification example is able to have functions and effects identical to those of the second embodiment.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061"><figref idrefs="f0023 f0024 f0025 f0026 f0027">Fig. 23 to 27</figref> illustrate the third embodiment. The components identical to those of the first comparative embodiment are denoted by identical symbols,<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> and the difference from the first comparative embodiment is explained hereinbelow. The difference from the first comparative embodiment is that the correction of the output of the motor 10 according to the angular acceleration d<sup>2</sup>θ<sub>h</sub>/dt<sup>2</sup> of rotation of the steering wheel 2 is not performed. Accordingly, the steering angle sensor 23 is not provided. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0024">Fig. 24</figref>, the low-pass filter 61 is connected via a phase compensation filter 71 to the calculation part 41. The phase compensation filter 71 performs phase lead-lag compensation for the output signal of the torque sensor 22 that passes through the low-pass filter 61. The compensation control part 20a of the controller 20 determines a set upper limit value Ro of the assist gradient R at the detected vehicle velocity V based on the correspondence relationship shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, and varies the frequency of an end point of the phase lead and the frequency of a start point of the phase lag in the phase lead-lag compensation with the phase compensation filter 71 according to the set upper limit value Ro of the determined assist gradient R. As a result, the detected steering torque T corresponding to the basic assist torque To varies according to the variation of the assist gradient R, and the correction amount of the output of the motor 10 is varied by the variation of the basic assist torque To.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062"><figref idrefs="f0025">Fig. 25</figref> represents a frequency response characteristic of a torque signal that is inputted into the calculation part 41 to determine the detected steering torque T, in which the frequency of the output signal of the torque sensor 22 is plotted on the abscissa, and the gain of the output from the phase compensation filter 71 to the input into the torque sensor 22 is plotted on the ordinate. Where the transfer function of the phase<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> compensation filter 71 is denoted by Gp, the transfer function of the low-pass filter 61 is denoted by Gf, the input into the torque sensor 22 is denoted by Si, and the output from the phase compensation filter 71 is denoted by So, the equation So = Gp · Gf · Si is valid. Here, where t1, t2, and t3 stand for time constants, a1 and a2 stand for filter constants, s stands for a Laplace operator, Gp · Gf = {(1 + a1 · t1 · s) · (1 + a2 · t2 · s)}/{(1 + t1 · s) · (1 + t2 · s) · (1 + t3 · s)}, t1 &gt; t2, a1 ≤ 1, and a2 ≥1, the frequency of a start point of the phase lag is 1/(2π · t1), the phase lag ends at a frequency of 1/(2π · a1 · t1), the frequency of a start point of the phase lead is 1/(2π · a2 · t2), and the phase lead ends at a frequency of 1/(2π · t2). The filter constants a1 and a2 are taken as functions of the set upper limit value Ro of the assist gradient R, and the correspondence relationship between the filter constant a1 and the set upper limit value Ro and the correspondence relationship between the filter constant a2 and the set upper limit value Ro are stored in the controller 20. In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0026">Fig. 26</figref>, the filter constant a1 is in direct correlation with the set upper limit value Ro, and as shown in <figref idrefs="f0027">Fig. 27</figref>, the filter constant a2 is in inverse correlation with the set upper limit value Ro. The compensation control part 20a determines the filter constants a1 and a2 corresponding to the set upper limit value Ro determined based on the detected vehicle velocity V, and sets the filter constants a1 and a2 of the phase compensation filter 71 to the determined values. As a result, the vehicle velocity V becomes the larger, the set upper limit value Ro becomes the smaller; therefore the filter constant a1 becomes large and the filter constant a2 becomes small. Accordingly, when the vehicle velocity V<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> increases from the state shown by a solid line in <figref idrefs="f0025">Fig. 25</figref>, the frequency of the end point of the phase lead of the output signal from the torque sensor 22 decreases as shown by the broken line, and the frequency of the start point of the phase lag increases; therefore the gain of the output from the phase compensation filter 71 to the input into the torque sensor 22 increases.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Other features are similar to those of the first comparative embodiment, and the target drive current i* of the motor 10 is determined by multiplying the basic assist current io by the basic vehicle velocity gain Gv. The electric power steering apparatus of the third embodiment has functions and effects different from those of the first comparative embodiment. To be more precise, as the vehicle velocity V increases and the assist gradient R decreases, the phase margin in the open-loop characteristic of the output to input of the torque sensor 22 increases, and therefore the stability of the control system improves. Further, when the vehicle velocity V increases, the set upper limit value Ro of the assist gradient R decreases, and the detected steering torque T corresponding to the basic assist torque To increases relatively to the torque input into the torque sensor 22; therefore the responsiveness to the steering operation improves. Thus, both the stability of the control system and the responsiveness to the steering operation can be improved.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments. For example, the mechanism that transmits the rotation of the steering wheel to the wheels so that the steering angle varies is not limited to that in the embodiments, and the rotation of the steering wheel<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> can be transmitted from the steering shaft to the wheels via a link mechanism instead of the rack and pinion mechanism. Furthermore, the mechanism for transmitting the output of the motor for generating steering assist power to the steering system is not limited to that in the embodiments, provided that the steering assist power is provided, for example, the steering assist power can be provided by driving a ball nut engaged with a ball screw integrated with the rack by the output of the motor. Furthermore, instead of determining the basic vehicle velocity gain Gv in the calculation part 42, it can be adopted that a correspondence relationship between the steering torque T and the basic assist current io is stored, for example, as a table for each of a plurality of predetermined vehicle velocities in the calculation part 41, and the correspondence relationship between the steering torque T and the basic assist current io is determined by utilizing the interpolation calculation when the detected vehicle velocity V stands between the predetermined vehicle velocities.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977109" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An electric power steering apparatus (1) comprising:
