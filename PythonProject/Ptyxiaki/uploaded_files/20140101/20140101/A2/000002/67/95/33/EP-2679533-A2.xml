Hereinafter, although a large concrete block for harbor construction work will be illustrated as one example of such large concrete blocks, the present invention is not limited to this, and all kinds of concrete structures which are lifted by cranes fall within the bounds of the present invention.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A large concrete block 10 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 and 2</figref> has lifting eye members 20 in an upper surface thereof, which are used when the large concrete block 10 is lifted by a crane.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Because large concrete blocks 10 are placed on top of one another, if the lifting eye members 20 protrude upwards from the upper surface of the large concrete block 10, they interfere with another large concrete block which is placed on the top of the large concrete block 10.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">To avoid the above problem, lifting eye member receiving depressions 11 are formed in the upper surface of the large concrete block 10, and an upper end of each lifting eye member 20 is disposed in the corresponding lifting eye member receiving depression 11.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The lifting eye members 20 are disposed in a mold before concrete is cast into the mold to form the large concrete block 10. When the concrete casting is completed, lower ends of the lifting eye members 20 are embedded in the concrete so that the lifting eye members 20 can be fixed to the concrete block 10. Furthermore, the lower end of each lifting eye member 20 generally has a fixing structure by which the lifting eye member 20 is more reliably fixed to the concrete block.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Meanwhile, <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> illustrates a hollow block type of large concrete block 10 where a central portion thereof is empty and an upper end thereof is open.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Each lifting eye member 20 can be formed by different kinds of methods, for example, using a reinforcing bar, a wire rope, etc.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However, the conventional large concrete block has the following problems.
<ol><li>(1) Although the lifting eye members are used only when lifting the concrete block, because the lifting eye members are firmly fixed in the concrete block, they cannot be reused.
<br/>
Particularly, in the case where the large concrete block is installed under the surface of the sea, the lifting eye member is made of a stainless wire rope which is comparatively expensive. Thus, there is a problem in that the lifting eye member that is expensive cannot be reused.
</li><li>(2) Concrete does not corrode, but the lifting eye member that is made of metal may corrode. If the lifting eye member corrodes, the volume thereof is increased. If the volume of the lifting eye member is excessively increased, the concrete block may be broken. This problem is increased when the concrete block is used for sea construction work, in other words, installed under the surface of the sea.</li><li>(3) As stated above, in the case of the large concrete block configured such that large concrete blocks are placed on top of one another, separate depressions for receiving lifting eye members must be formed. Such a structure where the lifting eye member receiving depressions must be formed makes it difficult to manufacture the concrete block and increases construction time.</li><li>(4) After the large concrete block has been placed on a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> predetermined place, if a long period of time has passed, the lifting eye members easily corrode. Thus, when it is required to lift the large concrete block again, it may be impossible to lift the large concrete block.</li><li>(5) If the force with which the lifting eye members are fixed to the large concrete block is not sufficient, a lifting eye member may be undesirably removed from the large concrete block while lifting the large concrete block, thus causing an accident. In this case, the large concrete block that has been dropped and shocked may become unusable.</li></ol></p><heading id="h0003"><b>Disclosure</b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b>Technical Problem</b></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a large concrete block which includes a concrete block body made of concrete, and a connection-wire-rope insert tube which is made of synthetic resin and is provided in the concrete block body in such a way that a medial portion thereof is embedded in the concrete block body and opposite ends thereof are disposed in an upper surface of the concrete block body and oriented upwards.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>Technical Solution</b></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><p id="p0012" num="0012">In order to accomplish the above object, in an aspect, the present invention provides a large concrete block for crane lifting, including: a concrete block body made of concrete; and a connection-wire-rope insert tube made of synthetic resin, the connection-wire-rope insert tube being embedded at a medial portion thereof in the concrete block body in such a way that opposite ends of the connection-wire-rope insert tube are disposed in an upper surface of the concrete block body and oriented upwards.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The medial portion of the connection-wire-rope insert tube may be arranged to have an arc shape that is convex downwards along a longitudinal direction thereof.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The connection-wire-rope insert tube may have a corrugated tube shape.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A tube stopper may be removably coupled to each of opposite ends of the connection-wire-rope insert tube.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The large concrete block may further include a connection wire rope, with lifting eyes provided on respective opposite ends of the connection wire rope, wherein the connection wire rope is disposed in the connection-wire-rope insert tube so as to be movable along the connection-wire-rope insert tube, and the lifting eyes of the connection wire rope are exposed to the outside from the connection-wire-rope insert tube.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing a large concrete block for crane<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> lifting, including: disposing a connection-wire-rope insert tube made of synthetic resin in a mold for forming a concrete block body in such a way that the connection-wire-rope insert tube has a U shape; and casting concrete into the mold and forming a concrete block body in such a way that a medial portion of the connection-wire-rope insert tube is embedded in the concrete block body and opposite ends of the connection-wire-rope insert tube are disposed at an upper surface of the concrete block body and oriented upwards.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for installation of a large concrete block, including: a concrete block manufacturing operation of disposing a connection-wire-rope insert tube made of synthetic resin in a mold for forming a concrete block body in such a way that the connection-wire-rope insert tube has a U shape, and casting concrete into the mold and forming a concrete block body in such a way that a medial portion of the connection-wire-rope insert tube is embedded in the concrete block body and opposite ends of the connection-wire-rope insert tube are disposed at an upper surface of the concrete block body and oriented upwards; a connection wire rope installation operation of passing a first end of a connection wire rope through the connection-wire-rope insert tube so that the first end of the connection wire rope is exposed to the outside from a first end of the connection-wire-rope insert tube while a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> second end of the connection wire rope is exposed to the outside from a second end of the connection-wire-rope insert tube; a lifting and placing operation of connecting a crane to the first and second ends of the connection wire rope, lifting the large concrete block using the crane, and placing the large concrete block at a predetermined place; and a connection wire rope removal operation of removing the connection wire rope from the connection-wire-rope insert tube after the lifting and placing operation has been completed.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The connection wire rope may include lifting eyes provided on respective opposite ends of the connection wire rope. In the lifting and placing operation, the crane may use both the lifting eyes to lift the large concrete block and place the large concrete block at a predetermined place, and the connection wire rope removal operation may comprise separating either of the lifting eyes from the crane and lifting a remaining one of the lifting eyes using the crane so that the connection wire rope is removed from the connection-wire-rope insert tube.</p><heading id="h0006"><b>Advantageous Effects</b></heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">The present invention has the following effects.
<ol><li>(1) The present invention does not require a lifting eye member that is made of metal to manufacture a large concrete block, but only uses a connection-wire-rope insert tube made<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> of synthetic resin. Therefore, the present invention can solve the problems which have been caused by using the lifting eye member.</li><li>(2) The connection-wire-rope insert tube of the present invention has no problem of corrosion. Hence, whenever it is required to lift the large concrete block again, the connection-wire-rope insert tube can be reused in such a way that a connection wire rope is connected to the connection-wire-rope insert tube.</li><li>(3) In the conventional lifting eye member, it is difficult for the lifting eye member to be firmly fixed to the large concrete block. Thus, a problem of the lifting eye member being removed from the large concrete block is frequently caused. On the other hand, in the present invention, the connection-wire-rope insert tube has a downward-convex arc shape, in other words, a U shape, whereby a concrete portion that is disposed above the connection-wire-rope insert tube can stably support the connection-wire-rope insert tube. Therefore, there is no problem of the connection wire rope being removed from the large concrete block when the large concrete block is lifted or placed at a predetermined place.</li></ol></p><heading id="h0007"><b>Description of Drawings</b></heading><p id="p0021" num="0021"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 and 2</figref> are, respectively, a perspective view and a<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> sectional view of a large concrete block according to a conventional technique;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is a perspective view of a large concrete block according to the conventional technique;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">5</figref> are, respectively, a perspective view and a sectional view of a large concrete block according to a first embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref> is a view illustrating a method for manufacturing the large concrete block of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Figs. 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">8</figref> are views illustrating a method for installation of the large concrete block of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 9 and 10</figref> are, respectively, a perspective view and a sectional view of a large concrete block according to a second embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 11</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a large concrete block according to a third embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 12</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a large concrete block according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 13</figref> is a view illustrating a method for manufacturing the large concrete block of <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 12</figref>.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0008">&lt;Description of the Reference Numerals in the Drawings&gt;</heading><p id="p0022" num="0022"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>100:</dt><dd>large concrete block 110: concrete block body<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></dd><dt>120:</dt><dd>connection-wire-rope insert tube</dd><dt>130:</dt><dd>connection wire rope 131: lifting eye</dd><dt>132:</dt><dd>towing wire</dd><dt>140:</dt><dd>tube stopper 141: external threaded part</dd><dt>142:</dt><dd>rotation handling part</dd></dl></p><heading id="h0009"><b>Best Mod</b></heading><p id="p0023" num="0023">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings, such that those skilled in the art can easily implement the present invention.

In other words, the connection-wire-rope insert tube 120 is configured to have a U shape.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Furthermore, the connection-wire-rope insert tube 120 is arranged such that opposite ends thereof are disposed in an upper surface of the concrete block body 110 and oriented upwards. In this embodiment, although the opposite ends of the connection-wire-rope insert tube 120 are illustrated as being oriented in the upright direction, this is only one example. For instance, the opposite ends of the connection-wire-rope insert tube 120 may be oriented diagonally upwards towards the central portion of the concrete block body 110.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Even if the connection-wire-rope insert tube 120 is exposed to seawater or the like for a long period of time, there is no probability of corrosion of the tube 120, because<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> it is made of synthetic resin.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Preferably, the connection-wire-rope insert tube 120 has a corrugated tube shape. For example, the connection-wire-rope insert tube 120 may be an ELP tube which is a kind of corrugated tube and is used to arrange wires. The reason for this is due to the fact that, because corrugated tubes are typically flexible, when the connection-wire-rope insert tube 120 is installed in the concrete block body at a site, work of bending the connection-wire-rope insert tube 120 into a downward-convex arc shape can be facilitated.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Furthermore, if the connection-wire-rope insert tube 120 has a corrugated tube shape, there is an advantage in that it can be more closely integrated with the concrete block body 110.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">A method for manufacturing the large concrete block of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref> will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref>.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6a</figref> illustrates the shape of a mold before concrete casting.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The mold is formed corresponding to the size and shape of the concrete block body.
