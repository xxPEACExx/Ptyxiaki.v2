To perform the landing properly, the helicopter approaches a landing pad at an airport, after executing instrument approach procedures to a ATC designated target such as at or near a runway threshold, by performing an air taxi maneuver. Air taxiing is the flying of the helicopter along, and at very low altitude above the airport terrain. While air taxiing, a pilot must fly a route per clearance and avoid obstacles such as parked or taxiing aircraft and building and in what may be limited visibility due to weather, lack of sunlight, or positioning of the sun. In a large airport environment, the actual helicopter landing pad may be a significant distance away from the instrument approach point and may not be visible due to distance or obstructions even in day time VMC operations.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">When pilots air taxi in visual meteorological conditions, it is often difficult to judge the air taxi route in three dimension space to properly arrive at the landing pad. This is more of an issue in limited visibility when the landing pad is not in sight. Given the trend of tighter path management for increased safety within terminal airspace, and congested airport environment, it is desirable to provide an intuitive pathway display that is compatible with helicopter parameters.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">This is especially true when transiting to visual flight at the end of an instrument approach procedure to the airport. While flying the instrument approach, pilots are trained to monitor progress and make adjustment with reference to the flight instruments, e.g., the Flight Director (FD), the glideslope deviation scale, and the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI). These standard flight instruments have been designed to provide guidance cues in an accurate and unambiguous manner. During the visual segment of an instrument approach,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the crew transitions from the instrument scan to visual cues in the outside environment. This transition requires the pilot to change from the abstraction of the schematic flight instruments to real world analog visual cues. These visual cues include: the apparent shape and size of the runway, the spacing and size of runway markings, and the apparent relative motion of the helicopter along the ground. An abrupt transition from instruments to visual can be disorienting.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a display system and method for assisting a helicopter pilot in performing an air taxi approach to a landing pad after performing an instrument approach to an airport. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the exemplary embodiments will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.</p><heading id="h0003">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">A display system and method are provided for assisting a helicopter pilot in performing an air taxi approach to a landing pad after performing an instrument approach to an airport.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A first exemplary embodiment comprises a method of providing visual guidance from an instrument approach to a landing pad at an airport for an aircrew of a helicopter, comprising displaying an aim point for the helicopter during the instrument approach; and displaying an air taxi path from the aim point to the landing pad.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A second exemplary embodiment comprises a method of providing visual guidance from an instrument approach to a landing pad at an airport for an aircrew of a helicopter, comprising displaying first symbology for the instrument approach including an aircraft aim point; displaying second symbology including a helicopter aim point; and displaying an air taxi path from the helicopter aim point to the landing pad.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A third exemplary embodiment comprises display system comprising a display; a database; an avionics system; a processor coupled to the display, database, and avionics system, the processor configured to display first symbology for the instrument approach including an aircraft aim point; display second symbology including a helicopter aim point; and display an air taxi path from the helicopter aim point to the landing pad.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention will hereinafter be described in conjunction with the following drawing figures, wherein like numerals denote like elements, and</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a known block diagram of a vehicle display system for generating images in accordance with exemplary embodiments;</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a simulated image of a landing environment in accordance with an exemplary embodiment;</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a simulated image of a landing environment in accordance with another exemplary embodiment; and</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart of a method in accordance with an exemplary embodiment.</p><heading id="h0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">The following detailed description is merely illustrative in nature and is not intended to limit the embodiments of the subject matter or the application and uses of such embodiments.

In some embodiments, system 110 may be a self-contained system such that each of the components described below are contained in a single housing and are dedicated exclusively to serving the functions of system 110, while in other embodiments, the various components described below may be standalone components or they may be components that are used as part of other systems and which are configured to be used as a shared resource between such other systems and system 110.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, system 110 includes Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and avionics sensors 114, databases 116, a display unit 120, a display screen 122, and a processor 124 including memory 118. The databases 116 include a synthetic vision system (SVS) and a terrain and runway database.

Display screen 122 is configured to be controlled by display unit 120 and may be used to display any type of image including, but not limited to, graphics and text. In some embodiments, display unit 120 may include multiple display screens 122 and/or system 110 may include multiple display units 120.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Processor 124 may be any type of computer, computer system, microprocessor, collection of logic devices, or any other analog or digital circuitry that is configured to calculate, and/or to perform algorithms, and/or to execute software applications, and/or to execute sub-routines, and/or to be loaded with and to execute any type of computer program. Processor 124 may comprise a single processor or a plurality of processors acting in concert. In some embodiments, processor 124 may be dedicated for use exclusively with system 110 while in other embodiments processor 124 may be shared with other systems on board the helicopter. In still other embodiments, processor 124 may be integrated into any of the other components of system 110.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Processor 124 is communicatively coupled to the GNSS/avionics sensors 114 and databases 116, and is operatively coupled to display unit 120. Such communicative and operative connections may be effected through the use of any suitable means of transmission, including both wired and wireless connections. For example, each component may be physically connected to processor 124 via a coaxial cable or via any other type of wired connection effective to convey electronic signals. In other embodiments, each component may be communicatively connected to processor 124 across a bus or other similar communication corridor. Examples of suitable wireless connections include, but are not limited to, a Bluetooth connection, a Wi-Fi connection, an infrared connection, OneWireless<sup>™</sup> connection, or the like. The OneWireless<sup>™</sup> connection has been developed by Honeywell International, Inc., the Assignee of this document.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Being communicatively and/or operatively coupled with the GNSS/avionics sensors 114, databases 116, and display unit 120 provide processor 124 with a pathway for the receipt and transmission of signals, commands, instructions, and interrogations to and from each of the other components. Processor 124 is configured (i.e., loaded with and being capable of executing suitable computer code, software and/or applications) to interact with and to coordinate with each of the other components of system 110 for the purpose of overlaying images corresponding to the second signal 130. For example, in the illustrated<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> embodiment, the processor 124 is configured to receive a second signal 130 from the databases 116 and to send a command to the display unit 120 instructing the display unit 120 to display portions of a corresponding image generated from database or symbols, on a display screen 122. The processor 124 may also be configured to receive a first signal 128 from the helicopter's GNSS/Avionics system 114 to aid displaying data in an iconic format.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In operation, the processor 120 is configured to process data obtained from the GNSS and avionics 114 of flight status data for the host helicopter. In this regard, the sources of flight status data generate, measure, and/or provide different types of data related to the operational status of the host helicopter, the environment in which the host helicopter is operating, flight parameters, and the like. In practice, the sources of flight status data may be realized using line replaceable units (LRUs), transducers, accelerometers, instruments, sensors, and other well known devices. The data provided by the sources of flight status data may include, for example and without limitation: airspeed data; groundspeed data; altitude data; attitude data, including pitch data and roll data; yaw data; geographic position data (high integrity), such as a combination of GPS (wide area augmentation system) and inertial reference system data; time/date information; heading information; weather information; flight path data; track data; radar altitude data; geometric altitude data; wind speed data; and wind direction data.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, textual, graphical, and/or iconic information rendered by the display unit 120, in response to appropriate display commands from the processor 124 is depicted. It is seen that the display unit 120 renders a view of the terrain 202 ahead of the aircraft, preferably as a three-dimensional perspective view, an altitude indicator 204, an airspeed indicator 206, an attitude indicator 208, and a flight path vector indicator 216. Additional information (not shown) is typically provided in either graphic or numerical format representative, for example, of altimeter setting 201, navigation receiver frequencies 203, and symbology 205 assisting the pilot in performing an instrument approach.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">A helicopter icon 222 is representative of the current heading direction relative to the specific runway 226 on which the helicopter is to land. The desired helicopter direction is determined, for example, by the processor 124 using data from the navigation database 116 and the avionics 114. It will be appreciated, however, that the desired helicopter direction may be determined by one or more other systems or subsystems, and from data or signals supplied from any one of numerous other systems or subsystems within, or external<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> to, the helicopter. Regardless of the particular manner in which the desired helicopter direction is determined, the processor 124 supplies appropriate display commands to cause the display unit 120 to render the helicopter icon 222.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The flight path marker 216 is typically a circle with horizontal lines (representing wings) extending on both sides therefrom, a vertical line (representing a rudder) extending upwards therefrom, and indicates where the plane is "aimed". One known enhancement is, when the flight path marker 216 blocks the view of another symbol on the screen 116, the portion of the flight path marker 216 that is blocking the other symbol becomes transparent.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, and referring to both <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> and the simpler view of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, a helicopter aim point 302 or instrument approach point and an air taxi path 304 are provided. The aim point 302 is specifically for helicopter operations and is different from an airplane aim point or touch down point (not shown) that conventionally is on the runway 226 typically some distance down the runway from the threshold point. The helicopter aim point may be adjacent the approach end of the runway 226 and may be of any format, but preferably of a format specific to helicopter operations. Optionally, symbology 306 may highlight a landing pad 308 for the helicopter 222, and additional symbology 310 may be provided to indicate that the helicopter is cleared by ground control to fly the air taxi path. The air taxi path can be displayed based on given clearances. For example, if the clearance is to follow a certain taxiway path, the taxi path is to be displayed along the pavement. If the clearance is to go directly from the instrument approach point to the landing pad, the taxi path is shown as a straight line. If the clearance is such that certain turns and area avoidance are required, the path can be shown as alternating sections of straight line and curves connecting the instrument approach point top the landing pad. The air taxi path is displayed on the terrain, tracing or conforming to ground profile and objects on terrain. As the air taxi is performed at very low altitude, the terrain conforming format provide the effective path information while reducing the display clutter.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart that illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a display process 400 suitable for use with a flight deck display system such as the display system 110.
