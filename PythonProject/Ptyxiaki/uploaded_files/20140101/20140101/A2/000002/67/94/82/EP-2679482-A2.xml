The invention is characterized in that each passenger is placed on a seat, which is always placed between each pair of adjacent floats and rests over two longitudinal bars bent into U shape, which in turn are simultaneously coupled and fixed through their respective longer central straight longitudinal segments to the crossbars, and at the same time through their respective twin shorter transverse ends to the main floats. Therefore it consists of three main structural parts: crossbars, floats and U-shaped longitudinal bars. Because of its simplicity, this structure is good for obtaining an expandable main frame for a watercraft to accommodate a higher or lower number of passengers depending on the need or circumstances, until reaching a limit because practical and technical reasons, being usually the suitable number of passengers of one of two if such watercrafts are manufactured in small size for enhancing portability. This expandable main frame is easy and quick to assemble, disassemble and reconfigure, and has an increased structural strength with respect to the case where there is only a coupling between floats and crossbars, due to the fact that such three parts are mutually joined by three types of screws in a intercrossed triple coupling. It also allows assembling of short pontoons.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, it lacks of enough structural strength to join with this same simple assembly system larger watercrafts or larger floating structures, especially for professional purposes, being this invention limited to small recreational watercrafts for use only in flat waters with human-powered or underpowered mechanical propulsion systems for giving a very low speed. This is because all U-shaped longitudinal bars are not joined between them by intermediate pieces. They can touch mutually sideward between them by their transverse ends when they share a float in multi-seated watercrafts, but they can not touch mutually sideward between them by their longer middle longitudinal straight segments for opposing to compression or shearing. So the single pieces which oppose to structural distortions and impedes structural collapse are the mounting screws.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">This main frame structure is characterized by an intertwined coupling of three main structural pieces in three stacked horizontal parallel layers, that is, floats down, crossbars in middle, and U-shaped longitudinal bars above. If these U-shaped longitudinal bars could be joined among them by an additional piece to add, the main frame structure obtained would have more cooperating fastening elements to be added to the mounting screws to endure better distortions, breakages and collapses of the structure. With some additional anchoring elements with which join rigidly the U-shaped longitudinal bars on the same plane parallel to the horizontal plane of the crossbars, it would be more difficult the collapse of the assembled structure because many reasons: continuous deformation by water movements, accumulated metal fatigue, corrosion, load excess, excessive wear, hits, among many others. So this type of improved structure could be applied to larger, longer, wider, tougher detachable watercrafts, or for use in harder waters, being resistant but at the same time detachable, and therefore it may lead to some new designs of transportable, modular, customizable and expandable watercrafts.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The invention is characterized by a main frame which is detachable, modular and expandable through a series of attachable and removable structural groups, equal to each other in the most of the cases, which are repeated in the direction of the crossbars and are joined to them. Such detachable main frame has a length or width which can be chosen depending on the type and size of the structure to assemble, well by selecting crossbars of the correct length, well by coupling in series several crossbars until completing the desired length. Such length of crossbars can be relatively short for assembling catamarans, boats or rafts, or relatively long for assembling large or long structures like floating pontoon bridges, barges or floating platforms. In these structures the floats, according to their anchoring positions to the crossbars, can be placed all of them together in mutual side contact (continuous segmented hull) or leaving gaps between two adjacent of them while there are free positions along the length of the crossbars (pontoons, catamarans). Each structural module added increases the floating structure in direction of the crossbars, each structural module removed makes the contrary. Such addition or removal of modules increases or decreases along this direction simultaneously the length or width of the structure, the accessible surface of the top platform, the buoyancy, the cargo capacity, as well as the number of repeated coupling positions and locking devices, so that the structural strength will increase as modules are added to the assembly or to the contrary, or at least it will partly compensate its decrease when length increases. The structures, totally or partially assembled, may not only be linear, but also horizontally and vertically branched thanks to branched linking pieces, rigid, foldable, articulated by intermediate hinges between rigid sections, fully flexible through cables that join the different detached modules, as well as the structures can be wound or unwound around reel middle pieces for shaping a chain of floats that can be transported rolling on ground or over soil.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Each modular structural group comprises at least a float on which two twin U-shaped longitudinal bars are coupled, which are attached slightly above the same, symmetrically on both sides of the vertical longitudinal plane of symmetry passing through the center of the float, touching them mutually by their transverse ends that reach to this same plane of symmetry, forming both two an horizontally elongated rectangular frame whose longer side is in the same direction than the float on which is coupled, and on which in turn a rectangular horizontal platform or plate can be attached, adjusting and fitting exactly over the external or internal perimeter of such rectangular frame in order to obtain a walking expandable surface section where to stand, to walk and to place objects justly above this same float. Below the horizontal plane defined by these two U-shaped longitudinal bars, on top of the float, at least two twin transverse grooves are practiced in the same horizontal plane, in a way that they traverse completely the float perpendicularly. Its cross section coincides exactly with the cross section of the crossbars, fact which gives to each crossbar capacity of introduction, perfect coupling without clearance, relative sliding and subsequent screwing in the desired position within each one of such transverse grooves. Thus, two or more of these crossbars of equal length, each one positioned inside one of these transverse grooves, are in contact with no clearances with these transverse grooves of the floats by bottom and side sides and with the longitudinal U-shaped bars by the top side, whether if such grooves are only from the same float or from several or many equal floats arranged in parallel with all of their grooves also mutually aligned. With this arrangement, the crossbars are always sandwiched between the top U-shaped longitudinal bars and the floats below with a triple interlocking, so that the displacement of each crossbar is limited to a single direction coincident with the symmetry axis of its respective transverse groove where it is placed, until such crossbar is screwed up and locked in the desired transverse position.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Each one of these three main structural elements is attached and locked to one from the other different two ones by a set of screws, so that by having a total of three different sets of mounting screws, the larger number of these ones is distributed through the structure and can drain loads and distortions that the structure can suffer in a more efficient way. Furthermore, since to extract and to release from the assembly one of the three types of said main elements (crossbars, floats or U-shaped longitudinal bars) joined to the other two it is necessary to completely remove two of the three sets of screws, it is difficult that the structure can accidentally break or being dismantled except by clear negligence, wrong assembly or by choice. If the two twin U-shaped longitudinal bars are mutually joined over its corresponding float, the transverse grooves of such same float are in practice holes due to be inaccessible from above, so that on this structural module with coupled U-shaped longitudinal bars a crossbar only can be attached by inserting it by one of their ends coaxially to the transverse groove and sliding it in the same direction until desired position for fixing with screws. Conversely, by removing the two twin U-shaped longitudinal bars from a float, the transverse grooves are accessible from above, so it is possible to couple this float at any free position in a crossbar, both in intermediate as in terminal positions, and then coupling the two U-shaped longitudinal bars over them.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">This arrangement improves and reinforces the structure markedly. In first, in the different structures the U-shaped longitudinal bars from two adjacent modules with floats can be arranged in mutual touch and can support to each other by their central longer longitudinal segments, thereby alleviating from the mounting screws many of the distortion moves, efforts and burdens as a result of compression strokes in the direction of the crossbars. Second, by adding joining and linking elements which join each two twin U-shaped longitudinal bars from the same float and / or from adjacent floats in touch, all U-shaped longitudinal bars, with their respective docked platform or plates, remain in the same horizontal plane with extreme stiffening, docked and screwed also to the crossbars, all of them in the same parallel plane, and to the floats, in an expandable sandwiched structure for a strong expandable main frame for assembly of expandable custom watercrafts and floating structures. Such joining and linking elements are two twin small transverse bars for joining in a whole each two twin U-shaped longitudinal bars attached to the same float, and several hinges and bolts for joining two adjacent U-shaped longitudinal bars from adjacent floats also in a whole, but allowing their mutual folding if no crossbars are threaded crossing the transverse grooves of the involved floats. With these two new elements reinforcing the expandable main frame, all constructible structures are strengthened against shear movements which are perpendicular to the crossbars, traction movements in the direction of the crossbars, torque movements also according to an axis parallel to the crossbars, and bending movements of the crossbars.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">To allow that the U-shaped longitudinal bars from those floating modules which are adjacent in the float arrangements can be in touch by their central longer longitudinal straight segments once screwed to the crossbars, the lengths of all the involved parts (crossbars, floats and U-shaped longitudinal bars) in the direction of the crossbars must be divided into sections of a same standardized length both for coupling and for spacing, so lengths of all elements in this direction are always a multiplier equal or greater than the unit of a certain length which is chosen and taken as the most optimized suitable unitary length by practical and technical reasons. This unit length is matched to the transverse separation distance between the two outer edges of the two twin U-shaped longitudinal bars engaged to the same float. Thus, two different rectangular frames shaped from two different pairs of twin U-shaped longitudinal bars docked over a float each, can be in mutual touch each other when screwed into adjacent screwing positions, and do not touch each other if one or more gaps between them are left. As the different pieces and elements must have always a length measured in the direction of the crossbars that is a multiplier equal or greater than the value of this unitary chosen length, addition or removal of the modular pieces along the crossbars increases or decreases, also in a modular way by incremental units, length and / orwidth of the structures, platform surface, buoyancy, cargo capacity, total number of possible docking positions for floats, and number of anchoring and locking mechanisms available. This chosen unit length is called hereafter as "segment".<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">"Segment" (a single one) also may refer in the text to the minimum possible increment or decrement in either of these properties in mounting or dismantling of structures, but it is mainly referred to the length measured in the direction of the crossbars, as such properties are obviously proportional to the length in the direction of the crossbars. "x segments" is then a number of x times this minimum increment or decrement in all of these properties cited. Obviously, a "segment" is also the minimum transverse distance separation posible between the two outer edges of the two twin U-shaped longitudinal bars engaged to a same float, being the length of this "segment" and of this float in this same direction the most suitable optimal for handling, assembling, storing and transporting operations, that is, not too big but also not too small.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is obviously necessary that over each of the parts and pieces from the set of pieces in their same relative spatial orientation for coupling to the crossbars and in the same direction, all the coupling, anchoring and locking devices must be repeated in this direction on each segment periodically, independently of the size of the piece or its dimension measured in the same direction that the crossbars. By this way each segment from the crossbars can be occupied by a docking piece or be left free, and also such segment can be screwed to such docking piece, so standardization in segments is applied on lengths and on locking and coupling elements. So pieces of different lengths / widths can be coupled and screwed segment by segment, even if there are free gaps. Therefore, distributions of all anchoring and locking mechanisms on each one of the parts and pieces from the set are symmetrical with respect to a vertical longitudinal plane of symmetry passing through the center of each respective part and perpendicular to the axis of the each one of the crossbars, as well as they are also symmetrical with respect to a vertical longitudinal plane of symmetry passing through the center of each separate unitary distribution segment of all anchoring and locking mechanisms on each one of the parts. That allows to some parts to be coupled in left or right positions indifferently, and to use them in interchangeably way on left and right sides.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">After standardizing the dimensions of the parts and pieces and the distribution of coupling and locking devices in the same relative direction than the crossbars in the assemblies, to the set of pieces two twin small transverse bars for each float are added, which have an outer cross-section that is the same that the inner cross-section of the metal tube the U-shaped longitudinal bars is made from. Such small twin transverse bars have a length that is equal or, for practical reasons, slightly less than twice the length of one of the two twin shorter transverse arms from an U-shaped longitudinal bar for coupling to the float, and therefore they have a standardized value in length slightly smaller than a positive integer number of segments. Thanks to its outer cross-section, each one can be introduced without space or clearance inside the tubular ends of any U-shaped longitudinal bar, standing symmetrically between each pair mutually coupled of them, which is in turn coupled to the same float. The twin transverse bars act as a linking piece between each two coupled U-shaped longitudinal bars in a whole in the form of a rectangular frame, as the screws that cross and fix the U-shaped longitudinal bars to the float are used also for crossing and fixing each transverse bar inside its coupled pair of U-shaped longitudinal bars and then both to the float.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Each two of these twin transverse bars held together each two paired U-shaped longitudinal bars as two joined halves of a rectangular horizontal frame, which can be removed from the float where it is coupled by loosening the fixing screws, but this rectangular frame still remain in a single whole, with its composing U-shaped longitudinal bars still joined by the same fixing screws which are not completely removed and still cross both these pieces and the inner twin transverse bars. This feature was not possible before due to the lack of any joining element between the twin coupled U-shaped longitudinal bars (with exception of the float when joined to it). In addition, this assembly is structurally much stronger than a simple rectangular frame made of a single tube bent and welded, despite of having two separable parts. This is because such transverse bars may be solid or made in tube of thick wall, giving to the corners and short sides of the rectangular frame much more resistance to bending or breaking in any direction horizontal or vertical, to strokes, to excessive weights or excessive compressions in the direction of the crossbars and transverse bars. In lack of these transverse bars such rectangular frame, split into two halves, could finish with breakage of fixing screws and U-shaped longitudinal bars released from the assembly or partially out from their coupling positions and out from their common horizontal plane, being mounted one above the other and collapsing the structure. The transverse bars aid to transmit and distribute effectively the compressive stress applied in the direction of the crossbars among all different structural modules in the assembly, freeing the screws of part of this duty. Furthermore, two twin transverse bars allow to each coupled twin U-shaped longitudinal bars to be assembled as a rectangular frame without necessarily having a float below, allowing to complete continuous platforms on long structures with floats spaced with gaps between them as floating pontoon bridges.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Once achieved the strengthening of the composing parts of each independent structural module, now composed each by a float, two twin U-shaped longitudinal bars, two twin small transverse bars, and usually a rectangular top platform, we are to proceed to add a second refinement enabling the strong coplanar binding, in turn, of two U-shaped longitudinal bars belonging to two adjacent different structural modules (with different floats) which are in mutual contact by their middle longitudinal longer straight sections in lateral contact and screwed to the crossbars. Such second refinement achieves further to immobilize the structural modules between each other and on a same plane parallel to the crossbars.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">This improvement is a series of longitudinal hinges, in the form of straight metal coaxial tubes, welded, screwed or bolted, which are positioned slightly above the outer edge of the central longer longitudinal linear section of each U-shaped longitudinal bar, in a way that these tubes are placed consecutively aligned in assembly position but they belong alternately to each one of the two U-shaped longitudinal bars to link together. This allows, by introducing a robust pin or bolt inside of the aligned series of aligned coaxial tubes, to strengthen the structure as well as to add hinges between two adjacent U-shaped longitudinal bars and two adjacent structural modules in touch for mutual folding in case that no crossbars are inserted crossing inside the transverse grooves of the floats.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">On one hand, the addition of these longitudinal hinges allows that the structural modules of all the set of pieces and parts are not only removable, but also foldable as a choice, so that besides the option of storage, transport and assembly of them by detached pieces or separate modules, there is the additional option of building more or less long chains of structural modules previously longitudinal linked by hinges, and preserved and transported folded, bent or wound around reel pieces for further unrolling and unfolding operations in deployment and structure strengthening by coupling and screwing of the crossbars to the deployed structure, whether if they are short chains (boats) as if they are long chains (rafts or floating walkways sections).</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">This is particularly interesting not only for building folding watercrafts that can fit in the width of a vehicle box of normal dimensions (such as a van, an ATV or a small truck), but also for not to be dependent of the use of a trailer, especially in cases of cut paths, ravines or rough roads to overcome in distress call situation. Also for quick and easy deployment of a floating pontoon walkway or bridge, so that if this large and heavy structure is pre-assembled in a compact provisional wound assembly, being all structural modules provisionally linked by their hinges, the whole bridge can be transported rolling on ground or soil to the deployment point on the shore, and the bridge is deployed to the opposite shore by unwinding and unfolding in a faster, safer and easier way than if assembling it piece by piece, especially if the water is turbulent and the stream can easily drag pieces or the own crew.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Moreover, such a system of longitudinal hinges is an additional strengthening device for the structure on the same plane when they are bolted with pins, which act in cooperation with the crossbars once they are placed. It is also safer and more versatile than the use of locks, latches or hooks, which in addition to not providing the above advantage of the ability of folding, as they can have hooked shapes, projections or spikes that can be released, loosen or broken, losing their effectiveness, and they can hurt hands and fingers during hasty fast assembly and transport steps or become hooked with objects at inopportune times. In comparison, the strength and toughness of such longitudinal hinges is greater the greater the thickness and length of their tubes are, as well as their hinge pins, and they have smoothed and rounded shapes with no burrs which are safer for handling and assembly.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">This detachable expandable main frame, which can be enlarged by adding successively structural modules especially reinforced, constitutes the core of the invention, which allows build a very broad range of floating structures, either for watercrafts or pontoon bridges, among many others.

The shape and characteristics of these floats on each case is different and appropriate or fully optimized for their specific function in a watercraft or in a pontoon bridge, maximizing hydrodynamics or buoyancy. So it seems pointless to pretend to build different types of structures and assemblies very different in function, either a watercraft or a pontoon walkway, by using the same floats and other types of structural parts, since none of these parts, in their shapes and characteristics, will be fully specialized and fully optimized in a particular function to give full performance or excellent behavior for its pretended purpose, but rather discreet when having to average performance and behavior characteristics to each one and every one of the types of structures to assemble.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">However, there is a specific type of application in which this purpose has all the logical sense, practical and economical, which is quick, fast response to water emergencies such as flash, massive, huge, extensive floods. In these cases flood fighter crews have to make a strong logistical effort for transporting as fast as possible a certain number of strong, reliable but heavy, bulky watercrafts (Rigid Inflatable Boats) using ground or aerial vehicles, usually limited because the budget, lack of time or lack of storing and parking spaces at the headquarters. They may also find difficult terrains and soils, cuts in paths or roads, land obstacles or ravines to overcome, as well they may have little time for gathering of good information if no forecasts were made in time or the event has happened by surprise. If they do not know the situation well because lack of data or there are no informers in the place, they also do not know what kind of assemblies or devices will be required once they reach to the flooding site. And they do not know if over time it will be necessary to change strategies because changing conditions or shortage, lack, or unavailability of necessary means despite all transported materials and equipment. In these cases it may be fully appropriate to have something based on the same structural elements which allow assembling different devices easily for different functions and purposes, starting from the same structural modules transported, for easy change between different watercrafts and other different devices as may be floating pontoon bridges or capsules depending on the needs in real time.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">When a strong emergency condition because hard flooding happens (flash, intense, widespread, extensive, massive), people resorts to special corps inside the army for these purposes, which have the materials, equipment, training and adequate enough logistical and deployment capacity to make a response proportional to the intensity of the flooding event, but unfortunately its response time is always delayed and the army can take hours or one day to get to the flooding place, so if the episode has been particularly sudden and there has been no prior warning or forecasts, the army arrives when everything has already happened, and all it can do is to seek and to rescue missing, stranded persons and to rebuild infrastructures.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the waiting time, many people may have died because drowning, hypothermia or trauma. Only in certain cases, such as rivers overflows, floods can be predicted well in advance, but often can not predict the exact geographic area where the army presence will be required in advance. As in most cases of sudden, flash water emergency, the response time is only a few hours or even several minutes, the only skilled crew found near the scene, with the preparation, training and proper equipment, are fire fighter and flood fighter crews and civil protection corps, whose budget and logistic, transport and deployment capabilities are smaller than the army, but arriving from different points, places and towns nearby to the flooding scene they can unite and coordinate among them for giving a proportional response if they may have or gather reliable tools for flood fighting.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">These corps, as the army, usually have for their actions in flood fighting R.I.B.s (Rigid Inflatable Boats), commonly named by the well-known brand name Zodiac. These boats are designed in such a quality and performance that has not been improved substantially since its invention and have demonstrated its full practical utility for decades. The only problem is that they are precisely boats, and they can only be used as boats. They can not change its own shape or size, they can not be transformed into something else, they can not be divided into detached parts to partition the size or weight to transport and carry, and they can not be divided or split to be in more than a single place at a time. If it is necessary to have another assembly or device different from a boat, like a floating pontoon bridge, it is necessary to wait to arrival of the army, or to make multiple trips with the available rescue boats until rescue of all the people, spending more time and taking on more risk to crews, or to use handmade, improvised devices as hand ladders. The inflatable boats are very compactable and very portable, but they need an air compressor for fast inflation, or they must be transported inflated draining big space from transport vehicles, and they may be not suitable for use in shallow draft areas having strong water stream where they can finish being ripped, punctured by sharp or pointed submerged objects as those that can be found in natural and urban places.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">No matter how good is a boat in water, if such boat is not on time where it is needed and when it is needed, it is useless for its rescue purpose. It would have therefore a best role another kind of boat that even having worst performance in water it may arrive on time overcoming distances by land faster. Each R.I.B. needs a trailer for transportation on land, and therefore a vehicle for each trailer and R.I.B. to transport and to deploy. Due to its length and width, typically they do not fit within the boxes and trunks of standard vehicles such as small trucks, ATVs or vans and can not be lifted to and be lowered from car roof racks by muscle. The trailer is an element that reduces speed, maneuverability and stability on road and on cross-country, and it can make difficult to enter and to pass through narrow, close country access roads, and they can not overcome ravines or road cuts, so sometimes they have to make a long detour that means wasted time. Also the trailer needs access to get close or get into the water to release the boat by human strength or by a cable and a crank, and this good deployment point may be hard to find or to reach sometimes.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">If these boats were detachable to split their size and weight in separate parts, smaller vehicles could transport it faster to the deployment point, or in case of a road cut or land obstacle, several people could carry it by hand to save time through the shortest path to the water even though the terrain would be difficult, which may be quite normal for a flood situation. In addition to R.I.B.s, if it were available a set of elements and pieces as described herein, in these flood events it would be possible to achieve these practical advantages:
<ul><li>Vans, small trucks and vehicles of usual normal length can transport a single or several folded or detached watercrafts inside, stacked in two or more layers, as well as over the car roof rack if convenient, as such detached parts or folded structural modules allow a better exploitation of vehicle spaces. Therefore, each vehicle can carry more than a single boat or equivalent parts with no need of a trailer, so carry more boats, more equipment in less time and with greater safety in displacement.</li><li>If once at the deployment place it is necessary at some point to build a different structure than a watercraft, it is possible to make this from detached parts and modules not assembled in structures, or by dismantling assembled boats if they are not needed or if they are in excess, and vice versa.</li><li>All assemblies and structures, including the larger and the successively more specialized ones, use the most of the same parts and pieces that the simpler structures use, so it is needed to carry or to order for delivery only these additional necessary parts, not a whole structure or complete device.</li><li>The pieces from several crews can come together to build jointly more or larger, more specialized or more complex structures. In turn, large sets of pieces can be split and scattered across multiple places, each of which could allow to assemble different structures depending on the available pieces on each.</li><li>Large structures such as floating bridges can be assembled in many types and in many alternate mounting procedures to choose among them, so it is possible to select the safest, faster or less bad option possible, depending on the conditions, available time, process safety, availability of parts and available personnel.</li><li>The pre-assembled floating bridges can be carried and transported in compact forms (folded in accordion, wound, wound-folded) and deployed by unfolding and / or unwinding faster and safer than if placing structural modules one by one. These structures can be brought in larger trucks or cargo helicopters, and / or pushed over ground by human strength if necessary through almost all soils and terrains. In this last case, it is possible to dock twin large side wheels several meters in radius to make easier such moves through hard terrain with no damage on the floats by hitting on rocks or hard ground. Once the bridge is at the deployment point, such side wheels can be converted into side supporting brackets from which the floating walkway unrolls and / or deploys with safety and stability.</li></ul></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">While the core of the invention is a removable, expandable, strong structural main frame which allow to build quickly and safely short or long linear or branched structures, it may have little practical utility.

These crossbars (1) join at least two floats (2) arranged in parallel longitudinally in mutual contact or separated between them (in the figure only one is shown for clarity), all of them symmetrical with respect to a vertical longitudinal plane of symmetry that passes through its own center. The assembly is completed for now by two U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) for each float (2) in tube of square or rectangular cross-section, also preferably made of metal or alloy resistant to corrosion. All the floats (2) have at least five transverse grooves on its top surface flat horizontal which cross it perpendicularly and completely. At least two of such transverse grooves (4), which are located on top flat surface in the central part of each float (2), serve for joining, coupling and screwing of the crossbars (1), thus they have the same cross section that them. There are other two transverse grooves (5) that serve for joining, coupling and screwing of the transverse shorter ends of said U-shaped longitudinal bars (3), also having the same cross section that these transverse ends, with the characteristic on all the floats (2) that the transverse grooves (4) are always placed between the two transverse grooves (5), so that the crossbars (1) coupled inside the transverse grooves (4) are always placed between the two transverse ends of each one of both twin U-shaped longitudinal bars (3).</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Thus, once assembled the structure as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Figure 1</b></figref>, whether if there is a single float (2) as if they are multiple floats (2) repeated sideward, the central longitudinal longer segment of all the U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) always are in the same horizontal plane resting and touching over the crossbars (1), all of them placed in the same horizontal plane parallel to the previous one, while the shorter transverse ends of those U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) always are in the same horizontal plane parallel to the previous ones, resting and touching on the floats (2), inserted, hosted and screwed into the transverse grooves (5) practiced on those floats(2). Then, such U-shaped longitudinal bars (3), once coupled and screwed to the other pieces can distribute and disperse weights and load forces from the top platform of the structure of watercraft or whatever structure, simultaneously both to the crossbars (1) as to the floats (2). An additional last transverse groove (6) is near the prow of all the floats (2), with the same cross section as the transverse grooves (4) for placement of a third crossbar (1), which increases the strengthening of the structure when coupled and screwed, and prevents that the prows in the watercrafts tend to be separated and deformed by the continued impact on the water because the own displacement of the watercraft, as well as to place further accessories for many practical applications to perform at the prow.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">All these elements of each type are equal and symmetrical with respect to a longitudinal vertical symmetry plane passing through the center of the piece in the same spatial orientation that in coupling position to the assemblies, with exception of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) where this plane is transverse) for using the pieces either on right or left sides, simplifying and reducing manufacturing costs and facilitating assembly and disassembly.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">These three types of main structural parts are mutually joined together by thick and strong crossbars-floats fixing screws or bolts (7), crossbars-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws, threaded rods or bolts<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> (8) and floats-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws or bolts (9).</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The triple linkage between each two of the three types of main sandwiched structural parts achieves a greater structural strength and endurance than in the case of having only the usual coupling between crossbars (1) and floats (2), and the structural tensions are supported and distributed to a higher number of screws or bolts.

This independent modular floating structural module also can be moved sliding along the same crossbars (1) for changing or adjusting its transverse position in relation to them but without releasing from them.

It is also possible to leave free gaps with no float (2) and floating structural module on desired positions for building gapped structures as rafts, pontoons or catamarans.

By having this capability, many gapped detachable watercrafts can be compacted transversely for reducing its width in preassembled arrangements for fast deployment by expanding the floats (2) and floating structural modules to the sides, as in case of catamarans, trimarans or small pontoons.

Best one is to change the crossbars (1) one after the other, without having to dismantle the whole preassembled structure into separate detached pieces, making the expansion and<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> contraction of the structures by modules easier and quicker than in case of complete dismantling.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">An example can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Figure 3</b></figref>.

Each top sliding cover (10) can be fixed by at least a floats-sliding covers fixing screw (12) to the prow of its corresponding float (2). So that this transverse groove (6) is covered or uncovered by the user with great ease, in order to couple and lock or to release different elements which can be coupled inside it, especially a crossbar (1) for joining the floats (2) among them by their prows.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The crossbars (1) are always manufactured in different selectable lengths to choose among them, being such possible selectable lengths a positive integer multiple of an unitary length which is a constant value in the invention, or at least in each possible format or version of the invention due to the size or dimensions of the manufactured pieces (for example, for handling and lifting by human power or by lifting machinery). This unitary length is matched with the maximum width of each one of the narrowest floating structural modules possible for practical use, that is, the transverse distance measured perpendicularly between the parallel outer edges of the two twin U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) coupled together over each float (2). In addition, this transverse distance is previously calculated for a optimized transport, storage, assembly and handling operations, that is, it is those width for floating structural modules that is fully optimal, so narrower floating structural modules are less practical or less manageable, or simply, they are too small. Then, the positive integer multiple may vary between one (to accommodate a single floating structural module with a single float (2) and two twin U-shaped longitudinal bars (3), coinciding exactly with its maximum width), to a limit determined by the size, strength and handling of both the floating structural modules and the assembled structures with them.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">From now, as the lengths or widths of the watercrafts and floating structures are specified in discrete units that are positive integer multiples of this said unit length, this is named from now as "segment", but it may be defined by any other name ("units", "widths", "bodies", etc.).

This allows to the set of parts and pieces to be joined together not only piece by piece but segment by segment, so that it is possible to multiply the number of structures possible to be built, and a great freedom of choice for engaging or not one piece over another even if they have different lengths or widths, for leaving a gap vacant or not, for choosing the dimensions and the coupling position thereof, is provided.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">However, to achieve this goal of standardization and quantification of lengths in discrete incremental units, this also have to be extended to the fixing and locking devices on all the different parts and pieces, so that they are periodically repeated in the piece for each segment of length in the direction of the crossbars (1) in the same relative spatial orientation for coupling to the crossbars (1) and structures in assembly process, obviously with a constant spacing of one segment. Each one of the segments of the crossbars (1) is completely traversed vertically by the same two different groups of holes which allow, respectively, that the crossbars-floats fixing screws or bolts (7) and the crossbars-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws, threaded rods or bolts (8), pass through the crossbar (1) from above to reach to the float (2) below in assembly, being introduced inside it.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Each one of these two sets of holes are drilled in all and each one of the segments of all the crossbars (1), symmetrically at both sides in relation to the transverse vertical plane of symmetry passing through the center of said segment (which is parallel to the vertical longitudinal plane of symmetry passing through the center of each float (2) in the mounting coupling arrangement and same spatial relative orientation between crossbars (1) and floats (2)).

Still they are not shown the possible additional possibilities for connections of these structures later into larger ones by use of inner crossbars (13).

Most of the new parts that are described as follows are modifications of these crossbars (1) and inner crossbars (13), and therefore include segments or fractions of segments coupled or attached to them in terminal or intermediate positions, as well as in angular fixed or angular variable linking pieces, as well as in linking pieces branched into two or three dimensions.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Other terminal coupling parts that can be attached laterally inserted into the crossbars (1) are the pieces for cable passage (15). These short pieces, in two versions, have always the same outer cross section than the inner cross section of the crossbars (1) in first version, and the same outer cross section than the inner cross section of the inner crossbars (13) in second version.

Such longitudinal complete parallel holes are always drilled or shaped in the same preset positions, so that when several pieces for cable passage (15) are inserted a crossbar (1) or inner crossbar (13) in whatever positions, such holes are coaxially aligned in parallel to crossbars (1) and inner crossbars (13). Then, a cable or rope<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> can be placed passing through a single row of these aligned consecutive holes, so it is possible thanks to these pieces for cable passage (15) to pass several resistant guide cables or ropes inside each crossbar (1) or inner crossbar (13) on a floating structure or floating structural module.

By the same reason of preventing breakage or damage of the ropes or cables for guiding, the longitudinal holes are drilled or shaped with no sharp edges or burrs. This has full utility for transporting floating structural modules or preassembled structures and overcoming ravines or hard terrain slopes by gravity, by making them to fall down sliding through those guide cables.

It is clear the desirability of various possible sizes of floats (2) to choose among, to pick them smaller, lighter and more portable for building small, maneuverable, light, fast watercrafts, or bigger, heavier, less transportable for building big, heavy, slow, high-capacity watercrafts and rafts. This is the same case for<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> building shorter or longer pontoon bridges and pontoon walkways.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">Despite they are suitable for detachable watercrafts, the floats (2) have the problem that although they are suitable for construction of pontoon-type floating structures with floats separated with gaps between all or several of them, whether if it is a watercraft as if it is a pontoon floating bridge or pontoon floating walkway, in case of assembled watercrafts they can easily suffer pontoon effect, due to the fact that the main deck or platform for cargo and passengers is placed above the floats, so that the buoyancy center can be very close or even below the gravity center. Therefore, those watercrafts built with floats (2) must be enough wide to increase its stability, so reducing its speed, or being limited simply to catamaran-type or pontoon-type watercrafts. This problem is not found in almost all other watercrafts, as in dinghies or rigid inflatable boats, as the hull is hollow and the deck or walking platform is very close to the float bottom, so cargo and people are placed at a lower height and buoyancy center is above gravity center, giving stability to the watercraft.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">By this reason, floats (2) should be improved with a new version of hollow counterparts. An alternative enhanced embodiment of the floats (2) are the hollow floats (67), which are exactly as the floats (2) on its dimensions, materials and shapes, but having upper openings on its top horizontal surface that shape and give access to a series of inner compartments (68). A comparison of the floats (2) and (67), and some of the improved models of floats, from one to three width segments can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0008"><b>Figure 16</b></figref>. Such top openings in floats (67), as well the inner compartments (68), both having coincident or similar perimeters and shapes in the horizontal plane, are practiced on the float (67) from above without reaching to the bottom, obviously for impeding entry of water, but arranged inside the perimeter formed by the two twin U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) when coupled to the float (67), so also avoiding the occupied surfaces by the transverse grooves (4), so that there are three separated top openings and there may be also from one to three inner compartments below, depending if such inner compartments are fused together or not. Those top openings are provided with top covers (69) to close the inner compartments (68) of them with corresponding locks, latches and locks. These compartments (68) can be filled with ballast, with which to keep the gravity center of the watercraft as low as possible to increase stability and placing it below the buoyancy center, or use them to store tools, accessories, supplies, water or fuel tanks, electric batteries, and any element which, being within the floating element, so in practice inside of a floating structural module, can be added or removed from the different structures within the same with noi need of removing it if the overall weight is light and manageable. Also, the main feature of floats (67) is that they allow to make the same than floats in rigid inflatable boats, by lowering the deck height for placing people in a more stable position and protected against fall by the inner faces of the float (67). Passenger may sit on detachable seats and backrest dockable along perimeter of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3).</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Despite the resulting deck is smaller for walking, those inner compartments (68), especially if they are not fused together, allow to confine ballast and cargo in a smaller spaces than in other usual<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> watercrafts, so they are retained on their place even if the watercrafts is shaken with hard water, and if covered by top covers (69) they can not be released or lost anyway. Meanwhile, prow and stern in the floats (67) have "solid" sections which can be filled, as the floats (2) should do, with unsinkable foam to make the same with said floats (67). Floats (67) have also inner transverse vertical walls or transverse beams (70) separating each two adjacent inner compartments (68) and hosting also on their top surface, coincident with the same of the float (2), the transverse grooves (4) with the set of holes for screwing the sets of crossbars-floats fixing screws or bolts (7), and inside their bodies the female threaded metal bodies that contains such said sets of threaded holes, for obtaining the same coupling capabilities than floats (2) and the same structural strength.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Other new perfected floating elements to add to the set of elements and pieces for adding versatility and practical functionality are new modified versions (71), (72) and (73) from floats (2), and other new different modified versions (74), (75) and (76) from floats (67), lacking first ones of inner compartments (68) as the floats (2) lack of them, and having second ones inner compartments (68) as the floats (67) have. All of them are characterized of being longer than floats (2) and (67) by being provided of a extended stern that protrudes exactly to the rear the same distance than the prow to the front in floats (2) and (67), measuring the distance from the closer transverse groove (5) to the extreme considered. In the same way that the prow, those extended stern in all new floats (71), (72), (73), (74), (75) and (76) has a rear transverse groove (77), symmetrically placed respect to the front transverse groove (6) in relation to the center of the floating element, and exactly having the same standardized sets and distributions of fixing elements for coupling and tightening of crossbars (1) as the front transverse groove (6) has. In the same way, all these extended sterns always have rear longitudinal guideways or flanges (78) which are symmetrical and opposite to the front longitudinal guideways or flanges (11), and rear sets of vertical holes for allowing pass and tighten action for the corresponding sets of floats-sliding covers fixing screws which are symmetrical and opposite to the front sets of vertical holes for allowing pass and tighten action for the corresponding sets of floats-sliding covers fixing screws (12), all of them respectively symmetrically arranged them in relation to a transverse vertical symmetry plane passing through the center of the floating element. They also have rear sliding covers (79) for making the same work than the front sliding covers (10).</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Those floats (71), (72), (73), (74), (75) and (76) differ among them in if their prow and stern are equal and symmetrical or are different. Floats (71) and (74), (closed and open, respectively) have a pointed end and the other is blunt, rounded or completely straight seen from above, making it possible to choose, depending on the duty that is to do, one of the two ends as prow in a watercraft, so having two possible orientations of the floats (71) or (74) when assembling watercrafts. However, the floats (72) and (75) (closed and open, respectively), and the floats (73) and (76) (closed and open, respectively), have both ends equal and symmetrical to each other, with the distinction that when seen from above, in<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> the first pair both ends are pointed and in the second pair they are blunt, rounded or completely straight. First pair is especially for assemblies where it is necessary to cut or split the water flow at both sides of the floating element, while the second pair is especially for assemblies where it is necessary to deviate water flow below the floating element, as well as for assembling of continuous multihull long or large watercrafts, as linear barges expandable in length to see later.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079"><figref idrefs="f0009"><b>Figure 17</b></figref> illustrates clearly the practical advantage of using asymmetrical floats (71) and (74) having different pointed and blunt ends for choosing between. In case <b>(a)</b> there is a detachable watercraft with a multiple-float sectional hull in compact arrangement that carries little cargo, so it slides smoothly above water surface and can reach high speed. In case <b>(c)</b> there is the same watercraft than in case <b>(a)</b> but carrying very much cargo, so the hull is sinking lower, and the saw-teeth shape of the prow retains water flow in front water flow pockets, so the watercraft slows. Simply by reversing the docking position of the outboard motor for swapping the watercraft's extremes as seen in case <b>(d)</b>, the prow is now blunt seen from above but curved when seen from the side, so with this same watercraft the water flows beneath the hull when the watercraft is moving forward, raising the prow even with a heavy cargo. In case of hull arrangements with separate floats <b>(b)</b>, as in catamarans, pontoon watercrafts and floating pontoon bridges and walkways, it is best to choose the pointed ends faced to the incoming direction of water, for either sliding over water with little cargo or cutting water with heavy cargo. So these asymmetrical floats (71) and (74) saves space in transport vehicles but allow choose the coupling direction of the floating elements in the assemblies.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080"><figref idrefs="f0009"><b>Figure 18</b></figref> illustrates two examples of useful uses of symmetric floats (73) and (76), both with symmetric blunt ends. In <b>(a)</b> a long modular expandable barge is shown, being such barge built with floats (73) and / or floats (76) which are arranged perpendicularly to the direction of advance of the barge, which moves in the same direction than the crossbars (1), so perpendicularly to the normal direction in almost all watercrafts assemblies. As symmetric floats (73) and (76) have both equal indifferent ends, those can be the symmetric port and starboard sides in the barge. If floats (73) are used, the main platform or main deck is placed over its top. If floats (76) are used, ballast or part of the cargo can be loaded inside their inner compartments (68), fully exploiting cargo capacity and improving stability of the barge. In addition, while in usual watercrafts arrangements the added floating structural modules expand the width, in this other arrangement is the length the one which is expanded with no theoretical but practical limits, so barges can be very long, which enhances speed, and can have highest cargo capacity. Case (b) is only possible in case that the separation distance d between the main symmetry axes of each pair of contiguous crossbars (1) and therefore between the main symmetry axes of each pair of contiguous transverse grooves (4), (6) and (77), that is, its spacing, is constant, but at the same time the distance from the symmetry axes of both crossbars (1) coupled inside the transverse grooves (6) and (77) and the symmetry axes of these last ones to the extreme of the closest end of the float (73) or (76), is half the said constant distance d. With these two geometrical conditions it is possible to mount the floats (73)<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> and (76) in horizontal two-dimensional arrangements, able of growing in length but also in width. To make so, the floats (73) and / or (76) can be assembled in longitudinal rows touching mutually by their extremes (shorter sides), not by their sides (longer sides) for growing the structure in a single direction. For growing the structure in the other horizontal perpendicular direction, the successive rows at side are displaced relatively to the previous one or two crossbars (1), so they interlace. In case of displacing a single crossbar (1) the successive rows symmetrically at both sides from a central row, obtained structure is or can be arrowhead-staggered in shape. In case of displacing two crossbars (2) the successive rows symmetrically at both sides from a central row, obtained structure is or can be diamond in shape or cushion in shape with staggered sides. In case of displacing of displacing either one or two crossbars (2) the successive rows only to a single side, obtained structure is rhomboidal with staggered sides.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Both floats (73) and (76), as well as all floating elements seen for now, have flat vertical sides for coupling exactly to another one with no gaps or clearances and fusing all of them consecutively in a single detachable but continuous hull. Such flat vertical sides are not suitable for maneuvering of watercrafts as they oppose to turns. To enhancing maneuverability in certain detachable watercrafts, an additional supplementary rounded side float (80) is added to the set of pieces, shown in <figref idrefs="f0010"><b>Figure 19</b></figref>. It is docked in symmetric twin pairs at both sides of a watercraft or at the prow and stern of a linear barge, smoothing and rounding corners and hull shapes, besides providing additional buoyancy and lateral stability. This supplementary side float (80) is preferably of a segment of width, and is symmetrical in relation to a vertical symmetry plane transverse to the forward direction of the watercraft that passes through its own center, but unlike all other floating elements it is asymmetric with respect to a vertical symmetry plane parallel to the forward direction of the watercraft that passes through its own center. It can be laterally coupled perfectly the direction of the crossbars (1) on either equal vertical flat side faces of the floats (73) and (76), so for that its vertical flat face has exactly the same matching section for a seamless junction with them, while the other opposite side is parallel to the anterior surface and much smaller, both being joined by continuous curved surfaces that aid to round and to smooth the hull shapes when two twin supplementary side floats (80) are docked. For coupling to the floating structures by means of the crossbars (1), such supplementary side floats (80) have their corresponding transverse grooves (4), (5), (6) and (77) arranged symmetrically to its vertical transverse plane of symmetry, each one with the corresponding sets of holes located at the top flat surface of them (best said the female threaded metal bodies embedded in the body of the supplementary side floats (80) that contains such sets of threaded holes) for screwing the sets of crossbars-floats fixing screws or bolts (7), crossbars-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws, threaded rods or bolts (8) and floats-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws or bolts (9). By the asymmetric shape of their ends, they lack of longitudinal guides (11) and (78) and sliding covers (10) and (79).</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">The shorter floats (2) and (67) of three transverse grooves (4) and (6) have the advantage of fitting better inside boxes of smaller vehicles as small trucks, vans and car roof racks of ATVs, being particularly<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> suitable a length of about 3 meters with a spacing between their transverse grooves (4) and (6) of about a meter. Moreover, longer floats (71), (72), (73), (74), (75) and (76) which have an extended stern with respect to those shorter ones (2) and (67), fit in larger vehicles such as trucks, large vans, trailers and car roof racks in long ATVs, due to the fact that if the spacing between two consecutive transverse grooves (4), (6) and (77) is about a meter, such floating elements have a suitable length of about four meters. However, apart from these two possible lengths given for having an idea of sizes, it is possible to make longer floats to give longer watercrafts and wider floating pontoon bridges with the same spacing between all two consecutive transverse grooves (4), (6) and (77) for a compatible coupling system with the other pieces, but in this case the length of the floating elements, which have an additional meter in length for each of each transverse groove (4), (6) or (77) added, make it very difficult to transport, to storage, to handling and to assembly except for the military, which already has a large number of rigid inflatable boats and extensible bridges that can carry with their numerous logistical and transportation means. Moreover, the coupled pairs of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) pose a problem, since their interlacing with the crossbars (1) for producing the strengthening of the structure, and as they constitute the main platform or the perimeter for the top openings in the hull for placement of cargo and passengers.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">So increasing the length of the floating element means to add successively in longitudinal row coupled pairs of two additional U-shaped longitudinal bars (3), one after the other docked over two crossbars (1) each, so two additional transverse grooves (4) are needed for each additional coupled pair of them, or instead of this solution, leaving as the only one the default coupled pair of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) in the center of the floating element above the two default crossbars (1) docked on the two default transverse grooves (4), and extending the prow and / or the stern the necessary length, in a way that more transverse grooves (4) and (77) will appear, and the sliding covers (10) and (79) may become excessively long. Some illustrative examples are shown in <figref idrefs="f0010"><b>Figure 20</b></figref>. Therefore, increasing the length of the floating elements in a single piece is not practical unless these floating elements are composed of detachable cross sections, such that the length increases with the number of cross sections added to the series. This would facilitate the transport and handling, as such sections are shorter, and gives no theoretical limit to the length of the constructible watercrafts, as well those sections would be easier to fabricate by not being excessively large or long. An example would be for special applications for cargo or freight transport in lakes, reservoirs, rivers or flooded extensive areas where the watercrafts need to reach a certain speed, so that the hull must be narrower than the linear barges allow.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">As seen in <figref idrefs="f0010"><b>Figure 21</b></figref>, a practical solution is to add to the set of pieces and parts three selectable sliced float sections (82), (83) and (84). These have the respective geometric shapes that result from severing an asymmetrical float (71) for each one of their standardized widths in segments, with one or two cuts according to a vertical plane perpendicular to its vertical symmetry longitudinal plane that passes through its center on calculated longitudinal preset positions, to obtain a bow sliced section (82)<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> containing the pointed prow end, the transverse groove (4) and closest transverse groove (5), a stern sliced section (83) containing the straight blunt end, the transverse groove (77) and closest transverse groove (5), and an intermediate sliced section (84) containing none of the two ends with constant cross section, with exception of the upper transverse grooves (4) and the only modification of two additional adjacent transverse grooves (5) in middle, separated by a thin wall or fused in a single one. In this last intermediate sliced section (84) the flat vertical surfaces resulting from vertical cuts are exactly equal and coincide with each other, as well as with their counterparts in bow sliced section (82) and stern sliced section (83), to enable the construction of floats consisting of two or more sliced sections consecutively aligned without discontinuities in hydrodynamic profile and shapes, so longitudinal positions of those vertical cuts are calculated for giving these geometrical results. Thus, each coupled pair of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) join longitudinally two consecutive sliced sections (82), (83) or (84) and their respective crossbars (1), which before this coupling were independent and were kept separate. Thus possible combinations are of two bow-bow sliced sections (82) + (82), two stern-stern sliced sections (83) + (83), or with at least one intermediate sliced section flanked by two terminal sliced sections in arrangements bow-bow sliced sections (82) + m · (84) + (82), stern-stern sliced section (83) + m · (84) + (83), or bow-stern (82) + m · (84) + (83), where m a positive integer greater than or equal to unity.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">Last additional floating element to add, seen in <figref idrefs="f0011"><b>Figure 22</b></figref>, is a pneumatic inflatable float (85) which combines a solid top non-deformable section (86), which has an integer number of segments in width, with a bottom inflatable pneumatic section (87) in approximately cylindrical symmetry, so in shape of capsule or banana, which is fastened to the previous solid top non-deformable section (86) through a series of hooks and buttonholes (88) or straps (89) at intervals around it, thus facilitating rapid replacement when damaged, ripped or punctured, with no need of changing top solid non-deformable section (86). Its main practical use is to build catamarans, rafts floating pontoon walkways or floating pontoon bridges or high cargo or traffic capacity, with the disadvantage of shorter life because fabric wear, which limits them to use in relatively calm waters with no floating dragged sharp pointed debris, and they can only be assembled into structures with separate floats since their rounded cross sections do not have the same flat vertical faces for perfect lateral coupling as all other floating elements have Said top solid non-deformable section (86) has the same transverse grooves (4), (5), (6) and (77), the same longitudinal guideways or flanges (11) and (78), and the sliding covers (10) and (79) as almost all other floating elements in in the same relative positions for compatible coupling operations, having also obviously over the top flat horizontal surface of transverse grooves (4), (5), (6) and (77) the same respective sets of holes, drilled vertically, for introduction of sets of crossbars-floats fixing screws or bolts (7), crossbars-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws, threaded rods or bolts (8) and floats-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws or bolts (9), as well as their corresponding female threaded metal bodies embedded in the body of the solid top non-deformable section (86).<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --></p><p id="p0086" num="0086">All floating elements have been described.

The hours of continuous use and movements of distortion of the structure, with abrasion due to mud and small stones can cause that the plastic area surrounding these transverse grooves (4), (5) and (77) resulted deformed and worn, leading to the appearance of clearances incompatible with a stable and safe structure.

It is a cap-shaped or hood-shaped detachable bulky element having the hydrodynamic external shape of a watercraft's prow which is docked by sliding and docking over the front longitudinal guideways or flanges (11), in the same way as front sliding covers (10), being coupled to the front of the watercraft, but as it is in a single piece, it encompasses and embraces as a big cup with no clearances all the outside of the watercraft's prow and all its composing parallel floats in mutual contact at the same time. As it holds together by embracing all of them, they are unable to separate each other even if the watercraft moves at high speed, as this piece is the one which receives all or almost all water impact in advance movement. By selecting the correct or most suitable external hydrodynamic shape, this element can improve buoyancy, speed or both.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Each attachable front prow (95) has variable custom external shape, length, width, material and hydrodynamic profile, being obviously symmetrical in relation to a vertical symmetry plane that pass through the center of the watercraft and through the center of the same in coupling position, and has a cavity, recess or hollow which is also symmetrical in the same way in relation to said symmetry planes. This hollow is practiced in longitudinal horizontal direction and is open only to the rear for docking on the floating elements, but closed to all other sides, for avoiding to be filled with water when the watercraft floats or moves. This cavity, recess or hollow has the same transverse width and segments in width than the pile or stacking of all floating structural modules of the watercraft where those attachable front prow (95) is to be docked, so overall width of the complete piece is a little more due to both two opposite walls that flanks the central cavity, recess or hollow. As seen in the figure, as all anchoring, fixing, locking and sliding devices from the invention are repeated in direction of the crossbars (1) a time for each segment in length present along of all present floating devices, irrespective of the distribution of floating elements and its width in segments of each separated one, the longitudinal guideways or flanges (11) and holes for the sets of floats-sliding covers fixing screws (12) remain then irrespective of the distribution, types and widths of all involved joined floating elements, with the only condition that always the number of segments of them must be the same than the width of the inner recess or hollow the concrete chosen attachable front prow (95) has, for fitting inside exactly as in a cup piece. In other words, each attachable front prow (95) can be docked indifferently on homogeneous or heterogeneous floating structural modules, on symmetric or asymmetric arrangements of them, but preferably on homogeneous and symmetric ones for stability. The surface of the recess or inner hollow matches and fits to the outer surfaces at prow of the different floating elements involved in the assembly, both their top flat surfaces as their other rounded smooth surfaces, so the attachable front prow (95), once coupled and fixed, is supported but also held and tightened backwards to the floating elements by the compression due to the forward move of the watercraft, as the bottom of the attachable front prow (95)<!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --> extends and inserts below the floating elements in the watercraft some longitudinal distance, causing the water flow to continue under the hull without they receive the force impact, so that it prevents this attachable front prow (95) can be peeled from its position and also protects, embraces holds together the longitudinal floating elements.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">For being docked and fixed each attachable front prow (95) has a series of slots practiced on the top surface of its inner hollow in matching coincident positions for obviously match with all the longitudinal guideways or flanges (11) and avoiding to the piece to slide longitudinally in relation to the floating structure when landing over the top horizontal surface of the floating elements, guided by those longitudinal guideways or flanges (11) to a stop position, where the attachable front prow (95) is screwed or bolted to the floating structure by using the sets of floats-sliding covers fixing screws (12) usually used for sliding covers (10). For this, the attachable front prow (95) has a set of vertically drilled holes in coincident positions with the holes found below over the top surface of the floating elements for said fixing screws that cross completely the top wall of the piece for being crossed by them. Obviously said longitudinal slots and said vertical holes are also in sets whose relative distribution is repeated sideward at each segment for standardization and for following the same compatible coupling system with other pieces. For coupling even more strongly the attachable front prow (95), their twin side walls are symmetrically pierced along a horizontal transverse direction in preset position, in a way that when the piece is docked and screwed to the floating structure, said holes are coincident in shape, dimensions and position with the consecutive aligned transverse grooves (6) of all stacked floating elements, so the attachable front prow (95) can be also held to the watercraft by means of a crossbar (1) that goes through said side holes and said consecutive aligned transverse grooves (6), as a kind of big bolt for fixing the whole piece on the watercraft main body.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">These attachable front prows (95) allow change and to improve modularly and interchangeably shapes, materials, lengths, mechanical properties and hydrodynamic shape of almost any modular watercraft's prow without changing the main composing longitudinal floating elements in docking and undocking operations. For example, among the many custom possibilities, it is possible to dock a hard prow for working in shallow landscapes with hard, rocky, abrasive soils, floating debris, or even a metal saw-teeth blade (98) for cutting thin ice layers or ice blocks as an icebreaker ship does, protecting the softer longitudinal floating elements, especially if made in plastic.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">Once described the elements related to the hull and buoyancy, it is time for full description of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) and modifications and related pieces with these elements.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">The two twin coupled U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) attached to each float or float sliced section (2), (67), (71), (72), (73), (74), (75), (76), (82), (83), (84) or (85) constitute, once joined together, a rectangular horizontal frame which is elongated with its longer side in parallel to the main longitudinal floating elements.

Also provide an interlaced sandwiched expandable main frame with increased structural rigidity against compression and shear forces, by being simultaneously screwed to the other two main structural parts in a same, as well as by touching sideward by their longer central linear sections to other two twin coupled U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) belonging to adjacent floating structural modules, or other intermediate elements or accessories interposed therebetween.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">Each pair of coupled U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) have the problem that they are not linked together directly, needing to be connected through the same float or float section (2), (67), (71), (72), (73), (74), (75), (76), (82), (83), (84) or (85) where both are screwed or bolted, acting such floating element as a joining intermediate piece between them. Therefore, if both are coplanar it is because they are fixed only by the transverse grooves (5) and the sets of thick and strong crossbars-U-shaped longitudinal bars connecting screws, threaded rods or bolts (8) and floats-U-shaped longitudinal bars connecting screws or bolts (9), as happens with mutual coplanarity of all coupled pairs of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3). So any enough strong hit, any enough continuous wear, any excessive deformation could break said fixing screws or bolts, removing U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) from their positions of assembly on the transverse grooves (5), dismantling the main platform and part of the floating structure, perhaps collapsing it. This expandable main frame is then vulnerable to excessive shear movements which are both parallel and perpendicular to the crossbars (1), to traction movements in the direction of the crossbars (1), to twisting movements also according to an axis parallel to the crossbars (1) that separate them from the same common horizontal plane, as well as to bending movements on the crossbars (1).Such efforts are mainly supporting by the screws. Furthermore, when removing one or both U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) from a floating structural module, they remain separated between them, so they should be handled compulsorily separately unless both were connected by a common rectangular plate or platform section.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">For avoiding those problems, as seen in <figref idrefs="f0011"><b>Figure 23</b></figref>, to each coupled pair of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) two twin small, simple transverse crossbars (100) are added, which are preferably made of metal, stainless steel or alloy resistant to corrosion for obtaining structural strength, being solid or hollow tubular, with the same outer cross section than the inner cross section that the metal tube with which the U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) are made, or slightly smaller than last one. Each one of said small transverse crossbars (100) can fit and being inserted easily with no clearances by inside the tubular openings of the transverse ends of tubular U-shaped longitudinal bars (3), in a way that when assembled, half of each of these small transverse crossbars (100) is introduced inside a transverse end of a single U-shaped longitudinal bar (3), and the opposite half can also fit inside a transverse end of another opposite single U-shaped longitudinal bar (3) in mirrored arrangement in relation to<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> the first one, precisely as U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) are arranged when coupled and fixed to the transverse grooves (5) sharing a common float or float sliced section (2), (67), (71), (72), (73), (74), (75), (76), (82), (83), (84) or (85). Both transverse ends of both coupled U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) and both twin small transverse crossbars (100) placed inside them are drilled with the same coincident consecutive vertical holes (in coupling position) with the vertical holes practiced on top horizontal surface of transverse grooves (5) for placing the sets of floats-U-shaped longitudinal bars connecting screws (9), so these fixing screws cross both types of structural metal pieces. As the holes in the small transverse crossbars (100) are threaded for retaining these fixing screws (9) into them, the sets of floats-U-shaped longitudinal bars connecting screws (9) can join together both coupled U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) in a single whole linked by the said middle twin small transverse crossbars (100), even if they are not screwed to any floating element, but increasing enormously structural strength of detached floating structural modules and assembled floating structures when they are screwed to any floating element, as they maintain all U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) in the same plane, especially if said small transverse crossbars (100) are solid, made in metal, and fill completely hollow transverse ends of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3).</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">Some or all pairs of coupled twin U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) can be replaced by rectangular frames (99), characterized by having exactly the same shape, dimensions and perimeter than each one of said pairs of coupled twin U-shaped longitudinal bars (3), thus both can be swapped indifferently in all the assemblies. So these rectangular frames (99) have standardized dimensions as all pairs of coupled twin U-shaped longitudinal bars (3), with the sides that are perpendicular to the crossbars (1) in coupling positions of the same constant length, and with the sides that are parallel to the crossbars (1) in coupling positions of a series of possible standardized lengths in a positive integer number of segments. By the same reasons, all holes drilled on each pair of coupled twin U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) are replicated exactly in diameter and coincident positions on their counterparts, those rectangular frames (99) having the same dimensions and perimeter. As these rectangular frames (99) can not be split in two smaller, lighter halves as their counterparts, they have more difficulties in storage and transport, not in assembly operations, but are weaker as they are shaped by bending the tube right angles in preset positions and welding at some point in the perimeter, which can be corroded or be broken with time.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">As seen in <figref idrefs="f0008"><b>Figure 16</b></figref>, above a single floating element a segment in width, one of the two said elements for constituting a section of platform can be coupled indifferently (a pair of coupled U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) or a rectangular frame (99) of the same dimensions and perimeter), with same results with exception of the structural strength. But if the floating element has n segments in width, or there are several of them stacked in mutual side contact in a pile with n overall segments in width, both different elements can be coupled indifferently or in mixed coupling until completing said n segments in width, as the coupling operations are based in the match of the number of overall segments between<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> the two different types of pieces to couple, not in the match of the same value of segments of width between two different pieces to couple, as second case is a particular situation inside first case. In other words, each coupled pair of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) and each rectangular frame (99) can be coupled over a floating element with the same width in segments, for constituting a floating structural module, or well be coupled over a floating element, or several ones, having different width. In first case the floating structural modules can be coupled or uncoupled to a floating structure in assembly detachedly one by one, including all their possible docked accessories and contents inside their inner compartments (68), while in second case this is not possible, but as the main structural elements are interlaced even more, resulting structure is even stronger by intercrossing of different pieces with different width. So for example, a pontoon bridge can be built using big floating elements three segments wide, but the platform coupled above is made with rectangular frames (99) a single segment wide, obtaining triple number of crosspieces in the bridge for supporting more weight on the platform (for example, for passing vehicles), or two segments wide, being interlaced with bottom floating elements and raising rigidity, as the widths of both elements individually do not match. This operation is the same for sliding covers (10) and (79), rectangular platform sections (92), and other possible accessories.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">Over each one of the pairs of coupled U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) and over each one of the rectangular frames (99), a modular rectangular platform (101) can be screwed or bolted along their respective metal tube perimeters through drilled holes, for giving a walking platform or main deck which is expandable with each floating structural module added, each coupled pair of coupled U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) added, and each rectangular frame (99) added, so main deck expands or shrinks modularly. So they have standardized dimensions of an integer positive number of segments in length in one of their sides, for always matching with size and dimensions of the different standardized coupled pairs of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) and rectangular frames (99), matching well with their external perimeter for being screwed or bolted over them, or matching with their internal perimeter for being screwed or bolted fitting inside, resting over the top surface of the floating element below if it is present. They also have drilled holes in matching positions with those two elements for screwing or bolting operations. Those modular rectangular platforms (101) can be made in any resistant material for supporting weight and load with no breakage (perforated stainless steel plates, hard plastic, wood), always with rough textures or anti-slip surfaces for safety when walking, standing and stepping.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">All of these platform rectangular modules, made of coupled pairs of U-shaped longitudinal bars U (3) or rectangular frames (99), cooperate with the other elements by supporting each other to each other to withstand better compressive and shear forces in transverse direction, but they are relatively ineffective against transverse tensile and longitudinal shear forces that tend to separate them or to slide them longitudinally in parallel to each other, so that these types of deformations will be fully supported by the sets of thick and strong crossbars-floats fixing screws or bolts (7), crossbars-U-shaped longitudinal<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --> bars fixing screws, threaded rods or bolts (8) and floats-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws or bolts (9). Therefore, several anchoring elements for additional reinforcement against these movements are added. <figref idrefs="f0013"><b>Figure 26</b></figref> shows the different ways in which two adjacent floating structural modules or platform rectangular modules (that is, with no floating element below) may be in mutual side contact. In long structures is would be convenient to attach, in those positions along crossbars (1) where there are no floating element underneath, some metal oblique braces (102) for reinforcement, which can be secured with convenient screws or bolts to the holes present in crossbars (1), that are free. Such elements would be essential in very long structures, especially if they are experiencing strong water currents, since the ends and the central sections would be subjected to differential thrust forces which would tend to bend the crossbars (1) in the same direction. For those watercrafts or rafts where no oblique metal braces (102) can be placed because all the length in crossbars (1) is full with floating elements, additional fixation elements are added. Those new elements are for bolting two adjacent U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) in mutual contact that belong to two adjacent different floating structural modules. For that, U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) can be provided with vertical holes or anchoring vertical side tubes (103) in the same predetermined positions along some points on its perimeter, for inserting through them thick strong anchoring U-shaped pins (104) or X-shaped pins (105) of vertical insertion, being the most effective action if the coupling positions of said elements are placed near the corners and center of longitudinal sides of each pair of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) or rectangular racks (99) to bolt. Obviously, rectangular platforms (101) are drilled with the same coincident holes for allowing these bolting operations.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">Other possibility for reinforcing the structure is the placement of modular accessories that fit inside the perimeter of each coupled pair of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) or each rectangular frame (99) and can be screwed or bolted to them, so in addition to their specific functions they can cooperate to the structural strength. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0013"><b>Figure 27</b></figref>, wide accessories such as baskets or trays <b>(a)</b> may be dropped vertically to fit into the inner perimeter of a coupled pair of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) or of a rectangular frame (99), using the sets of holes in the crossbar (1) for the sets of crossbars-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws, threaded rods or bolts (8) for fixation by bolting with no sliding capability. Those elements may be wide and occupy all surface delimited by said perimeter, or only a part. In this last case, the accessories can have the ability of slide longitudinally forward or backward for commodity or for adjusting position of cargo in parallel direction to the straight linear sections of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) or rectangular frames (99) that are transverse to the crossbars (1), resting and sliding above them, between two stopping positions delimited by their sides parallel to the crossbars (1). For that, some horizontal wheeled pins (107) can be useful when bolted to said accessories docked inside a rectangular perimeter of two coupled U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) or of a rectangular frame (99), as they allow sliding until stopper positions resting on these elements but they prevent their accidental release in vertical direction due to water movements. The sliding can be<!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --> obviously avoided by insertion of a single or several vertical pins, exactly as the previous case.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">A kind of new necessary element to greater accommodation and safety for passengers in a watercraft are lateral supports (108) providing with cushioned or inflatable sections (109) for attaching a soft, safe gunwale, similar to those that rigid inflatable boats have but detachable. Said elements can be anchored vertically arranged in parallel direction to the floating elements above the U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) or rectangular frames (99) and being bolted to them, or well, for saving space, they can be provided with at least two twin inner crossbar (13) stumps for being inserted and fixed inside the tubular ends of crossbars (1) of the watercraft.

For serving also as illustrative example of the constructive possibilities of the invention, this watercraft has been built with floating elements different in length but symmetrically arranged (as it can happen in case of pieces shortage), being the side floating elements two twin short floats (2) coupled in inverted position with their pointed extreme placed at the stern of the watercraft, shaping a staggered prow but avoiding to have a saw-teeth prow which could retain water flow in water bags at prow.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">Concluded exposition of structural reinforcement elements for platform of the floating structures, a new group of elements and refinements allow the side linking of two adjacent floating structural modules by hinges, so two of them can fold mutually along its common hinge, as well as several or many floating structural modules can be linked in flexible chains of varying lengths. Said hinges also are important structural reinforcement elements but are included in this other different group for best clarity in exposition. It is necessary to argue the necessity of these new type of structures possible to assemble thanks to said hinges.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">The transport of preassembled rigid structures to elsewhere can be difficult depending on the size, weight and linear dimensions of the structure, terrain and environmental conditions, transport means and many factors. For example, if it was necessary to place a pontoon bridge in middle to a far streamline converted into a wild overflowed river because the hard rains for evacuating a crowded town in short time, it could be needed a cargo helicopter for its transport and placement by air, as its assembly piece by piece can take not only time but also danger for the constructing crew. If no helicopter is available, placement of said pontoon bridge could not be possible in due time. So far, all the elements and parts exposed are inserted each other and coupled together by movements that follow always the three perpendicular directions of space, which poses practical limitations in certain cases, being necessary to incorporate new elements to eliminate said limitations, discussed as follows.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">As seen in <figref idrefs="f0014"><b>Figure 29</b></figref>, with the parts and pieces already described and available, there are<!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --> few possible alternative methods for constructing floating walkways or floating bridges crossing perpendicularly a water stream of certain width, dragging force and torque applied on the said walkway or bridge. In method <b>(a)</b> a single or preferably at least two parallel cables or cables are placed crossing the water stream and fixed to both shores firmly tied to posts, trees, pegs, rocks or any firmly steady terrain features, using a spear gun to overcome the distance. Said cables serve as guideways for holding by opposing water dragging force of several floating structural modules which are to going filling the gap between shores at intervals by being attached along the parallel cables and being displaced by sliding along them to get close to the opposite shore, in a way that each floating structural module is intercalated with a platform section with no floating element. These cables pass through the transverse grooves (6), (4) or (77) of the floating elements used. In case of using middle transverse grooves <b>(4)</b> the modules are harder to build but stronger, as the cables are retained with no possibility of releasing (with only exception of cable breakage) by the structural frames constituted by coupled pairs of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) or rectangular frames (99). In case of using ending transverse grooves (4) or (77) the modules are easy to build but weaker, as it is only necessary to open and to close sliding covers (10) and (79) for placing and retaining the cable inside. In this case, each new floating structural module or platform section is added at the shore, linked to the last one of the growing chain, and all the chain is pushed to the opposite shore one step along the guide cables. The floating walkway grows in stages, one with each floating structural or platform section added. As only two transverse grooves (4), (6) or (77) are crossed by the guide cables, the other free two are for going placing through, along of them, twin lines of crossbars (1) rigidly connected in series by middle inner crossbars (13) sections, so these lines are for giving stiffness to the floating structure. So from the beginning, each time a new floating structural module is added to the growing chain, a section of crossbars (1) is coupled and screwed and / or bolted to it, so all of them in the chain are joined to the crossbars (1) line. By pushing said crossbars (1) in direction of the guide cables, for instance by hitting on them in its same direction with rubber mallets, al the assembled chain can displace slowly along guide cables to the other shore. At intervals twin middle inner crossbar (13) are placed for joining in series two consecutive crossbars (1) and multiplying its length. We should remember that use of pieces for cable passage (15), pointed terminal pieces for penetration and self-centering of the crossbars (22), and crossbars split in two U-shaped pieces (25) and inner crossbars split in two U-shaped pieces (26) instead of crossbars <b>(1)</b> and inner crossbars (13) may be fully useful for the duty. At the end detachable handrails, side panels or similar security items for evacuation or supply path are to be added. It is clear that in this method crew is safe at the shore, but the time spent, and the physical effort to perform may be excessive. An alternative method <b>(b)</b> does not involve coupling on the guide cables of the floating structural modules and platform sections one by one, but in preassembled sets of several of them. In this case considerations to do are similar to previous case, but probably with greater physical effort, so it only would be practical in case of having a mechanical or electrical traction<!-- EPO <DP n="52"> --> device from the opposite shore with an additional traction cable.</p><p id="p0105" num="0105">In an alternative method <b>(c)</b> the placing of the elements from the growing chains is performed one by one on the growing end on water of the floating pontoon bridge. In this case there are no guide cables, as if they were present the elements could not be coupled in this position, or at least with a reasonably difficulty. So the different floating structural modules and platform sections are transported one by one over the platform of the constructed section to the growing head on the extreme over the water, and linked and bolted to it in terminal position. So the extreme at the shore is firmly fixed to the soil, and at some intervals twin or twin pairs of terminal pieces for spiking to the shallow soil (23) or intermediate linking pieces for spiking to the shallow soil (24) are intercalated in terminal or middle positions along the lines of crossbars (1) to fix or anchor the floating pontoon bridge to the shallow soil, in case that water stream is not very strong. Obviously, this method requires less physical strength than two first ones, but the floating pontoon bridge is not fixed as firmly as in these cases by supporting guide cables, and the elements are transported to and placed one by one on the extreme over the water, so crew may be in risk situation. But also there is the problem that, as there are no supporting cables, with the characteristics and features of the parts and pieces, there are no easy way of attaching or fastening a float (2), (71), (72), (73) or (85) on the water surface but resisting the drag force, and even less of maintaining it with the transverse grooves (4), (6) and (77) consecutively aligned with the row of those from the stacked aligned floating structural modules already assembled, before they could be thread by the crossbars (1). Alternative method <b>(d)</b> is similar to <b>(c)</b>, except that the elements are coupled to the growing chain in preassembled and stiffened straight short sections from the shore, to be towed through the water to final binding position or transported over the platform of already assembled part of the structure.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">This important limitation, which could endanger assembly crews, is because all the elements and parts exposed are inserted each other and coupled together by movements that follow always the three perpendicular directions of space, with no rotation movements allowed.</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">To solve this problem and for strengthening even more the expandable main frame of the invention, a series of coaxial equal longitudinal hinges (110) are added to all or all pairs of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) and rectangular frames (99) for obtaining hinged U-shaped longitudinal bars (111) and hinged rectangular frames (112) respectively, as seen in <figref idrefs="f0015"><b>Figure 30</b></figref>. Said longitudinal hinges (110) allow hinge in longitudinal direction over a common folding axis two of these structural elements, so also two adjacent floating structural modules. They consist of equal thick cylindrical metal tubes which are joined by any method (as may be welded, screwed or bolted), longitudinally, coaxially, consecutively exactly on the top outer edge of the linear sections of a usual U-shaped longitudinal bar (3) or usual rectangular frame (99) that in coupling positions on a floating structure are arranged in parallel to the floating elements, and perpendicularly to the crossbars (1), so they are not joined to any of their surfaces or faces, but exactly<!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --> on this edge, protruding slightly upward and sideward a little additional preset distance. This little preset distance places the symmetry central axis and folding axis of each longitudinal hinge (110) and each row of some aligned of them coincidently with the edge between two hinged U-shaped longitudinal bars (111) and hinged rectangular frames (112) but slightly above from their top surfaces for allowing the mutual folding, with the caution of placing gaps between each two consecutively aligned longitudinal hinges (110) in the same row for matching, coupling and hinging with other row from an adjacent hinged U-shaped longitudinal bar (111) or hinged rectangular frame (112) symmetrically arranged to the previous one in relation to its common folding axis defined by said aligned longitudinal hinges (110). The joining position of said longitudinal hinges (110) does not introduce additional distances sideward due to touch between adjacent hinged U-shaped longitudinal bars (111) and / or hinged rectangular frames (112), so coupling positions of these two elements over the crossbars (1) are coincident with usual U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) and rectangular frames (99). Then it is possible to swap indifferently all of them in the assemblies, with the difference that hinged versions can fold one over each other or being linked in more or less long chains through said longitudinal hinges (110), as well as the floating structures composed by these hinged elements with their floating structural modules assembled together in mutual contact and hinged by inserting hinging bolts, are much stronger, as said longitudinal hinges (110) constitute a new linking element that impedes the relative separation of adjacent floating structural modules, relieving an important portion of the task from the sets of crossbars-floats fixing screws or bolts (7), crossbars-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws, threaded rods or bolts (8) and floats-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws or bolts (9). Pins or bolts (113) are responsible of joining each two rows of longitudinal hinges (110) in a common folding axis.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">In addition to this important task of reinforcement of structure, another simple practical utility, compatible with previous one, is to allow to link laterally side tilting or swinging accessories as side foldable panels; side foldable accessing ramps or side foldable bridge sections, which swing around a row of said longitudinal hinges (110) in one or both free ends of floating structure. But also important is possibility is that when the stack or series of floating structural modules are not still impaled by any stiffening crossbar (1) but they are mutually linked each two by their longitudinal hinges (110), they remain joined in a chain of floating structural modules whose links have a certain degree of mutual rotational freedom, so said chains are flexible and can be folded or curved only to the folding direction that longitudinal hinges (110) allow, as the other direction is impeded because touch between all the elements.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">This feature is fundamental for construction of long structures as pontoon bridges quickly and safely. As seen in the process of <figref idrefs="f0015"><b>Figure 31</b></figref><b>,</b> one of the main utilities of longitudinal hinges (110) is to facilitate lateral linking of additional floating structural modules to the growing end over water on a floating pontoon walkway in construction both a single one each time as in sets of two, three, or even more, depending on the size and weight of the resulting final short chains, the number of assembly<!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --> workers, and conditions. In lack of longitudinal hinges (110), for linking a new floating structural module to the growing end over the water body or water stream, those should to be dropped to water and being kept in correct position with hands, ropes or other means, despite the water dragging force, while introducing or attempting to introduce the crossbars (1) through transverse grooves (4), (6) or (77), with risk for operators and risk of losing the piece. Instead, with this improvement, said floating structural module can be linked to the growing end by said longitudinal hinges (110) and fixing pins (113) without dropping it to water, and once linked, it can be dropped freely to water with no risk of being lost dragged by the stream. Then, it is easier to impale this new floating structural module with crossbars (1) provided of pointed terminal pieces for penetration and self-centering of the crossbars (22) hitting with rubber mallets on their opposite side at the shore, as all series of transverse grooves (4) (6) or (77), are now much better aligned in the right direction.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">Instead of adding flotation structural modules one by one, they can also be added in short chains of several of them, which can be in turn partially flexible by being linked together by their respective longitudinal hinges (110), or rigid by being impaled by crossbars (1), as seen in <figref idrefs="f0015"><b>Figure 32</b></figref><b>.</b> In <b>(a)</b> the new rigid section is added to the growing structure through their respective longitudinal hinges (110) and terminal pins (113), so thereafter stiffness is obtained by further impalement by crossbars (1) and screwing to them.

We should notice that in this case the structure is more flexible than previous one, as longitudinal hinges (110) do not allow the folding below the horizontal plane of the platform because touching among pieces, while in second case said variable angled pieces with centered hinge (29) allow symmetrical angles above and below, as well as they introduce gaps in the structure for making possible this feature, being this structure suitable for long floating structures in wavy water. For safe transport and safe linking, it would be suitable some kind of hooked trolley, with which an operator places the bolts (113) with appropriate tools to maintain a certain distance hands and fingers from the pieces, while other operator maintains the new section to add in correct position comfortably using his own body as counterweight.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">As not only a single floating structural module but several of them at the same time can be linked, in certain circumstances a lot of time could be saved by transporting them in pre-assembled arrangements to strengthen and stiffen later in short time by impalement with crossbars (1) As seen in <figref idrefs="f0016"><b>Figure 33</b></figref><b>,</b> watercrafts and rafts, as short floating pontoons, can be folded in two layers reducing its width by half, in addition to which in turn they can be stacked in successive double layers one above the other, exploiting to maximum spaces in storing facilities and vehicles.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">Another important practical application of longitudinal hinges (110) is to allow assembly<!-- EPO <DP n="55"> --> of preassembled arrangements of easy and quick transport and deployment of long, large floating structures, exploiting the feature that the floating structural modules can be chained, folded, curled, wound, shaped for further impalement and strengthening with crossbars (1). So that said preassembled arrangements give new methods of transport, deployment and collecting of structures as may be long floating walkways or bridges much faster than previously seen.</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">Several flotation structural units can be linked by their longitudinal hinges (110) of their hinged U-longitudinal bars (111) and / or hinged rectangular frames (112) with the help of fixing pins (113). All of said modules can be folded in the same direction of rotation, but not to the other or in alternating directions, curving part or all of the flexible chain to a single side. So always all floats or float sliced sections (2), (67), (71), (72), (73), (74), (75), (76), (82), (83), (84) or (85) are on convex side of the curved chain, and all hinged U-longitudinal bars (111) and / or hinged rectangular frames (112) are inwardly on concave side. With no crossbars (1) impaling and giving rigidity to the floating structure linked with longitudinal hinges (110), each one of the flotation structural modules may be disposed in relation to an adjacent one freely at any angle between 0 ° (the two flotation structural modules are aligned in the same plane), and close to 180 ° (the flotation structural modules are completely folded). With three floating structural modules linked mutually by their longitudinal hinges (110), the floating structure can be closed in a prismatic shape with two twin polygonal bases, being said structure in shape of triangular prism, regular or irregular, depending on the width in segments of each one of the three floating structural modules linked. Obviously, the more floating structural modules in the closed chain, the more close is the shaped prism to a cylinder, so these cyclic prismatic structures, having enough number of sides, so enough number of floating structural modules linked, would aid to transport rolling on ground large or long preassembled structures, either by vehicles as by human force, easy to transport and fast to deploy by simple unwinding, in a similar way as a carpet or a blind does. But if there are more than three, such prismatic structures fold because its own weight. These cyclic prismatic structures are useful only when they are wound previously around a central reel piece for supporting its own weight and maintaining it in open disposition for rolling on ground, but also maintaining tighten the chain around them with no clearances.</p><p id="p0114" num="0114">In <figref idrefs="f0016"><b>Figure 34</b></figref> ssome examples of reel middle pieces are seen, being the most useful and simple convex polygonal racks (114) in <b>(a)</b>.They are constituted by a flat metal tube frame with a shape of convex polygon, usually regular, so having the same angles and sides, because in this way it is possible to wind chained floating structural modules around, shaping cyclic regular prisms, suitable for being transported rolling or stepping-rolling on ground is they are enough close to a cylinder in shape. They do not need to be as thick as convex polygonal frames (32) as they do not pass through transverse grooves (4), (6) and (77) as those, so they do not need to have their same cross section, but they are made in a metal tube enough strong. Side lengths have always standardized values of a positive integer number of segments in length for allowing matching and coupling. Almost all of their structural strength is due<!-- EPO <DP n="56"> --> to a series of radial reinforcing rods that connect opposite vertices and / or opposite points as a bicycle wheel, but also having a central ring or central tube, which is centered on the piece and is coplanar in relation to it. At least two twin convex polygonal racks (114) can be arranged coaxially in vertical parallel planes in they are joined by transverse bars that connects respective vertex, and also optionally edges from both two. This shapes a cage in form of polygonal prism, which has twin bases constituted by both twin convex polygonal racks (114) and lies resting over one of their rectangular faces. This cage is the reel middle piece around of which it is possible to wind the chain of floating structural modules, previously linked by their longitudinal hinges (110) as explained. Given a chain of floating structural modules, linked each two consecutive of them by their longitudinal hinges (110), a pair of twin convex polygonal racks (114) is chosen for assembling the said cage for that chain, but having necessarily such twin convex polygonal racks (114) the same number of sides than the number of floating structural modules linked in the chain, as well as the length of each one of their sides is matched with the width of each one of the floating structural modules linked in the chain. In other words, if all sides on each convex polygonal rack (114) are equal, all floating structural modules linked in the chain must have the same width than the side length of those sides, so usually being identical. If sides on each convex polygonal rack (114) have different lengths, widths from each floating structural modules linked in the chain must be matched in the same sequence, matching one by one when winding over the reel cage middle piece. Then, it is possible to wind the chain around said reel cage middle piece following and matching its perimeter, obtaining a prismatic shape with outer floating structural modules when terminal longitudinal hinges (110) are linked by fixing bolts (113). As each different prismatic geometry needs a specific reel cage middle piece, so two specific twin convex polygonal racks (114), most suitable ones for manufacturing may be regular hexagonal racks (114) or regular octagonal racks (114).</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">If it is necessary to assemble a prismatic structure for transporting a pontoon bridge, but there are no convex polygonal racks (114) because lack or shortage of pieces, it may be possible to use rings or tubes with enough diameter <b>(b)</b> for maintaining the chain open but loosen, so they would roll on ground with more effort. As advantage, any floating structural modules can be linked in any order, only taking care of matching with radius of central elements used.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">In <b>(c)</b> tthere is an example of an alternative element for shaping prismatic arrangements of chained floating structural modules in which the prism shaped around have always the same number of sides, but their lengths may vary, and can be used for shaping prisms with regular polygonal bases (equilateral and equiangular sides), with bases in form of convex equilateral non-equiangular polygons, with bases in form of convex equiangular non-equilateral polygons, or with irregular convex polygonal bases. This element allows built a reel cage middle piece whose shaping ability is adjustable but weaker than in previous convex polygonal racks (114). These elements are star-shaped adjustable racks (116), which consists of at least three tubular spoke arms of the same length and same square or<!-- EPO <DP n="57"> --> rectangular cross section, which are welded at their ends to a common center in a same plane, giving to the piece a star-shaped look. As convex polygonal racks (114) have, on its center all star-shaped adjustable racks (116) have a central hole that crosses it completely in a direction that is perpendicular in relation to its main plane that serves for introduction of a cylindrical cross-bar, along rotation axis of the assembly for pulling or pushing on ground all the structure wound around the reel cage middle piece in prism-shaped form. Such tubular spokes are distributed symmetrically around the center, with the same angle between each adjacent two of them, and are drilled with identical holes in a direction that is perpendicular in relation to the piece's main plane, being those holes arranged in rows of constant spacing centered and aligned on each spoke, so each hole on a concrete spoke always has other counterparts in other spokes at the same radial distance from the center than theirs. Then, a movable wedge (117) for each spoke can be moved radially and be placed on a concrete radial position by a bolt or pin that crosses the piece and one of those holes on the spokes. Said movable wedges (117) can be placed then at the same or at different radial distances from center independently. For that, each one of them has an U-shaped guide piece that fits and slides over the outer surfaces of the spokes, having also the hole for its fixation pin or bolt along its corresponding spoke. In a same way than movable wedges (117), each spoke has a telescopic leg (118), which can also move along its corresponding spoke and can be fixed on a desired radial position thanks to a fixing pin or bolt independent from the others, but in this case displacing inside the tube the spokes are made with, for not colliding with movable wedge (117) from its same spoke.</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">Two identical star-shaped adjustable racks (116) can be arranged coaxially in parallel vertical planes, and can be joined by transverse bars for constituting a star-shaped reel cage middle piece. Around this element it is possible to wind, in a similar way as described for convex polygonal racks (114), a chain of linked floating structural modules which can adapt a prismatic shape with the same number of floating structural modules than number of spokes of the twin star-shaped adjustable racks (116) chosen, being possible with these to fit chains having different width among them with no problem, in difference with convex polygonal racks (114). In this case the chained floating structural modules are not supported in prismatic shape by tube straight sections (the sides of convex polygonal racks (114)) by a side-side touch, but by a corner-corner touch. The movable wedges (117) have angular shape, so along its displacement along its respective radial spokes they can be placed on a radial distance each (either if the same than if different, depending on the structure to shape around) for fitting and matching to a inner corner of the tubular prismatic hollow of the prismatic structure of chained floating structural modules to shape and to maintain with no falling because its own weight. For this purpose, said movable wedges (117) have a section which is perpendicular to the main plane of the star-shaped adjustable rack (116) with which can reach and hold the structure in a prismatic shape. In these prismatic structures both star-shaped adjustable racks (116) are arranged in vertical planes outside all the outer<!-- EPO <DP n="58"> --> perimeters of all coupled pairs of hinged U-shaped longitudinal bars (111) or hinged rectangular frames (112), so said perpendicular protruding section of each movable wedge (117) elongates and reaches to inside said perimeters, touching each one a corner between two hinged U-shaped longitudinal bars (111) or hinged rectangular frames (112), flanking middle row of longitudinal hinges (110). Therefore, the ends of the spokes of star-shaped adjustable racks (116) protrude radially slightly from the prismatic structure on the gaps formed at prow and stern between each two partially folded adjacent floating elements, so each telescopic leg (118) has free path with no collision with other elements for being moved radially.</p><p id="p0118" num="0118">Whether using convex polygonal racks (114) or star-shaped adjustable racks (116), the floats or float sliced sections (2), (67), (71), (72), (73), (74), (75), (76), (82), (83), (84) and (85) are always arranged outside, so they are the elements that touch the ground. In case of waterlogged, muddy, sandy, soft soils or full of vegetation, it is no problem, but if terrain is hard, floating elements can be damaged or broken when rolling, so it is fully suitable use of star-shaped adjustable racks (116) with telescopic legs (118), so they may make contact with the ground instead of floating elements, allowing an adjustable-in-height standing base or bracket for holding the prismatic structure, that also allow to place it horizontally, correcting irregularities in the soil, as well to going advancing rolling by consecutive steps. Changing the type or feet on said telescopic legs (118) it is possible to roll over soft soils without dipping because the weight by increasing feet's surface, to have best grabbing by adding feet with hooks or rough surfaces, or to build a detachable big wheel for rolling all prismatic structure through country paths, rails or roads by extending said feet in form of a detachable wheel rim (119). Such detachable wheel rims (119) are composed of identical detachable wheel rim sections, in a way that when docked to spokes on a same the star-shaped adjustable racks (116) they constitute a circular wheel with spokes. Two twin ones of these assemblies can give a two-wheeled cart for transporting a fast-deployment big, heavy, bulky pontoon bridge rolling on ground pulled by a motor vehicle or by human force. Those big side wheels can be built coupled on the star-shaped adjustable racks (116) used for shaping the chain of floating structural modules around, so all the structure spins as a whole and has a big rotation momentum, or coupled to two twin additional side star-shaped adjustable racks (116) sharing a common horizontal shaft with the prismatic structure supported, so transport is enhanced as the bulky prism does not spin with the side wheels.</p><p id="p0119" num="0119">Case <b>(d)</b> is a foldable version of star-shaped adjustable racks (116), in which spokes are replaced by a certain number of bars threaded through a central common axis where a shaft is inserted. Movable wedges (117) and telescopic legs (118) works exactly in the same way. Despite a lower structural strength and not allowing odd numbers of chained floating structural modules, they are easily transportable on vehicles.</p><p id="p0120" num="0120">In <figref idrefs="f0016"><b>Figure 35</b></figref> an example of the comparative effectiveness of various forms of land transport through difficult terrains are seen, involving transport by human force or small motor vehicles.</p><p id="p0121" num="0121">Thanks to these prismatic structures, it is possible a quicker and easier transport of long wound<!-- EPO <DP n="59"> --> structures rolling on ground, but also its quicker deployment than in case of assembling them piece by piece, by unwinding, unfolding and stiffening with crossbars (1). It is also possible to split the wound floating chain into several parts, so these procedures may allow transport to a difficult place either a long floating pontoon bridge, as several detachable watercrafts in a single whole. As seen in <figref idrefs="f0017"><b>Figure 36</b></figref><b>,</b> once at the deployment point, in this case a shore at side of a water stream to cross with a floating pontoon bridge to deploy, chain of linked floating structural modules is open by unlinking a row of longitudinal hinges (110). If some pieces are transported inside the prismatic structure when rolling on ground, secured by brackets or any suitable fastening methods, they are removed and prepared for use and docking, as may be crossbars (1). Once set and anchored to the soil from shore one of the ends of the chain of linked floating structural modules, in this example using nailed bars and chains, the reel cage middle piece composed of twin convex polygonal racks (114) is pushed in direction to water, unwinding the chain, giving a flexible straight section of floating pontoon bridge, still to stiffen with crossbars (1). Then, it is possible to continue adding, one by one, more floating structural modules until completion of all floating pontoon bridge length by methods described above. Along all aligned consecutive transverse grooves (4), (5) and (77), the crossbars are introduced (1), suitably lubricated externally, for impaling, fixing and strengthening all the pontoon bridge, using elements described above for making these procedures easier. Alternatively, if the floating pontoon bridge should be very long, it is also possible to link a second prismatic structure (a second spool of floating structural modules) to the first one, linking them by the same row of longitudinal hinges (110), doubling the length of pontoon bridge, and performing unwinding and strengthening operations. By practical reasons, a third spool of floating structural modules is hard to be moved along a section of pontoon bridge because size and weight reasons, so additional floating structural modules must be added one by one, or said third spool of floating structural modules should be moved to the extreme on water floating for linking and unwinding. In addition, it is not suitable to build rigid floating pontoon bridges too long with crossbars (1) because structural reasons.</p><p id="p0122" num="0122">The more important limitation to notice is that in these pontoon bridges, the floating elements have no gaps between each two of them. But if leaving gaps, prismatic structures formed can not roll easily on ground, except if they are mounted over twin big side wheels. It is therefore necessary to find a suitable way to attach intercalated platform sections between each two floating structural modules, in a kind of mixed wound-folded prismatic structures. <figref idrefs="f0017"><b>Figure 37</b></figref> shows how two twin platform sections can be linked at both sides of a floating structural module, using their longitudinal hinges (110) for linking. Repeating this assembly multiple times, an accordion-shape foldable structure is obtained, well linear if all floating structural modules are in the same plane, well curved if those are gradually turned a certain angle around their consecutive longitudinal hinges (110) in a curved arrangement. But this device has two platform sections whose folding direction is inverted in relation to the normal direction allowed with<!-- EPO <DP n="60"> --> normal position of longitudinal hinges (110), which are above the platform horizontal plane when the structure is completely unfolded or unwound. For allowing shaping of a chain in accordion, each floating structural module has two coupled hinged U-shaped longitudinal bars (111) or a hinged rectangular frame (112), but the twin platform sections are not made with those elements, as the middle hinge that folds mutually them must invert its folding direction. This alternation of folding directions allow to platform sections to be folded upwards or inwards in the prismatic mixed wound-folded arrangements, where there is enough free space in the central tubular hollow to accommodate them. As seen in said <figref idrefs="f0017">Figure <b>37</b></figref><b>,</b> the two twin platform sections mutually foldable can be built with three types of elements to choose depending on the circumstances and availability or shortage of pieces. In an imperfect arrangement (a), they are made with two coupled pairs of hinged U-shaped bars (111), only inverting vertically in coupling position on each coupled pair the hinged U-shaped bar (111) that links both platform sections mutually foldable, reversing then the direction of the folding movement. This is perfect in case that U-shaped longitudinal bars (3), hinged U-shaped longitudinal bars (111), rectangular frames (99) and hinged rectangular frames (112) are flat, but not in case that they may present a not flat embodiment with curves or bent sections for structural reasons. If this is so, unfolding is not complete because collision between those inverted U-shaped bars (111) and crossbars (1) when they will be coupled, but may be a solution in case of pieces unavailability or shortage. In difference, arrangements (b) and (c) allow a complete folding and unfolding for complete screwing in concordance with holes for fixing elements in the crossbars (1) when coupled. However, they use new parts to be manufactured exclusively for this particular application, but usually they are only for exclusive use on prismatic wound-folded assemblies.</p><p id="p0123" num="0123">In case <b>(b)</b> each rectangular platform section is constituted by a modified hinged rectangular frame (120), which is exactly the same than a hinged rectangular frame (112), but having a row of their longitudinal hinges (110) inverted vertically in relation to the other one, so allowing inversion of folding direction. In case <b>(c)</b> each rectangular platform section is constituted by a hinged U-shaped longitudinal bar (111) coupled with a modified hinged U-shaped longitudinal bar (121) for obtaining the same result, being said modified hinged U-shaped longitudinal bar (121) a modification of a hinged U-shaped longitudinal bar (111) where the row of longitudinal hinges is vertically inverted for allowing inversion of folding direction. In this last case, only practical utility of modified hinged U-shaped longitudinal bar (121) is to split the size and width of a modified hinged rectangular frame (120) in two halves for easy handling and storage.</p><p id="p0124" num="0124">So an accordion-foldable arrangement, having two twin foldable platform sections between each two consecutive floating structural modules linked through their respective longitudinal hinges (110), can be arranged in a prismatic wound-folded assembly starting from four floating structural modules. Really, this is possible only in case that the floating structural modules are wider than the platform sections because geometrical considerations, that is, the four triangles in which a square can be divided with their diagonals are not equilateral but isosceles. This is the same case with five floating<!-- EPO <DP n="61"> --> structural modules. But in case of having an prismatic wound-folded assembly of six floating structural modules, an special geometrical feature happens, as a regular hexagon can be divided into six smaller regular equilateral triangles having sides of the same length, so widths from their composing floating structural modules and platform sections can be the same.</p><p id="p0125" num="0125">In <figref idrefs="f0018"><b>Figure 38</b></figref> there is an example of a prismatic wound-folded assembly with six identical floating structural modules and six twin foldable rectangular platform sections folded inwards which are intercalated between each two floating structural modules. This structure is supported without folding because its own weight by a reel cage middle piece built with transverse bars joining two twin coaxial star-shaped adjustable racks (116) in vertical parallel planes. The perspective view allows better overview of the elements that are slightly clarified in previous two-dimensional figures, such as movable wedges (117) and telescopic legs (118), as well transverse bars (122) for shaping the reel cage middle piece. In smaller size there are additional figures showing a comparison of two-dimensional projections, in the direction of the main symmetry axis of the prismatic wound-folded assemblies, of structures having two twin and four twin foldable platform sections folded inwards. In case of having two, the overall length of the completely unwound and unfolded pontoon bridge is eighteen times the width of the floating structural modules used. In case of having four, the overall length of the completely unwound and unfolded pontoon bridge is thirty times the width of the floating structural modules used.</p><p id="p0126" num="0126">So it is obvious the extremely high compaction ability those prismatic wound-folded assembly feature. Therefore, when constructing a mixed prismatic wound-folded assembly it is possible to choose nearly all: composing parts, overall length after unfolding and unwinding, diameter, weight, length, presence of gaps between floating structural modules, number of sides, supporting bracket, side wheels, etc.</p><p id="p0127" num="0127">The deployment procedure of these prismatic wound-folded assemblies is similar to that seen in <figref idrefs="f0017"><b>Figure 36</b></figref> for wound structures, but in this case, immediately after release of each floating structural module, each pair of two twin rectangular platform sections linked is unfolded and introducing the crossbars (1) therethrough, so that the unfolded platform sections can rest on them and does not bend or break fatally by excess of weight, making the deployment process slow. In <figref idrefs="f0018"><b>Figure 39</b></figref> an alternative procedure is seen, in which the floating structure grows as a blind, by maintaining the prismatic wound-folded assembly in fix position on the shore supported by a bracket made with telescopic legs (118) and two twin side star-shaped adjustable racks (116) at a certain height for not touching with the soil or any other object, as a waterwheel, and extending the growing end. Firstly, it proceeds to completely unwind the prismatic wound-folded assembly, leaving resting on the soil or water surface all floating structural modules with their intercalated twin foldable platform sections folded upwards. Then the crossbars (1) are introduced along all or some transverse grooves (4), (6) or (77), which are now aligned consecutively, and they are screwed to the floating element farthest from shore. Then, by pushing crossbars (1), all other floating structural modules are dragged and all folding sections unfolded, for further screwing,<!-- EPO <DP n="62"> --> bolting and other procedures. This procedure is safer as the floating pontoon bridge is deployed from a structure anchored to the shore in safety, but also has the advantage of being reversible, being relatively easy to perform the inverse process of folding and winding the floating chain, especially with mechanical or electric devices. It is therefore suitable for temporary or permanent fixed placement in points where a portable detachable pontoon bridge is needed, for example in frequent flood zones or seasonal river overflow, where there are no bridges or similar infrastructures have been destroyed. To wind / fold and unwind / unfold faster and easier it is suitable to pass cables along through all transverse grooves (4), (6), (77) for pulling from the other side if accessible and if necessary, being then easier to impale with the crossbars (1) by using said cables as a guide.</p><p id="p0128" num="0128">A similar process to that summarized in <figref idrefs="f0017"><b>Figure 36</b></figref> but safer is shown in <figref idrefs="f0019"><b>Figure 40</b></figref><b>,</b> although it can not be used in deep water for avoiding to float above water but making to rest and to advance all structure standing over the shallow soil. In this case the structure is unwound and unfolded like a carpet, keeping fix and taut the end on the shore and making advancing all prismatic wound-folded structure to the opposite shore, step by step, standing over the four telescopic legs (118), being possible to ballast all structure for opposing to drag water force. Also optionally detachable wheel rims (119) can be used for having more surface on the shallow soil, but in this case telescopic legs (118) can not be adjusted separately for adapt to shallow soil irregularities. The growth is slow and must be done carefully in consecutive four-legged steps, so that, with effort and good coordination among team members, they are going releasing with caution each floating structural module to drop it, leaving it floating above water, then they push upward prying on the telescopic legs (118) that are not in contact with the soil to roll all structure over the two more advanced telescopic legs (118) from the four ones where the assembly is supported to the next four-legged standing step. Instead of pushing the prismatic structure for making it to roll, it is also best suitable to pull with cables or wires from the opposite shore if possible, for unwinding and unfolding all structure with safety and less risk for the crew, but someone must be on the same for releasing and unfolding the elements and for going adapting the more advanced telescopic legs (118) to possible shallow soil irregularities. A cable spool (123) freely rotating, positioned transversely inside the reel cage middle piece, for example spinning on the central shaft from the prismatic wound-folded structure, unwinds at least two cables which pass through all chosen rows of aligned transverse grooves (4), (6) or (77). If the floating elements are provided with crossbars (1) sections with terminal pieces for passing cables (15) on said transverse grooves (4), (6) or (77), a flexible floating pontoon bridge is obtained, supported by said cables, tighten and taut between the opposite shores. If this is not the case, those cables can serve as a guideways for pulling the crossbars (1) and go impaling all consecutive floating structural modules in a rigid structure to bolt, or several ones joined by flexible cables (for example, if two transverse grooves (4), (6) or (77) rows are filled with crossbars (1) and the other one or two with said cables). At the same time, other operators are behind<!-- EPO <DP n="63"> --> for ensuring the already extended pontoon bridge section with crossbars (1), nailed bars, ballasts, and other elements, as well placing the railings and security features. Many assemblies and constructive options are possible, so only a few illustrative examples are commented.</p><p id="p0129" num="0129">These accordion-folded structures, prismatic wound structures, and prismatic wound-folded structures can be preassembled in advance and stored in warehouses and headquarters, and shipped in appropriately sized vehicles quickly in distress call, or if forecast or magnitude of the event makes it advisable their immediate use or their availability in enough number for further use on need. As seen in <figref idrefs="f0019"><b>Figure 41</b></figref><b>,</b> one possibility to consider is not only the transport of these structures by cargo helicopters, but also perhaps the possible fast and quick laying and deploying in serious distress call, being the cargo helicopter itself responsible of transporting and unwinding and / or unfolding the long floating structure on the air, well completely or dropping a section over water, in minutes or seconds. Existing enough powerful cargo helicopters and air cranes being able of lifting several tons, only availability of pieces and aircraft, weather conditions, water conditions, fuel supply, aircraft's range and pilot's skill are critical matters. Procedure is to suspend hanging from the cargo helicopter, with an appropriate supporting frame or rack, a freely spinning reel cage middle piece wrapped by a prismatic wound-folded structure or prismatic wound structure to deploy. An electric drive system (124) controls releasing of floating structural units and rectangular platform sections from the spool, which fall guided through at least two cables that pass each one along a row of aligned transverse grooves (4), (6) or (77) that are provided with crossbars (1) sections with terminal lubricated pieces for passing cables (15) for good sliding of the chain along the guide cables, so the chain unwinds and unfolds by gravity but step by step slowly. The rotation of the spinning shaft may be also controlled by an engaged electric motor and / or brake (125) to better control the chain unwinding speed, which also could be able or rewinding and refolding the same for picking up of the structure when unnecessary using said cables as guideways. A cable spool (123) placed inside the device unwinds (or winds in reverse mode) said guide cables, being their extremes previously dropped to the shore, for being fixed firmly to elements as trees, posts, rocks, streetlights, bollards, or any similar thing to keep cables tensed and make fall the chain along them.</p><p id="p0130" num="0130">As seen in <figref idrefs="f0019"><b>Figure 42</b></figref><b>,</b> longer chains are possible to be deployed with larger hanging racks and powerful cargo helicopters. In this case, floating chain does not have a prismatic wound-folded arrangement, but a similar longer ribbon-folded structure, which is similar to an accordion-folded arrangement, but with at least a 180° curve at one of their extremes, being possible to obtain ribbon-folded structures with two or three layers for deploying a long floating pontoon bridge on air, or for delivering by air a supporting frame with a long floating chain inside for cutting sections of desired of needed length. In those ribbon-folded structures, the floating chain does not wrap a reel cage middle piece, but their floating structural modules rest on or hang from horizontal flat guides or shelves horizontally along they can be displaced, while all intercalated twin foldable rectangular sections are<!-- EPO <DP n="64"> --> folded perpendicularly, reducing overall length in relation of unfolded structure.</p><p id="p0131" num="0131">As additional important use of longitudinal hinges (110), as shown in <figref idrefs="f0020"><b>Figure 43</b></figref><b>,</b> it is possible to build droppable floating supply containers, both by parachute drop or by direct drop at very low height. Said supply containers are prismatic wound structures where the floating structural modules are wrapping a reel cage middle piece composed of at least two twin convex polygonal racks (114), but including inside the tubular longitudinal cavity appropriate cases containing supplies, tools or any other deliverable necessary item, as well as crossbars (1). Once picked up those devices by people on water or on shallow water, they can be opened and supply cases removed, so the outer shell can be split and be rigidified by the crossbars (1) for converting the container into rafts, boats or small straight pontoon bridges, especially in case of severe high-destruction catastrophes related to water, as tsunami or dam breakage episodes, where deliverable pontoons may be needed.</p><p id="p0132" num="0132">We should notice that all elements that can be linked together by longitudinal hinges (110) can be hinged or not. Those longitudinal hinges (110) give rigidity and a link between each two adjacent floating structural modules and / or rectangular platform sections which force to them to remain in the same plane. This situation is good in structures to strengthen with crossbars (1), but if this is not the case, the different sections can move with water movements, so in enough wavy water or enough strong water stream the longitudinal hinges (110) can be broken if no care. In some cases it would be better to unlink longitudinal hinges (110) for giving flexibility to the floating structure if it is long, as seen in <figref idrefs="f0020"><b>Figure 44</b></figref><b>,</b> for obtaining a long floating structure supported by taut cables with independent movable floating structural modules, or as seen in <figref idrefs="f0020"><b>Figure 45</b></figref><b>,</b> to assemble an articulated long floating structure hinged by stronger variable angled pieces with centered hinge (29) in wavy waters.</p><p id="p0133" num="0133">Another set of elements allow to dispose of parts and pieces for long structures, especially floating pontoon bridges and floating pontoon walkways, in which the floating elements do not couple in perpendicular direction to the line of crossbars (1) so also main platform or deck as before, but they can be arranged with respect to them in a fixed or variable angle, to keep them in parallel to the flow of a stream of water, especially if it is very strong. As seen in section <b>(a)</b> of <figref idrefs="f0021"><b>Figure 46</b></figref><b>,</b> the parts available so far do not allow a practical solution to the problem that would be presented in case where the floating elements of the structure could not be arranged in parallel to the direction of water flow, but forming with it a certain angle. That problem may arise if the only available points on the two opposite shores were positioned on a line which is not perpendicular to the water flow. If a usual floating pontoon bridge or walkway were deployed and too much cargo or traffic pass through it, their floating elements may sunk partially into water flow and oppose much greater resistance than normal, so that the structure would be much more difficult to build and to maintain stable in position, as well as parts could suffer fatigue, bend or break (especially the screws and bolts), and the structure could collapse. Use of flexible floating structures by unlinking of longitudinal hinges (110) supported by cables is not a solution, as the floating<!-- EPO <DP n="65"> --> elements remain also in angle in relation to the water flow, and the cables will suffer then the action. As these situations may be very frequent in flood situation, a new set of pieces for allowing place the floating elements in angle in relation to the crossbars (1) must be added, as they could be determinant in a critical rescue situation. A first approach to solve the problem can be seen in <b>(b),</b> and consists of manufacturing floating elements that can be coupled at various standardized fixed angles to the crossbars (1) so that, as far as possible, they are compatible with all other remaining structural parts for assembly. Two selectable sets to choose between, depending on the practical need and situation, are presented. Two additional sets to see later allow to the floating elements to freely turn below the plane of the platform around vertical shafts, being able of reaching all or many possible angles, instead of having to select a piece for each fixed angle.</p><p id="p0134" num="0134">A first set of units (c) consists of some additional modified floats (127), (128), (129), (130) and (131), which are respective modifications of those floats (2), (71), (72), (73), (85) which do not have top openings and inner compartments (68), and therefore are completely closed. These modified floats (127), (128), (129), (130), (131) are characterized in that their transverse grooves (4), (6) and (77) are modified in form of oblique transverse grooves (132), (133) and (134), respectively, being all of them mutually parallel and exactly with the same cross section than previous ones for a compatible coupling with crossbars (1), but being all of them molded on the body of its corresponding floating element following a single one from a set of possible selectable standardized non-right oblique angles in relation to the longitudinal direction of that floating element. These oblique transverse grooves (132), (133) and (134) allow the crossbars (1) to be coupled to such modified floats (127), (128), (129), (130), (131) in that same angle. For allowing that compatible coupling, all sets of holes located at the top flat horizontal surface of oblique transverse grooves (132), (133) and (134), as well as their corresponding female threaded metal bodies embedded in the body of the modified floats (127), (128), (129), (130) that contains such sets of threaded holes for screwing the sets of crossbars-floats connecting screws or bolts (7) and crossbars-U-shaped longitudinal bars connecting screws, threaded rods or bolts (8) are turned the same angle in the same direction around a central vertical axis in relation to their original counterparts on usual transverse grooves (4) and (6) and (77). Thanks to that, all coupling and fixing elements are arranged in parallel to the main axis of oblique transverse grooves (132), (133) and (134) for matching perfectly with the sets of drilled holes in the crossbars (7). U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) and rectangular frames (99) can not be rotated this same angle for coupling perpendicularly to the crossbars (1), due to the fact that in this case the sets of holes, as well as their corresponding female threaded metal bodies embedded, for screwing of the sets of floats-U-shaped longitudinal bars connecting screws or bolts (9) could exit from the floating element "staying in the air" even with small rotation angles. So that transverse grooves (5) in modified floats (127), (128), (129), (130) and (131) are maintained exactly as in original floats (2), (71), (72), (73), (85). In contrast, the screw holes drilled<!-- EPO <DP n="66"> --> in U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) and rectangular frames (99) for the sets of crossbars-U-shaped longitudinal bars connecting screws, threaded rods or bolts (8), do not match with their counterparts in crossbars (1) due to the angled arrangement, so in these assemblies they must be drilled in new positions.</p><p id="p0135" num="0135">Modified floats (127), (128), (129), (130), (131) give strong floating oblique pontoons, but they have several important drawbacks. As crossbars (1) are coupled in angle to the modified floats (127), (128), (129), (130), it is not possible to arrange two or more floating structural units in mutual side contact because the separation distances between them, measured perpendicularly to the floating elements, is reduced in relation to the case of perpendicular usual coupling. So those structures assembled with said modified floats (127), (128), (129), (130) are only suitable for assembly of oblique floating pontoons (bridges, walkways, rafts), so always having their floating elements separated with a gap between each adjacent two ones along the crossbars (1), and gaps in discontinuous platform must be completed with any custom elements conveniently screwed, riveted or bolted. More further, different versions from those are required for each one of the standardized angles in each of the two directions, left or right, since the two elements of the same standardized angle are symmetrical-mirrored images and can not be obtained with a 180 ° rotation of the same part along a vertical axis. Additionally, the only realizable floats for geometrical reasons will be those of a single or very few segments in width with angles between floating elements and crossbars (1) in the range from 90° to approximately 45°, because crossbars (1) can not get smaller angles for being more in parallel to the floating elements as they can get into transverse grooves (5). This subset of pieces requires an excessive number of additional pieces of large size, obtaining very few practical benefits in compensation.</p><p id="p0136" num="0136">A better solution, although still with certain geometrical constraints and practices, can be seen in <b>(d).</b> It is a modification on the transverse grooves (4) of the floats (2), (71), (72), (73) and (85) which causes modified floats (136), (137), (138), (139) and (140), respectively. Crossbars (1) do not couple directly to these new floating elements, but through some selectable and interchangeable intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (141) or (142) for choosing one between both two possible types available. All of said intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (141) or (142) are box-shaped and have the same outer shape and dimensions for swapping among them compatibily, as well each one of them is crossed by an oblique transverse groove or hole (143) that pierces it completely with a hole of the same inner cross section than the outer cross section from crossbars (1) for a compatible coupling with them. Said oblique transverse groove or hole (143) is practiced in the horizontal plane at the same height in all identical intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (141) and (142), following a series of different standardized angles with respect to the modified floats (136), (137), (138), (139), and (140) when said intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (141) or (142) are coupled to them, to allow engagement thereon of the crossbars (1) according to the same standardized angles, perfectly<!-- EPO <DP n="67"> --> and with no gaps or clearances. Thus, selection of the correct intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (141) or (142) to couple over the modified floats (136), (137), (138), (139), and (140) allow to adjust the mounting angle between them and the crossbars (1), with no need of storing and carrying multiple floating items for each angle and for each of the two possible directions, so this solution is better than previous one for transport at long distances, while previous one is better for assembly in fix position at specific points. The two intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (141) and (142) differ in that first ones are pierced with oblique transverse holes (143), and second ones are pierced with oblique transverse grooves (143), exactly with the same outer cross section for coupling on crossbars (1). Modified floats (136), (137), (138), (139) and (140) have exactly the same shape and characteristics as their respective original versions (2), (71), (72), (73) and (85), with the exception that transverse grooves (4) are here expanded from original size largely along the top flat horizontal surface of modified floats (136), (137), (138), (139) and (140) for giving at least two expanded transverse grooves (144), on which the crossbars (1) do not couple, but intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (141) and (142), exactly and with no gaps or clearances. The expanded transverse grooves (144) have greater height than the original transverse grooves (4), and are considerably longer, so that they can occupy all or most of the distance between the twin transverse grooves (5), which remain with no changes in the same relative positions as in almost all floating elements described. This occupied distance is then divided equally among all the intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (141) or (142) present (usually two) for giving them the same shape and dimensions, with a narrow transverse wall separating each two consecutive intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (141) or (142) coupled along top flat horizontal surface of modified float (136), (137), (138), (139) or (140), or without said transverse wall or walls, being all expanded transverse grooves (144) fused on a single one that occupies almost all space between twin transverse grooves (5). All intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (141) and (142) are firmly coupled to the modified floats (136), (137), (138), (139), (140) through a series of floats-intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling connecting screws or bolts (145), which are screwed vertically inside respective female threaded metal bodies embedded in the body of said modified floats (136), (137), (138), (139), (140), which are arranged in sets placed inside and near the outer perimeter of each expanded transverse groove (144) and are symmetrical in relation to the vertical longitudinal symmetry plane that passes through the center of said modified floats (136), (137), (138), (139), (140) and said intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (141) and (142) when coupled to last ones. In turn, crossbars (1) are coupled to the intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (141) and (142) by sets of usual crossbars-floats fixing screws or bolts (7) that are not arranged perpendicularly to the floating elements, but to the crossbars (1) (with exception of cases where expanded transverse grooves (144) are pierced perpendicularly over its intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (141) and (142). In all other cases, where the crossbars (1) are turned a certain standardized angle different from 90° when placed each<!-- EPO <DP n="68"> --> one inside an oblique transverse groove or hole (143), the sets of holes for the sets of crossbars-floats fixing screws or bolts (7) are also the same standardized angle value in the same direction in relation to the modified floats (136), (137), (138), (139) and (140). To allow screwing into these positions that are rotated with respect to the normal orientation, all intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (141) and (142) have other sets of threaded complete holes vertically drilled for being crossed for respective sets of crossbars-intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling fixing screws (146), in a way that they are arranged aligned with the corresponding oblique transverse groove or hole (143) and coincidentally with positions of the sets of holes for the sets of crossbars-floats fixing screws or bolts (7) and crossbars-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws, threaded rods or bolts (8) when the crossbar (1) is coupled in the right position and displacement.</p><p id="p0137" num="0137">Thus, changing the angle of the oblique floating pontoon bridge or walkway is only a matter of changing all intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (141) and (142) for other ones of the correct angle. It should be seen that if intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (141) with oblique transverse holes (143) are used, the same one serves for both mirrored directions, to the right and to the left, simply reversing vertically the piece swapping top and bottom faces, but said elements must be impaled by the crossbars (1) laterally, so it is not possible to intercalate a floating structural modue in middle of a structure in assembly if using intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (141), but if intermediate pieces for crossbar coupling (142) with oblique transverse grooves (143) are used, then the same piece serves only for as ingle one from the two possible mirrored directions, but it is possible to intercalate a floating structural module in middle of a structure in assembly.</p><p id="p0138" num="0138">Although there is the advantage of less number or parts and pieces in comparison with previous solution, this one is also limited as well, for geometrical reasons, to angles not too close to the direction of floating elements, since the more deviated from the original direction perpendicular to floating elements the crossbars (1) are, the more fraction from top flat horizontal surface from modified floats (136), (137), (138), (139), (140) is lost, so there is a limit after which the expanded transverse grooves (144) and the transverse grooves (5) overlap, being interpenetrated crossbars (1) and U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) or rectangular frames (99). Moreover, in this solution only central crossbars (1) are suitable, as prow and stern are needed for placing sliding covers (10), (79), (92), (93), (94), or other different modified custom versions of them.</p><p id="p0139" num="0139">A better solution may be to use floating elements which can turn over a vertical shaft, then they can adopt any angle or at least many angles form an angle range in relation to the crossbars (1) lines. To do so, floating structural modules must be separated from the platform, as their elements are rigidly joined, in two different horizontal planes with said shafts as linking element between them, so that the floating structural modules can rotate freely below and in relation to the horizontal plane defined by the platform of deck. In this way the floating structural modules are oriented automatically at all times in<!-- EPO <DP n="69"> --> the direction of the water stream, being an example when the floating structure changes its orientation relative to the to the water stream when towed by a watercraft or when pivoted from one end at the shore after having been assembled on land. <figref idrefs="f0021"><b>Figure 47</b></figref>shows a number of elements that incorporate a robust short vertical shaft, which allow to assemble quickly small straight sections of floating walkways in which at least two floating structural modules can rotate independently to each other pivoting on a vertical shaft each below the horizontal plane defined by the platform, usually an angle range which is limited in most cases for practical reasons to a value of more than 90 ° and less than 180 °. It is a crossbar with central vertical shaft (147) that can be engaged in any transverse groove (4), (6) or (77), but preferentially in the forward transverse groove (4) of any floating element, using the corresponding usual crossbars-floats fixing screws or bolts (7). It is made from a crossbar (1) at least one segment in length, in whose exact center a wide vertical hole is drilled to insert inside a strong cylindrical shaft (148), either solid or thick-walled tubular, which passes it vertically reaching exactly to the underside without protruding from the same, for an exact coupling on said transverse groove (4). Said cylindrical vertical shaft (148) is tightly welded to the crossbar (1), and optionally some reinforcing elements as triangle-shaped reinforcing plates or supplementary tube jackets or washers can be welded to the joint areas between both parts for strengthen against strong bending movements that could break said cylindrical vertical shaft (148). On this crossbar with central vertical shaft (147) usual U-shaped longitudinal bars (3), hinged U-shaped longitudinal bars (111), rectangular frames (99), hinged rectangular frames (112) couple in compatible way, and the corresponding rectangular modular platform section (101) has a hole for protrusion of cylindrical vertical shaft (148) upwards.</p><p id="p0140" num="0140">Now a piece in form of crossbeam (149), that engages and embraces all crossbars (1) from top platform keeping them above the floating elements and cylindrical vertical shaft (148), is added. Such crossbeam (149) can pivot freely around a cylindrical vertical shaft (148) by being threaded by it through a vertical hole with coincident diameter, so it can pivot freely in relation to the floating structural module where the crossbar with central vertical shaft (147) is coupled, resting its weight, and weight from top walkway platform section, over the flat top horizontal surface of bottom rectangular modular platform section (101). Said crossbeam (149) is made in metal, stainless steel or alloy resistant to corrosion, and can be a single thick robust metallic bar, or several of them in parallel welded, riveted, bolted or screwed together in order to achieve greater size and structural strength. On its top, by cutting and / or welding, riveting, bolting or screwing of right metal parts, at least two transverse metal grooves (150) are added, arranged symmetrically at both sides of said crossbeam (149) in relation to its own center and perpendicularly in relation to the direction of their longest side, being these transverse metal grooves (150) arranged horizontally in parallel, and having the same cross section than transverse grooves (4), (69, (77), so that over them crossbars (1) can fit and be coupled perfectly with no gaps or clearances. Because in this assembly the walkway top platform is not locked and intertwined with floating<!-- EPO <DP n="70"> --> structural modules, it is possible to have four metal transverse grooves (150) on each crossbeam (149) for strengthening the structure, or to get wider or narrow walkways depending on if two or four of those are engaged with crossbars (1) lines.</p><p id="p0141" num="0141">As said metal transverse grooves (150) play the role of the usual transverse grooves (4), they also have the usual standardized sets of holes the usual transverse grooves (4) and crossbars (1) always have in coincident positions and distributions, so that they also should have the minimum length of one segment to place these crossbars (1). Along the main longitudinal vertical symmetry plane of each crossbeam (149) avoiding positions of metal transverse grooves (150) and central hole, a row of vertical cylindrical tubes or holes (151) with the same diameter than central hole (this one really belongs to said row) is practiced. Said vertical cylindrical tubes or holes (151) are selectable for inserting vertical shaft (148) through one of them which snugly, which is secured to not vertically get out from position by a ferrule (152) horizontally traversed by a pin (153), which in turn also simultaneously passes through the top of cylindrical shaft (148), so it has for this purpose a horizontal hole along its diameter near its upper end. Once inserted and these cylindrical shaft (148) on the inside of one of the vertical cylindrical tubes or holes (151) from crossbeam (149), the platform constituted by the crossbars (1) screwed to the latter with corresponding rectangular frames (99) or any compatible elements with these ones, rotates with respect to the floating structural modules, and vice versa. To facilitate rotation, the crossbeam (149) has a flat bottom face for resting and sliding with as little friction as possible, but at the same time distributing the most weight on the top flat horizontal surface from modular rectangular platform (101), the latter being suitable to be constituted by perforated high-strength metal sheet.</p><p id="p0142" num="0142">The crossbeam (149) can also rest on a high-diameter intermediate lubricated washer arranged between the two surfaces, or it can incorporate, along its outer perimeter, a series of wheels or rollers (154), fastened by small plates (155), to facilitate sliding and then rotation with high weight on the walkway platform section, and to also greatly increase the buckling resistance of the cylindrical shaft (148) with increasing distance lateral support all orientations. Each floating pontoon walkway straight section rests over at least two side floating structural modules, provided each one with a crossbar with central vertical shaft (147) and vertical cylindrical shaft (148) and a crossbeam (149) in the arrangement said. It is possible to mount pontoon walkways having more than two of these rotating floating structural modules, but these always must be placed greater distances than twice their turning radii to not collide each other in their rotational movements. There is a limitation because possible bending of crossbars (1) in non-flat wavy waters in case of long straight pontoon walkway sections. These rotating floating structural modules can rotate a limited angle range from about +45° to about -45° in relation to a direction perpendicular to crossbars (1). that is, about 90° in total, but this depends on the overall width of the single floating structural module or series of them used in the arrangement. This is because on its turn the crossbeam (149) can get out from them if they are too narrow. Anyway, if the floating structural<!-- EPO <DP n="71"> --> modules gets parallel to the crossbars (1), all structure may be unstable if first ones are not enough wide. The choice of a cylindrical tube or hole (151) from the row of them found on each crossbeam (149) allows to adjust position of the cylindrical vertical shaft (148) for centering, advancing or delaying its position on the pontoon walkway in all floating structural modules separately. The obvious and most important reason is for obtaining a wider sustentation base for better stability, as well as for trying to compensate the applied torque on the floating pontoon walkway because water stream force, and recover balance and horizontality. <figref idrefs="f0021"><b>Figure 47b</b></figref>is an example of a short floating straight rigid pontoon walkway, which is easily built up on the shore, made and assembled in the aforementioned way. After assembly, it is easy to move all the floating structure to its end position floating above water by pivoting it around its end on the shore, using ballast or a thick nailed peg as rotation shaft from the shore. By prying on the crossbars (1), and / or by using the water stream force itself, the short floating straight rigid pontoon walkway turns to the desired end direction, but all the time the floating structural modules are aligned with water flow, minimizing resistance and drag. And the same happens in reverse process.</p><p id="p0143" num="0143">This system can be improved with new elements that allow construction of straight sections of floating pontoon bridges, having bottom pivotable floating assemblies, which can be chained by common vertical shafts for giving long articulated floating pontoon bridges, longer than those previously cited.</p><p id="p0144" num="0144">As seen in <figref idrefs="f0022"><b>Figure 48</b></figref><b>,</b> this system can be improved with new elements with which to assemble long floating articulated pontoon bridges composed by straight rigid short sections mutually joined each two through vertical shafts where on each one a floating arrangement can turn freely 360° below the horizontal plane of the top straight platform sections. In this system each one of said floating arrangements are composed by symmetrical groups of at least two floating structural modules. Floating structural modules, constituted by solid floats in a single piece (2), (67), (71), (72), (73), (74), (75) or (76), are screwed in even-numbered sets to them to at least two identical crossbars (1) which have more than two segments in length each, in a way that these sets of floating structural modules are screwed leaving a central symmetrical gap with no floating structural modules coupled. This gap should be from one segment in width to as much three segments in width, but always all arrangement, including the central gap, must be symmetric in relation to a vertical longitudinal plane of symmetry that passes through its own center. Each side of this arrangement has the same number and symmetrical arrangement order of floating elements. The number and width of the floats (2), (67), (71), (72), (73), (74), (75), (76) used in the assembly determines its cargo capacity and stability, therefore usually it is more suitable it they are relatively wide, several segments in width to ensure side stability. In the middle gap a number of new elements is coupled, in the form of an assembly which gives a common strong vertical shaft for turning freely in relation to the floating pontoon bridge section to place above later, suspended over said vertical shaft. On the free segment or segments of said gap in the assembly with no floating structural modules coupled, a box-shaped supporting frame for shaft (156) is fitted and<!-- EPO <DP n="72"> --> coupled. It consists of a robust box-shaped parallelepiped frame, made of tubular metal with square or rectangular cross section, with a series of oblique struts or braces welded or riveted joining corners of their vertical faces, and being its upper and lower faces covered by respective thick metal plates (157) and (158). This box-shaped supporting frame for shaft (156) fits perfectly from above and without clearances between the two floating structural modules that flank the crossbars (1) central gap in the assembly, fitting exactly on the rectangular hollow that remains between the two central crossbars (1) coupled to transverse grooves (4) of all floating elements used, and the two U-shaped longitudinal bars (3), hinged U-shaped longitudinal bars (111), rectangular frames (99) or hinged rectangular frames (112) used that are placed at sides. As said box-shaped supporting frame for shaft (156) touches with those elements, this placement provides greater stiffness against shear movements or bias on the assembly structure. For being supported without dropping, this box-shaped supporting frame for shaft (156) rests its weight on the free central segment or segments of both crossbars (1), front and back, with which it is in contact, so the top metal plate (157) thereof extends forward and backward to fit the entire top surface of the free segment or segments of crossbars (1).</p><p id="p0145" num="0145">For fixing the box-shaped supporting frame for shaft (156) to the floating assembly, such protruding surfaces from the top metal plate (157) are drilled with vertical holes groups at coincident positions with their counterparts on the crossbars (1) below, for using the same standardized fixing or bolting elements already described lots of times. In order to achieve a better anchoring and fastening the front and rear edges of said top metal plate (157) may be bent downward, or be bonded or welded to transverse U-shaped beams placed below, providing twin pieces which fit exactly on the crossbars (1) surrounding and embracing them from their top and sides, leaving its bottom free for extracting vertically the box-shaped supporting frame for shaft (156) in disassembly. Obviously, the width of said box-shaped supporting frame for shaft (156) measured in parallel to the crossbars (1) when coupled to them, is a positive integer number of segments, being preferable and sufficient a single segment for a robust, compact, strong assembly. This element incorporates on its vertical longitudinal symmetry plane that passes through its own center, a row of vertical strong thick tubes for shaft housing (159), all of them of the same large diameter and thick wall, so one of them can be chosen for placing the rotation pivoting axis of all floating assembly, so for centering or for displacing it forwards or backwards in relation to the floating pontoon bridge platform section to place above later and achieving balance or torque compensation in a water stream. The top metal plate (157) is drilled with holes matching in diameter and position to each one of said tubes for shaft housing (159), allowing introduction of a shaft from above on one of them, while the thick bottom metal plate (158) is not normally drilled to support said shaft with no falling down, or drilled with a smaller centered hole for crossing it with a vertical bar or peg for nailing or anchoring the floating structure to shallow soil. The pivot shaft (160) is a cylindrical strong robust thick-walled tube of large diameter that achieves robustness and high resistance against<!-- EPO <DP n="73"> --> bending, which fits exactly or with little clearance to allow the surfaces to be oiled, inside each of the tubes for shaft housing (159), resting its lower end and weight on the bottom metal plate (158), thus transmitting a fraction of weight from the upper platform section to the center bottom of the pivoting floating assembly. Optionally a thick rotation bushing (161) may be interposed between the pivot shaft (160) and bottom metal plate (158), to facilitate smooth rotation once greased. The pivot shaft (160) can be attached optionally to the supporting frame for shaft (156) to prevent accidental loss or releasing due to wide water vertical oscillations by using a thick horizontal pin (162) which passes through and holds together simultaneously the pivot shaft (160) and the tube for shaft housing (159) in which it is housed, so for that rotation shaft (160) and each and every one of tube for shaft housing (159) have practiced horizontal holes at the same height in the direction of their diameters, to allow said horizontal pin (162) housing. After placing the rotating shaft (160) in one of the tube for shaft housing (159) and fixed with its horizontal pin (162), a horizontal circular plate (163) is placed. It is a circular thick metal plate, able of withstanding great weights above, with a central hole of diameter slightly larger thand the pivot shaft (160) to be inserted on the latter resting on the greased top metal plate (157). While allowing the rotation, this element receives and distributes the weight of all top assembled structure so indifferent to the angular orientation of all pivoting floating structure. Such horizontal circular plate has large diameter, both to cover the whole or almost all surface of the top metal plate (157) as well as to provide in all orientations a good radial supporting distance to counteract movements that tend to flex or to break pivot shaft (160).</p><p id="p0146" num="0146">The horizontal circular plate (163) receives the weight of the platform section placed above through a intermediate big crossbeam piece (164). This approximately box-shaped element, made of metal, has similar functions than the crossbeam (149) but it is stronger and larger, is symmetrical with respect to two own vertical planes, longitudinal and transverse, respectively. It has two flat horizontal surfaces, top and bottom, where the top one is interrupted by transverse metal grooves (150) and bottom one may be smaller than the top one to concentrate weight and load from the upper platform section on the horizontal circular plate (163) on which it rests. On its top flat horizontal surface, by cutting and / or welding, riveting, bolting or screwing of right metal parts, at least two transverse metal grooves (150) are added, arranged symmetrically at both sides of said big crossbeam piece (164) in relation to its own center and perpendicularly in relation to the direction of their longest side, being these transverse metal grooves (150) arranged horizontally in parallel, and having the same cross section than transverse grooves (4), (69, (77), so that over them crossbars (1) can fit and be coupled perfectly with no gaps or clearances. Because in this assembly the walkway top platform is not locked and intertwined with floating structural modules, it is possible to have four metal transverse grooves (150) on each crossbeam (149) for strengthening the structure, or to get wider or narrow walkways depending on if two or four of those are engaged with crossbars (1) lines. As said metal transverse grooves (150) play the role of the usual transverse grooves (4), they also have the usual standardized<!-- EPO <DP n="74"> --> sets of holes the usual transverse grooves (4) and crossbars (1) always have in coincident positions and distributions, so that they also should have the minimum length of one segment to place these crossbars (1). The big crossbeam piece (164) has internally a thick vertical cylindrical tube (165) which passes through its center connecting top and bottom flat horizontal surfaces and can host inside it the pivot shaft (160), so said top and bottom flat horizontal surfaces has holes of the same diameter than thick vertical cylindrical tube (165) which are centered on it. By this way, the big crossbeam piece (164) can pivot around the pivot shaft (160), which is inserted inside its inner thick vertical cylindrical tube (165), resting its weight over the greased horizontal circular plate (164). The thick vertical cylindrical tube (165) has larger diameter thand the pivot shaft (160), so that it is introduced with some play to allow the introduction of supplementary lubricated sleeves (166) or thick washers, which can be placed or not depending on the need. Such supplementary lubricated sleeves (166) are all identical and introduced greased, stacked in column and making contact between the thick vertical cylindrical tube (165) and the pivot shaft (160), surrounding this last one, so that they smooth rotation and strengthen said pivot shaft (160), impeding this could swing when placed inside the thick vertical cylindrical tube (165), so limiting movement to only rotation along a vertical axis. The top end of pivot shaft (160) protrudes slightly above the top surface of big crossbeam piece (164), so it has the required length for this feature and the two pieces are fastened together, for not getting out vertically one from the other, through a horizontal pin (167) which simultaneously pass through horizontal consecutive drilled holes practiced at the top end of pivot shaft (160) and a top sleeve (168). Said top sleeve (168) outer diameter larger than the hole in the top horizontal surface of big crossbeam piece (164), acting as a top upright confinement stopper. So each pivoting float assembly is freely rotatable 360° about its pivot shaft (160) in relationto the top pontoon bridge platform section.</p><p id="p0147" num="0147">For following better the water flow direction, the floating structural modules can incorporate a series of rear vertical fins (169) that are introduced vertically in water acting as a rudder. These vertical fins (169) can be joined to a detachable rear supporting rack, symmetric in relation to the vertical symmetry plane of the arrangement and can dock over the rear crossbar (1), either if placed on a row of transverse grooves (4) or (77). Said detachable rear supporting rack can be telescopic for prying better and align automatically the floating elements to the water flow direction.</p><p id="p0148" num="0148">Thus it is possible to assemble straight pontoon walkway sections and supporting them over at least two of these pivoting floating arrangements at sides, which can pivot each one freely in a horizontal plane around its own pivot shaft (160). It is also possible to place one end of a straight pontoon walkway section resting over a box-shaped supporting frame for shaft (156) and this in turn being secured to the soil by a standing bracket made of crossbars (1) and a set of pedestal parts (40), (41), (42), (59), (60), (60), (62), aided by wedges to obtain the horizontal, and weights, ballasts, planks, pillars, pegs and the like for complete immobilization, for buliding a straight pivotable pontoon bridge which pivots from the<!-- EPO <DP n="75"> --> shore. The choice of tubes for shaft housing (159) allow to place the pivot shaft (160) centered on the box-shaped supporting frame for shaft (156), or moving it forward or backward along it and in relation to the symmetric floating assembly of floats (2), (67), (71), (72), (73), (74), (75) or (76) used on the same, thus adjusting the stability and / or compensating the torque applied to the floating pontoon bridge due to a water stream drag force. movements applied to the structure may tend to force and drag these elements, so pivoting shafts (160) may deviate from verticality in an independent way, so they could be broken even if thick and robust. It can also happen that there may be a significant height difference between land and water, and after building a floating pontoon bridge on the safety of the shore, when pivoting it from its shore end to move the other one on the water, problems could arise because the pivot shafts (160) placed over water remain arranged vertically in parallel but the pivot shaft (160) on the shore appear in relative angle with latter ones, so this one may come to be bent or broken. For compensating this fact, it is only necessary to add an additional piece for giving a second strong angular articulation with a little freedom degree of movement in a vertical axis, for allowing the pivot shafts (160) remain in parallel despite vertical movements in water or height differences between water and shore.</p><p id="p0149" num="0149">Placed above and resting over the horizontal circular plate (163), an additional piece is added optionally depending on the need for giving said additional strong articulation, docked below the big crossbeam piece (164) and in intermediate position between those. Below to the bottom flat horizontal surface of each big crossbeam piece (164), a supplementary rocking piece (170) with rounded bottom surfaces is docked, which allows to the upper big crossbeam piece (164) to tilt a limited angle range in a vertical plane as a rocking chair does, so the floating pontoon bridge section coupled above said latter piece makes the same. Thanks to this supplementary rocking piece (170) each straight platform section from the articulated floating pontoon bridge can tilt slightly in relation to each other with no danger for pivot shafts (160). Said supplementary rocking piece (170) has a top part in form of a thick rectangular plate of exactly or approximately the same size and dimensions than the bottom flat horizontal surface of each big crossbeam piece (164) for good coupling between both pieces, being joined with the help of a series of supplementary rocking piece fixing screws (171), which are inserted and tightened from below through vertical screw holes drilled in matching positions in both pieces for joining them firmly. The rectangular plate has a central hole with a diameter greater thand the pivot shaft (160) so that this can pass through said hole with enough perimetral space to spare. To allow tilting movement, this rectangular plate from supplementary rocking piece (170) has on its underside in coupling position, disposed below their short sides and avoiding the middle area of the center hole, twin symmetric curved surfaces which rest and touch on the horizontal circular plate (163). Each of said twin symmetric curved surfaces has the shape of a cylinder chopped along a plane which is perpendicular to their bases, passing through its center or not. When these twin symmetric curved surfaces roll over the horizontal circular plate (163) allow to the big crossbeam piece (164) to tilt a little<!-- EPO <DP n="76"> --> a limited angle range disposed in a vertical plane parallel to the short sides of said supplementary rocking piece (170). If the supplementary lubricated sleeves (166) are not placed or removed, a tubular gap remains between the pivot shaft (160) and the thick vertical cylindrical tube (165) from each big crossbeam piece (164), so these two can adopt a certain relative angle before colliding between, so the tilting angle range is determined mainly by the diameters ratio between these two elements and by the arc length of the twin symmetric curved surfaces. On top of the pivot shaft (168) the top sleeve (168) is changed by a single torus-shaped or conical sleeve (173) with rounded surfaces that touch the inner perimeter top edge of the thick vertical cylindrical tube (165), so due to its shape said torus-shaped or conical sleeve (173) tends to maintain at all times mutually centered the thick vertical cylindrical tube (165) with the pivot shaft (160) inside, so also tends to automatically align pivot shaft (168) and the big crossbeam piece (164). The torus-shaped or conical sleeve (173) must have then the same horizontal hole for insertion of the horizontal pin (167) that top sleeve (168) has. A good convenient modification is that the horizontal pin (167) is not used, but instead of it a transverse tilting shaft (175) is used. This element is a strong cylindrical horizontal bar that acts as strong horizontal pin and tilting shaft. This elements crosses through convenient holes the supplementary rocking piece (170) through its center in the direction of their long sides, and coincidentally with the rotation axis of its tilting movement, as well as it crosses also with a coincident horizontal hole the pivot shaft (160), being suitable that this latter would be changed by a short pivot shaft (172), identical to the pivot shaft (160) but shorter, which does not protrude upwards from the thick vertical cylindrical tube (165), allowing a wider tilting angle range. If it is desirable to limit the tilting angle or fixing it to a certain angle, supplementary rocking piece fixing screws (171) can be used by this purpose, provided they are thick and sturdy enough, or present in enough number for scattering deformation efforts among them. Simply their vertical screwing positions are adjusted to desired touching positions to the bottom horizontal circular plate (163), so the length of their screw studs added to the screw head (being suitable that said head is finished in a hemispherical shape for best function) determines such angle or angle range.</p><p id="p0150" num="0150">Other alternative pieces allow change the supplementary rocking piece (170) by a joint ball in the same way as a trailer ball, giving a weaker assembly but faster in mounting and dismounting. These pieces consist of a pivot shaft stump finished in a spherical ball (177) which replaces the pivot shaft (160) and short pivot shaft (172), which engages on a female receiving socket (178) which has a spherical cavity or receptacle that can be opened and closed by a suitable locking mechanism secured with a pin or similar. This last piece is positioned below the bottom flat horizontal surface from the big crossbar piece (164) by means of the supplementary rocking piece fixing screws (171), while the first one is inserted into a selected one of the thick vertical cylindrical tubes (165). The fitting of the spherical ball end of the socket cavity gives a joint capable of rotating 360 degrees in azimuth and an limited angle range in height, but with the drawback that it concentrates all the weight from the platform section<!-- EPO <DP n="77"> --> on the ball and socket, so these pieces are suitable for not very much load or cargo. With the elements described so far it is possible to join two or more consecutive straight floating pontoon bridge platform sections in two basic ways, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0023"><b>Figure 49</b></figref><b>.</b></p><p id="p0151" num="0151">First ones is to support each end of each straight platform section over a single symmetric pivoting floating assembly for stabilized flotation over water and / or over ground, then towing or pivoting from shore this straight platform section to final position, and then additional straight platform sections to coupling to the previous one are joined by means of linear linking elements following the lines of crossbars (1), either flexible ones (cables) or articulated ones (variable angled pieces with centered hinge (29). This way only allows assembly of linear straight articulated long floating pontoon bridges.</p><p id="p0152" num="0152">The second way is to support each end of an initial straight platform section over a single symmetric pivoting floating assembly for stabilized flotation over water and / or over ground, then building the following straight platform sections successively over the previous one, having each (starting from second one) only a single symmetric pivoting floating assembly on its farthest end and sharing a symmetric pivoting floating assembly with a common pivot shaft (168). After completion of each straight platform section over the previous one, it is dropped to water and pivoted until straight direction to the previous one, or in the desired angle, fixing to the soil by nailing, ballasting or anchoring elements already exposed, repeating the process as many times as needed for reaching th the other shore. By this sharing of common pivot shafts (168) and common symmetric pivoting floating assemblies between each two consecutively stacked linked straight platform sections, the structure is deployed, dismantled or folded as a carpenter's rule does, as well as this system allow to branch the floating pontoon bridge in Y-shaped or T-shaped bifurcations by sharing in three straight platform sections. Mixed arrangements are also possible.</p><p id="p0153" num="0153">Concluded the group of elements that allow the construction of floating pontoon walkways and floating bridges, it only remains for concluding the description of the invention, to describe a relatively miscellaneous last group of elements and pieces which makes possible the construction of some unorthodox floating structures which are useful in extremely hard flooding conditions or extremely strong water streams, even with dragging debris present, where almost all existent watercrafts and pontoon structures can not work or may result capsized, smashed or collapsed. If the populated area to evacuate is surrounded by strong water streams that usual watercrafts can not cross because dragging or hits with debris and no air means are available, it may be possible to place crossing cables for evacuating people with harnesses with pulleys, but this process is performed person by person and can be slow. With the new elements present in such situation it is possible, as last resort, assembling some types of watercrafts and capsules which can move, guided through a transverse transference cable which is placed and firmly fixed crossing that water stream, using the component parallel to such transference cable from the same pushing force due to the water stream, in addition to the fact that<!-- EPO <DP n="78"> --> several of such assemblies (case of rotating capsules) roll over water surface and also can roll over any colliding floating dragged objects or debris, even trees, so they can overcome them, protecting at the same time the passengers who are placed inside the hull in rotation around them. The most part of these assemblies are parts and pieces already described, so addition of these new parts and pieces does not mean to spend very much additional space in vehicles, but the possible duty said unorthodox assemblies may perform may be important in severe, hard situations where there are no other choice. The main requirement is that it is possible to place a strong cable, or several parallel cables, between the two sides, by using of a wire gun, hook launcher rifle or similar device. If a member of the rescue team can cross by any mean possible to reach the other side, it is best. Then, said strong cable is fixed taut and tighten by their ends to any strong elements placed on the shores, for example, trees. Once that operation has been performed, the device for crossing the water stream with evacuees inside depend on the hardness ow the waters stream. If water flow is strong but laminar, or there are no strong height variations in water level or turbulences along the path to cross, and no floating objects or debris are dragged, it is possible to use oblique rafts as device to assemble. If water flow is highl turbulent, or there are strong height variations in water level and / or floating dragged objetcs and debris, the only possible devices that can work in these conditions are rotating capsules.</p><p id="p0154" num="0154">An oblique raft is a raft assembled with identical oblique floats (129) (or less preferably with oblique floats (138)), both of which have twin pointed ends. Because there are no distinction between prow and stern on any of them , being both extremes ending in tip end, both can serve as forward part of the watercraft. For building half of an oblique raft, said identical oblique floats (129) (or les preferable, oblique floats (138)) are coupled, belonging each one to a floating structural module, to four identical crossbars (1) along their oblique transverse grooves (132), (133) and (134), leaving gaps between each two of them as they can not (and must not) be placed together in mutual contact., and being preferable to use only two side floating elements for giving the less weight possible for easy handling and lifting by hand, despite it is possible to build oblique rafts with more floating elements. The other half of the same oblique raft is assembled exactly in the same way, but with the difference of using oblique floats (129) or oblique floats (138) whose oblique transverse grooves (132), (133) and (134) have the same angle but in the opposite specular direction. By this way, two halves of this oblique raft in assembly are mirror symmetric and one can be coupled with full coincidence over the other, giving a oblique raft which is reversible as it has twin swappable top and bottom floating layers. By turning out the oblique raft, swapping top and bottom, the watercraft is the same but the angle between crossbars (1) and oblique floats (129) is mirrored. All crossbars (1) are provided with terminal pieces for passing cables (15), and a series of parallel cables can be passed through said crossbars (1). If the guide cable is sufficiently tense, the crossbars (1) are always maintained, more or less, approximately in perpendicular direction to the water flow direction, but oblique floats (129) will be in an angle relative thereto. Said angle,<!-- EPO <DP n="79"> --> obviously, can be selected by choice of these oblique floats (129) for adapt to conditions as water flow speed. Submerged floating elements on bottom floating layer act as passive propulsion devices by diverting the water flow partially to a side, in a way that the more load transported over the oblique raft, the more oblique surface from oblique floats (129) are sunk and the more transverse pushing force is obtained (depending also as commented of the selected oblique floats (129) because the angle). So if the guide cables are enough oiled, said transverse component pushes the oblique raft on the desired direction with no motors used and no physical effort spent. If a water hit sinks all oblique raft, the top floating layer increases buoyancy inmediately, making the oblique raft to raise from water. Once the oblique raft reaches the opposite shore, and cargo or passengers have been extracted, to reverse its displacement direction it is necessary only to flip top and bottom layers, turning the oblique raft 180 degrees, so mirroring relative angle of floating elements. While doing this, the guide cables must be loosen, untied and also swapped, interchanging forward cables with backward cables and to the contrary with no need of extracting them from the crossbars (1), and tying and tightening them other time, so the trip in the other direction is performed in the same way. To facilitate these tasks in overturning steps, passengers or cargo are accommodated in a strong container, like a basket or a stretcher, which is coupled and joined to the crossbars (1) in middle of both oblique floats (129) from the top floating layer, so it is detached and reattached when the overturn has been made. This oblique raft is rigid and strong, suitable for strong water stream and relatively hard water stream conditions, with the only limitation of swapping top and bottom layers and front and rear guide cables for switching direction of displacement. As this switching step is to be made by human strength, the size and weight must be manageable, imposing a limit of the load and number of people to transfer on each trip, but two or more of these devices can be placed, working in parallel for taking less time if necessary.</p><p id="p0155" num="0155">As oblique rafts do not need human force or electric or mechanical motors or traction devices, this same principle is good for assembly a new bigger model of oblique raft for transference of higher capacity of cargo or people between two opposite shores using the water stream force, as ferries that cross rivers displacing along a transference cable, but with the need that the angle of their floating elements should be mirrored and even adjusted with no need of lifting the craft, so if this were possible, the oblique raft could stay in water at the shore in load and unload processes, and accelerate and braking by adjusting in navigation the angle of their floating elements in relation to the flow. Said assembly, which can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0023">Figure 50</figref>, will be only suitable for non-rescue operations in laminar strong water flow conditions, but has no oil or electric consumption. It is detachable with parts and elements already described and which can be identified by their respective numbers, with exception of the crossbars (181), which can be exactly identical to crossbars (1), or having the drilled screw holes practiced only in preset positions, different from the same ones present in crossbars (1) and especially modified for this assembly, as well as longitudinal straight bars (182), whose task is to link in a same<!-- EPO <DP n="80"> --> line firmly all vertical shafts from crossbars with central vertical shaft (147), so both crossbars (181) and longitudinal straight bars (182) form a rhomboidal flexible grate whose sides are rigid but whose angles can be varied thanks to a hand crank and locked into fix positions thanks to oblique braces (183).</p><p id="p0156" num="0156">Turning to emergency situations, since water flows copying landforms or submerged objects above, the flow can be irregular in height and / or turbulent, giving waves, turbulence, vortices, and in the case of presence of cavities in the landform, hydrostatic tides. So in these cases, especially such harder ones, it may happen that the water drag force is excessive for any watercraft or pontoon bridge, as well as even for such oblique rafts. Cargo and passengers are unprotected against overturned or have the risk of falling overboard when the watercraft is shaking if they are not secured thereto, or the same watercraft could finish overturned and their passengers dragged and drowned. Such shaking movements in watercrafts can go breaking the transference cables because the continuous shaking out. Worst, the transference cable is close to the water and dragged objects as trees or debris could hook with them and break or release their extremes. However, if it were possible to place the transference cable in a raised position from water, such possibility of collision or hooking with dragged objects and debris will be reduced. Rotational capsules are suitable for facing hard situations as these described.</p><p id="p0157" num="0157">For assembling a rotational capsule, four (at least) identical regular convex polygonal frames (32) (that is, equilateral and equiangular convex polygonal frames (32)) are coaxially arranged in parallel vertical planes coupled on the transverse grooves (4), (6) and (77) of a certain number of identical closed symmetric floats (72), (73) and (85), in a way that all segments of all sides of the identical regular convex polygonal frames (32) are fully occupied by said floats (72), (73) or (85), so them are arranged around said regular convex polygonal frames (32) in a peripheral prismatic arrangement, radially symmetric in relation to the center. Smaller arrangements are those in which they are used as many floats (72), (73) or (85) as sides have the regular convex polygonal frames (32) used, so that each side is occupied by a single float (72), (73) or (85) of the same width in segments as its length. Bigger arrangements are those in which the same arrangement of floats (72), (73) or (85) that completes exactly all the segments in length of a side of the regular convex polygonal frames (32), is repeated symmetrically radially on all other sides. Once assembled both types of elements in a regular polygonal prismatic structure, there is a central hollow coaxially aligned inside the same, also in shape of regular polygonal prism with the same number of sides. The crew can access inside this hollow to couple other elements. Coupled pairs of twin U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) or rectangular frames (99) can be docked and screwed simultaneously to the regular convex polygonal frames (32) and to the floats (72), (73) or (85) used until completing all segments in length of each side of the regular convex polygonal frames (32) (in easier words, using a single one of these elements or several ones but always completing the length of each side), giving a sandwiched structure on each side of the regular polygonal prismatic structure. If instead of these elements, coupled pairs of twin U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) or rectangular frames (99) are<!-- EPO <DP n="81"> --> used, they can be mutually linked by their longitudinal hinges (110), either if they are placed on corners as if they are placed on faces of the inner prismatic hollow, so the regular polygonal prismatic structure is even stronger and tougher. Rectangular platforms (101) are also coupled. Since in all floating structural modules the U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) or similar counterparts and the crossbars (1) are placed in different parallel horizontal planes, in this arrangement the U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) and regular convex polygonal frames (32) are placed in two different coaxial aligned prisms, one contained inside the other. By this geometrical feature, the vertices of all regular convex polygonal frames (32) protrudes from the floating elements, so they can be joined by longitudinal bars (112), hosted in a longitudinal row of holes for each vertex. We should notice that in this structure these longitudinal bars (112) are placed outside from the arrangement of floating elements, while in all previous reel cage middle pieces they are placed inside the arrangement of floating elements.</p><p id="p0158" num="0158">With the aid of thick pins, screws or bolts, or also preferably using the own longitudinal bars (122), two twin star-shaped adjustable racks (116) of the same number of spokes than sides in the regular convex polygonal frames (32) used, are docked over the two outer ones on the assembled prismatic structure, being connected each spoke to each vertex and all star-shaped adjustable racks (116) and regular convex polygonal frames (32) coaxially aligned. With this arrangement the two outer star-shaped adjustable racks (116) give two aligned holes which are coincident to the symmetry axis of the prismatic structure, so suitable for placing a thick cylindrical hollow shaft for making the capsule to spin around. Inside said thick cylindrical hollow shaft the transference cable orset of parallel transference cables pass, suitably lubricated tensioned and for this function. In turn, the faces of the inner prismatic hollow are filled with any cushioned or inflatable elements for protecting the passengers when all the capsule is spinning passing through the water stream, who are housed within the prismatic structure in rotation, being attached hanging from central thick cylindrical hollow shaft from safety harnesses and other security equipment, as helmets. Said thick cylindrical hollow shaft may be also cushioned. Passengers may pick up his legs toward the abdomen if necessary, depending on the space available and the diameter of the structure built, so they do not hit the rotating periphery. This rugged floating rotary cage which has peripheric spinning outer hull, lacks a preferred vertical orientation, so it can not overturn in any way independently of the value of the water stream force and torque applied to the prismatic structure, so the stronger the water flow is, the higher angular acceleration suffers the rotational capsule and it spins faster, and to the contrary., so the rotating capsule floats while it rotates freely around its central rotation axis. As passengers and cargo hang from the thick cylindrical hollow shaft and all weights are equitatively distributed as all prismatic structures sides are identical, the center of gravity is placed on the rotation axis, usually centered on it. Passengers, firmly attached to the thick cylindrical hollow shaft, are surrounded by padded protections and can not be released except by breaking or voluntary opening of harnesses, but in that case they still remain inside the cage, rolling<!-- EPO <DP n="82"> --> over the cushioned parts. As the rotation axis and the transverse cable are above the floats (72), (73) or (85) in contact with water, the torque exerted is very large, but rather than producing uncontrolled pitching or shaking as in the case of a normal watercraft, this is translated into a rotary motion for making the rotating capsules spin, so the capsule is stabilized as it rolls over the water stream, dragged objects or debris. With hull in rotation, as a result of the principle of conservation of angular momentum, a stabilization of the spatial orientation of its rotation axis tends to reduce pitching and tilting movements in the transference compared to conventional watercrafts, and reducing in turn pulls on the cable. Furthermore, there is a dynamic increase in buoyancy in rotating capsules, since the rotation makes the rotating capsule to climb over incident water flow through its rotation inertia. For adjusting the moment of inertia of the structure a series of identical weights can be placed at equal radial distances from the center on the spokes from star-shaped adjustable racks (116).</p><p id="p0159" num="0159">Since the rotating capsule has to move transversely to the water stream using the transverse component from their own pushing force, both in a direction as to the contrary, it can resort to the transverse cable placement in slightly oblique arrangement with respect to the water stream, as in <figref idrefs="f0024"><b>Figure 51</b></figref><b>.</b> With this solution, to reverse the direction of movement it is necessary to reverse the arrangement of the cable ends, which must necessarily be longer than the width of the water stream to cross, what means time and efforts required for rolling the capsule across the soil on the shore to its new starting position on each trip, but only in case the shores are free of obstacles. Therefore, an oblique radial paddle (184) is placed on the rotating capsule to each one of all spokes from both star-shaped adjustable racks (116), so arranged in a radial symmetrical distribution. Each oblique radial paddle (184) is a metal bar with square cross section which can be inserted snugly inside, displaced along and fixed at a certain radial distance from center along each one of said spokes with bolts (as telescopic legs). To such bar a metal plate is welded for shaping the paddle at an angle of 45 ° in relation the faces of said square bar. These oblique radial paddle (184) protrudes from the floats (72), (73) or (85), all of them with the same orientation of 45° or -45° in all spokes, so they cooperate. When water flow hits each oblique radial paddle (184), the longitudinal component makes the rotating capsule to spin, and the transverse component makes the rotating capsule to slide along the transference cable on the desired direction, which depends on the coupling orientation of them. Once the rotating capsule has reached the shore and passengers have got out, simply all oblique radial paddle (184) are rotated 90° for inverting the direction. As the floats (72), (73) and (85) are symmetrical with respect to a vertical transverse symmetry plane that passes through its own center, both two ends are equal and indifferent, therefore the rotating capsule present the same behavior in a sense of displacement as on the other. In other case such behavior in both directions can be different. We should notice that, with exception of said oblique radial paddles (184), no additional elements have been added still, so all the structure described for now for building rotating capsules is made with elements, parts and pieces already seen.<!-- EPO <DP n="83"> --> An additional element to add to rotating capsules are a kind of triangular prism-shaped floats (185) .Each one of them fits exactly in the triangular hollow between two adjacent floats (72), (73) or (85), so their bases are regular triangles (equilateral and equiangular) only in case of a rotating capsule having six sides, while in all the rest of cases their bases are an isosceles triangle, whose angles depend on the number of sides of the rotating capsule where it is to be coupled. By their coupling, said triangular prism-shaped floats (185) increase the buoyancy of the rotating capsule by filling with floating bodies the gaps between the main floats (72), (73) or (85). Each triangular prism-shaped float (185) has a complete longitudinal hole which crosses completely it, located in a position near the vertex which is inserted between the two adjacent floats (71), (72) or (85), in a way that each longitudinal bar (122) can impale each triangular prism-shaped float (185) through such longitudinal hole, holding it in position without being released. Said triangular prism-shaped float (185) may be replaced by a pneumatic inflatable version (196) for increasing buoyancy and saving space in vehicles.</p><p id="p0160" num="0160">Another important elements to couple to each rotating capsule are twin radially-symmetric sliding covers (187), being each one constituted by one piece or more. Said pieces cover both sides of the tubular prismatic hollow of the rotating capsule, avoiding it could be filled with water, and impede that the passengers may be hit and injured with floating objects that can entry into said tubular prismatic hollow, pushed by the stream. Each one of said twin radially-symmetric sliding covers (187) are polygon-shaped pieces, or several identical pieces that when joined in a radially-symmetric arrangement they shape a polygon, being such polygon regular and of the same number of sides than the twin regular bases ofthe prismatic structure of the rotating capsule. So that the single piece or the radial arrangement of several identical ones of them, disposed in a plane which is parallel to the regular convex polygonal frames (32), is / are then introduced from one side inside the prismatic central hollow of the rotating capsule along its main longitudinal central symmetry axis, exactly matching with the inner flat faces of said prismatic central hollow, actually corresponding to the top surfaces of the floats (71), (72), (73) or (85) used in the assembly and the radially inner faces of the regular convex polygonal frames (32) coupled on the transverse grooves (4), (6) and (77), fitting snugly between and over them without clearances. Each one of said twin radially-symmetric sliding covers (187), or the radial arrangement of several identical ones of them, has / have longitudinal slots which are also arranged in a radially-symmetric disposition, in a way that they can fit without play on the longitudinal guides or flanges (11) or (78) of each one of the floats (71), (72), (73) or (85) assembled in the rotating capsules, and slide along them until stop touching the star-shaped adjustable rack (116), to which it / they can be screwed or bolted from inside the prismatic tubular hollow by passengers, as well as from outside to the floats (71), (72), (73) or (85), arranged radially, by means of the sets of floats-sliding covers fixing screw (12).</p><p id="p0161" num="0161">We should notice that said rotating capsules are also tsunami emergency capsules. Only differences are that they do not use transference cables and oblique radial paddles (184).<!-- EPO <DP n="84"> --></p><p id="p0162" num="0162">At least on paper it is possible to build not only tsunami emergency capsules and rotating capsules, but also floating walkways of rotary-peripheral hull, although because the increased complexity of the structure and its lower strength they may be hardly realizable except in exceptional cases of preassembly and / or previous placement in anticipation of a possible extraordinarily rapid evacuation of large numbers of people in case of danger, as for example, danger of sudden thaw of a rushing river or a high risk of liquefaction of a sloping ground or permafrost. A floating walkway of rotary-peripheral hull is a walkway placed connecting two shores, which is arranged crossing a water body, water stream, frozen water stream or sloping terrain with high risk of liquefaction, characterized by being wrapped by one or several prismatic rotary structures, made with floating structural modules, in a way that each one of said prismatic rotary structures spin around a floating walkway section, in the same way that rotary capsules do, but in a longitudinal fix position over such floating walkway. Then, they try to offer protection to people crossing the walkway in a situation of evacuation emergency in a similar way that the rotary capsules offer to the passengers inside. The prismatic rotary structures rolls over water, dragged objects, debris, ice blocks, or any solid object, while the people cross inside such structure in rotation for making a fast evacuation in seconds or minutes if necessary.

To permit relative rotation of each one of the prismatic rotatory floating peripheral arrangements around its corresponding three dimensional prismatic frame (188) containing the gateway or gateway horizontal section, all rectangular platform sections (101) on each and every floating structural modules have been replaced by curved rectangular platform sections (189), all of them with the same outer perimeter, dimensions, sets of holes and anchoring positions than usual rectangular platform sections (101) have for compatible coupling on the coupled pairs of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3), coupled pairs of hinged U-shaped longitudinal bars (111), rectangular frames (99) and hinged rectangular frames (112), but with the feature that its top surface is not flat as in the former one, but curved in the longitudinal direction, so that each one constitutes an angular sector of a hollow cylindrical tube of the same angle value that the result of dividing a complete circle by the number of sides that the regular convex polygonal frames (32) used in the same assembly.

Each floating structural module can be present and can be coupled to the crossbars (1) which belong to the floating structure in construction, well in a single modular set previously assembled in a single joining step, well in form of their composing detached parts in several steps, with the result that each time that one of these floating structural units is coupled and secured the modular, incremental, successive, reversible growth of size (length and / or width), structural strength, deck surface and buoyancy capacity of the floating structure in construction is achieved, as well as the number of locking and anchoring positions that are present on each one of said floating structural modules for further coupling of other elements, parts, pieces and accessories. Each one of the parts and elements from the set here claimed has well-defined shapes and features that allow to them, depending on the number of available pieces from each type, its standardized, compatible mounting and securing in a great number of possible assemblies and arrangements due to the fact that the same anchoring and locking positions and securing mechanisms and devices are repeated sideward along at least the direction of the crossbars (1), as well because in almost all the cases they are present in standardized compatible repeated arrangement in all the pieces, so they are present and repeated independently of the type of pieces where they are placed.<br/>
Said set of elements and pieces is <b>characterized in that</b> on each floating structure the crossbars (1) are always identical and of the same length, preferably with rectangular or square cross-section, while each floating structural module is composed under compulsion of at least a main float (2) and two twin U-shaped longitudinal bars (3), being possible to have other elements, pieces and accessories coupled over the previous ones which also can be attached or detached modularly in an incremental, additive way by repeated coupling sideward with each floating structural module coupled to the floating structure in assembly, disassembly or reconfiguration. The floats (2) are elongated and symmetric in relation to a vertical symmetry plane that passes through its own center, having all of them practiced downward below its top flat horizontal surface at least five transverse grooves (4), (5) and (6), all of them with square or rectangular cross-section and crossing completely its float (2) from side to side in horizontal direction perpendicular to its vertical symmetry plane that passes through its own center, in a way that at least two transverse grooves (4) that are placed in the central part of the float (2), serve for coupling and securing of a crossbars (1) each, so for that said transverse grooves (4) have the same inner cross-section than the outer cross-section the crossbars (1) have for compatible coupling snugly with no plays or clearances between both two elements, being said crossbars (1) when inserted inside able of sliding along each transverse groove (4) in the same direction than them<!-- EPO <DP n="87"> --> before its mutual screwing or bolting.<br/>
While, the transverse grooves (5), which are always present in a number of two which flank all the transverse grooves (4) present on each float (2), serve for coupling and securing inside of them the two twin transverse short linear ending sections, so said transverse grooves (5) have the same outer cross-section than the outer cross-section of the metal tube the U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) are made starting from. When all crossbars (1) are coupled and screwed or bolted to the float (2) on their final positions inside the transverse grooves (4) and (6), and the two twin transverse short linear ending sections ofthe U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) are coupled and screwed or bolted to the float (2) on their final positions inside the transverse grooves (5), all top flat horizontal surfaces all these pieces can remain aligned at the same level.<br/>
When crossbars (1), float (2) and twin U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) are in the coupling position described, in the floating structural module assembled and in all possible constructible floating structural modules the crossbars (1) that are hosted in transverse grooves (4) are always placed between each twin transverse grooves (5) and the between each two twin transverse short linear ending sections from each U-shaped longitudinal bar (3) hosted inside the previous transverse grooves (5), passing perpendicularly below the longitudinal long linear middle section from each U-shaped longitudinal bar (3) in mutual contact with them by touching of top flat horizontal face from crossbars (1) with bottom flat horizontal face from longitudinal long linear middle section from each U-shaped longitudinal bar (3), resting then each U-shaped longitudinal bar (3) over each crossbar (1) hosted in all transverse grooves (4) in float (2). Each two U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) are coupled to the floats (2) in twin pairs which are in almost all cases symmetric in relation to a vertical symmetry plane that passes through the center of the float (2), in a way that each of these coupled pairs define a rectangle coupled on middle top of each float (2) in form of a rectangular frame where a top rectangular platform section (101) can be placed, for increasing modularly the deck surface with each floating structural module added to the floating structure in assembly.<br/>
U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) are coupled in twin symmetrically-mirrored pairs, usually being identical both of them in almost all cases, to a float (2) for constituting a floating structural module. Each U-shaped longitudinal bar (3) is made of cut and bent metal hollow tube bar of square or rectangular cross-section, which is bent in right angles in a U shape of three linear straight sections arranged in the same plane or parallel planes, a longer central one and two twin symmetric shorter ones at the ends, in a way that the distance between their two twin shorter ending linear sections, measured in perpendicular direction in relation to them, is the same than the distance between the two twin transverse grooves (5) performed on each float (2) also measured in perpendicular direction in relation to them. This matching in distances makes possible a compatible coupling of each U-shaped longitudinal bar (3) over each float (2) through said transverse grooves (5), being arranged those U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) always with their longer central straight linear section in parallel in relation to the main float (2) where it is coupled, slightly above from the top flat horizontal surface of said float (2) and displaced from the vertical central symmetry plane of the floats (2) the length of their two<!-- EPO <DP n="88"> --> twin shorter ending linear sections, because in coupling position of the U-shaped longitudinal bar (3) to which they belong, they reach exactly until the vertical central symmetry plane of the float (2), being arranged each U-shaped longitudinal bar (3) at both sides of said symmetry plane.<br/>
The length of the two twin shorter ending linear sections of each U-shaped longitudinal bar (3) is exactly calculated in a way that, once coupled and secured to its corresponding float (2), its longer central straight linear section arranged in parallel in relation to the main float (2) matches exactly with the imaginary vertical plane which is coincident with the vertical flat side face of the same side of the float (2) where it is coupled, or instead of matching exactly protrudes transversely a little additional distance. Thanks to this, two floating structural modules coupled over parallel crossbars (1) can touch between them, if placed in consecutive contact, only through said longer central straight linear sections from two different U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) which belong each one to one of these floating structural modules, not through both floats (2) or their corresponding flat vertical side faces.<br/>
As in all floating structural modules, as well as in all floating structures assembled, all central straight linear sections from all U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) are placed in the same horizontal plane, which is parallel to the corresponding horizontal planes where the crossbars (1) and the floats (2) are respectively arranged, an intercrossed strongly sandwiched main frame is constituted thanks to these three main structural pieces, being said main frame expandable sideward by addition of more additional floating structural modules in the direction of the crossbars (1), either if mounted in a continuous sectional hull structure with all of them in mutual contact sideward, or leaving intermediate gaps along crossbars (1) at the desired positions with no floating structural modules coupled. All three main structural pieces, crossbars (1), floats (2) and U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) are each one symmetric in relation to a longitudinal or vertical symmetry plane that passes through its own center, for making possible to couple them in all structures either in right or left sides indifferently.<br/>
Each two of these three main structural elements are mutually joined with one of three possible sets of fixing screws, so crossbars (1) and floats (2) are mutually screwed and secured with a set of crossbars-floats fixing screws (7), in a way that each one of them crosses consecutively and joins a section of both these pieces by two consecutively vertical coaxial holes practiced each one in one of said pieces to join, being each one of these pairs of consecutively vertical coaxial holes repeated in the horizontal plane and belonging to a group or several groups which are arranged symmetrically in relation to the vertical central symmetry plane that passes through the center of the float (2) in coupling position of said pieces. The sets of said holes placed on the floats (2) are located inside the perimeter of the top flat horizontal surfaces of transverse grooves (4) and (6), and are drilled and threaded with female thread on pieces, bodies, matrices or metal blocks embedded inside the body of floats (2) for giving structural resistance and endurance to threads. With this arrangement each set of crossbars-floats fixing screws (7) joins each crossbar (1) hosted inside a transverse groove (4) or (6) to a float (2). Crossbars (1) and U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) are mutually screwed and<!-- EPO <DP n="89"> --> secured with a set of crossbars-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws, threaded rods or bolts (8), in a way that each one of them crosses consecutively and joins a section of both these pieces by consecutive vertical coaxial holes practiced each one in one of said pieces to join, being each one of these pairs of consecutively vertical coaxial holes repeated in the horizontal plane and belonging to a group or several groups which are arranged symmetrically in rotation to the vertical symmetry plane that passes through the center of the float (2) in coupling position of said pieces. The sets of said holes are placed on each one of the sections of mutual contact between crossbars (1) and the longer straight linear middle section from each U-shaped longitudinal bar (3). With this arrangement each set of crossbars-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws, threaded rods or bolts (8) joins each crossbar (1) to each coupled pair of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3). Floats (2) and U-shaped longitudinal bars (3)are mutually screwed and secured with a set of floats-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws (9), in a way that each one of them crosses consecutively and joins a section of both these pieces by two consecutively vertical coaxial holes practiced each one in one of said pieces to join, being each one of these pairs of consecutively vertical coaxial holes repeated in the horizontal plane and belonging to a group or several groups which are arranged symmetrically in relation to the vertical longitudinal symmetry plane that passes through the center of the float (2) and in relation to the vertical transversal symmetry plane that passes through the center of the U-shaped longitudinal bar (3) in coupling position of said pieces, allowing the coupling of each U-shaped longitudinal bar (3) either in right or left sides indifferently. The sets of said holes placed on the floats (2) are located inside the perimeter of the top flat horizontal surfaces of transverse grooves (5), and are drilled and threaded with female thread on pieces, bodies, matrices or metal blocks embedded inside the body of floats (2) for giving structural resistance and endurance to threads.<br/>
By removing two of these three types of screws, threaded rods or bolts (7), (8) or (9), releasing, displacement in rotation to the other two, and partial or total removing of one of the main structural pieces are allowed, being still joined the other two structural pieces by the set of screws (7), (8) or (9) which has not been removed.<br/>
Each coupled pair of two twin U-shaped longitudinal bars on each assembled floating structural module gives a horizontal rectangular tube metal frame, where to screw a rectangular modular platform section (101) whose outer dimensions are exactly the same that said horizontal rectangular tube metal frame has, for an exact matching and coupling of this rectangular modular platform section (101) over it.<br/>
A transverse groove (6) is located on the top flat horizontal surface above the prow of each float (2), outside the pair of twin transverse grooves (5) and then outside the rectangular frame constituted by each two twin U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) once coupled over said float (2), being said transverse groove (6) exactly identical to each transverse groove (4), so crossing completely the float (2) from side to side, arranged in parallel in the same horizontal plane and with the same cross-section that transverse grooves (4), and having the same sets of vertical holes placed on its top flat horizontal surface drilled and threaded with female thread on pieces, bodies, matrices or metal blocks embedded inside the body of floats (2), in the same disposition<!-- EPO <DP n="90"> --> and arrangement than their counterparts in transverse grooves (4), for a compatible coupling of a crossbar (1) inside said transverse groove (6) as in transverse grooves (4).<br/>
Disposed on said top flat horizontal surface at the prow of each float (2), and flanking but jumping said transverse groove (6), there are disposed one or several strong longitudinal guide ways or flanges (11), arranged symmetrically in relation to the vertical longitudinal symmetry plane that passes through the center of the float (2), which are molded in the same body than the float (2) or made in a separate piece and screwed or bolted to said float (2), and finish in a transverse stopper placed to stop in this longitudinal position other pieces than can be inserted and slid along said longitudinal guide ways or flanges (11).<br/>
Over said top flat horizontal surface at the prow of each float (2) and inserted and slid along said longitudinal guide ways or flanges (11) from the front backwards until stop on said transverse stopper, a sliding cover (10) can be coupled for covering the transverse groove (6) and the crossbar (1) that can be housed in last one, impeding that their sets of crossbars-floats fixing screws (7) can be accidentally unscrewed or removed. For that coupling, each sliding cover (10) has corresponding longitudinal bottom slots that coincide and match with the longitudinal guide ways or flanges (11), impeding to said sliding cover (10) to be accidentally released upwards from the assembly. Each sliding cover (10) is fixed to the float (2) above by means of a set of sliding covers-floats fixing screws (12), in a way that each one of them crosses consecutively and joins sliding cover (10) and float (2) by two consecutively vertical coaxial holes practiced each one in one of said pieces to join, being each one of these pairs of consecutively vertical coaxial holes repeated in the horizontal plane and belonging to a group or several groups which are arranged symmetrically in relation to the vertical central symmetry plane that passes through the center of the float (2) and sliding cover (10) in coupling position of said pieces. The sets of said holes placed on the floats (2) are located outside the perimeter of the top flat horizontal surface of the transverse groove (6), and are drilled and threaded with female thread on pieces, bodies, matrices or metal blocks embedded inside the body of floats (2) for giving structural resistance and endurance to threads.<br/>
All described elements which belong to the floating structural modules, that is, crossbars (1), floats (2), sliding covers (10) and rectangular modular platform sections (101), are manufactured always in standardized dimensions for a compatible coupling among these pieces and further ones, in a way that their respective lengths of all said pieces, in the direction which is parallel to the crossbars (1) in the same spatial orientation than in their respective coupling positions to said crossbars (1) in a floating structure in assembly process, are always a positive integer multiple, equal or greater than one, of a standardized preset unitary length whose value is previously calculated for best optimization in storage, transport and handling processes of the set of parts and pieces because resulting final size and weight, being that standardized preset unitary length named thereinafter as "segment". This rule is modified in case of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3), in a way that in these pieces this same length standardization rule is applied to each pair of these pieces coupled to a float (2), so each one of their twin shorter straight ending sections have the half of a positive integer number of segments<!-- EPO <DP n="91"> --> in length.<br/>
The value for such standardized preset unitary length or segment, is the value of the most suitable minimum width for a floating structural module for practical handling of all pieces in the set, or which is the same, the transverse separation distance between the two parallel outer edges of the straight longer middle sections from both U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) coupled on the same float (2) measured in perpendicular direction in relation to them, so in parallel to the crossbars (1) in coupling arrangement, in a way that the value of said segment is related to the minimum value of the modular increase or decrease in length of the assembled structures measured in direction ofthe crossbars (1), in deck surface, as well as in buoyancy / load capacity which can be made in a single step of addition or removal of a single floating structural module in a floating structure in assembly.<br/>
In addition to this standardization rule in lengths, in all the different parts and pieces belonging to the set of elements and pieces, the different sets, groups and arrangements of the different locking, sliding and fixing mechanisms and devices practiced in a single segment in length on each different piece, measured in the same direction that the crossbars (1) or in a parallel direction to them in the same spatial orientation that in coupling positions, are repeated sideward a time on each segment in the same direction that the crossbars (1) or in a parallel direction to them in the same spatial orientation that in coupling positions, thus with a periodic repetition of the same distribution of all of said groups and arrangements of the different locking, sliding and fixing mechanisms and devices with a constant spacing of a segment. This rule is applied to the longitudinal guide ways or flanges (11) in the floats (2), the different sets of screws, threaded rods or bolts (7), (8), (9) and (12), the different sets of vertical holes practiced on the crossbars (1), floats (2), U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) and sliding covers (10) for being crossed by the previous ones, the respective drilled holes and drilled female-threaded metal bodies, matrices or blocks embedded in the body of the floats (2), and the bottom longitudinal slots in the sliding covers (10), so on each one of these pieces which are n segments in length in said direction, their respective locking, sliding and fixing mechanisms and devices are repeated n times in said direction in coupling position. By this way, all said groups and arrangements of the different locking, sliding and fixing mechanisms and devices are symmetric in relation to a vertical plane of symmetry that passes through its own center and is perpendicular to the crossbars (1) in coupling positions, independently of the sizes of the pieces in the assembly where they are placed, as well as each one of said groups and arrangements of the different locking, sliding and fixing mechanisms and devices is symmetric in relation to a vertical plane of symmetry that passes through its own center. Only exception are the U-shaped longitudinal bars (3), where this rule is applied to each coupled pair of both of them over a float (2).<br/>
This segmentation of lengths and this periodic repetition of the different locking, sliding and fixing mechanisms and devices in the direction of the crossbars (1) in all pieces and elements belonging to the set, makes possible the coupling of the different floating structural modules, floats (2) or coupled pairs of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) on a series of identical selectable preset positions along the crossbars (1), each one<!-- EPO <DP n="92"> --> a segment in length measured in the same direction than the crossbars (1), which can be occupied by a complete or a part of a floating structural module, or being left unoccupied according to the user's wishes, for building very different floating structures for many possible purposes.<br/>
To each coupled pair of U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) two twin small, simple transverse crossbars (100) are added, being preferably made of solid or hollow tubular metal bar, with the same outer cross section than the inner cross section that the metal tube with which the U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) are made, or slightly smaller, in a way that each one of said small transverse crossbars (100) can be introduced by each one of their two extremes and fit being inserted snugly by inside the tubular opening of one of these transverse ends of tubular U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) exactly until its half, connecting symmetrically both two twin U-shaped longitudinal bars (3). Both transverse ends of both coupled U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) and both twin small transverse crossbars (100) placed inside them are drilled with the same coincident consecutive vertical holes in coupling position with the vertical holes practiced on top horizontal surface of transverse grooves (5) for placing the sets of floats-U-shaped longitudinal bars connecting screws (9), so these fixing screws cross both types of structural metal pieces, with the only difference that the drilled holes practiced on the transverse crossbars (100) are threaded for hosting screwed inside said floats-U-shaped longitudinal bars connecting screws (9).<br/>
To the set of pieces inner crossbars (13) are added, consisting in metal tube pieces with exactly all the same characteristics that the crossbars (1), so also made of metal tube frame of square or rectangular cross-section but with the distinction of having an outer cross section whose shape and dimensions are such that these inner crossbars (13) can be inserted snugly inside the hollow tubular usual outer crossbars (1) and be displaced along all its length also snugly, and be fixed to them or together with them with the same sets of crossbars-floats fixing screws or bolts (7) and crossbars-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws, threaded rods or bolts (8), so for that said inner crossbars (13) are also manufactured in standardized lengths of a positive integer number of segments, and they have performed the same sets of holes in the same coincident standardized positions for the sets of crossbars-floats fixing screws or bolts (7) and crossbars-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws, threaded rods or bolts (8), for being crossed by them.<br/>
To all or part of all U-shaped longitudinal bars (3), a series of coaxial equal longitudinal hinges (110) are added for modifying them, thus obtaining hinged U-shaped longitudinal bars (111) which can be mutually linked by a middle hinge that allow mutual folding of each two of them adopting any angle from 0° to approximately 180°, in a way that said longitudinal hinges (110) consist of equal thick cylindrical metal tubes which are joined by any method longitudinally, coaxially, consecutively exactly on the top outer edge of the middle straight linear section of an usual U-shaped longitudinal bar (3), so they are not joined to any of their surfaces or faces, but exactly on this edge, protruding slightly upward and sideward a little additional preset distance, which gives that this little preset distance places the symmetry central axis and folding axis of each longitudinal hinge (110) and each row of some aligned of them coincidently with the edge between two hinged<!-- EPO <DP n="93"> --> U-shaped longitudinal bars (111) but slightly above from their top surfaces for allowing the mutual folding, so the preset coupling position of said longitudinal hinges (110) to the crossbars (1) are coincident with the same ones from usual U-shaped longitudinal bars (3), so they can be used indifferently and interchangeably in all the different structures. A series of cylindrical pins or bolts (113) are responsible of linking each two adjacent rows of longitudinal hinges (110) in a common folding axis.<br/>
To the set of pieces two new types of linking elements are added, in concrete crossbars split in two U-shaped pieces (25) and inner crossbars split in two U-shaped pieces (26), consisting in pieces, preferably made of metal, both of which can be disassembled into two unequal halves in form of bars of U-shaped cross-section in a way that one from them can fit inside the other one snugly by their open sides, but having when coupled the same outer cross section than crossbars (1) and inner crossbars (13), respectively, having also the same standardized length of an integer positive number of segments and the same distributions of sets of holes for the sets of crossbars-floats fixing screws or bolts (7) and crossbars-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws, threaded rods or bolts (8), so in the assemblies and structures they can be swapped by the crossbars (1) and inner crossbars (13) respectively, so before the two parts of each element are joined to each other and / or the floats (2), they can flank from both sides and close inside of them, along all its length, a cable, rope or chain whose extremes are far or are tied or hooked to a tree, lamppost, post, rock, or any elements from the environment where both extremes of the cable must be fixed, for instance, for passing a guide between two opposite shores. The two halves can joined together by means of a series of spaced holes, either if vertical or horizontal, which cross both pieces to join in coincident positions by pins.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0002" num="0002"><claim-text>Set of parts and elements for modular assembly, disassembly and reconfiguration of watercrafts and floating structures of multiple floats as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in thatto the set of parts and pieces rectangular frames (99) and hinged rectangular frames (112) are added, being characterized each one of these pieces in that they can be screwed or bolted to the crossbars (1) and floats (2) in the different structures and assemblies indifferently and interchangeably for substituting usual coupled pairs of twin U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) and usual coupled pairs of twin hinged U-shaped longitudinal bars (111) joined through their respective inner twin transverse crossbars (100) inside, so said rectangular frames (99) and hinged rectangular frames (112) are made of the same metal tube that those conveniently cut, bent and weld for making a rectangular frame with the same coincident outer and inner perimeters and standardized dimensions in segments that each one of their counterparts, and they have the same coincident standardized distributions of sets of holes for the sets of crossbars-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws, threaded rods or bolts (8) and floats-U-shaped longitudinal bars fixing screws or bolts (9) for compatible standardized coupling to other elements from the set, so their longitudinal sides in coupling positions have always the same length than the middle straight linear segment of all U-shaped longitudinal bars (3) and hinged U-shaped longitudinal bars (111), and their transversal sides in coupling positions have always said possible standardized values of a positive integer<!-- EPO <DP n="94"> --> number of segments.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0003" num="0003"><claim-text>Set of parts and elements for modular assembly, disassembly and reconfiguration of watercrafts and floating structures of multiple floats as claimed in <b>Claim 2, characterized in that</b> to the set of pieces a kind of new elements is added, consisting of modifications of the usual sliding covers (10) in form of rectangular sliding platform sections (92), each one of them having the same flat horizontal bottom surface crossed by the same longitudinal bottom slots for coupling to the longitudinal guideways or flanges (11) and the same sets of holes for attachment of the sets of sliding covers-floats fixing screws (12) as they are present and practiced in usual sliding covers (10), but being its top section modified and enlarged in form of a flat horizontal surface in form of a rectangular plate or rectangular platform section with a standardized length measured in the direction of the crossbars (1) in coupling position of a positive integer number of segments, allowing modular expansion of main deck or main platform to the prow of each float (2) and sideward with each floating structural module added, but also having over said top flat horizontal surface a series of molding textures or rough finish to safely walk and step without sliding, and optional perimeter flanges protruding upward to hinder the exit of objects and feet from the surface to water.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0004" num="0004"><claim-text>Set of parts and elements for modular assembly, disassembly and reconfiguration of watercrafts and floating structures of multiple floats as claimed in Claim 3, <b>characterized in that</b> to the set of pieces a kind of new elements is added, consisting of a series of attachable front prows (95) of two or more segments in width each one, whose widths, lengths, external shapes and materials are customizable and can be varied on each one, which are selectable, removable and interchangeable and can be docked or not depending on the need, which consist of bulky cap-shaped or hood-shaped detachable elements with hydrodynamic external shape of a watercraft's prow, but instead of being a part of the watercraft's main hull, each one of them can be coupled to the front of the watercraft holding, encompassing and embracing snugly all the outside of the watercraft's prow and all its composing parallel floats in mutual contact at the same time, impeding they could be separated to each other even if the watercraft moves at high speed, as said attachable front prow (95) receives all or almost all water impact in advance movement. Each one of said attachable front prows (95) is symmetrical in relation to a vertical symmetry plane that pass through the center of the watercraft and through the center of the same piece in coupling position, and has a cavity, recess or hollow which is also symmetrical in the same way in relation to said symmetry planes and is practiced in longitudinal horizontal direction, being open only to the rear for docking on the floating elements, but closed to all other sides, for avoiding to be filled with water when the watercraft floats or moves, which has the same transverse segments in width than the pile or stacking of all floating structural modules of the watercraft where those attachable front prow (95) is to be docked, so overall width of the complete piece is a little more due to both two opposite walls that flanks the central cavity, recess or hollow.

This element incorporates on its vertical longitudinal symmetry plane that passes through its own center, a row of vertical strong thick tubes for shaft housing (159), all of them of the same large diameter and thick wall, so one of them can be chosen for placing the rotation pivoting axis of all floating assembly,<!-- EPO <DP n="110"> --> so for centering or for displacing it forwards or backwards in relation to the floating pontoon bridge platform section to place above later and achieving balance or torque compensation in a water stream. The top metal plate (157) is drilled with holes matching in diameter and position to each one of said tubes for shaft housing (159), allowing introduction of a shaft from above on one of them, while the thick bottom metal plate (158) is not drilled to support said shaft with no falling down, or drilled with a smaller centered hole for crossing it with a vertical bar or peg for nailing or anchoring the floating structure to shallow soil.</claim-text>

The big crossbeam piece (164) has internally a thick vertical cylindrical tube (165) which passes through its center connecting top and bottom flat horizontal surfaces and can host inside it the pivot shaft (160), so said top and bottom flat horizontal surfaces have holes of the same diameter than thick vertical cylindrical tube (165) which are centered on it.

The thick vertical cylindrical tube (165) has larger diameter than the pivot shaft (160), so that it is introduced with some play to allow the introduction<!-- EPO <DP n="111"> --> of supplementary lubricated sleeves (166) or thick washers, which can be placed or not depending on the need. Such supplementary lubricated sleeves (166) are all identical and introduced greased, stacked in column and making contact between the thick vertical cylindrical tube (165) and the pivot shaft (160), surrounding this last one, so that they smooth rotation and strengthen said pivot shaft (160) whil limiting movement to only rotation along a vertical axis. The top end of pivot shaft (160) protrudes slightly above the top surface of big crossbeam piece (164), so it has the required length for this feature and the two pieces are fastened together, for not getting out vertically one from the other, through a horizontal pin (167) which simultaneously pass through horizontal consecutive drilled holes practiced at the top end of pivot shaft (160) and a top sleeve (168). Said top sleeve (168) outer diameter larger than the hole in the top horizontal surface of big crossbeam piece (164), acting as a top upright confinement stopper.

Each one of said twin radially-symmetric sliding covers (187), or the radial arrangement of several identical ones of them, has / have longitudinal slots which are also arranged in a radially-symmetric disposition, in a way that they can fit without play on the longitudinal guides or flanges (11) or (78) of each one of the floats (71), (72), (73) or (85) assembled in the rotating capsules, and slide along them until stop touching the star-shaped adjustable rack (116), to which it / they can be screwed or bolted from inside the prismatic tubular hollow by passengers, as well as from outside to the floats (71), (72), (73) or (85), arranged radially, by means of the sets of floats-sliding covers fixing screw (12).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0017" num="0017"><claim-text>Set of parts and elements for modular assembly, disassembly and reconfiguration of watercrafts and floating structures of multiple floats as claimed in <b>Claim 16, characterized in that</b> two new elements are added, specifically a three-dimensional prismatic frame (188) having inner rolling elements (190) and a curved rectangular modular platform (189), so that in combination with other described and claimed elements before they allow construction of rotating-hull floating walkways which are supported over prismatic rotatory floating peripheral arrangements that rotate around the main walking platform of the rotating-hull floating walkway. Each one of said rotating-hull floating walkways consist of a single or several prismatic rotatory floating peripheral arrangements of floating structural units, each one of them assembled when four identical regular convex polygonal frames (32) are coaxially arranged in parallel vertical planes coupled on the transverse grooves (4), (6) and (77) of a certain number of identical dosed symmetric floats (72), (73) and (85), in a way that all segments of all sides of all the identical regular convex polygonal frames (32) are fully occupied by segments of said floats (72), (73) or (85), so they are arranged around said regular convex polygonal frames (32) in a prismatic rotatory floating peripheral arrangements, radially symmetric in relation to the center. It remains a central hollow coaxially aligned inside the same, also in shape of regular polygonal prism with the same number of sides, for coupling indifferently coupled pairs of twin U-shaped longitudinal bars (3), coupled pairs of hinged twin U-shaped longitudinal bars (111), rectangular frames (99) or hinged rectangular frames (112) simultaneously to the regular convex polygonal frames (32) and to the floats (72), (73) or (85) used until completing all segments in length of each side of the regular convex polygonal frames (32) used, giving<!-- EPO <DP n="115"> --> a sandwiched structure on each side of the prismatic rotatory floating peripheral arrangements structure, which is strengthened by bolting their longitudinal hinges (110) and joining the protruding vertices of all regular convex polygonal frames (32) by longitudinal bars (112). To each floating structural module which belongs to this prismatic rotatory floating peripheral arrangement, instead of rectangular platform sections (101), curved rectangular platform sections (189) are coupled, being characterized each one of these last ones of being exactly identical that said rectangular platform sections (101), but being finished in a top surface which is not flat but curved in a shape of inner cylindrical tube section, in a way that the axis of the imaginary cylinder is in parallel to the longer side of said curved rectangular platform sections (189), forming each one a cylindrical tube section of the same angle as the value corresponding to the division of a full circle by the number of sides of the regular convex polygonal frames (32) used in the prismatic rotatory floating peripheral arrangement, so that with the assembly of all curved rectangular platform sections (189) the remaining tubular central hollow is cylindrical, not regular polygonal as with usual rectangular platform sections (101). The platform from the rotating-hull floating walkway is placed inside a large three-dimensional prismatic frame (188), which is in turn placed inside along the tubular cylindrical hollow of each and every one of the prismatic rotatory floating peripheral arrangements used, which are in enough number to complete the entire length of the rotating-hull floating walkway between the two anchoring positions at both shores by being placed at preset intermediate positions, with the free rotation of all prismatic rotatory floating peripheral arrangements around the three-dimensional prismatic frame (188) allowed snugly with no plays or clearances due to the fact that the three-dimensional prismatic frame (188) is provided with inner rolling elements (190) whose parallel rotation axes are arranged in parallel in relation to the rotation axis of each one of the coaxially aligned prismatic rotatory floating peripheral arrangements, so these last ones can rotate freely and spin pushed by water stream around the three-dimensional prismatic frame (188), while persons can walk or run along the main platform, protected from water hits or debris by the rotating hull around them.</claim-text></claim></claims><drawings mxw-id="PDW16667813" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="116"> --><figure id="f0001" num="1,2a,2b"><img id="if0001" file="imgf0001.tif" wi="165"
