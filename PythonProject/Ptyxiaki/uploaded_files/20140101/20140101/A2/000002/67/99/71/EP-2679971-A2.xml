In order to manufacture products for which precise assembly operations are required, a robot including a force sensor has been proposed whose robot arm includes, at a position corresponding to a wrist portion of the robot arm, a force sensor for detecting external force and that is capable of performing precise assembly operations while detecting external force applied to a robot hand connected to the robot arm.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As the force sensor for detecting external force, a force sensor of a magnetic type is known (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2009075083A"><text>2009-75083</text></patcit>). The force sensor of a magnetic type has a structure in which magnetic flux generating sources and magnetoelectric transducers are held in such a way as to be able<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> to move relative to each other. The output voltages of the magnetic flux generating sources change in accordance with the magnetic flux density of magnetic flux flowing to the magnetoelectric transducers, which changes in accordance with a distance between the magnetic flux generating sources and the magnetoelectric transducers that may be changed by external force. By detecting the output voltages, the magnitude of the external force may be detected.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">On the other hand, a device called a "slip ring" that is capable of transmitting electric power and electrical signals from a stationary body to a rotating body is known (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP6310250A"><text>06-310250</text></patcit>). The slip ring is used when electric power and data signals are to be transmitted in an electromechanical system that needs to intermittently or continuously rotate. By providing the slip ring at a rotating unit instead of providing a transmission cable that is easily broken due to metal fatigue caused by bending at the rotating unit, the performance of the system improves and the operation of the system may be simplified. In the case of a robot, wires that are easily broken at movable joints may be omitted. The slip ring is also called a "rotary electrical joint" or a "collector", but will be simply referred to as the slip ring hereinafter. Although apparatuses capable of transmitting electric power and electrical signals from a stationary body to a rotating body include a rotary connector that utilizes<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> conducting fluid, the rotary connector will also be referred to as the "slip ring" in the following description. Members that rotate relative to each other such as a brush and rings in the slip ring may be referred to as a stationary body and a rotating body for the sake of convenience.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A robot is normally fixed to a base. A fixed end of the robot is configured by a thick, large member because the fixed end of the robot needs to be firmly fixed physically. On the other hand, compared to the fixed end, an arm of the robot (robot arm) is designed to become thinner and thinner on the side of a free end, so that a wide movable range is secured and various attitudes necessary to perform operations are established while avoiding collisions. Therefore, at positions close to the free end of the robot arm, there are limitations in design, that is, the area of regions other than links and joint portions of the robot arm in which additional components may be mounted is small.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">When a slip ring is to be mounted on a wrist portion located close to the free end of a robot arm of an articulated robot in addition to a force sensor in order to transmit electrical signals and supply power, the force sensor and the slip ring are to be individually provided, which undesirably increases the required mounting volume in the wrist portion.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention provides a force sensor that may be suitably mounted on a rotating unit of a robot arm and that<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> is capable of supplying power, detecting external force, and reducing the mounting volume.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Furthermore, the present invention provides a robot arm including the force sensor.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention in its first aspect provides a force sensor as specified in claims 1 to 10.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention in its second aspect provides a robot arm as specified in claim 11.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1A and 1B</figref> are a cross-sectional view and an exploded perspective view, respectively, of a force sensor in the present invention.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of the force sensor in the present invention.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">3B</figref> are electric function block diagrams illustrating the circuit configuration of the force sensor in the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 4</figref> is a diagram illustrating a force sensor according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0006 f0007">Figs. 5A to 5C</figref> are diagrams illustrating a force sensor according to a second embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 6</figref> is a diagram illustrating a force sensor according to a third embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 7</figref> is a diagram illustrating a slip ring unit.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 8</figref> is a diagram illustrating a force sensor according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 9</figref> is a diagram illustrating a robot arm on which the force sensor in the present invention is mounted.</p><heading id="h0006">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">The present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1A and 1B</figref> are a cross-sectional view and an exploded perspective view, respectively, of a force sensor in the present invention.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">One of sensor units provided in the force sensor in the present invention will be described.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">A pressure member 1 composed of a metal such as stainless steel is configured to be mounted on a sheath 2 including a top surface unit 4, a bottom surface unit 5, and four pillars (3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d) connecting the top surface<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> unit 4 and the bottom surface unit 5. The pressure member 1 is illustrated as a cross member in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1B</figref>, the shape of the pressure member 1 is not particularly limited insofar as the pressure member 1 may be mounted on the sheath 2 and has enough rigidity so that the pressure member 1 is not damaged when external force is applied.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As with the pressure member 1, the top surface unit 4, the bottom surface unit 5, and the pillars (3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d) are composed of metals. The pillars (3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d)<br/>
connect the top surface unit 4 and the bottom surface unit 5 to each other at positions corresponding to the vertices of a square.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">For example, notches may be provided in the top surface unit 4 of the sheath 2, and projections corresponding to the notches may be provided on the pressure member 1, so that the top surface unit 4 and the pressure member 1 are fitted together. In <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1A and 1B</figref>, a lower substrate 8 and an upper substrate 9 are provided inside the sheath 2. Magnetic flux generating sources 11 are provided on the lower substrate 8, and magnetoelectric transducers 10 are provided on the upper substrate 9. In the configuration illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1A and 1B</figref>, the magnetoelectric transducers 10 are arranged on the upper substrate 9 at substantially the same intervals, and the magnetic flux generating sources 11 corresponding to the magnetoelectric transducers 10 are arranged on the lower<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> substrate 8. In the following description, terms "upper" substrate and "lower" substrate will be used for convenience of description, but there are no particular technical limitations.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Fixed magnetoelectric transducers, whose positions are fixed relative to the positions of the magnetic flux generating sources 11, are provided immediately below the magnetic flux generating sources 11. The fixed magnetoelectric transducers have a configuration that enables continuous monitoring of changes in the magnetic force of the magnetic flux generating sources 11. When permanent magnets are used as the magnetic flux generating sources 11, the strength of magnetic fields generated by the magnetic flux generating sources 11 can decrease due to an increase in temperature caused by heat generated by current flowing through a cable and the like. By sensing this variation in the magnetic fields using the fixed magnetoelectric transducers, the variation may be used as a correction coefficient in detection of external force, which will be described later.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Alternatively, the magnetic flux generating sources 11 may be provided on the upper substrate 9, and the magnetoelectric transducers 10 may be provided on the lower substrate 8. The upper substrate 9 and the lower substrate 8 are arranged inside the sheath 2, and the magnetic flux generating sources 11 and the magnetoelectric transducers 10 provided on these substrates are arranged at certain intervals,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> so that the magnetic flux generating sources 11 and the magnetoelectric transducers 10 may relatively change their respective positions. The upper substrate 9 is fixed relative to the pressure member 1 or the sheath 2, and the lower substrate 8 is fixed relative to the bottom surface unit 5.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">By arranging the components as described above, the positions of the magnetoelectric transducers 10 provided on the upper substrate 9 may change relative to the positions of the magnetic flux generating sources 11 provided on the lower substrate 8 when external force is applied to the pressure member 1. When force mainly having a component in an X direction illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref> is applied to the top surface unit 4, the pillars (3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d) of the sheath 2 slightly tilt in the X direction relative to the bottom surface unit 5, and the positions of the upper substrate 9 and the positions of the lower substrate 8 change relative to each other. In addition, when force in a Y direction, which is a depth direction of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref> but not illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref>, is applied to the top surface unit 4, the pillars (3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d) tilt in the Y direction relative to the bottom surface unit 5.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">On the other hand, when force in a negative direction of a Z direction is applied to the top surface unit 4, the pillars (3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d) elastically deform and are slightly compressed in the Z direction. As a result, the positions of the upper substrate 9 and the positions of the lower substrate 8<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> change relative to each other in a direction in which the distance between the top surface unit 4 and the bottom surface unit 5 decreases.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">By using the above-described configuration, the magnitude of the magnetic flux flowing to the magnetoelectric transducers 10 changes in accordance with a change in the distance between the magnetic flux generating sources 11 and the magnetoelectric transducers 10 caused by external force applied to the pressure member 1, and accordingly the outputs of the magnetoelectric transducers 10 change in accordance with the change in the magnitude of the magnetic flux. By detecting the changes in the outputs of the magnetoelectric transducers 10, the magnitude of the external force may be detected.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As indicated by the following expressions 1 and 2, output voltages V of the magnetoelectric transducers 10 that change in accordance with magnetic flux density B of the magnetic flux flowing to the magnetoelectric transducers 10 are detected, and external force F is calculated using the output voltages V.

Wiring and the like are provided on the upper substrate 9 and the lower substrate 8<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> in practice, but description thereof is partly omitted for the sake of simplification. The slip ring unit includes rings 7, which are rotating bodies, and a brush 6, which is a stationary body. Although the rings 7 are referred to as rotating bodies and the brush 6 is referred to as a stationary body herein, either component may be referred to as a rotating body. The same holds true for a housing in a rotary connector and a shaft capable of rotating relative to the housing.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As the rings 7, a multilayer component obtained by alternately stacking tubular metal members capable of conducting electricity and tubular insulating materials around a shaft member is used. <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 7</figref> schematically illustrates the configuration of the slip ring unit.
