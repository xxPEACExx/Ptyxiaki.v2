For example, adhesive bonding results in a more uniform stress distribution across a bonded joint relative to the stress distribution across a mechanically-fastened joint. In addition, adhesive forms a barrier between structural components which may avoid undesirable effects that may be associated with mechanical joints wherein dissimilar materials are in direct contact with one another. Adhesive bonding of structural components may also reduce assembly costs and provide increased fatigue life relative to the assembly costs and fatigue life associated with mechanically-fastened joints.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A fillet bond is a type of adhesive bond between a curved surface of one component and a generally flat surface of another component. In a fillet bond, adhesive material forms fillets between the joined components. The thickness of a fillet bond may vary across a bondline between the two components. Advantageously, fillet bonds may provide improved stress distribution in a joint by spreading load in the joint over a relatively large surface area.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For certain assemblies having bonded joints, it may be necessary to qualify the strength-carrying capability of the bonded joints prior to placing the assembly into service. For example, prior to certifying an aircraft, it may be necessary to qualify bonded joints in primary load-carrying structure of the aircraft. Qualifying the bonded joints may include verifying that the margins of safety of the bonded joints are within design limits. The margins of safety may be determined by applying loads to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> test specimens of the bonded joint wherein the loads simulate actual loads to which the bonded joint may be subjected during the service life of the joint.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Certain structures may be subjected to in-service loads that place a fillet bond in tension pulloff (e.g., out-of-plane) loads. One such structure that may be subjected to tension pulloff loads is a skin panel having a plurality of stiffeners positioned in spaced relation to one another on one side of the skin panel. Each one of the stiffeners may be bonded to the skin panel with a fillet bond extending along a length of the stiffener. During service, the tension pulloff load may be distributed generally uniformly across the skin panel and may cause the fillet bonds to be loaded in tension.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Conventional testing apparatuses for testing the load-carrying capability of bonded joints are generally directed toward flat-bond geometry between two generally planar components. Adhesive material in such flat-bond geometry may have a generally uniform thickness across the bonded joint. Conventional testing apparatuses may include a generally flat backing plate that may be mounted to an outer surface of a test specimen having a flat-bond geometry. The testing apparatus may be mounted within a testing machine. The test specimen may be instrumented with strain gauges so that strain measurements may be recorded during application of a test load. The strain levels may be converted to stress. The test specimen may be tested to failure and the stress levels at failure may be correlated to strength values of the bonded joint.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Unfortunately, conventional testing apparatuses using backing plates may not provide an accurate duplication of the forces induced in a fillet bond. For example, for the above-mentioned structural assembly having stiffeners bonded to a skin panel, tension pulloff loads on the skin panel may induce bending loads in the test specimen at the fillet bonds. Although conventional testing apparatuses may be adequate for applying a tension test load to a fillet bond in a test specimen, the stiffness of the backing plate prevents the generation of bending loads in the test specimen.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A further drawback associated with conventional testing apparatuses is that eccentric or asymmetric loading may be produced in a test specimen. Such asymmetric loading may be caused by manufacturing tolerances of the test specimen, by misalignment of the test specimen with the testing machine, or due to other factors. The occurrence of asymmetric loading may minimize the repeatability of testing<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> conditions across a plurality of test specimens and may compromise the accuracy of test results.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">As can be seen, there exists a need in the art for a testing apparatus and method that may substantially duplicate the loading conditions in a fillet bond during application of a tension to the fillet bond. In this regard, there exists a need in the art for a testing apparatus and method capable of accurately inducing symmetric bending in a fillet bond during application of a tension test load. Ideally, the testing apparatus may avoid the need for measuring strain in a test specimen and then correlating the strain to stress for determining the strength capability of the fillet bond.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The above-noted needs associated with structural testing of fillet bonds are specifically addressed and alleviated by the present disclosure which provides a testing apparatus for characterizing a tension strength of a fillet bond joining a stiffener component to a skin component of a test specimen. The testing apparatus may include a lower fixture configured to maintain the stiffener component in a fixed position, and an upper fixture configured to engage the skin component at a pair of engagement locations on opposite sides of the fillet bond. The testing apparatus may additionally include a gimbal joint mechanically coupled to the upper fixture and configured to substantially isolate the fillet bond from asymmetric bending during application of a tension test load to the fillet bond.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a further embodiment, disclosed is a testing apparatus for characterizing a tension strength of a fillet bond. The testing apparatus may include a lower fixture and an upper fixture. The lower may maintain the stiffener component in a fixed position. The upper fixture may have a pair of load pins oriented generally parallel to one another and configured to engage an inner surface (304) of the skin component at a pair of discrete engagement locations on opposite sides of the fillet bond. The testing apparatus may include a gimbal joint mechanically coupled to the upper fixture and configured to substantially isolate the fillet bond from asymmetric bending during application of a tension test load to the fillet bond. The engagement locations may be positioned such that fillet edges of the fillet bond are subjected to a moment-shear<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> ratio that is substantially equivalent to the moment-shear ratio at the fillet edges of a structural assembly subjected to a uniformly distributed tension pulloff load</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Also disclosed is a method of characterizing a tension strength of a fillet bond joining a stiffener component to a skin component of a test specimen. The method may include the steps of placing the test specimen in a testing apparatus, and fixedly positioning a stiffener component of the test specimen. The method may further include engaging the skin component at a pair of engagement locations on opposite sides of the fillet bond, and applying a tension test load to the fillet bond at the engagement locations. The method may additionally include substantially isolating the fillet bond from asymmetric bending when applying the tension test load.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The features, functions and advantages that have been discussed can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present disclosure or may be combined in yet other embodiments, further details of which can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings below.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">These and other features of the present disclosure will become more apparent upon reference to the drawings wherein like numbers refer to like parts throughout and wherein:

In <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the skin panel 102 includes an inner surface 104 and an outer surface 106. The panel stiffeners 108 may be bonded to the inner and/or outer surfaces 104, 106 of the skin panel 102. The fillet bonds 128 may extend along a length of the panel stiffeners 108 and may define a skin-stiffener joint 126 for structurally bonding the panel stiffeners 108 to the skin panel 102. Although shown as being generally straight, the panel stiffeners 108 may be curved. The structural assembly 100 may be implemented in any one of a variety of different applications. For example, the structural assembly 100 may be implemented in an aircraft. However, the structural assembly 100 may be implemented in any vehicular or non-vehicular application, without limitation.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The present disclosure provides a testing apparatus 600 (<figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 11</figref>) and a test specimen 300 (<figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref>) that may advantageously be implemented for characterizing<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> a tension strength of a fillet bond 128 at a skin-stiffener joint 126 of a structural assembly 100.
