These wind conditions can be broadly divided into two categories - below rated speeds and above rated speeds. To produce power in these wind conditions, wind turbines may include sophisticated control systems such as pitch controllers and torque controllers. These controllers account for changes in the wind conditions and accompanying changes in wind turbine dynamics. For example, pitch controllers generally vary the pitch angle of rotor blades to account for the changes in wind conditions and turbine dynamics. During below rated wind speeds, wind power may be lower than the rated power output of the wind turbine. In this situation, the pitch controller may attempt to maximize the power output by pitching the rotor blades substantially perpendicular to the wind direction. Alternatively, during above rated wind speeds, wind power may be greater than the rated power output of the wind turbine. Therefore, in this case, the pitch controller may restrain wind energy conversion by pitching the rotor blades such that only a part of the wind energy impinges on the rotor blades. By controlling the pitch angle, the pitch controller thus controls the velocity of the rotor blades and in turn the energy generated by the wind turbine.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Along with maintaining rotor velocity, pitch controllers may also be employed to reduce tower oscillations. Tower oscillations or vibrations occur due to various disturbances, such as turbulence, inefficient damping, or transition between the two wind conditions. Moreover, the tower may vibrate along any degree of freedom. For example, the tower may vibrate in a fore-aft direction (commonly referred to as tower nodding), in a side-to-side direction (commonly referred to as tower naying), or along its longitudinal axis (commonly referred to as torsional vibration).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Tower nodding is usually caused by aerodynamic thrust and rotation of the rotor blades. Every time a rotor blade passes in front of the tower, the thrust of the wind impinging on the tower decreases. Such continuous variation in wind force may<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> induce oscillations in the tower. Moreover, if the rotor velocity is such that a rotor blade passes over the tower each time the tower is in one of its extreme positions (forward or backward), the tower oscillations may be amplified. Typically, the oscillations in the fore-aft direction are automatically minimized due to aerodynamic damping. Aerodynamic damping relies on the fact that the top of the tower constantly oscillates in the fore-aft direction. When the top of the tower moves upwind (or forward), the rotor thrust is increased. This increase in rotor thrust pushes the tower back downwind. The downwind push in turn aids in dampening the tower oscillations. Similarly, when the top of the tower moves downwind, the rotor thrust may be decreased. This decrease in rotor thrust pushes the tower back upwind. The upwind push also aids in dampening the tower oscillations.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Although aerodynamic damping aids in reducing oscillations considerably, if the rotor velocity is synchronized with the tower oscillations, the results may be detrimental for wind turbine components. In such instances, the tower may oscillate at a high rate causing mechanical strain and possible damage to the tower. Moreover, such synchronization may amplify the rotor velocity at tower resonance frequency, thereby potentially damaging generators and/or drivetrains connected to the rotor blades. As the amplification of tower oscillations is dependent on the rotor velocity, pitching the rotor to adjust its velocity may prevent amplification of the tower oscillations. Accordingly, by pitching the rotor blades, the pitch controller may control the rotor velocity and prevent amplification of the tower oscillations.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Typically, the pitch controller utilizes two separate control loops for the two functions - controlling the rotor velocity and reducing the tower oscillations. A rotor velocity control loop is employed to determine a pitch angle to control rotor velocity and a tower-damping control loop is used to compute a pitch angle to reduce tower oscillations. Often, these feedback loops operate relatively independently of each other. For example, the rotor velocity control loop may determine the pitch angle based on rotor velocity, wind speed, and current pitch angle. The tower-damping control loop, on the other hand, may determine the pitch angle based on tower deflection, tower top velocity, tower top acceleration, current pitch angle, and wind speed. Because of this independence, the currently available rotor velocity control<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> loops may compute a pitch angle to maintain rotor speed that may disadvantageously induce tower oscillations instead of reducing them. Moreover, these rotor velocity control loops may cause energy amplification in the rotor near tower resonance frequencies. Such amplification may increase oscillations in the tower and increase the fatigue load placed on the wind turbine. Over time, such fatigue loads may reduce the life of wind turbine parts and increase the expenses associated with wind turbines.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, a method for reducing tower oscillations in a wind turbine is presented. The method includes obtaining a rotor velocity. Furthermore, the method includes obtaining one or more parameters associated with a tower of the wind turbine. Further, the method includes determining a modified rotor velocity based on the one or more parameters. Moreover, the method includes determining a first pitch angle based on the modified rotor velocity. In addition, the method includes pitching one or more blades of the wind turbine based on the first pitch angle to reduce the tower oscillations.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure, a pitch control system is presented.

More particularly, the present disclosure relates to an exemplary rotor velocity control loop that uses a pitch control system as an actuator. Moreover, the rotor velocity control loop determines a pitch angle that reduces tower oscillations. To this end, the rotor velocity control loop includes a decoupling unit that addresses the interdependence between rotor dynamics and tower dynamics using model based methods to reduce oscillations induced in the tower fore-aft direction at above rated speeds.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Moreover, embodiments of the present disclosure are described with reference to a land-based three-blade wind turbine. It will be understood, however, that such a reference is merely exemplary and that the systems and methods described here may just as easily be implemented in floating wind turbines, offshore wind turbines, 2-blade wind turbines, or 4-blade wind turbines without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagrammatical representation that illustrates forces and motions experienced by a wind turbine 100. The wind turbine 100 includes a tower 102, a rotor 104, one or more rotor blades 106, and a nacelle 108. The tower 102 may be coupled to the ground, to the ocean floor, or to a floating foundation using any known securing means, such as bolting, cementing, welding, and so on.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Further, in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> reference numeral 110 is generally representative of wind. The wind 110 may have a mean speed (υ). As the wind 110 blows in the indicated direction, an aerodynamic torque (<i>M<sub>z</sub>)</i> is placed on the rotor blades 106 causing the rotor blades 106 to rotate in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the wind direction. This motion of the rotor blades 106 is represented in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> by an angular rotor velocity (ω<i><sub>r</sub></i>) of the rotating blades 106. Further, the nacelle 108 may include a gearbox (not shown) and a generator (not shown). The gearbox may increase the speed of the rotor blades 106 and the generator may convert the rotation of the rotor blades 106 into electricity, thus converting the energy of the wind 110 into electricity. Alternatively, the nacelle 108 may include a direct drivetrain (not shown). In such cases, inclusion of the gearbox may be circumvented.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Moreover, due to an aerodynamic thrust (<i>F<sub>z</sub>)</i> of the wind 110 and the rotation of the rotor blades 106, the tower 102 may oscillate in a fore-aft direction. Reference numeral 114 is generally representative of the fore-aft oscillations. It will be understood that in addition to the fore-aft oscillations 114, the tower 102 may also experience other oscillations. Example oscillations include side-to-side oscillations, torsional oscillations, twisting oscillations, and the like. These oscillations are not illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The wind turbine 100 may employ a sensing device to detect the fore-aft oscillations 114. For example, an oscillation velocity detector (not shown) or an oscillation deflection detector (not shown) may be employed. Alternatively, an accelerometer 112 may be employed in the wind turbine 100 to detect the acceleration of the fore-aft oscillations 114. In some embodiments, the accelerometer 112 may be disposed within the nacelle 108 or at the top of the tower 102. In other instances, the accelerometer 112 may be positioned at the center of the tower 102.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Furthermore, to reduce the fore-aft tower oscillations 114 and to control the rotor velocity, the wind turbine 100 may include an exemplary pitch control system 116 that may include a rotor velocity control loop (not shown). In some embodiments, the pitch control system 116 may also include a tower-damping control loop (not shown). Depending on the mean or effective speed of the incoming wind 110, the exemplary pitch control system 116 may be configured to determine the pitch angle of the rotor blades 106 to maximize output power (within the rated limits) and/or minimize tower oscillations.

The method will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">FIGs. 1-2</figref>. The method begins at step 802 where a rotor velocity of a wind turbine, such as the wind turbine 100, is determined. In one embodiment, the rotor unit 202 may be configured to determine the rotor velocity by directly measuring the rotor velocity using a sensor, such as an anemometer, a speedometer, a rotational velocity meter, and so on. Alternatively, the rotor unit 202 may be configured to determine the rotor velocity by measuring an output power or generator speed of the wind turbine 100.

More particularly, a tower top velocity may be determined. In one embodiment, the tower unit 204 may be configured to determine the tower top velocity based on a tower top acceleration. The accelerometer 112 coupled to the wind turbine 100 may be employed to determine the acceleration of the tower deflections. Based on this detected value, the tower unit 204 may compute the tower top velocity. By way of example, the tower unit 204 may perform an integration operation on the tower top acceleration to determine the tower top velocity. Alternatively, the tower velocity may be determined from available measurements such as tower acceleration using a model-based estimator such as a Kalman filter. In other embodiments, a velocity sensor or a deflection sensor may be installed on the wind turbine 100 to measure the tower top velocity or the tower deflection, respectively. In case the tower deflection is detected, the tower unit 204 may be configured to perform a differentiation operation on the tower deflection to determine the tower top velocity. Furthermore, one or more of the sensors may be coupled to the tower unit 204 such that the measured parameter value may be directly provided to the tower unit 204.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Furthermore, at steps 806 and 808, a modified rotor velocity may be computed. To this end, a first rotor velocity component may be computed, as indicated by step 806. The computing unit 210 may be configured to utilize a linearized model of the rotor dynamics as represented by equation (5) to determine the modified rotor velocity.

The subtracting unit 212 may be a digital computing device or an electric hardware device without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In case of a hardware device, the computing unit 210 may be configured to output an electrical signal corresponding to the first rotor velocity component. Similarly, the rotor unit 202 may convert the rotor velocity into an electrical signal. These signals (i.e., the first rotor velocity component and the rotor velocity) may then be subtracted in the subtracting unit 212. In the case of a digital computing device, the digital values for the rotor velocity and the first rotor velocity component may be provided to the subtracting unit 212 where these may be subtracted to determine the modified rotor velocity.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Subsequently, at step 810, a first pitch angle may be generated based on the modified rotor velocity. The subtracting unit 212 may be configured to communicate the modified rotor velocity to the controller 206. The controller 206, in turn, may be configured to determine the corresponding first pitch angle. As described previously, the controller 206 may be configured to perform this operation by utilizing any one of a number of known technologies. For instance, the controller 206 may include a prepopulated LUT that includes pitch angle values corresponding to various rotor velocities. Alternatively, the controller 206 may be configured to store a determined threshold rotor velocity, such as a rotor velocity that generates rated power output. The controller 206 may subsequently compare the modified rotor velocity with the threshold rotor velocity to generate an error signal. Furthermore, the controller 206 may also include a LUT that stores pitch angles corresponding to various error signals. Accordingly, the controller 206 may be configured to compare the generated error signal with the error signals in the LUT to determine an appropriate first pitch angle. Furthermore, in some wind turbines, the controller 206 may be configured to generate first pitch angle values for the rotor blades 106 individually so that each rotor<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> blade 106 may be pitched at a different angle. In other embodiments, the controller 206 may generate one first pitch angle for all the rotor blades 106.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Following the determination of the first pitch angle, one or more rotor blades 106 may be pitched based on a corresponding first pitch angle, as indicated by step 812.

The pitch actuator 214 may, in turn, be configured to utilize any known actuating means to alter the pitch angle of the blades.

Similar to the method previously described, this method begins at step 902 by determining the rotor velocity. Subsequently, at step 904, one or more parameters associated with the tower 102 may be obtained. The parameters may include tower top velocity and a second pitch angle. In one example, the tower top velocity may be determined at step 906 and the second pitch angle may be determined at step 908. To this end, the pitch control system 500 may include the tower-damping unit 508. The tower-damping unit 508 may be configured to determine the second pitch angle based on a linear model of tower dynamics and the tower top velocity. As described previously with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>, the tower-damping unit 508 may be configured to determine the thrust required to reduce the oscillations and determine the second pitch angle that may aid in generating the desired thrust.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Once the second pitch angle is computed, a modified rotor velocity may be determined at step 910. To compute the modified rotor velocity, it may be desirable to obtain the first and second rotor velocity components. Accordingly, the first and second components of rotor velocity are computed, as indicated by step 912. In one embodiment, for this computation, the computing unit 514 may be configured to utilize the linearized model of rotor dynamics provided by equation (6). Using this equation, the computing unit 514 may be configured to determine a combination of the first and second rotor velocity components (ω̂<i><sub>rc</sub></i>). In this model, the computing<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> unit 514 may be configured to employ the values of the tower top velocity and the second pitch angle to determine the first and second components of rotor velocity. Subsequently, at step 914, the first and second components of rotor velocity are subtracted from the rotor velocity obtained at step 902 to determine the modified rotor velocity. In one embodiment, the combination of the first and second rotor velocity components (ω̂<i><sub>rc</sub></i>) may be subtracted from the rotor velocity to determine the modified rotor velocity.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Furthermore, at step 916, a first pitch angle may be generated based on the modified rotor velocity. More particularly, the modified rotor velocity may be communicated to the controller 206 and the controller 206 may be configured to generate the first pitch angle. The first pitch angle and the second pitch angle may be combined in the adder 512 to generate a combined pitch angle, as indicated by step 918. This combined pitch angle may be transmitted to the pitch actuator 214. At step 920, the pitch actuator 518 may be configured to pitch the rotor blades 106 (individually or together) to obtain a desired rotor velocity and to reduce tower oscillations.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">It will be understood that the methods of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIGs. 8</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">9</figref> may be repeated continuously, periodically, or at determined intervals of time to maintain the desired rotor velocity and/or minimize tower oscillations. In case of high turbulence or very high speeds, these methods may not be sufficient to maintain the rotor velocity and/or the tower oscillations within threshold limits. In such cases, the pitch control system 116 may also be configured to power off or shut down the wind turbine 100 until the turbulent conditions pass. Such a measure may be taken to prevent damage to the wind turbine 100.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Furthermore, although the systems and methods described hereinabove decouple rotor and tower dynamics to reduce fore-aft tower oscillations and maintain effective rotor velocity, these systems may be utilized to decouple other wind turbine dynamics as well.

Moreover, linear analysis reveals that the interdependence between the rotor dynamics and the tower dynamics results in unstable rotor dynamics. The exemplary rotor velocity loop of the pitch control system of the present disclosure effectively reduces/eliminates the effects of the tower dynamics on the rotor dynamics and therefore reduces energy amplification in the rotor at tower resonance.
