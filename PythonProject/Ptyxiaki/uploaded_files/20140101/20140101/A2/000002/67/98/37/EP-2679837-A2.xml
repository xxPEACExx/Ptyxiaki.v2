A flange 16 is integrally connected to body 12 and extends perpendicular to a longitudinal axis 18 of body 12. A wave-shaped washer 20 is integrally connected to flange 16. Wave-shaped washer 20 has multiple valleys 22 interposed between oppositely directed peaks 24. The peaks 24 define the closest points of approach of wave-shaped washer 20 with respect to flange 16 in a manufactured condition of fastener 10, as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. Fastener 10 can be made using an injection molding operation, and all the components are initially integrally connected and are homogeneous in that the same material and material properties exist throughout fastener 10.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">2B</figref>, and again to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, multiple frangible connectors 26 are integrally connected at a first end 25 to a lower surface 28 of flange 16. Each of the frangible connectors 26 is triangular shaped and includes a first side 30, which according to several aspects is oriented substantially perpendicular to flange 16, and a second side 32, angularly oriented with respect to flange 16 and first side 30. The first end 25 defines a maximum thickness Tmax of the frangible connectors 26, and an opposite end or<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> connecting tip 33 of each of the frangible connectors 26 defines a minimum thickness Tmin, such connecting tips 33 represent a film thickness substantially defining a point connection between frangible connector 26 and peak 24. Connecting tips 33 extend for an entire width "W" of the frangible connectors 26 connecting each frangible connector 26 to one of the peaks 24 of wave-shaped washer 20. The provision of the minimum thickness Tmin at connecting tip 33 induces fracture to occur along a fracture line 27 defined at the junction of connecting tip 33 and peak 24, thereby minimizing a force required to fracture the frangible connector 26 at connecting tip 33 from peak 24.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The second side 32 is oriented at an obtuse angle α with respect to lower surface 28 and extends to the connecting tip 33. The second side 32 is therefore also oriented at an acute angle β with respect to an upper face 56 of peak 24. As flange 16 and body 12 co-rotate with respect to wave-shaped washer 20 during installation of fastener 10 in a rotational direction "R", the minimum thickness Tmin at connecting tip 33 induces fracture of frangible connectors 26 at the connecting tip 33. The angular orientation of second side 32 orients second side 32 to angularly face or be directed toward the peaks 24 of wave-shaped washer 20 such that the second sides 32 of the frangible connectors 26 contact and slide along wave-shaped washer 20 after frangible connectors 26 fracture and during subsequent application of installation torque to fastener 10. The angular facing second sides 32 reduce rotating friction between the frangible connectors 26 and wave-shaped washer 20 after they fracture and when body 12 is axially rotated. According to further aspects, to further enhance<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the bending of frangible connectors 26 prior to and after fracture of connecting tip 33, first side 30 can also be oriented at an acute angle with respect to flange 16, represented as first side 30' in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 2B</figref>. As evident in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 2B</figref>, the acute angle of first side 30' will also act to reduce the maximum thickness Tmax and promote bending of the frangible connectors 26 after fracture of the connecting tips 33.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The frangible connectors 26 are also oriented such that the fracture line 27 defined by the line of contact between connecting tip 33 and peak 24 extends both substantially transverse to and radially outward with respect to the longitudinal axis 18. This presents a minimum connection thickness of frangible connectors 26 in an orientation that further minimizes the resistance to bending/fracture of the frangible connectors 26 at connecting tip 33 as body 12 is axially rotated in direction "R" with respect to longitudinal axis 18, at the same time that wave-shaped washer 20 contacts an object such as a heat shield (shown and described in reference to <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4</figref>). The resistance to axial rotation as wave-shaped washer 20 frictionally contacts the object thereafter provides resistance to further rotation of body 12, which produces the force necessary to fracture frangible connectors 26 at the connecting tips 33. During this axial rotational motion of body 12, the frangible connectors 26 are subject to bending and shear forces acting in a force direction "C" perpendicular to fracture line 27, which act to break the frangible connectors 26 at connecting tip 33, with the angled second side 32 positioned in an orientation to thereafter slidingly contact the wave-shaped washer 20. This allows the body 12 to more freely axially<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> rotate with respect to wave-shaped washer 20 during subsequent compression of wave-shaped washer 20.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 3</figref> and again to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figures 1-2</figref>, a through-bore 34 of body 12 has an entrance cavity 36 leading into an internally threaded portion 38. The frangible connectors 26 initially provide a clearance gap 40 between the flange 16 and the peaks 24 of wave-shaped washer 20. Although wave-shaped washer 20 is shown having a diameter substantially equal to a diameter of flange 16, the diameter of wave-shaped washer 20 can be larger or smaller than the diameter of flange 16.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4</figref> and again to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">Figures 1-3</figref>, in a partially installed condition of fastener 10, a weld-stud 42 is shown fixed to a body panel 44 of a vehicle. Weld-stud 42 extends upwardly through an aperture 46 created in a heat shield 48 which abuts the body panel 44. External threads 50 of weld-stud 42 threadably engage with internal threads 52 created in the threaded portion 38 of body 12. Wave-shaped washer 20 is brought into contact with heat shield 48 in the partially installed condition by axial rotation of fastener 10. At this time, the clearance gap 40 is provided between an upper face 56 of each of the peaks 24 and the lower surface 28 of flange 16, and a spacing or distance between the peaks 24 and valleys 22 defines a distance "D". Initially, the clearance gap 40 is present until subsequent axial rotation of body 12 about longitudinal axis 18 causes fracture of each frangible connector 26 at a fracture location 54 also defining the fracture line 27, as the wave-shaped washer 20<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> frictionally engages the heat shield 48. Contact of wave-shaped washer 20 with heat shield 48 thereafter resists rotation of wave-shaped washer 20.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 5</figref> and again to <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4</figref>, a completed installation of fastener 10 is presented. Friction between wave-shaped washer 20 and heat shield 48 inhibits axial rotation of wave-shaped washer 20 after the position of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4</figref> is reached. The frangible connectors 26 therefore fracture, and subsequent axial rotation of body 12 from the position shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4</figref> brings lower surface 28 of flange 16 into direct contact with upper face 56 of each of the peaks 24. The fractured frangible connectors 26 deflect and flatten during this period. Continued rotation of body 12 until a predetermined installation torque value is achieved first compresses and/or crushes the deflected frangible connectors 26 and then acts to compress wave-shaped washer 20. Although some thickness of the frangible connectors 26 may remain, the clearance gap 40 is reduced substantially to a dimension approaching zero.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Compression of wave-shaped washer 20 collapses the peaks 24 and valleys 22, reducing the distance "D" to a thickness "E" which corresponds to a nominal thickness of wave-shaped washer 20. The material of wave-shaped washer 20 when compressed elastically seeks to return peaks 24 and valleys 22, therefore compressing wave-shaped washer 20 from distance "D" to thickness "E" creates a biasing force "F" acting upwardly as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 5</figref> and co-axial with longitudinal axis 18 against the threads 50 of weld-stud 42. The biasing force "F" is a function in part of the amount of deflection of the material of wave-shaped washer 20, and acts to resist rotation/release of<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> fastener 10 from the installed position shown. In the installed position shown, the weld-stud 42 can extend outwardly with respect to body 12.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 6</figref>, a torque vs. torque angle degree graph 58 compares various nut/washer combinations of materials for an applied torque 60 and a resulting torque angle 62 in degrees. A combination of a standard M6 fastener with a washer of metal exhibited the second highest slope of change from an initiation of washer contact to maximum torque required for seating. A combination 68 of a standard M6 fastener of metal with a metal wave washer exhibited the highest slope of change from an initiation of washer contact to maximum torque required for seating. A PEEK material fastener 70 with no washer exhibited a similar slope of change from an initiation of washer contact to maximum torque required for seating compared to combinations 66, 68. A combination 72 of a metal fastener with a PEEK wave washer provided an improved slope of change from an initiation of washer contact to maximum torque required for seating, compared to combinations 66, 68 and 70. A combination 74 having a PEEK fastener with a PEEK wave washer provided the greatest distribution of torque angle per value of applied torque compared to the combinations 66, 68, 70, 72, indicating a PEEK fastener and PEEK wave washer similar to fastener 10 improves the distribution of torque over a wider range of torque angles, which reduces the friction load applied to the heat shield before the maximum desired seating torque is achieved.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 7</figref>, a torque vs. torque angle degree graph 74 compares various nut/washer combinations of materials for a torque 76 required<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> to remove a fastener and a resulting torque angle 78 in degrees. A combination 80 of a standard M6 fastener with a washer of metal exhibited the most rapid drop-off slope from an initiation of fastener release to minimum torque during fastener removal. A combination 82 of a standard M6 fastener of metal with a metal wave washer exhibited a similar slope of change compared to combination 80. A PEEK material fastener 84 with no washer exhibited the second lowest initiation torque level to initiate fastener removal and substantially no difference from the onset of fastener release to full release compared to combinations 80, 82. A combination 86 of a metal fastener with a PEEK wave washer performed the most poorly, compared to combinations 66, 68 and 70. A combination 88 of a PEEK fastener with a PEEK wave washer similar to fastener 10 did not provide the high onset torque values of metal fasteners, which is anticipated, however combination 88 provided an initially higher initiation removal torque compared to combinations 84, 86, and also provided an improved distribution of torque angle per value of torque over the entire range of motion compared to any of the combinations 80, 82, 84, 86. This indicates a PEEK fastener and PEEK wave-shaped washer similar to fastener 10 can improve the resistance to fastener release over a wider range of torque angles, inhibiting release of fastener 10.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 8</figref> and again to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">2B</figref>, an orientation of an exemplary one of the frangible connectors 26 is shown after fracture at connecting tip 33 and as second side 32 slides with respect to upper face 56 of peak 24. Because of their minimal thickness Tmin and due to sliding motion along second side 32, the fractured end of connecting tips 33 are not<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> intended to bite into the material of upper face 56 of the peaks 24. In lieu of acting as bite members after fracture, frangible connectors 26 are substantially compressed by application of full installation torque to body 12, and therefore do not provide substantial resistance to release of body 12. Thickness Tmin is therefore selected to provide a minimum retention capability to retain wave-shaped washer 20 in contact with flange 16 until use/installation of fastener 10.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0010">Figures 9A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0011">9B</figref>, according to further aspects, a high heat fastener 90 includes a wave-shaped washer 92 modified from wave-shaped washer 20 to further include a plurality of serrations 94 extending away from an outward facing surface 96. The serrations 94 are similar in geometry to frangible connectors 26. Each of the serrations 94 includes a free end 98 defining a sharp corner due to a triangular shape of the serrations 94. A first side 100 of each of the serrations 94 is oriented substantially co-axial with respect to an axis 102 oriented substantially transverse to a plane defined by the junction of the first side 100 of each serration 94 with outward facing surface 96. A second side 104 of each of the serrations 94 is oriented at an acute angle γ (gamma) with respect to axis 102. The serrations are angularly oriented to limit resistance during installation of wave-shaped washer 92 in a clockwise installation rotational direction of high heat fastener 90, but resist release in an opposite or a counter clockwise release direction.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">According to several embodiments, a material for fastener 10 can be PEEK (polyetherether ketone), which provides elevated operating temperatures in a range necessary for application with a heat shield, such as a<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> heat shield positioned proximate to an automobile vehicle catalytic converter.

The fastener wave-shaped washer 20 partially deflects to absorb the installation torque which creates a biasing force acting to resist loosening of the fastener, and includes triangular shaped frangible connectors that fracture or break at a narrow thickness connecting end and are angularly oriented permitting the body to rotate freely with respect to the wave-shaped washer during installation to mitigate against the wave-shaped washer rotating against the heat shield.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough, and will fully convey the scope to those who are skilled in the art.
