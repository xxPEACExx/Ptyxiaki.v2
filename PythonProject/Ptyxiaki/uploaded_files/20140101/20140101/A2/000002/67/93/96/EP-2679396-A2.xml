In such paper, even when a pigment ink is applied to the paper, the pigment particles penetrate into the cracks and do not remain on the surface of the recording medium, and the gloss of an image is therefore not reduced.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Investigations by the present inventors, however, demonstrate that images recorded on recording media-having surface roughness as described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2000355160A"><text>2000-355160</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2001347748A"><text>2001-347748</text></patcit> have metallic glossiness-like glare or cause bronzing in which reflected light alters the appearance of colors of coloring materials depending on viewing angle of the recorded matter.

The present inventors have investigated the cause of bronzing that occurs when luster paper is used.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Luster paper is a recording medium having many concave portions on the surface. If an ink is applied to such-a recording medium, the ink tends to remain in the concave portions of the recording medium. It is believed that the ink is dried and fixed in such a state to cause localization of the coloring material in the concave portions of the recording medium and thereby to readily cause occurrence of bronzing.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Investigations by the present inventors demonstrate that if the recording medium has a surface of which arithmetic mean roughness in accordance with JIS B 0601:2001 is 0.8 µm or more, a desired luster surface is<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> provided, but bronzing tends to occur by the mechanism described above. Accordingly, various investigations have been done for obtaining luster paper that can sufficiently prevent bronzing even if the arithmetic mean roughness is 0.8 µm or more.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The present inventors have investigated methods of enhancing the ink absorbability of a recording medium by a structure that blocks the mechanism of causing bronzing and prevents inks from remaining in the concave portions on the surface of the recording medium. As a result, the inventors have concluded that it is important that the recording medium has an ink receiving layer containing inorganic particles and that the recording medium has a surface provided with a plurality of openings having a specific size.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In a recording medium having an ink receiving layer containing inorganic particles, the apertures formed by the inorganic particles in the ink receiving layer absorb the ink applied to the recording medium to prevent the ink from remaining in the concave portions on the surface of the recording medium. Furthermore, since the surface of the recording medium has the openings having a specific size, the ink flows into the ink receiving layer<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> through the openings of the concave portions on the surface of the recording medium to further accelerate the absorption of the ink by the apertures formed by the inorganic particles. It is believed that the ink is prevented from remaining in the concave portions on the surface of the recording medium as described above to prevent bronzing of the image. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> shows a photograph of the surface of a recording medium of the present invention observed with a laser microscope VK-9710 (manufactured by Keyence Corporation). The cracks shown in the photograph are the openings in the present invention.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Further investigations by the present inventors have revealed that the openings provided to the surface of the recording medium need to have a width of 30 µm or less and a length of 500 µm or less and that the necessary number of the openings is 5 or more and 30 or less per 1 mm<sup>2</sup> of the surface of the recording medium. The number of the opening is preferably 10 or more and 30 or less per 1 mm<sup>2</sup> of the surface. In the present invention, the terms "length of an opening" and "width of an opening" are defined as follows. In the present invention, the term "length of an opening" refers to the length of the longest straight line connecting arbitrary two points on the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> outline of the opening (L in each of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 2A to 2C</figref>). The term "width of an opening" refers to the diameter of the largest circle inscribed to the opening (W in each of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 2A to 2C</figref>).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the present invention, the widths and the lengths of the openings and the number of the openings per 1 mm<sup>2</sup> are derived by observing the surface of the recording medium with an electron microscope. Specifically, a recording medium surface is observed at a magnification of 200 with a laser microscope VK-9710 (manufactured by Keyence Corporation). An arbitrary square region of 1 mm x 1 mm is determined in the surface of a recording medium. The widths and the lengths of all openings contained in the region are derived according to the above-described definition, and then the openings having a width of 30 µm or less and a length of 500 µm or less is counted. The opening existing at the boundary of the region of 1 mm x 1 mm is counted as being contained in the region. This process is carried out for different ten regions, and average value of the numbers of openings having a width of 30 µm or less and a length of 500 µm or less is calculated as the "number of openings having a width of 30 µm or less and a length of 500 µm or less per 1 mm<sup>2</sup> of the surface of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> a recording medium". In also examples described below, the widths and the lengths of openings and the number of openings per 1 mm<sup>2</sup> were determined by the same method.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Though the surface may have openings having a width of larger than 30 µm or openings having a length of larger than 500 µm, such openings increase the ink absorbability to reduce the optical density of an image formed thereon. Accordingly, the number of such openings should be low. In the present invention, the number of openings having a width of larger than 30 µm and openings having a length of larger than 500 µm should be 20% or less to the number of openings having a width of 30 µm or less and a length of 500 µm or less per 1 mm<sup>2</sup> of the surface of a recording medium.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">If the number of openings having a width of 30 µm or less and a length of 500 µm or less is less than 5 per 1 mm<sup>2</sup> of the surface of a recording medium, the effect of preventing bronzing is insufficient.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">If the number of openings having a width of 30 µm or less and a length of 500 µm or less is larger than 30 per 1 mm<sup>2</sup> of the surface of a recording medium, the openings are visible to the naked eye in some cases, resulting in loss of the high-grade texture as luster paper.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> In addition, such a surface has high ink absorbability to reduce the optical density of images.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to the mechanism described above, the effect of the present invention is achieved by synergistic effects of each composition.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the present invention, whether a recording medium has a luster surface or not is determined by the following method. The surface of a recording medium is irradiated with incident light at an incident angle of 60 degrees from the vertical direction, and L<sup>*</sup> value (L<sup>*</sup><sub>1</sub>) of reflection light at a light receiving angle of 60 degrees from the vertical direction and L<sup>*</sup> value (L<sup>*</sup><sub>2</sub>) of reflection light at a light receiving angle of 67 degrees were measured with a three-dimensional goniophotometer GCMS-3B (manufactured by Murakami Color Research Laboratory). The ratio of L<sup>*</sup><sub>2</sub> to L<sup>*</sup><sub>1</sub> (L<sup>*</sup><sub>2</sub>/L<sup>*</sup><sub>1</sub>) was calculated. Investigations by the present inventors demonstrate that the value of L<sup>*</sup><sub>2</sub>/L<sup>*</sup><sub>1</sub> correlates to the texture of the surface of a recording medium and that a ratio L<sup>*</sup><sub>2</sub>/L<sup>*</sup><sub>1</sub> of 0.3 or more provides a desired luster surface. Accordingly, in the present invention, a recording medium of which surface has a ratio L<sup>*</sup><sub>2</sub>/L<sup>*</sup><sub>1</sub> of 0.3 or more is determined to have a luster surface.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><heading id="h0007">Recording medium</heading><p id="p0024" num="0024">The recording medium of the present invention includes a base and an ink receiving layer. The present invention can be applied to a recording medium that is used in ink jet recording.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The recording medium of the present invention has a surface having an arithmetic mean roughness of 0.8 µm or more in accordance with JIS B 0601:2001. The arithmetic mean roughness of the surface of the recording medium is preferably 2.5 µm or less and more preferably 1.0 µm or more and 2.0 µm or less. The arithmetic mean roughness of the surface of a recording medium can be controlled by, for example, a method pressing a roll having specific asperities to the surface of a base coated with a polyolefin resin and further applying a coating solution for ink receiving layer to the surface or a method pressing a roll having specific asperities to the surface of a recording medium. Each member constituting the recording medium of the present invention will now be described. Base</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The base may be composed of base paper only or may be composed of base paper and a resin layer, i.e., base paper coated with a resin. In the present invention, a<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> base composed of base paper and a resin layer can be used. Such a structure in which a resin coats base paper can decrease penetration of water in an ink into the base and can inhibit cockling. The resin layer may be provided to only one surface of the base paper or may be provided to both surfaces of the base paper, but the surface on the ink receiving layer side of the base should be coated with the resin.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The base paper is produced by papermaking of wood pulp as the main raw material and, optionally, synthetic pulp such as polypropylene and synthetic fibers such as nylon or polyester fibers. Examples of the wood pulp include broadleaf tree bleached kraft pulp (LBKP), broadleaf tree bleached sulfite pulp (LBSP), needle-leaf bleached kraft pulp (NBKP), needle-leaf bleached sulfite pulp (NBSP), broadleaf dissolving pulp (LDP), needle-leaf dissolving pulp (NDP), broadleaf unbleached kraft pulp (LUKP), and needle-leaf unbleached kraft pulp (NUKP). These may be used alone or in combination as necessary. In particular, among these wood pulp, LBKP, NBSP, LBSP, NDP, and LDP, which contain short fiber components in large amounts, can be particularly used.
