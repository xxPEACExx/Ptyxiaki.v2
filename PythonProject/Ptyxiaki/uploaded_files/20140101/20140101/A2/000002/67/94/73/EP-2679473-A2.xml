The energy absorbing structure may further comprise a processor-controlled valve capable of allowing pressurized fluid to pass to the hydraulic piston/cylinder unit and the ride accumulator.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In another embodiment, the valve may comprise a first processor-controlled valve. In this embodiment, the energy absorbing structure may further comprise a second processor-controlled valve, a height adjust accumulator, a third processor-controlled valve and a processor for controlling the first, second and third valves.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The processor may cause the first valve to be in a first position such that the first valve is closed when an operator enters or exits a rider compartment. The processor may move the first valve to a second position when the vehicle is in motion so as to open the first valve to allow the floorboard to move relative to the frame.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The processor may effect a floorboard height adjustment operation when the floorboard is spaced from a neutral position after an operator has stepped onto the floorboard.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The processor may move the second valve to a closed state when a floorboard height adjustment operation is not being effected. The processor may also move the second valve to an open state so as to allow pressurized air within the ride accumulator to be released when the floorboard is to be lowered to the neutral position.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The processor may move the third valve to a second position so as to allow pressurized fluid to enter the height adjust accumulator and subsequently move the second valve to its open state when the floorboard is to be raised to the neutral position.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">All embodiments may include upper and lower endstops to confine floorboard movement between upper and lower stop positions. The endstops may be generally elastic in nature and made of natural rubber, urethane or silicone type materials, and designed with linear or non-linear spring rates and damping characteristics to optimize ride comfort when the floorboard is in contact with the endstops.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0025" num="0025"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.

The disturbances may result from the truck 10 passing over a continuously uneven surface, or moving over large bumps or sharp drops in the surface. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, the energy absorbing structure 120 comprises a mast assembly 130, first and second tension springs 140 and 142, a damper 144, and spring preload adjusting structure 150.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3 and 4</figref>, the mast assembly 130 includes a first element 132, a channel 132A in the illustrated embodiment, which is fixedly coupled, such as by welds, to the frame 14 of the truck main body 12. The mast assembly 130 further comprises a second element 134, a carriage assembly 134A in the illustrated embodiment, capable of vertical movement within the channel 132A. The carriage assembly 134A comprises a main body 136 having front load bearings 136A and side load bearings 136B, which allow the main body 136 to move vertically within the channel 132A, see <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3 and 4</figref>. The carriage assembly 134A further comprises a floorboard support 136C, which is fixedly coupled, such as by welds, to the main body 136 for movement with the main body 136. The floorboard support 136C is positioned beneath the floorboard 110 and supports the floorboard 110 within the rider compartment 30. The floorboard support 136C functions as the sole support for the floorboard 110; hence, the floorboard 110 is suspended in the rider compartment 30 on the support 136C and moves vertically with the floorboard support 136C and the main body 136.

It is also contemplated that the spring first ends 140A and 142A may be releasably coupled to the floorboard 110 such as by extending through openings (not shown) in the floorboard 110.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The damper 144 may comprise a piston rod 144A coupled via a pin 145 to a bracket 110C fixedly coupled to the floorboard 110. A cylinder 144B of the damper 144 is coupled to a U-shaped bracket 138 via a bolt 138A and coupling plate 138D. The U-shaped bracket 138 is fixed to the channel 132A, which, as noted above, is fixed to the truck main body frame 14. The cylinder 144B may contain a piston/valve assembly (not shown) coupled to the piston rod 144A for movement with the piston rod 144A and a separator piston (not shown) free floating within the cylinder 144B. A fluid such as oil is provided on both sides of the piston/valve assembly, while the separator piston is exposed to the oil on one side and exposed to a gas, e.g., air, on its other side. In the illustrated embodiment, the damper 144 generates damping action that is different for compression and extension. The damper 144 generates the damping action by creating a differential pressure across the piston/valve assembly that is proportional to the damping force. The rate of fluid flow through compression and extension orifices in the piston/valve assembly is proportional to the compression and extension velocities. When the piston rod 144A moves inward (compression), which occurs when the springs 140, 142 retract for a hole, as discussed below, a quantity of fluid corresponding to the differential volume created is pushed through a compression orifice in the piston/valve assembly in a first direction to an opposing side of the piston of the piston/valve assembly. When the piston rod 144A moves out (extension), which occurs when the springs 140, 142 extend for a bump, as discussed below, a quantity of fluid moves through an extension orifice in the piston/valve assembly in a second direction opposite to the first direction to an opposing side of the piston of the piston/valve assembly. Check type valves are used in the compression and extension orifices to direct the fluid through the appropriate orifice and in the appropriate direction. The compression and extension orifices are different in size to provide different damping characteristics in compression and extension. The damper 144 may comprise a damper commercially available from Stabilus (Germany) under the product designation Stab-O-Shoc. From mathematical calculations, it is believed that the damper 144 should have a linear damping rate of 4-10 pounds-second/inch for compression, 10-20 pounds-second/inch for extension, and a stroke length between about 1 inch to about 5 inches and preferably about 2 inches. Other damping characteristics such as variable damping characteristics could be used to provide other desirable damper responses.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The springs 140 and 142 function to absorb at least a portion of energy resulting from disturbances encountered by the truck 10 as it moves along a floor surface. The springs 140 and 142 extend (for a bump) and retract (for a hole) in response to receiving kinetic energy and, as such, store the kinetic energy as potential energy. The damper 144 functions to absorb the energy released from the springs 140 and 142 as the springs 140 and 142 return to an initial position following extension or retraction, i.e., the damper 144 converts the kinetic energy into heat. The damper 144 further performs a damping function as the springs 140 and 142 are extended or retracted.

The mounting bracket 154 supports a motor 156, which functions to turn a screw 156A. The screw 156A passes through a threaded bore in a back plate 152A of the movable bracket 152. By actuating the motor 156 to rotate the screw 156A in either a first rotational direction or a second rotational direction opposite to the first direction, the movable bracket 152 is caused to move vertically away from or toward the U-shaped bracket 138. When the bracket 152 moves away from the bracket 138 and toward the motor 156, the first and second springs 140 and 142 are extended, i.e., lengthened, so as to increase a preload on each spring 140, 142. When the bracket 152 is moved in a direction toward the bracket 138 and away from the motor 156, the preload on the springs 140 and 142 is reduced.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">An upper stop 138B is fixedly coupled to the U-shaped bracket 138 so as to limit upward movement of the carriage assembly 134A. One or more lower stops (not shown) are fixed to a lower surface 110D of the floorboard 110 to limit downward movement of the floorboard 110 relative to a base (not shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>) of the frame 14, i.e., the lower stops engage the base of the truck main body frame 14 to prevent further downward movement of the floorboard 10 and the carriage assembly 134A. The upper and lower stops are generally elastic in nature and designed to minimize shock transmission while the floorboard 110 is in contact with the stops. The upper and lower stops may be made of natural rubber, urethane, silicone or other like elastomeric type material. The stops in a preferred embodiment provide a force deflection characteristic, i.e., they deflect by x amount when a force F is applied against the stop, as described by the following polynomial equation: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">F</mi><mo>=</mo><mo>-</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">27.88</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi mathvariant="normal">x</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">3</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">251</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi mathvariant="normal">x</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">86.7</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">x</mi></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="56" he="8" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>

In the illustrated embodiment, the "neutral position" is equal to a predefined position falling within a range equal to ± 15% of a centered position. That is, the neutral position is a predefined position which may comprise a midway position between the upper and lower stop positions or may be defined by another position falling within the range of ± 15% of the midway or centered position. The maximum distance that the floorboard 110 moves between its upper and lower stop positions may be from about 1 inch to about 5 inches and preferably is about 2 inches.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">When a light-weight operator is positioned on the floorboard 110, the floorboard 110 may be spaced from the neutral position toward the upper stop 138B. Conversely, when a heavy-weight operator is positioned on the floorboard 110, the floorboard 110 may be spaced from the neutral position toward the base of the frame 14. So as to allow the floorboard 110 to be located at the neutral position subsequent to an operator stepping onto the floorboard 110, the motor 156 is driven to cause the screw 156A to rotate in an appropriate direction to vary the preload on the springs 140 and 142 such that the floorboard 110 is repositioned to its neutral position.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">It is contemplated that switches (not shown) or other position sensing type devices may be provided to sense during a floorboard height adjustment operation when the floorboard 110 is away from its neutral position such that appropriate signals are generated by the switches to a processor which causes the motor 156 to drive the screw 156A in an appropriate direction to effect movement of the floorboard 110 to its neutral position. It is contemplated that the processor may effect a floorboard height adjustment operation so as to move the floorboard to its neutral position just after an operator enters the operator's compartment 30 and activates the presence sensor 40. Alternatively, an operator may manually actuate one or more switches (not shown) to drive the motor 156 in an appropriate direction so as to cause the floorboard 110 to be moved to a neutral position, which position may be indicated visually to the operator when the floorboard 110 is aligned with an alignment mark (not shown) provided on a wall of the frame 14. It is believed that the floorboard 110 may accommodate an operator having a weight that falls within a substantially broad range, e.g., from about 100 pounds to about 300 pounds, and yet still be located in the neutral position by varying the preload on the springs 140 and 142.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">It is preferred that the operator support assembly 100 have a natural frequency between about 1.5 and about 2.5 Hz.

It is believed that the energy absorbing structure 120 coupled to the floorboard 110 supporting an operator having a weight between about 100 pounds and 300 pounds and capable of achieving these two objectives may comprise first and second springs 240 and 242 having a relaxed length (prior to being coupled to the floorboard 110 and the movable adjustment bracket 152) of from about 6 inches to about 12 inches, and a spring rate of from about 25 pounds/inch to about 200 pounds/inch.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">It is noted that the energy absorbing structure 120 is small in size so as to allow the structure 120 to be easily housed or located behind a rider compartment interior wall 14A of the main body frame 14, see <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, where the wall 14A is broken away to allow the structure 120 to be seen.

Pressurized hydraulic fluid HF entering the accumulator 762 causes the pressure of the air within the upper portion 762B of the accumulator 762 to increase.

The stops in a preferred embodiment provide a force deflection characteristic, i.e., they deflect by x amount when a force F is applied against the stop, as described by the following polynomial equation: <maths id="math0006" num=""><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">F</mi><mo>=</mo><mo>-</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">27.88</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi mathvariant="normal">x</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">3</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">251</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi mathvariant="normal">x</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">86.7</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">x</mi></math><img id="ib0006" file="imgb0006.tif" wi="55" he="8" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>

In the illustrated embodiment, the "neutral position" is equal to a predefined position falling within a range equal to ± 15% of a centered position.</p><p id="p0120" num="0120">When a light-weight operator steps onto the floorboard 110, the floorboard 110 may move so as to be spaced from the neutral position toward the upper stop. Conversely, when a heavy-weight operator steps onto the floorboard 110, the floorboard 110 may move so as to be spaced from the neutral position toward the base of the frame 14. To allow the floorboard 110 to be moved to its neutral position after an operator steps onto the floorboard 110, the processor 880 effects a floorboard height adjustment operation. Such an operation is effected in the illustrated embodiment just after an operator, standing on the floorboard 110, selects a direction of travel for the truck, i.e., when power is provided to the first and second driven wheels. Alternatively, a floorboard height adjustment operation may be effected just after an operator enters the operator's compartment and activates the presence sensor 40.</p><p id="p0121" num="0121">A sensor 744, such as a conventional linear position sensor, fixed to the main body frame 14, may be provided to detect when the floorboard 110 is spaced from its predefined neutral position. Alternatively, switches, such as conventional microswitches, may be provided to sense<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> when the floorboard 110 has moved away from its neutral position. As will be discussed further below, the processor 880, when effecting a floorboard height adjustment operation, controls the operation of the two-way normally closed poppet type valve 832 and the 2 position 3-way solenoid valve 770 to move the floorboard 110 to its neutral position. It is believed that the floorboard 110 may accommodate an operator having a weight that falls within a substantially broad range, e.g., from about 100 pounds to about 300 pounds, and yet still be moved to its neutral position after the operator steps onto the floorboard 110 and the floorboard 110 is unlocked.</p><p id="p0122" num="0122">When the processor 880 determines during a floorboard height adjustment operation, based on signals generated by the sensor 744, that the floorboard 110 needs to be moved upward relative to the truck main body frame 14, the processor 880 causes pressurized fluid HF to be added to the lower portion 660A of the accumulator 660 and the cylinder second portion 642C. When the processor 880 determines during a floorboard height adjustment operation, based on signals generated by the sensor 744, that the floorboard 110 needs to be moved downward relative to the truck main body frame 14, the processor 880 causes pressurized fluid HF to be released from the accumulator lower portion 660A and the cylinder second portion 642C. Apparatus and process steps for adding pressurized fluid to or releasing pressurized fluid HF from the accumulator 660 will now be discussed.</p><p id="p0123" num="0123">When the processor 880 is not effecting a floorboard height adjustment operation, it maintains the 2 position 3-way solenoid valve 770 in a first position to allow hydraulic fluid to pass through the valve 770 to a hydraulic fluid reservoir 784.</p><p id="p0124" num="0124">When the processor 880 determines during a floorboard height adjustment operation, based on signals generated by the sensor 744, that the floorboard 110 needs to be moved upward relative to the truck main body frame 14, the processor 880 causes the 2 position 3-way solenoid valve 770 to move to its second position. When in its second position, the valve 770 allows hydraulic fluid HF provided by a source of pressurized hydraulic fluid 782, such as a hydraulic pump, to pass through the valve 770. The pressurized hydraulic fluid HF also passes through the valve 832 and enters into the lower portion 660A of the accumulator 660 as well as the cylinder 642. The increased fluid quantity in the cylinder 642 causes the floorboard 110 to move upward relative to the truck main body frame 14. Once the floorboard 110 is raised to its neutral position, as sensed by the sensor 744, the processor 880 causes the valve 770 to return to its first position such that pressurized fluid is no longer provided to the accumulator 660 and the cylinder 642. The normally closed valve 832 is not actuated by the processor 880 when the floorboard 110 is<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> being raised. When the valve 832 is not actuated, i.e., in its normally closed state, the valve 832 only allows pressurized fluid to pass through it and enter the accumulator 660 but does not allow pressurized fluid to exit the accumulator 660.</p><p id="p0125" num="0125">The orifice 834 limits the rate at which pressurized hydraulic fluid HF moves into the lower portion 660A of the accumulator 660 and the cylinder 642. By restricting the flow of fluid through the orifice 834, the rate at which the floorboard 110 is raised is limited to an acceptable value.</p><p id="p0126" num="0126">When the processor 880 determines during a floorboard height adjustment operation, based on signals generated by the sensor 744, that the floorboard 110 needs to be moved downward relative to the truck main body frame 14, the processor 880 moves the normally closed valve 832 to its opened state, i.e., the valve 832 is actuated. The valve 832 is only actuated when the floorboard 110 is being lowered. Hence, during all other times, including normal operation of the truck, the valve 832 remains in its normally closed state. The processor 880 does not change the position of the valve 770 when the floorboard 110 is lowered, i.e., the valve 770 remains in its first position. Once the valve 832 is moved to its opened state, pressurized fluid is released from the lower portion 660A of the accumulator 660 and the cylinder 642, thereby reducing the fluid quantity in the cylinder 642. The reduced fluid quantity in the cylinder 642 causes the floorboard 110 to move downward relative to the truck main body frame 14. Once the floorboard 110 is lowered to its neutral position, as sensed by the sensor 744, the processor 880 causes the valve 832 to move to its normally closed state.</p><p id="p0127" num="0127">The orifice 834 again limits the rate at which pressurized fluid exits the accumulator 660. By restricting the flow of fluid through the orifice 834, the rate at which the floorboard 110 is lowered falls within an acceptable range, i.e., the floorboard 110 is not lowered too quickly.</p><p id="p0128" num="0128">An operator support assembly 900 constructed in accordance with a ninth embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0012 f0013 f0014">Figs. 12-17</figref>, where like reference numerals indicate like elements.

The maximum distance that the floorboard 910 moves between its upper and lower stop positions may be from about 1 inch to about 5 inches and preferably is about 2 inches.</p><p id="p0146" num="0146">When a light-weight operator is positioned on the floorboard 910, the floorboard 910 may be spaced from the neutral position toward the upper stops 958A and 958B. Conversely, when a heavy-weight operator is positioned on the floorboard 910, the floorboard 910 may be spaced from the neutral position in a direction away from the upper stops 95 8A and 958B.</p><p id="p0147" num="0147">It is contemplated that the position of the floorboard 910 may be adjusted automatically during a height adjustment operation or manually. An automatic floorboard height adjustment operation may be effected just after an operator enters the operator's compartment 30 and activates the presence sensor 40. Alternatively, a floorboard height adjustment operation may be effected just after an operator, standing on the floorboard, selects a direction of travel for the truck, i.e., when power is provided to the first and second driven wheels.</p><p id="p0148" num="0148">For automatic adjustment during a floorboard height adjustment operation, a first sensor 1100 is provided for detecting the position of the carriage assembly 934 and the floorboard 910 relative to a desired neutral position or the support plate 960. The sensor 1100 comprises <u>a</u> potentiometer 1102 coupled to the support plate 960 and a rocker arm 1104 coupled to the potentiometer 1102 and the main body side plate 936G, see <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 18</figref>. The rocker arm 1104 moves with the carriage assembly main body 936 such that the sensor 1100 senses the position of the carriage assembly 934 and the floorboard 910. In <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 18</figref>, the carriage assembly 934 is in its uppermost position where it engages upper stops 958A and 058B. In <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 19</figref>, the carriage<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> assembly 934 is in an intermediate position and in <figref idrefs="f0016">Fig. 20</figref>, the carriage assembly 934 is in its lowermost position.</p><p id="p0149" num="0149">When in the automatic adjust mode, which mode may be selected by an operator via a switch (not shown) or the like provided in the rider compartment 30, the preload on the springs 940 and 942 is automatically varied during a floorboard height adjustment operation so as to position the floorboard 910, with an operator thereon, in the neutral position. The sensor 1100 generates position signals to a controller (not shown) indicative of the location of the floorboard 910 relative to its neutral position. In response to receiving the position signals from the sensor 1100, the controller generates control signals to the motor 1056 causing the motor 1056 to rotate the screw 1056D so as to pivot the lever 1054 in an appropriate direction to vary the preload on the springs 940 and 942 such that the floorboard 910, with the operator standing on it, is returned to the neutral position. Hence, so as to allow the floorboard 910 to be moved to the neutral position during a floorboard height adjustment operation, the motor 1056 is actuated via the controller during the floorboard height adjustment operation in response to position signals generated by the sensor 1100 to vary the preload on the springs 940 and 942 such that the floorboard 910 is repositioned to its neutral position.</p><p id="p0150" num="0150">In the manual adjust mode, the operator may vary the preload on the springs 940 and 942 via an adjustment knob or switch (not shown) in the rider compartment 30. To give the floorboard 910 a "softer" feel when standing on the floorboard 910, the operator may vary the position of the adjustment knob to cause the motor 1056 to move the lever 1054 in a clockwise direction, as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 18</figref>, so as to reduce the preload on the springs 940 and 942. To give the floorboard 910 a "firmer" feel when standing on the floorboard 910, the operator may vary the position of the adjustment knob so as to cause the motor 1056 to move the lever 1054 in a counter-clockwise direction, as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 18</figref>, so as to increase the preload on the springs 940 and 942. Based on the adjustment selected by the operator, the floorboard 910 may or may not be located in its neutral position when the operator is standing on the floorboard 910. In the manual adjust mode, the controller disregards the position signals generated by the first sensor 1100.</p><p id="p0151" num="0151">A second sensor 1110 may be provided for detecting the position of the lever 1054. The sensor 1110 comprises a potentiometer 1112 coupled to the support plate 960 and a rocker arm 1114 coupled to the potentiometer 1112 and the lever 1054, see <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 18</figref>. The rocker arm 1114 is rotated by the lever 1054 when the lever 1054 is pivoted by the motor 1056 such that the sensor 1110 senses the position of the lever 1054 and generates lever position signals to the controller.<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> In response to receiving the signals generated by the sensor 1110, the controller determines the position of the lever 1054 and, hence, the preload on the springs 940 and 942. The controller may activate a display (not shown) within the rider compartment 30 so as to indicate to the operator the current preload on the springs 940 and 942, e.g., firm, soft or an intermediate condition between firm and soft. During the automatic mode, the controller may disregard the lever position signals generated by the second sensor 1110. Other position sensing devices may be employed in place of the switches 1057A, 1057B and the sensor 1110. For example, an encoder or potentiometer associated with the motor screw may be employed.</p><p id="p0152" num="0152">It is preferred that the operator support assembly 1000 have a natural frequency between about 1.5 and about 2.5 Hz. It is further preferred that the floorboard 910 typically move only within a range of positions well within its upper and lower stop positions during normal operation of the truck 10. It is believed that the energy absorbing structure 1020 coupled to the floorboard 910 supporting an operator having a weight between about 100 pounds and 300 pounds and capable of achieving these two objectives may comprise first and second springs 940 and 942 having a relaxed length (prior to being coupled to the side plates 936G and 936H and the yoke 1052) of from about 8 inches to about 11 inches, and a spring rate of from about 25 pounds/inch to about 200 pounds/inch.</p><p id="p0153" num="0153">One or more electromagnets (not shown) may be mounted to the support plate 960 and positioned adjacent the carriage assembly main body 936. When power is provided to the electromagnets, the electromagnets function to releasably lock the carriage assembly main body 936 and, hence, the floorboard 910, to the support plate 960 and the truck frame 14. The electromagnets may be activated to lock the floorboard 910 to the support plate 960 so as to provide an operator with a firm feel as the operator steps into or out of the rider compartment. It is also contemplated that the one or more electromagnets may be replaced with a solenoid having a reciprocating piston. The solenoid is fixed to the support plate 960. A bore is provided in the carriage assembly main body 936 to receive the solenoid piston when the solenoid is actuated to extend the piston. To lock the floorboard 910 to the support plate 960, the solenoid is actuated to extend the piston such that it engages the bore in the carriage main body 936. Once an operator has entered the rider compartment 30, and power is provided to the driven wheels, the solenoid may be actuated to retract the piston such that it exits the bore in the carriage assembly main body 936 so as to allow the carriage assembly 934 to move relative to the support plate 960.</p><p id="p0154" num="0154">An operator support assembly 1200 constructed in accordance with an eleventh embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0017">Figs. 22</figref>, where like reference numerals<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> indicate like elements. The operator support assembly 1200 may be incorporated into a truck similar to the one illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> or other materials handling vehicles. The operator support assembly 1200 is constructed in substantially the same manner as operator support assembly 900 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0012 f0013 f0014">Figs. 12-17</figref>, but, in addition, a backrest assembly 1210 is provided. The backrest assembly 1210 comprises a support 1212 and a pad 1214 coupled to the support 1212. The support 1212 is fixedly coupled to the main body 936 of the carriage assembly 934 so as to move with the carriage assembly 934. Hence, as the carriage assembly 934 moves upward and downward as a truck in which the assembly 1200 is incorporated encounters bumps and holes, the backrest assembly 1210 moves with the floorboard (not shown in <figref idrefs="f0017">Fig. 22</figref>) coupled to the carriage assembly 934 and the operator. It is also contemplated that an armrest, a control knob or lever such as a multifunction controller or steering tiller or other elements typically found within an operator's compartment may be fixedly coupled to the carriage assembly 934 so that they move with the carriage assembly 934 and the floorboard.</p><p id="p0155" num="0155">Many alterations and modifications may be made by those having ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
