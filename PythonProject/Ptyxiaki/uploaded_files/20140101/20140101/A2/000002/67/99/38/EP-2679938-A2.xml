Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Generally, a refrigerator is a home appliance including a storage chamber to store food, and a cold air supplier to supply cold air to the storage chamber in order to keep food fresh. To satisfy consumer demand, such a refrigerator may be provided with an ice making chamber and an ice maker, for production of ice.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Structures for supplying cold air to an ice making chamber in order to produce ice may be classified into an indirect cooling type structure and a direct cooling type structure. In the indirect cooling type structure, cold air generated at an evaporator is fed to the ice making chamber via a separate duct. On the other hand, in the direct cooling type structure, cold air is directly generated within the ice making chamber. In particular, in the direct cooling type structure, a portion of a refrigerant pipe may extend into the ice making chamber, and a separate heat exchanger may be installed in the ice making chamber. Otherwise, the refrigerant pipe may contact an ice making tray such that the ice making tray directly functions as a heat exchanger.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Such a direct cooling type ice making structure may have advantages of high ice making rate and elimination of a feeding duct structure in that cold air is directly generated within the ice making chamber. In such a direct cooling type structure, however, it may be necessary to prevent formation of frost on the refrigerant pipe caused by temperature difference. In addition, a task to extend a portion of the refrigerant pipe into the ice making chamber is required.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><p id="p0005" num="0005">Therefore, it is an aspect of the present disclosure to provide an ice making chamber assembly structure capable of not only achieving effective insulation of a refrigerant pipe, thereby preventing formation of frost on the refrigerant pipe, but also firmly fixing the refrigerant pipe in a refrigerator having a direct cooling type ice making structure in which a portion of the refrigerant pipe extends into an ice making chamber.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Additional aspects of the disclosure will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the disclosure.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure, a refrigerator includes an inner case including an ice making chamber formed in an interior of the inner case, an outer case coupled to an outside of the inner case, a body insulator foamed between the inner case and the outer case, a refrigerant pipe having at least a portion disposed in the ice making chamber, to supply cooling energy to the ice making chamber, and a refrigerant pipe insulator enclosing the refrigerant pipe, to insulate and support the refrigerant pipe, wherein the inner case further includes an opening allowing the refrigerant pipe insulator to extend therethrough, wherein the refrigerant pipe insulator extends through the opening such that a portion of the refrigerant pipe insulator is disposed in the ice making chamber, and a remaining portion of the refrigerant pipe insulator is disposed between the inner case and the outer case, and wherein the refrigerant pipe insulator is supported by the body insulator foamed between the inner case and the outer case.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The refrigerant pipe insulator may be supported by an outer surface of the inner case around the opening.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The refrigerant pipe insulator may be supported by an inner surface of the outer case.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The refrigerator may further include a support case disposed at a rear side of the ice making chamber within the ice making chamber, the support case having a support passage formed in an interior of the support case, to receive the refrigerant pipe insulator.

In this case, since the second support surface 342 of the refrigerant pipe insulator 300 is supported by the outer surface 25 of the inner case 20 around the opening 29, the portion<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> 310 of the refrigerant pipe insulator 300 may be disposed at the inside of the inner case 20, and the remaining portion 302 of the refrigerant pipe insulator 300 may be disposed at the outside of the inner case 20.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">The outer case 30 is then coupled to the outside of the inner case 20 (640). In this case, since the length L of the fixed portion 302 of the refrigerant pipe insulator 300 corresponds to the distance between the outer surface 25 of the inner case 20 and the inner surface 31 of the outer case 30, the refrigerant tube insulator 300 may be supported by the inner surface 31 of the outer case 30.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Thereafter, the body insulator 40 is foamed between the inner case 20 and the outer case 30 (650). The fixed portion 302 of the refrigerant pipe insulator 300 is supported by the foamed body insulator 40 and, as such, the refrigerant pipe insulator 300 may be fixed. Since the refrigerant insulator 300 is kept in a state of being supported by the outer surface 25 of the inner case 20 and the inner surface 31 of the outer case 30 during foaming of the body insulator 40, it may be possible to prevent the refrigerant pipe insulator 300 from moving from an original position due to the liquid foaming agent. The body insulator 40 may be formed by filling a space between the coupled inner and outer cases 20 and 30 with a foaming agent and expanding the foaming agent.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Since the refrigerant pipe insulator 300 is coupled to the refrigerant pipe 210 in accordance with the above-described method, it may be possible to firmly fix the refrigerant tube 210 to the inside of the ice making chamber 70 while reliably insulating the refrigerant pope 210.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">As apparent from the above description, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, it may be possible to firmly fix the refrigerant pipe which is disposed in the ice making chamber, using the refrigerant pipe insulator.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">The refrigerant pipe insulator is firmly supported by the body insulator foamed between the inner case and the outer case and, as such, the refrigerant pipe insulator is firmly fixed.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">The refrigerant pipe insulator is constituted by a plurality of assembled insulator sections. The refrigerant pipe is interposed between the insulator sections. Thus, assembly of the refrigerant pipe assembly may be easily achieved.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">The clamp member is fitted around the front end of the refrigerant pipe insulator, thereby preventing the insulator sections from being spaced apart from each other. Also, the rear end of<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> the refrigerant pipe insulator is supported by the body insulator. Thus, the refrigerant pipe insulator may be firmly fixed through a simple structure.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">The refrigerant pipe includes one or more bent portions supported by the refrigerant pipe insulator while being enclosed by the refrigerant pipe insulator. Accordingly, it may be possible to prevent the refrigerant pipe from moving relative to the refrigerant pipe insulator.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Assembly of the refrigerant pipe assembly may be carried out before foaming of the body insulator.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">Also, the insertion length of the refrigerant pipe may be easily determined during assembly of the refrigerant pipe assembly.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">Additionally, the refrigerant insulator is supported not only by the body insulator, but also by the outer surface of the inner case and the inner case of the outer case. Accordingly, it may be possible to prevent the refrigerant pipe insulator from moving from an original position before or after foaming of the body insulator.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Although a few embodiments of the present disclosure have been shown and described, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the disclosure, the scope of which is defined in the claims and their equivalents.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56976649" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A refrigerator (1) comprising:
