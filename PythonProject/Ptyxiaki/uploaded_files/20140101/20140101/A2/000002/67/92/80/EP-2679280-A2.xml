The further aspect of the invention is a method for rescuing a passenger of an aircraft in an emergency situation.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Emergency situations on board of an aircraft may be characterized by a decompression of the cabin, smoke or fire, wind turbulences and mechanical impacts. Usually, a pilot will seek to conduct a quick emergency descent of the aircraft in such an emergency situation and to reach the closest airport or emergency landing lane. After landing the aircraft, a quick exit of all passengers out of the aircraft is required. Such quick exit may be hindered by smoke and/or insufficient oxygen in the aircraft passenger cabin.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is known to supply oxygen to passengers in an emergency situation like a decompression situation, smoke or fire in the cabin. For this purpose, oxygen masks drop out of a passenger service unit and oxygen is supplied to the passenger via said oxygen mask. The oxygen mask is connected to the passenger service unit via a connecting line. In the passenger service unit an oxygen source is comprised which stores oxygen and provides said oxygen to the passenger after activation of the oxygen supply. Usually, the passenger can activate the oxygen supply pulling a connecting line wherein said connecting line may be a flexible tube which at the same time serves to direct the oxygen from the passenger service unit to the oxygen mask or maybe a wire or rope or the like distinct from the connecting line. It is known to store oxygen in the passenger service unit in a chemically bound form and to produce said oxygen in a chemical reaction after activation. This type of oxygen source is called chemical oxygen generator (COG). It is further known to store oxygen in a pressurized tank wherein activation of said oxygen source comprises opening a valve or a sealing component to open said pressure tank and allow flow of oxygen out of said tank to the oxygen mask.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Such emergency oxygen devices have shown to be insufficient in certain emergency situations, in particular in case of smoke of fire in the cabin or during the quick exit of the passengers out of the cabin. It is an object of the invention to provide an emergency oxygen supply device for passengers of an aircraft which improves the safety of the passenger in such emergency situations and facilitates the handling of the emergency oxygen supply device by the passenger.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">This object is solved by an aircraft passenger emergency oxygen supply device as described in the introductory portion wherein the oxygen mask comprises a chemical reaction component connected to the mask body for receiving exhaled air out of said mask body, converting said exhaled air into supply air by a chemical reaction between said exhaled air and a chemical reaction material comprised in said chemical reaction component to produce oxygen-enriched air and for supplying said oxygen-enriched air as the supply air to the mask body.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to the invention a chemical reaction component is comprised in the oxygen mask. The oxygen mask is thus characterized by a chemical reaction component which is part of the oxygen mask or integral with the oxygen mask or directly attached to the oxygen mask. This means that the chemical reaction component is mechanically fixed to the mask in such a way that the passenger carries the chemical reaction component together with the oxygen mask. In contrast to prior art oxygen emergency systems for aircraft passenger a chemical reaction component is provided which allows to convert exhaled air of the passenger into oxygen enriched and optionally carbon dioxide depleted air which can be inhaled by the passenger again. By this, the passenger receives an independent oxygen mask and can carry this oxygen mask and receive oxygen out of the mask body even if the passenger leaves his seat like this may happen e.g. in a panic situation or may be required in a quick exit procedure.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">One advantage of the emergency oxygen supply device according to the invention is to allow the passenger to leave his seat and still be supplied with oxygen which protects the passenger from smoke or hypoxia in an emergency situation. In particular if a quick exit procedure is conducted on board of the aircraft this significantly increases the safety of the passenger since the passenger may even wait for several minutes in a row inside the aircraft cabin before exiting the cabin through an emergency exit and is not endangered by smoke or reduced oxygen content in the air inside the cabin.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the invention said connecting line is an oxygen supply line for connecting said mask body with a source of oxygen in said passenger service unit, wherein said source of oxygen is a chemical oxygen generator or a pressurized oxygen tank.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the invention, the chemical reaction component is adapted to produce oxygen enriched air out of the exhaled air of the passenger. Thus, the chemical reaction component comprises a chemical reaction material which is capable to produce oxygen out of the exhaled air comprising carbon dioxide. However, usually such chemical reaction materials which are adapted to convert oxygen depleted air into oxygen enriched air require some start-up time to provide<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> said oxygen enriched air. During this start-up time the passenger may be supplied from a source of oxygen which is capable of immediate release of oxygen in an emergency situation. Such source of oxygen may be a chemical oxygen generator comprising a chemical reaction material which is producing oxygen independently from exhaled air in a chemical reaction or may be a pressurized oxygen tank comprising oxygen in pressurized form. According to this preferred embodiment the connecting line is a flexible tube or hose and the source of oxygen is arranged in said passenger service unit. In such case, the connecting line is required for providing initial start-up oxygen out of said source of oxygen to the oxygen mask to immediately supply the passenger with oxygen in an emergency situation. After a short start-up time during which the passenger is supplied via said connecting line out of the source of oxygen in the passenger service unit the chemical reaction material comprised in the oxygen mask will have started up the chemical reaction to convert exhaled oxygen depleted air into oxygen enriched air and to thus supply the passenger with oxygen enriched air independent from the source of oxygen.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to an alternative preferred embodiment hereto said connecting line is a wire or rope for connecting said mask body with a fixing point in said passenger service unit, wherein said oxygen mask further comprises a source of oxygen, wherein said source of oxygen is a chemical oxygen generator or a pressurized oxygen tank. According to this embodiment, again a source of oxygen is comprised in the oxygen supply device to provide oxygen in the initial start-up time period wherein the chemical reaction material comprised in the chemical reaction component does not sufficiently enrich the exhaled air with oxygen for supplying oxygen enriched air to the passenger. In this embodiment the source of oxygen is comprised in the oxygen mask, i.e. is a part of the oxygen mask, integral with the oxygen mask or directly fixed to the oxygen mask. In such a case the connecting line is not required to direct or deliver oxygen out of the passenger service unit to the oxygen mask but may be a simple wire or rope or the like which serves to hold the oxygen mask after it has fallen out of the passenger service unit or which may serve to activate the oxygen supply by imparting a pulling force onto said connecting line to activate a switch element coupled with said connecting line.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> According to a further preferred embodiment said connecting line comprises a coupling element, said coupling element being adapted to maintain the connection provided by said connecting line and said coupling between the oxygen mask and the passenger service unit if a predetermined pulling force along said connecting line is not exceeded and to release said connection provided by said connecting line and said coupling between the oxygen mask and the passenger service unit if a predetermined lower pulling force along said connecting line is exceeded.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to this embodiment the passenger may disconnect the oxygen mask from the passenger service unit by detaching the connecting line a coupling element. This coupling element is adapted to maintain the connection between the passenger service unit and the oxygen mask up to predetermined pulling force which is applied along said connecting line by the passenger. If said pulling force is exceeded the coupling element releases the oxygen mask to thus allow the passenger to leave his seat with the oxygen mask and to be supplied with oxygen furtheron. The coupling element may be positioned at the oxygen mask or at the passenger service unit or in between along the connecting line. It may comprises to connecting elements coupled with each other wherein said coupling of the two connecting elements is only maintained until a predetermined pulling force is reached and hereafter the two connecting elements are released from each other. The coupling element may be a weakened section of the connecting line which breaks at a predetermined pulling force, a spring-biased coupling wherein the spring force determines the pulling force required to release the coupling or the like.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to a further preferred embodiment wherein a source of oxygen is provided in the passenger service unit and oxygen is supplied via a flow connecting line out of the passenger service unit to the oxygen mask it is preferred that said coupling element is connected to a starter unit integrated in said passenger service unit and adapted to start oxygen supply out of said source of oxygen source, wherein said starter unit is adapted to start oxygen supply out of said oxygen source if a pulling force along the connecting line exceeds a lower pulling force start level, said lower pulling force start level being below the predetermined<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> lower pulling force. According to this embodiment a starter unit is integrated into the passenger service unit and is activated by a pulling force along the connecting line. This pulling force shall be stronger than a predetermined lower pulling force start level to avoid accidental start up of the oxygen supply. However, the lower pulling force start level shall be below the predetermined lower pulling force required to separate the oxygen mask from the passenger service unit. By this, it is possible that the passenger first initiates the oxygen supply by applying a pulling force exceeding a certain lower limit but not exceeding a predetermined second limit and to receive immediate oxygen supply via the connecting line. Hereafter, the passenger may apply a stronger pulling force to release the oxygen mask from the passenger service unit if this required, e.g. for an emergency quick exit procedure. It is to be understood that this embodiment may have a lower pulling force start level and a lower pulling force which are different from each other such that the passenger may not accidentally release the oxygen mask from the passenger service unit to early. Further, it is to be understood that the coupling element may be adapted to separate only after two pulling forces have been applied one after the other, i.e. the coupling element does not separate upon a first pulling force independent from the magnitude of said pulling force. In this preferred design option a first pulling force will in any case initiate the oxygen supply by activating the starter unit but will in no case separate the oxygen mask from the passenger service unit and a subsequent second pulling action may release the oxygen mask from the passenger service unit.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to a further preferred embodiment wherein the source of oxygen is arranged at the oxygen mask and the connecting line is a wire, rope or the like, it is preferred that said coupling element is connected to a starter unit integrated in said oxygen mask and adapted to start oxygen supply out of said source of oxygen source, wherein said starter unit is adapted to start oxygen supply out of said oxygen source if a pulling force along the connecting line exceeds a lower pulling force start level, said lower pulling force start level being below the predetermined lower pulling force. According to this embodiment, the starter unit is positioned at the oxygen mask and is activated by a pulling force which is greater than a lower pulling force start level.

An oxygen mask 1 has dropped out of a passenger service unit 2 which is arranged as a sealing compartment inside an aircraft cabin. The passenger service unit 2 comprises a storing space 20 wherein the oxygen mask 1 can be stored in regular flight condition. A cover lid 11 on the bottom side of said storing space can be released and opened to the outside of the storing space thus opening the storing space in the direction of gravity thus effecting a falling out of the oxygen mask 1.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The oxygen mask is connected to the passenger service unit 2 via a connecting line 20, 21. Said connecting line comprises a tether 21 and a flexible tube 20. The flexible tube is connected on the upper and to a chemical oxygen generator 30 and arranged in the passenger service unit. The downside end of the flexible tube is connected to a coupling element 40.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The downside end of the tether 21 is connected to the coupling element, too. The upside end of the tether 21 is connected to a releasable pin 31 which is part of a starter unit 32 attached to the chemical oxygen generator 30.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The coupling element 40 is integral with a control unit 50 which is attached to a mask body 60.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The mask body 60 comprises a large opening 61 for covering mouth and nose of a passenger. Further, a first small opening 62 is provided in said mask body 60, said first opening 62 being in fluid connection with the flexible hose 20 via said control unit 50 and said coupling element 40. Further, a second small opening 63 is present in the mask body 60. Said second opening 63 connects the interior of the mask body 60 with a chemical reaction component 70. Said chemical reaction<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> component 70 comprises a first opening in fluid connection with the mask body 60 and a second opening 72 in fluid connection with a flexible bladder 80.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Finally, the mask body 60 comprises a third small opening 64 with integrated check valve 65.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The function of the emergency oxygen device according to the first embodiment is explained in detail with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">figures 1</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0002">1a</figref> now. In regular flight condition the oxygen mask is completely stored in the storing space 10 of the passenger service unit. In case of an emergency situation requiring supply of oxygen to the passenger the cover lid is released and opened and the oxygen mask 1 falls out of the storing space to be presented to the passenger. The tether 21 holds the oxygen mask 1 in a predetermined position wherein it is easy for the passenger to grasp the oxygen mask.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The passenger will grasp the oxygen mask 1 and pull it downwards with a first pulling force. This first pulling force will affect release of the releasable pin 31 out of the starter unit 32. This pulling out of the pin 31 out of the starter unit 32 will effect a spark which activates the chemical oxygen generator to produce oxygen. The chemical oxygen generator 30 comprises oxygen in a chemically bound form selected from the groups of inorganic superoxides, chlorates, perchlorates and ozonides. Preferably, the chemical oxygen generator comprises sodium chlorate as a main ingredient. The oxygen produced in an exothermic reaction in the chemical oxygen generator is directed to the mask body via the flexible hose 20. The control unit 50 comprises an inhaling valve which opens if the passenger applies a low pressure to the inside of the mask body 60 and thus a partition of oxygen is provided to the mouth and nose of the passenger via the opening 61. This partition corresponds to an amount of oxygen produced by the chemical oxygen generator in the foregoing exhaling cycle. As soon as this amount of oxygen is exhausted the passenger may apply a larger vacuum to the inside of the mask body affecting an opening of the check valve 65. By this, ambient air is drawn into the mask body to allow the passenger to complete the inhaling cycle. This ambient air may have a low oxygen content but since the first partition of concentrated oxygen is delivered into the lung of the passenger this second<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> partition of pure oxygen air only serves to fill the mouth and respiratory ducts of the passenger and does not require to be rich of oxygen herefor.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">After having inhaled this first and second partition through said first opening 62 and said third opening 64 the passenger will exhale the air. If the passenger applies a positive pressure to the inside of the mask body in this exhaling cycle the valve unit comprised in the control unit 50 will close and the check valve 65 will close. The exhaling air will thus flow through the second opening 63 into the chemical reaction component 70. The chemical reaction component 70 comprises potassium dioxide. This potassium dioxide reacts with the carbon dioxide of the exhaled air in an exothermic reaction as follows:<br/>
<br/>
         4KO<sub>2</sub> + 2CO<sub>2</sub> = 2K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 3O<sub>2</sub>.<br/>
 <br/>
</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Thus, carbon dioxide contained in the exhaled air is chemically bound in the chemical reaction component and oxygen is produces therein. It is an important aspect of the chemical reaction material comprised in the chemical reaction component to have the ability to bind carbon dioxide out of the exhaled air and to produce oxygen out of the exhaled air at the same time.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">It is to be understood that other materials might be used as a chemical reaction component as well. This may comprise lithiumhydroxide and/or breathing lime or calcium carbonate. In particular, the chemical reaction component may be adapted to extract carbondioxide out of the exhaled air only but to not produce additional oxygen. Such a chemical reaction componennt may be used in connection with a small oxygen source like e.g. a small oxygen pressure tank or a small chemcial oxygen generator. Using such chemical reaction component will allow the passenger to participate in evacuation process of an aircraft without thze risk of fainting due to carbon dioxide intoxication.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">After having passed through the chemical reaction component 70 from the first opening 71 to the second opening 72 the oxygen enriched and carbon dioxide depleted exhaled air flows into the flexible bladder 80 and is temporarily stored therein. The flexible bladder may be dimensioned in such a way to take up the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> whole exhaled air out of one breathing cycle of the passenger. Alternatively, the flexible bladder may be dimensioned in such a way to take up only a part of said exhaled air whereas a remaining part is exhaled through an exhale valve (not shown) into the ambient air inside the cabin. The check valve 65 may be adapted to open upon a high pressure inside the oxygen mask and thus allow the remaining second part of the exhaling air volume to pass into the ambient air.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In the subsequent breathing cycle the passenger will take up first the oxygen produced by the chemical oxygen generator during the foregoing exhaling cycle. Hereafter the passenger will take up the exhaled air out of the flexible bladder 80. During this taking up of the exhaled air the exhaled air passes again through the chemical reaction component 70 thus being further enriched with oxygen and depleted from carbon dioxide.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The chemical oxygen generator 30 is dimensioned to provide oxygen for less than one minute. It is to be understood, that the chemical oxygen generator may be adapted to supply oxygen for a shorter period of time like e.g. only 30 or 45 seconds and for a longer period of time like e.g. 1.5 minutes, 2 minutes or 5 minutes depending on the configuration of the system components. It is usually desired that aftzer such time period the chemical reaction in the chemical reaction component 70 has fully started and the passenger will receive sufficient oxygen out of the chemical reaction in the chemical reaction component 70 to maintain his vital functions.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Hereafter, the passenger may pull again the oxygen mask 1 to himself thus affecting a second pulling force on the coupling element 40. This second pulling force will affect a release of the coupling element and thus cut the last connection of the oxygen mask 1 to the passenger service unit 2 which was present by the flexible hose. The passenger may then move inside the cabin with the oxygen mask 1 being permanently supplied with oxygen enriched and carbon dioxide depleted air. In particular, the passenger may use his mask during evacuation of the passengers to the outside of the aircraft cabin after landing of the aircraft.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">2a</figref> show a second embodiment of the emergency oxygen device according to the invention.

In this case a pulling force is<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> applied to the tether 120 affecting the releasable pin 131 to be pulled out of the coupling element 140 which is part of the starter unit 132.
