More particularly, it relates to a method for manufacturing a ceramic honeycomb structure capable of enhancing production efficiency by reducing a need for an offline inspection.</p><heading id="h0003">Background Art</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">In various fields such as chemistry, electric power, iron and steel, a honeycomb structure made of a ceramic material (a ceramic honeycomb structure) is utilized as a support for a catalyst device to be used for environmental protection, recovery of specific substances and the like. Moreover, a ceramic honeycomb structure is also used as a filter for purifying an exhaust gas. Such a ceramic honeycomb structure exhibits excellent heat resistance and corrosion resistance, and is utilized in various use applications as described above. The honeycomb structure<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> is a structure having partition walls defining a plurality of cells extending from one end face to another end face to form through channels of a fluid. Hereinafter, a direction from the one end face to another end face may be referred to as an axial direction.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Heretofore, the honeycomb structure has been manufactured by the following method. Firstly, a kneaded clay including a forming raw material is formed into a honeycomb-like shape to obtain a honeycomb formed body. The honeycomb formed body is a cylindrical body in which a plural number of cells extending from the one end face to another end face are defined by the partition walls. This honeycomb formed body is cut so that a length of the honeycomb formed body in the above axial direction is larger than a length as a finished size. Next, the honeycomb formed body to be cut is dried to obtain the honeycomb dried body. Next, finish processing is performed so that the length of the honeycomb dried body in the axial direction becomes the finished size, to obtain "the finished honeycomb dried body". Next, a sampling dimensional inspection is performed in order to check the distortion of an outer shape of "the finished honeycomb dried body". In the sampling dimensional inspection, "the finished honeycomb dried body" in which the outer shape is distorted beyond the scope of an allowable range (specified conditions) fails, and is removed from a production line.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> Furthermore, a total dimensional inspection (a total inspection for a failed lot) is performed to a lot in which the failed finished honeycomb dried body (e.g., several hundred of "finished honeycomb dried bodies" placed on the same pallet) is detected, to remove the failed body. Next, "the finished honeycomb dried body" is fired to obtain a honeycomb structure (see, e.g., Patent Document 1). Moreover, as to the honeycomb structure manufactured by such a method, the inspection as to whether the outer size thereof satisfies a size tolerance (a product standard) of the finished size is performed, and the structure which has passed the inspection is shipped out as a product.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">[Patent Document 1] <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2002046856A"><text>JP-A-2002-046856</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">When a honeycomb structure is prepared by the above method, "a total inspection" is usually performed offline (taking the dried bodies off from a production line). And, since "the total inspection" is performed to all "finished honeycomb dried bodies" of the same lot as a lot which has failed in a sampling dimensional inspection, it has been necessary to perform the inspection to a large number of honeycomb structures offline manually. Therefore, production efficiency may be reduced.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> The present invention has been developed in view of the above-mentioned problem.

It should be understood that the present invention is not limited to the following embodiment and that design change, improvement and the like are suitably added on the basis of ordinary knowledge of a person skilled in the art without departing from the gist of the present invention.</p><heading id="h0007">(1) Method for Manufacturing Ceramic Honeycomb Structure:</heading><p id="p0023" num="0023">One embodiment of a method for manufacturing a ceramic honeycomb structure of the present invention is a method for manufacturing a ceramic honeycomb structure including a shape verification step A, a finishing step B, and a firing step C as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1. Fig. 1</figref> is a perspective view schematically showing a process to form the ceramic honeycomb structure in the one embodiment of the method for manufacturing the ceramic honeycomb structure of the present invention. The shape verification step A is a step of measuring an outer shape of a ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 to remove the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 which does not satisfy specified conditions. The finishing step B is a step of subjecting the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 satisfying the specified conditions to finish processing so that a length in "a direction L<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> from one end face 61 to another end face 62" becomes a finished size m, to obtain a finished ceramic honeycomb dried body 70. The ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 is the body in which a plural number of cells 52 extending from the one end face 61 to another end face 62 are defined by partition walls 51. The ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 preferably has a tubular shape (e.g., a cylindrical shape, a tubular shape with an elliptic bottom surface, a tubular shape with a polygonal bottom surface, or the like). The firing step C is a step of firing the finished ceramic honeycomb dried body 70 obtained in the finishing step B, to obtain a ceramic honeycomb structure 100. Hereinafter, the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 may simply be referred to "the honeycomb dried body 50". The finished ceramic honeycomb dried body 70 may simply be referred to "the finished honeycomb dried body 70". The ceramic honeycomb structure 100 may simply be referred to "the honeycomb structure 100".</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to the method for manufacturing the ceramic honeycomb structure of the present invention, in the shape verification step, the ceramic honeycomb dried body which does not satisfy "the specified conditions of the outer shape" is removed, and hence it is not necessary to perform "a sampling dimensional inspection". Therefore, production efficiency enhances. Moreover, even if "the sampling dimensional inspection" is performed, since the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> ceramic honeycomb dried bodies which do not satisfy "the specified conditions of the outer shapes" are removed, it is not necessary to perform "a total inspection for a failed lot". It is to be noted that, heretofore, when the ceramic honeycomb dried body which does not satisfy the specified conditions is identified in "the sampling dimensional inspection", the similar inspection to the sampling dimensional inspection has been performed as to a total lot constituting of the same lot to which the failed ceramic honeycomb dried body belongs, in a case that such a failed ceramic honeycomb dried body was observed. "The shape verification step" can automatically and continuously be performed online (on a production line), whereas "the total inspection for the failed lot" needs to be manually performed offline in a state of taking the dried bodies off from a production line. Since "the shape verification step" of the present invention can automatically and continuously be performed online (on a production line), shape verification can effectively be performed. In contrast, because there is a state in which "the total inspection for the failed lot" performed between a independent cutting step and firing step is separated from the both steps, the total inspection can not be on an automatic inspection line (i.e., on an offline), thereby a total inspection is performed manually. Thus, "the total inspection for the failed lot" needs to be performed by manually on an offline, which is very ineffective. And,<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> "the shape verification step" performed online has much greater advantage obtained by performing an automatic inspection even if the number of the shape verification increases, compared to an inspection performed by manually on an offline. Therefore, according to the present invention, by including the shape verification step, it is possible to omit "the total inspection for the failed lot" being an inefficient operation to be performed offline or, at least, to make a percentage of the total inspection extraordinary small, and thereby it is possible to enhance production efficiency.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the method for manufacturing the ceramic honeycomb structure of the present embodiment, the shape verification step A is performed by the following method. Here, <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a perspective view schematically showing an example of a measuring method of the outer shape in the shape verification step. The ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 has an outer wall. Heretofore, the term "outer shape" means a shape of a peripheral surface 63.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Firstly, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, take the three positions "apart from each other "in the direction (an axial direction) L from the one end face 61 to another end face 62"" and located on the peripheral surface 63 of the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 as a measurement start positions P1, P2 and P3, respectively. And, contours in a<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> circumferential direction including the measurement start positions P1, P2, and P3 are measured. Specifically, take respective three portions including the respective measurement start positions P1, P2, and P3 and going around the peripheral surface in circumferential direction R as contour measuring portions Q1, Q2, and Q3. And, as is shown in "A: the shape verification step" of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, each of the contours of the contour measuring portions Q1, Q2, and Q3 is measured. Cutting positions in the finish processing are preferably Q1 and Q3. The contour measuring portions Q1, Q2, and Q3 are annular portions going around the peripheral surface 63 of the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 in the circumferential direction. In <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the positions on the peripheral surface where the contours are measured (the contour measuring portions Q1, Q2, and Q3) are shown by three annular dashed lines going around an outer periphery. An effect of the present invention can be sufficiently exerted if three contour measuring portions are chosen, but they may be four portions or more. Here, in "a cross section" nearly perpendicular to a direction in which the cells 52 of the ceramic honeycomb body 50 extend, "the circumferential direction R" means a direction going around a peripheral edge of the "cross section" along the peripheral surface 63 of the honeycomb dried body 50.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">And, when a maximum value and a minimum value of the contours measured in the circumferential direction at the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> contour measuring portions Q1, Q2 and Q3 are in a specified numeric range, it is judged that "the specified conditions are satisfied". Moreover, when the maximum value and the minimum value of the contours measured in the circumferential direction at the contour measuring portions Q1, Q2 and Q3 are out of the specified numeric range, it is judged that "the specified conditions are not satisfied". There is not any special restriction on numeric sizes of the maximum value and the minimum value of the contour. A size of outer diameter can be also calculated from measurement data of positions opposite to each other at 180 degrees in each of the contour measuring portions. Herewith, a standard verification of the size of outer diameter can also be performed.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Here, "the contour" means a size of an actual contour difference from a geometric contour determined by a theoretically correct size. Therefore, the contour to be measured in the method for manufacturing the ceramic honeycomb structure of the present embodiment is the size of the difference of the ceramic honeycomb dried body from a standard size of outer diameter. By measuring such a contour, it is possible to define a dispersion of a line element constituting a curved surface as planar tolerance region in a two-dimensional. That is, it is possible to define the dispersion of the line element constituting an outer peripheral surface of the ceramic honeycomb dried<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> body as planar tolerance region in a two-dimensional. The contour is a value performed at best fit processing (processing to minimize a difference amount from a standard value) with respect to the standard size of outer diameter by processing a minimum square method or the like to measured data. That is, in the shape verification, judgment of acceptance is performed by comparing the contours obtained by individually subjecting the best fit processing to the measured data of Q1, Q2, and Q3 with the specified conditions.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Moreover, "the finished size of the ceramic honeycomb dried body" means a finished size of the ceramic honeycomb dried body derived from the finished size required for the ceramic honeycomb structure as a final product.

The ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 is placed on the measurement table 65 at a state that one end face 61 directs downward. Thereby, the one end face 61 is a bottom surface. It is possible to continuously measure the contours of Q1, Q2 and Q3 in the circumferential direction R of the peripheral surface 63 of the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 by rotating this measurement table 65 in the horizontal plane. At the time of rotating the measurement table 65, it makes the outer periphery (the peripheral surface) of the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 rotate in a rotating direction T.

Moreover, spacers 66 are arranged between the measurement<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> table 65 and the one end face 61 of the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50. Since the flatness of each of the end faces 61 and 62 of the honeycomb dried body 50 deteriorates by a cutting and drying operation during forming, there is a possibility that the honeycomb dried body 50 is moved by a centrifugal force at the time of rotating the measurement table 65.

As to the preparing method of the ceramic honeycomb dried body, there is not limited to the following preparing method. That is, as long as the ceramic honeycomb dried body is the one prior to performing the finish processing so that the length in "the direction L from the one end face 61 to another end face 62" (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>) becomes finished size, there is not any special restriction on the preparing method or the like thereof.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">As the preparing method of the ceramic honeycomb dried body, there is a method of preparing a honeycomb formed body by use of a general extrusion-forming method, and drying the obtained honeycomb formed body. The honeycomb formed body is a cylindrical formed body in which<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> a plural number of cells extending from one end face to another end face are defined by partition walls. As the extrusion-forming method, there are an intermittent (ram) extrusion-forming method and a continuous extrusion-forming method. The intermittent extrusion-forming method is a method of kneading a forming raw material containing a ceramic material and a forming auxiliary agent, forming a kneaded clay by a vacuum clay kneader, and then extruding the obtained kneaded clay to prepare the honeycomb formed body. Moreover, the continuous extrusion-forming method is a method of directly forming mixed powder into a kneaded clay, and extruding it to prepare the honeycomb formed body. There is not any special restriction on the ceramic material included in the forming raw material, and it is possible to use a ceramic material used as the forming raw material in a heretofore known method for manufacturing the ceramic honeycomb structure. Examples of the ceramic material include cordierite, a cordierite forming raw material, silicon carbide, and alumina. It is to be noted that the cordierite forming raw material is a ceramic raw material blended so as to obtain a chemical composition in which silica is in a range of 42 to 56 mass%, alumina is in a range of 30 to 45 mass%, and magnesia is in a range of 12 to 16 mass%. The cordierite forming raw material is the one which becomes cordierite by firing. In the extrusion-forming, it is preferable to use a die having a desirable whole shape, cell shape, partition wall thickness, cell<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> density, and the like.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Moreover, the forming raw material contains water becoming a dispersion medium. Furthermore, the forming raw material may contain a pore former, a binder, a dispersant, a surfactant, and the like if necessary. As the pore former, the binder, the dispersant, the surfactant and the like, it is possible to suitably use the ones used in the heretofore known method for manufacturing the ceramic honeycomb structure.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Next, both end portions of the obtained honeycomb formed body are cut. Incidentally, when the honeycomb formed body is cut, it makes the length of each honeycomb formed bodies to be cut in "the direction from the one end face to another end face" long compared with the finished size of the honeycomb structure. A portion of each honeycomb formed body to be cut, which is longer than the finished size, is cut and removed in the finishing step.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Next, it is preferable that the obtained honeycomb formed body is dried to obtain the honeycomb dried body. There is not any special restriction on a drying method, and there is a method including hot air drying, microwave drying, dielectric drying, reduced pressure drying, vacuum drying, and freeze drying and the like. Above all, the dielectric drying, the microwave drying and the hot air<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> drying are preferably performed alone or in combination.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In the ceramic honeycomb dried body obtained in this manner, distortion and an undulation may be generated at the outer periphery at the time of conveying a honeycomb formed body or drying the honeycomb formed body. In the method for manufacturing the ceramic honeycomb structure of the present embodiment, even if the ceramic honeycomb dried body has an undulation face at the outer periphery, the contour can be measured. Therefore, it is possible to judge whether or not the ceramic honeycomb dried body satisfies the specified conditions, and the failed body can beforehand be removed. And thereby, it is possible to omit "the total inspection for the failed lot" to be performed for the honeycomb dried bodies of the same lot as the lot of the honeycomb dried body judged that it "does not satisfy the specified conditions" by the sampling inspection or, at least, to make a percentage of the total inspection (the total inspection percentage) extraordinary small.</p><heading id="h0009">(1-2) Shape verification Step:</heading><p id="p0042" num="0042">In the shape verification step, there is not any special restriction on the measuring method of the contour. For example, the contour can be measured by the laser displacement meter 67 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. As the laser displacement meter 67, a reflective non-contact laser<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> displacement meter can suitably be used. Such a laser displacement meter can measure the contour more accurately with respect to the finished size of the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In the method for manufacturing the ceramic honeycomb structure of the present embodiment, it is preferable that the measurement of the outer shape in the shape verification step is performed by the following method. Firstly, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, there is measured the contour in circumferential direction including the measurement start positions P1, P2, and P3 apart from each other in "the direction L from the one end face 61 to another end face 62" and located on the peripheral surface 63 of the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50. Specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, take respective three portions including the respective measurement start positions P1, P2, and P3 and going around the peripheral surface in the circumferential direction as contour measuring portions Q1, Q2, and Q3. Then, the contours of the ceramic honeycomb dried body at the contour measuring portions Q1, Q2, and Q3 are measured. It is preferable that the portions to be measured are suitably selected in accordance with the specified conditions.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">There is not any special restriction on a temperature of the ceramic honeycomb dried body at the time<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> of measuring the shape of the ceramic honeycomb dried body, but the temperature of the ceramic honeycomb dried body is preferably from 20 to 150°C. However, the temperature of the ceramic honeycomb dried body after drying the ceramic honeycomb formed body is from about 50 to 150°C, and it is also possible to measure the contour after cooling this ceramic honeycomb dried body to room temperature once. However, heat efficiency and operation efficiency deteriorate. In the measurement of the contour described above, it is desirable to correct an influence of the temperature for a measurement result. It is desirable that a thermal expansion coefficient of the ceramic honeycomb dried body including the ceramic material and the forming auxiliary agent is beforehand measured, and "a standard size of outer diameter" of the ceramic honeycomb dried body is corrected to "a standard size of outer diameter" corresponding to the temperature. Owing to the correction of "the standard size of outer diameter", it is possible to perform suitable measurement, even if the temperature of the ceramic honeycomb dried body is from 20 to 150°C. That is, it is possible to provide the ceramic honeycomb dried body after drying the ceramic honeycomb formed body with the measurement of the contour immediately. Thereby, the operation efficiency can further be enhanced.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, it is preferable that the measurement of the contour is performed by placing the<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 on the measurement table 65 capable of placing the object to be measured horizontally. When such a measurement table 65 is used, it is possible to easily measure all the regions in the circumferential direction of the peripheral surface of the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50. That is, it is possible to measure the contours of Q1, Q2 and Q3 of the peripheral surface 63 of the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 simultaneously and continuously by fixing the laser displacement meter 67 and rotating the measurement table 65 on which the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 is placed at 360 degrees in the horizontal plane. The laser displacement meter 67 may be movable. There is not any problem in a measuring method in which the laser displacement meter is moved to Q1, Q2, and Q3 every rotation, as long as productivity is not affected. Moreover, such a measuring method can be considered as follows. That is, even if "the direction L from the one end face 61 to another end face 62" of the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 inclines with respect to a direction orthogonal to the horizontal plane (the vertical direction), the influence of the above inclination is noticeably small at the calculation of the maximum value and minimum value of the contour. Therefore, when the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 is placed on the measurement table 65, "the direction L from the one end face 61 to another end face 62" of the ceramic honeycomb<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> dried body 50 may slightly incline with respect to the direction orthogonal to the horizontal plane (the vertical direction). In the method for manufacturing the ceramic honeycomb structure of the present embodiment, it is preferable that "a height difference of the inclination of the end face 61 of the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 with respect to the horizontal plane" (the height difference of the inclination of the end face) is 4 mm or less at the time of placing the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 on the measurement table 65. Here, the above "height difference of the inclination of the end face" is as follows. The honeycomb dried body 50 is placed on the measurement table 65 so that "the direction L from the one end face 61 to another end face 62" turns in the vertical direction. At this time, a difference between a height of "the highest position in the vertical direction" of the bottom face of the honeycomb dried body 50 from the surface of the measurement table 65 and a height of "the lowest position in the vertical direction" from the surface of the measurement table 65 is "the height difference of the inclination of the end face".</p><heading id="h0010">(1-3) Finishing Step:</heading><p id="p0046" num="0046">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, in the finishing step B, the ceramic honeycomb dried body 50 satisfying the specified conditions is subjected to the finish processing so that the length in "the direction L from the one end face 61 to<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> another end face 62" becomes the finished size m.

Afterward, the ceramic honeycomb dried body subjected to the degreasing is fired to form the ceramic honeycomb structure. There is not any special restriction on degreasing conditions. It is preferable that the degreasing is performed on conditions suitable for the forming raw material of the ceramic honeycomb dried body. For example, it is preferable that the degreasing is performed in accordance with an organic material which is the forming auxiliary agent in the forming raw material, and an additive amount. Examples of the above organic material include an organic binder, dispersant and pore former.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The firing means an operation of sintering the forming raw material in the ceramic honeycomb dried body subjected to the degreasing to acquire a predetermined strength. Since firing conditions (temperature and time)<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> vary in accordance with a type of the ceramic forming raw material, suitable conditions may be selected in accordance with the type. The firing temperature is usually, for example, about 1400 to 1600°C, but is not limited to this. When the degreasing and firing are performed, it is preferable that the firing is continuously performed by raising the temperature in continuity after the degreasing. It is to be noted that the degreasing and the firing may be performed in separate steps.

This is because in the manufacturing methods of Examples 1 to 3, the ceramic honeycomb dried bodies which did not satisfy the specified conditions were removed in a shape verification step, "any honeycomb structures which did not<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> satisfy the specified conditions" were not detected in a honeycomb structure inspection. In the manufacturing methods of Examples 1 to 3, since "the shape verification step" can be continuously performed online (on a production line), the shape verification was able to be effectively performed. In contrast, "the total inspection for the failed lot" was needed to be performed manually offline because the total inspection was not on an automatic inspection line, which was very ineffective. Thus, "the shape verification step" performed online which is inevitably performed in the manufacturing step of the honeycomb structure had much greater advantage obtained by performing an automatic measurement, compared to an inspection performed manually offline.</p><heading id="h0020">Industrial Applicability</heading><p id="p0077" num="0077">A method for manufacturing a ceramic honeycomb structure of the present invention can be utilized in a method for manufacturing the ceramic honeycomb structure utilized as a support for a catalyst device, a filter for purifying exhaust gas or the like.</p><heading id="h0021">Description of Reference Marks</heading><p id="p0078" num="0078">50: ceramic honeycomb dried body, 51: partition wall, 52: cell, 61: one end face, 62: another end face, 63: peripheral surface, 65: measurement table, 66: spacer, 67:<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> laser displacement meter, 70: finished ceramic honeycomb dried body, 100: ceramic honeycomb structure, A: shape verification step, B: finishing step, C: firing step, L: direction (an axial direction) from one end face to another end face, m: finished size, P1, P2 and P3: measurement start position, Q1, Q2 and Q3: contour measuring portion, and T: rotating direction.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977190" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A method for manufacturing a ceramic honeycomb structure comprising:
