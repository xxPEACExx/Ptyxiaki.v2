These errors are often seen over temperature because the strain state of the system, to which the sensors are mounted, changes with expansion and contraction, due to temperature change. Other sources of strain change are also significant enough to have a negative effect on sensors, such as creep under stress or pressure. Changes in output over temperature must be modeled and subtracted from a sensor's output where accuracy is required. Larger strains from a given temperature change are harder to model accurately and may require more computing power and higher-order models. Any relaxation (creep) of the materials due to these strains cannot be modeled and shows up as sensor error.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Mechanical isolators are often used between the sensor and the system to which the sensor is mounted to allow for the strains to be taken up by the isolator rather than passing them on to the sensor. The isolator does this by having a mechanically elastic section between the sensor mount and the system, like a set of springs that always comes back to the same state after being stretched. Isolation features are easy to form in certain materials, such as silicon, but sensors are often made of other materials and the bond between the sensor and isolator creates unwanted stresses.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">The present invention provides a stress isolator that allows a sensor to be attached to materials of the same coefficient of thermal expansion and still provide the required elastic isolation between the sensor and the system to which it is mounted. It does this using microelectromechanical system (MEMS) processing methods and is particularly compatible with MEMS sensors. The isolator is made of two materials, borosilicate glass and silicon. The glass is the same material as the mounting surface of the MEMS sensors. The silicon makes an excellent isolator, being very elastic and easy to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> form into complex shapes. The two materials of the isolator are joined using an anodic bond. The construction of the isolator can be specific to different types of MEMS sensors, making the most of their geometry to reduce overall volume.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In one aspect of the invention, the isolator supports other electrical components necessary to the MEMS sensor, which reduces overall system volume and increases performance by making the electrical paths as short as possible.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Preferred and alternative embodiments of the present invention are described in detail below with reference to the following drawings:</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref> is a side view of a MEMS package formed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURES 2-1 and 2-2</figref> are perspective views of an exemplary glass layer for use in a MEMS package, such as is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref>;</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURES 3-1 and 3-2</figref> are perspective views of an exemplary spring layer for use in a MEMS package, such as is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref>;</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIGURE 4</figref> is a perspective view of an exemplary MEMS component for mounting to the glass layer shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURES 2-1 and 2-2</figref>; and</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIGURES 5-1 and 5-2</figref> are perspective views of the combined components from <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004">FIGURES 2 through 4</figref>.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref> shows an exemplary microelectromechanical system (MEMS) package 20 that is mounted to a circuit board or housing 28. In one embodiment, the MEMS package 20 includes an isolater having a spring layer 30 made of silicon or similar material and a glass layer 32. A frame of the spring layer 30 is bonded (i.e., anodically) to the glass layer 32. Then, the glass layer 32 is bonded to a glass section of the MEMS die 26.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In one embodiment, the MEMS die 26 includes a flange (or cutout) 42 formed by the removal of portions of a cover and device layer. The flange 42 is made of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> glass similar to that of the glass layer 32. The flange 42 is attached to the glass layer 32 using metal pads 46, 48 (as necessary) and gold (or comparable metal) stud bumps 44. A hole that was previously etched or machined into the glass layer 32 allows reception of a portion of the MEMS die 26 that has been mounted in a flip-chip manner. A raft 52 of the silicon spring layer 30 is mounted to the housing 28 using gold (or comparable metal) stud bumps 58. A recess 60 is etched into the spring layer 30 prior to being bonded with the glass layer 32. Other suitable, electrically conductive attachment methods may be used for attaching the MEMS die 26 to the glass layer 32 or the spring layer 30 to the circuit board 28, such as solder, gold-silicon eutectic, or epoxy.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The isolator is a perfect or near-perfect coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) match with the MEMS die 26. The spring layer 30 provides zero or near-zero outgassing and is easily formable into intricate shapes for the proper balance of support and flexibility required to absorb stress, using various photolithography techniques, various isotropic and nonisotropic etchants, and plasma-based techniques, such as deep reactive ion etching. The MEMS die 26 includes a section of borosilicate glass. The silicon is also a close CTE match to the MEMS die glass.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The following describes an exemplary construction process. First, metal patterns are applied to a first surface of a glass wafer, then hole(s) are drilled through the glass wafer. Next, a potassium hydroxide (KOH) etch is performed on a front side of a silicon wafer to create the recess 60. Then, a deep reactive ion etch (DRIE) is performed through the silicon wafer from a back side to create spring structures. Then, the glass wafer is anodically bonded to the silicon wafer. Next, the MEMS sensor is bonded to the isolator, then the isolator is attached to a MEMS package. In one embodiment, the MEMS sensors 26 is bonded to the isolator as a full wafer before dicing or one MEMS sensor at a time is bonded to one isolator after both the isolator wafer and MEMS wafer are diced.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The isolator allows for mounting of support electronics as close to the MEMS device as is possible. This allows for the least noise and smallest power<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> consumption. By properly patterning metal on the glass layer 32, various kinds of surface-mount electrical devices, in die or packaged form, can be mounted.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2-1</figref> shows a top perspective view of an exemplary isolator glass layer 32-1 that has been etched to provide a window that is framed on two opposing sides by flanges 64.

The springs 72 attach at one end to a different interior edge of the window 66 and at a second end to a different exterior edge of the raft 70. <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURE 3-2</figref> shows an optional metal pad 74 that is attached to an underside of the raft 70. The metal pad 74 is later used to mount to a circuit board or housing via stud bumps (such as are shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref>) or other suitable attachment methods such as solder, gold-silicon eutectic, or epoxy.

Flanges 42-1 have been formed from one end of the MEMS die 26-1, such that the flanges 42-1 reside near an intermediate section of the MEMS die 26-1. Metalized pads 46-1 are either applied to the flanges 42-1 or are previously applied to an intermediate/device layer of the MEMS die 26-1 and become exposed upon removal of material of the section adjacent the intermediate/device layer. The metallized pads 46-1 electrically connect to active components within the MEMS die 26-1.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIGURES 5-1 and 5-2</figref> show the isolator glass layer 32-1 bonded to the spring layer 30-1 and the MEMS die 26-1 bonded to the isolator glass layer 32-1. The metalized pads 48-1 and 46-1 are bonded together, using stud bumps (not shown), in order to attach the MEMS die 26-1 to the isolator glass layer 32-1. Also, electrical components 80 are attached to the metallized pads 50-1. An example of the connection between the metalized pads 48-1, 46-1 and their respective surfaces are SiAu eutectic bonds.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In one embodiment, the MEMS die is mounted face up. Leads on the MEMS die are wirebonded to metal pads on the isolator or directly out to the circuit board/package. In another embodiment, the MEMS die has pads on its top surface and is flip-chip mounted to the glass on the isolator. A low-stress electrical connection from the isolator glass is then made, such as wirebonds.<br/>
