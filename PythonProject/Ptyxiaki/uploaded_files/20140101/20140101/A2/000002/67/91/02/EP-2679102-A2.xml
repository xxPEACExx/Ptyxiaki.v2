num="0002">Vanilla extracts comprising vanillin and other flavor compounds are produced by subjecting ripe green vanilla beans to a curing and extraction process.

The cured beans can than be extracted to form a liquid vanilla extract.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The enzymatic reactions in the vanilla beans from its precursor glucovanillin to vanillin are believed to be mainly caused by residual plant enzymes, in particular glucosidase enzymes.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The glucovanillin content in perfectly matured vanilla beans is about 10% per weight of dried vanilla beans on average, which can be theoretically converted into a maximum of 4.84% vanillin assuming complete conversion and no losses. Usually, much lower yields are obtained, especially in traditional processes.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Traditional so-called "curing" processes involve scalding, sweating and<br/>
a long conditioning step that lasts several weeks or months and employs naturally occurring enzymatic reactions.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Prior to sweating and conditioning, the beans usually are subjected to a short (e.g. three minutes) step of scalding in hot water at about 65°C.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">During the sweating step, exposure to heat in a humid atmosphere to prevent drying out of beans allows naturally occurring enzymes to convert various precursors including glucovanillin to vanilla flavor components including vanillin.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">During the conditioning period which usually lasts many weeks or months, the beans are very slowly dried to allow natural enzymatic reactions to continue. This step involves repeated quality controls and depends on the environmental conditions.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">While the sensory profile/flavor of the resulting extracts can be excellent, even under optimal conditions the vanillin yield is very low and usually up to about 2.2% per dry weight of vanilla beans.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Less time consuming processes known in the art either result in a similarly low average vanillin yield, and/or the sensory profile is not acceptable, lacking in complex vanilla aroma and/or containing undesirable off-notes to an extent that almost completely overpowers the vanillin taste even if the yield of vanillin is relatively high, and results in an artificial note not associated with the typical aroma of a vanilla extract formed by traditional several months long curing methods.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">For example, some known shorter processes add enzymes to green vanilla beans, for example as described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2004091316A"><text>WO 2004/091316</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5705205A"><text>US 5,705,205</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2004091316A"><text>WO 2004/091316</text></patcit> describes a combined treatment of extraction and subsequent enzymatic reaction based on green vanilla beans. The enzymatic process employs enzymes with a high lytic activity and a marked cellulase activity (unlike for example beta-glucosidase). These lytic enzymes are used to release the vanillin formed during browning from the plant cells by lysis of the plant cell walls. The accelerated browning step of 0.5 to 7 days is performed by freezing of green vanilla beans followed by thawing, or alternatively, when accepting a lower vanillin yield, by shortly scalding in water at 60°C to 65°C and a subsequent sweating step, incubating the scalded beans at 15°C to 45°C until brown for a similar time.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5705205A"><text>US 5,705,205</text></patcit> describes an enzymatic process wherein green freshly harvested beans are hydrated to be ground in water and subjected to various enzymes including, among others, β-glucosidase, the latter to hydrolyze glucovanillin to vanillin.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">While improved organoleptically when compared to some earlier enzymatic processes, ripe green (i.e. "uncured") vanilla beans processed according to known enzymatic processes of short duration (several days up to about a week) still do not develop a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> comparably complex aroma when compared to traditional curing processes that last for several weeks or months.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Accordingly, there remains a need for a short process that can provide a vanilla bean extract with a good vanillin yield, with an improved sensory profile having a more complex vanilla aroma without off-notes.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In particular, a complex vanilla aroma should comprise a low concentration of desirable phenolic notes (as they will be perceived to be overpowering otherwise), and lack or minimize the very dominant fatty acid off-notes and green off-notes often associated with extracts made from green vanilla beans (rather than cured vanilla beans).</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Both traditional curing and the shorter enzymatic processes keep the vanilla beans moist for a significant duration of the process to allow the residual plant enzymes and/or added enzymes to do their work, converting glucovanillin to vanillin.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">Applicant discovered that when green vanilla beans are first dried quickly within about 24 hours to a low moisture content of about 10%, and only afterwards subjected to an enzymatic treatment employing b-glucosidase, vanilla extracts with a good vanillin yield and a complex well-balanced vanilla aroma without off-notes can be formed.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Provided is the following:

Alternatively, the enzymatically processed vanilla bean material can be extracted afterwards.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Furthermore, without wishing to be bound by theory, applicant discovered that one factor on vanillin yield of vanilla beans is the presence of certain bacteria. The first heating/drying step also contributes to reduce these microorganisms and avoids the early formation of vanillin (which appears to be formed to a significant extent by bacterial enzymes rather than plant enzymes), thereby avoiding the degradation of vanillin by microorganisms that sets in at higher vanillin concentrations, to avoid its toxicity.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> Therefore, to maximize yield, the beans should be dried to a moisture content of about 10% as quickly as possible.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Optionally, to further maximize vanillin yield, the process may be performed with vanilla beans high in glucovanillin (i.e. high in vanillin precursor but low in vanillin). Ideally, the glucovanillin should be at least 6% or higher, for example at least 7%, at least 8%, or at least 10%. Accordingly, beans from <i>Vanilla planifolia</i> are preferred, while beans from <i>V</i>. <i>pompona,</i> and <i>V. tahitensis</i> usually do not have a sufficient glucovanillin concentration.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Optionally, to ensure the development of a fully-developed well-balanced complex aroma the extraction steps should be performed before conversion of glucovanillin to vanillin (rather than afterwards). Again without wishing to be bound by theory, the extraction prior to the enzymatic incubation reduces the microorganisms otherwise present during the enzyme treatment which appears to contribute to the development of a well-balanced complex aroma.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The vanilla bean products including, without limitation, vanilla extracts described herein provide a well-developed, well-balanced complex flavor profile comprising the major vanilla flavor compounds. Major vanilla flavor compounds include, without limitation, phenolic compounds, furan compounds, fatty acid compounds, compounds formed by reaction with ethanol, and acetaldehyde diethyl acetal.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Phenolic vanilla flavor compounds include, without limitation, acetovanillone alpha-ethoxy-p-cresol, benzoic acid, guaiacol, 4-methylguaiacol, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, methylparaben, methyl vanillate, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol 5-methoxyvanillin, phenol, Vanillin, vanillic acid, vanillyl alcohol, vanillyl ethyl ether, and p-vinylphenol.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">These phenolic vanilla flavor compounds, in particular guaiacol, should be present in a low concentration so that they do not dominate resulting in an unbalanced flavor.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Furan vanilla flavor compounds include, without limitation, 2-furfural, 2-furfurol 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furfural, 5-methyl-2-furfural, 2-hydroxyfuraneol, gamma-butyrolactone (dihydro 2(3H)-furanone.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Fatty acid vanilla flavor compounds include, without limitation, linoleic acid, and palmitic acid.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Vanilla flavor compounds that are formed by the reaction with ethanol include, without limitation, etyl acetate, ethyl glycolyte, ethyl lactate, ethyl linoleate, ethyl pyrovate, ethyl levulinate, and diethylsuccinate.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">A vanilla extract consists substantially of extractive matter of vanilla beans from plants of the genus vanilla, and optionally a solvent. For example, certain sugars may be added in some countries. Solvents include, without limitation, alcohol/ethanol, and water. Solvents that are not food grade have to be removed or sufficiently reduced in concentration to form the end product sold to the consumer according to nationally differing regulatory requirements.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">There are currently three major cultivars of the genus vanilla grown globally, all derived from a species originally found in Mesoamerica: <i>Vanilla planifolia</i> (V. planifolia, syn.

The majority of the world's vanilla that is produced is the <i>V. planifolia</i> variety, grown in a small region of the east African nation of Madagascar and Indonesia, and which when produced in Madagascar is more commonly known as "Madagascar-Bourbon" vanilla.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Vanilla spec. include, without limitation, <i>V. planifolia, V. tahitensis, V. pompona,</i> and hybrids of these or other vanilla spec. plants, for example, without limitation, hybrids of <i>V. planifolia</i> and <i>V. pompona.</i></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Vanilla beans require about 6 months to fully develop on the vine, during which stage the beans are green in color. At the end of the growing stage the beans are still green with a small yellow tip and sometimes referred to as "blossom-end yellow" or "mature", which is the stage at which mature or ripe green beans are harvested. When traditionally cured, they turn from green to brown. A green vanilla bean therefore is a<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> mature uncured bean._The green ripe vanilla beans should be completely ripe for maximum glucovanillin content. This can be tested by visual inspection (green beans with yellow tip). To further optimize yield, the glucovanillin concentration may be tested. A suitable glucovanillin concentration is from about 6% or higher.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The vanilla beans are comminuted by any suitable means to render them to pieces, for example, without limitation, about 1-2.5 cm long. Any suitable tool or mechanism may be employed. For example, the beans may be cut or chopped. The cuts generally proceed transversely of the long axes of the beans though other directions are possible as well.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The process of forming a vanilla extract comprises drying comminuted green ripe beans at a drying temperature of about 65°C to about 120°C for at least about one hour or until a moisture content of less than 10% is reached. A suitable drying temperature, for example, includes from about 80°C to 90°C. Drying may be facilitated by forced air, applying a vacuum, or any other means that do not burn or roast the beans.<br/>
The temperature needs to be high enough to reduce vanillin-degrading microorganisms, including, without limitation, <i>Bacillus subtilis,</i> for example, 65°C and above, but below a temperature where the beans burn. The latter will also depend on the residual moisture content that will drop during the drying process, e.g. drying can be started at 120°C but the temperature will be adjusted to a lower temperature of 65°C to 100°C once the beans are drier and before they start to burn. The beans should reach a moisture concentration of less than 10% (w/w). Moisture content can be easily determined, e.g. using an infrared oven/moisture analyzer and weighing before and after drying, comparing a partially dried bean to a ground and completely dried bean. Depending on the initial temperature and degree of temperature reduction during drying, the duration of drying will vary. It usually takes not more than 24 hours, which is sufficient time to reduce the microorganims to an acceptable level so that produced vanillin is not significantly degraded in the subsequent steps including during the enzymatic reaction. If more time is available, whole beans may be dried more slowly at a lower temperature, for example at about 60°C, but this is less preferred since it will allow more microbial organisms, including <i>Bacillus subtilis,</i> to survive and thereby lower vanillin yield.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The dried vanilla beans are ground in a grinder and extracted with a solvent.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Any solvent able to bring vanillin and/or additional vanilla flavors into solution can be used.

If a food-grade solvent is used it does not need to be removed afterwards, which is more efficient particularly in the final process steps.

Too much enzyme will not have an additional benefit and may introduce off-tastes. To little enzyme will lengthen the time required for the enzymatic process to reach an acceptable vanillin yield. The optimal amount of enzyme can be easily determined and adjusted accordingly.<br/>
