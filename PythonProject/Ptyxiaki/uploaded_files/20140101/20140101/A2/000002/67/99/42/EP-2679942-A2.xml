A refrigerator may be provided with an ice maker for generating ice.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, in a case of a side by side type refrigerator which has a refrigerating compartment and a freezing compartment on right and left sides inside a body of the refrigerator, respectively, an ice maker may be provided inside the freezing compartment. The ice maker generates ice with a cooling energy inside the freezing compartment.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, in order to make ice in a side by side type refrigerator of this structure, the whole area inside a freezing compartment should be cooled down below freezing temperatures so that time and energy are inefficiently consumed.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Further, since a freezing compartment is closed by a freezing compartment door which is rotatably connected to a body of a refrigerator, the freezing compartment door should be opened in order to extract the ice inside the freezing compartment. Once the freezing compartment door is opened, the cooling energy inside the freezing compartment is easily discharged to an outside because the whole open front portion of the freezing compartment is exposed to the outside.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Additionally, the above-noted problem may occur in other types of refrigerators where an ice making compartment is provided in a refrigerating compartment and an ice maker inside the ice making compartment generates ice using other sources of cooling energy rather than a cooling air inside the refrigerating compartment, since the refrigerating compartment door is opened in order to extract the ice inside the ice making compartment of the refrigerating compartment, resulting in leakage of the cooling energy inside the refrigerating compartment.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present disclosure relates to a structure of a side by side type refrigerator which makes ice rapidly.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present disclosure also relates to a structure of a side by side type refrigerator which minimizes a leakage of a cooling energy inside the refrigerator when an ice bucket is inserted into or drawn from the refrigerator.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present disclosure further relates to a structure of a side by side type refrigerator with an ice maker and a dispenser which has a simplified water supplying pipe and a water supplying system with enhanced reliability.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Additional aspects and/or advantages will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure, a refrigerator includes a body;

The position of the freezing compartment 30 and the refrigerating compartment 31 may be changed with each other. The ice making compartment 32 is formed between the freezing compartment 30 and the refrigerating compartment 31 inside the body 10. The water tank compartment 33 is formed below the ice making compartment 32 between the freezing compartment 30 and the refrigerating compartment 31 inside the body 10.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The freezing compartment 30 is formed with its front portion open, and the open front portion of the freezing compartment 30 can be closed by a freezing compartment door 34 which is rotatably connected to the body 10.
