The invention also relates to a method for assembling a sharp angled corner of a lamp housing onto a vehicle metal body part; which may be a vehicle rear closure assembly. Such rear closures may comprise a one- or two-piece tailgate, a hatch, a boot lid or at least one rear door; but for convenience, the rear closure assembly will henceforth be described and illustrated as a tailgate. Hence, the invention also relates to a method of assembling a vehicle tailgate structure, and to a vehicle including such a tailgate structure.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Passenger vehicles such as cars and sports utility vehicles (SUVs) usually have a hinged tailgate at the rear of the vehicle that can be opened to provide access to the passenger compartment and/or to a luggage compartment. The tailgate may support a pair of lamp assemblies (known as rear "combi" lamps), each containing a cluster of lamps including, e.g. the tail lamps, direction indicators, brake lamps, fog lamps and/or reversing lamps. The lamp assemblies are usually mounted adjacent the outermost side edges of the tailgate. Additional lamp assemblies may be fitted to the rear wings (or fenders) of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is common for the housing of a lamp assembly to be moulded from plastic with a reflective inner surface, and to include a coloured plastic lens in a sealed unit. The lamp assembly may be installed into a pressed metal recess that has been<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> welded to the main vehicle metallic body, or to a tailgate, hatch, or other panel.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The lamp assembly housing generally has sufficient depth to enable a space within the housing to hold all of the lamp's internal structure. It is this depth, when mounted into a metal body part, which determines the body pressing radius around the periphery of the recess; i.e. the greater the depth of the housing to be accommodated, the greater the radius of the corners of the pressed recess must be, so that an adequately deep recess may be pressed without risk of tearing the metal.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In this context, the depth of the lamp cluster is the dimension from the visible outer surface thereof to the innermost surface, which is concealed within the vehicle bodywork. This dimension would generally be measured along, or parallel to, the length or longitudinal axis of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For stylistic reasons, it may be desirable to have a sharp corner (e.g. substantially less than 90 degrees internal angle) for an inboard side of the lens but, because a large radius must be present in the pressed metal to receive the lamp housing, the only way to achieve a sharp corner effect is for the lens plastic to extend substantially beyond the edge of the lamp housing to overhang the pressed metal corner. This results in a poor appearance, as the back panel metal is visible through the translucent coloured lens, giving an undesirable variety of aesthetic effects with different body paint colours. Furthermore, the unsupported portion of the lens is exposed to potential damage. The unsupported lens, due to the brittleness of the material, can<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> be damaged with minimal force; and cannot be dimensionally controlled with sufficient accuracy for an optimal fit and finish. From a design perspective, this arrangement is unsatisfactory, because the lamp housing edge must be as close to the lens periphery as possible; so that light from within the lamp housing makes use of substantially the whole surface area of the lens.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention proposes an assembly of a lamp unit to a vehicle metal body part, and a method of assembling the same that allows for incorporation in the design of a sharp corner at an inboard side of the lens, without the associated exposure to damage and/or incomplete use of its translucent surface for transmitting light from within the lamp housing.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In one broad aspect, the invention entails an assembly of a lamp unit to a vehicle metal body part, wherein said lamp unit comprises a lamp housing with a sharp corner, and said vehicle body part comprises a pressed metal recess at a side of the vehicle for receiving said lamp unit, at least one corner of said pressed metal recess having an oversized radius to accommodate the full depth of the lamp housing at the sharp corner; and said assembly further includes a finisher element mounted with, against or adjacent the sharp corner to cover the oversized corner radius of the recess.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the invention, the assembly provides a structure where the pressed recess of the metal body has a large enough radius to accommodate the full depth of the lamp housing, but also keeps the housing of the lamp close to the lens periphery, even though it will have a sharp corner. This is achieved by utilising a lamp housing, sealed with a lens, wherein the lens periphery is smaller than the mating metal<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> body pressed (recessed) area. In practice, the large radius required for the depth of press is hidden by a finisher element (or finisher panel) fitted adjacent to the lamp assembly. Where the finisher element is fitted to a tailgate, it may, for example, cover number plate lights, and may carry the vehicle maker or model name. Where the finisher element is fitted to a vehicle wing or fender, it may be a vehicle bumper. Vehicle bumpers are generally increasing in size, and are therefore used to cover an increasing range of vehicle parts and features.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In an example, the lamp housing includes a flange that protrudes from an inner side wall thereof, and overlaps behind the finisher element. When assembled, this means that none of the metal body of the vehicle adjacent to the lamp assembly is visible in any tolerance condition. According to the invention, the vehicle has its required styling intention of having a sharp corner on one side of the rear lamp assembly, which may be an inboard side. Since there is no lens overhang or unsupported portion, the lamp assembly achieves a robust structure; and the functional components of the assembly are hidden from view. As existing parts are used for two purposes, there is no need for additional parts acting as covers.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In an example, the oversized radius of the corner of the pressed metal recess extends the recess toward the inboard side of the vehicle only. In other words, the lamp housing fits snugly with the recess so that the lens is continuous with the bodywork on all sides, except the exposed opening necessary to accommodate the sharp corner, which opening is later covered by the finisher element.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In an example, the vehicle lamp housing including a plurality of walls that form an open-sided lamp compartment for receiving one or more lamps; a lens having at least one sharp corner and sealed at its peripheral edges with the walls of the housing to close the lamp compartment; and a flange extending outwards from at least one of the walls of the lamp housing adjacent the sharp corner of the lens.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In further examples, the sharp corner on the lamp housing may subtend an angle of less than seventy, forty, or fifteen degrees; and may have a radius of less than fifteen, ten, or five millimetres.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to a second aspect, the invention provides a method for assembling a sharp angled corner of a lamp housing into a vehicle metal body part including: providing a pressed recess in the metal of the vehicle body part, wherein the radius of a corner of the pressed recess corresponding to the sharp angled corner of the lamp housing is large enough to accommodate the full depth of the lamp housing into the pressed recess; installing a lamp housing into the pressed recess; and installing a finisher element onto the vehicle metal body part, said finisher element being located against or adjacent to the sharp angled corner of the lamp housing, to cover the exposed corner radius of the pressed recess.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A vehicle lamp assembly according to the present invention will be hereafter described by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein:-

Further contours are pressed into the metal bodywork as is the usual practice, e.g. to receive additional components such as a finisher element 13. It is also common for a series of openings 11a to remain in the recess portion 11 so that the lamp housing can be accessed from inside the vehicle, e.g. for replacing light bulbs.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to the invention, the pressed metal recess portion 11 is formed at its inboard side to be larger than it needs to be to accommodate the corresponding inboard side of a lamp housing 14. It is noteworthy that the "corner" 15 of the pressed metal recess 11 does not have a sharp edge (as it would not be possible to press such a shape into the metal using available manufacturing techniques), but has a curvature of such a size as to enable the required depth to be achieved. The provision of a corner radius to accommodate depth of draw is well known in the art of metal working.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The curvature 16 of corner 15 is best illustrated by <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4a. <b>Figure 4a</b></figref> also clearly shows the extent to which the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> recess 11 is intended to be larger than the inboard side 17 of the lamp housing 14.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Figure 3</b></figref> generally illustrates the lamp housing 14 in place within recess 11, such that the lens 18 smoothly meets the bodywork 12 at the upper (12U) and lower (12L) edges, which may include corresponding curvatures and other features, according to functional and styling requirements. Particularly, the angled edge 17 of the lens 18 stylistically abuts an arch feature 19 pressed into the body work 12 of the tailgate.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The oversized nature of the recess 11 at its corner 15 is evident in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>. In the illustrated embodiment, there is an open area 11F extending in the inboard direction only, towards the longitudinal centre line of the vehicle (X-X in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>). Open area 11F extends substantially parallel to lens edge 17, and does not return to meet the housing 14 until adjacent the wide angled lower corner 23. However, any suitable shape of the open area 11F may be possible, so long as it accommodates all of the sharp angle of the housing/lens corner. For example, the corner radius 16 (<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4a</figref>) may direct the inboard edge of recess 11 to curve quickly back toward the wall of housing 14 long before the lower corner 23 is reached.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the illustrated and preferred embodiment of the invention, the lamp housing 14 generally fits snugly into the pressed recess 11, so that the lens 18 is close to and co-planar with the body work over most of its periphery, with only an exposed inboard side 18F to be subsequently hidden by the finisher element 13.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As illustrated, a flange 20 (<figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">3</figref>) is provided to extend from an inner sidewall 14F of housing 14 (preferably located near to the join 14J with lens 18). This flange 20 substantially covers open area 11F, which results from the oversized inboard dimension of recess 11 in relation to the inboard side of housing 14. Preferably, flange 20 will be integrally moulded with the inner lamp housing wall 14F; and will be dark in colour to disguise the small remaining gap between the lamp assembly 14 and the finisher element 13 when the vehicle is fully assembled.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0003"><b>Figure 4b</b></figref> illustrates the rear vehicle/tailgate structure wherein the finisher element 13 visible in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref> has been installed (usually by suitable fasteners or by a snap fit structure) to be closely adjacent to the installed lamp housing. It will be apparent that, in accordance with the purpose of the invention, the assembled structure is able to have a relatively sharp corner 21 on the lens, which is fully supported by the lamp housing to which it is sealed (indicated by the dashed lines 22). Furthermore, any gap between the finisher element 13 and the lens 18 is underlaid by the flange 20, which is shown exposed in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4a</figref>.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0003"><b>Figure 5</b></figref> illustrates a plan sectional view of the assembled components, where it can be seen that edge 17 of lens 18 is supported by the sidewall structure 14F of lamp housing 14; and how flange 20 overlaps behind the finisher element 13, which is in turn affixed (not shown) to the vehicle bodywork 12. The oversized inboard dimension of recess 11 (welded to bodywork 12 at joint 11J) is clearly evident by the gap G formed between lamp housing 14 and the inner portion of recess 11. Numeral 14R denotes a reflector, mounted within lamp housing 14. It will be noted that housing 14 and lens 18<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> are shown overlapping each other in this Figure at joint 14J; this is because these two parts are welded together during assembly of the vehicle lamp unit.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In further embodiments of the invention, it may be possible to omit either the flange, or the separate finisher element, such that the open area caused by the oversized corner is covered by the other element. For example, the flange moulded integrally with the lamp housing may extend to become a finisher element in a direction towards the centre of the rear of the vehicle. Alternatively, the finisher element may extend to meet with the lamp housing; or may extend into a slot formed in the sidewall thereof. Either solution covers the exposed metal void (open area 11F) found near the sharp angle of the lens.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Although it is conventional for the pressed metal recess to be a part separate to the tailgate, not least because it can then be made from a steel particularly suited to deep pressing, the recess may be stamped into the tailgate itself.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The tailgate or rear lamp assembly according to the invention generally utilises available manufacturing capabilities and materials known in the art. However, it enables extreme styling features (e.g. sharp corners on a lens) to be incorporated without compromising the robustness of components.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56977517" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An assembly of a lamp unit to a vehicle metal body part (12), wherein said lamp unit comprises a lamp housing (14) with a sharp corner (21), and said vehicle body part (12) comprises a pressed metal recess (11) at a side of the vehicle (1) for receiving said lamp unit, at least one corner of said pressed metal recess (11) having an oversized radius (16) to accommodate the full depth of the lamp housing (14) at the sharp corner (21); and said assembly further includes a finisher element (13) mounted with, against or adjacent the sharp corner (21) to cover the oversized corner radius (16) of the recess (11).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0002" num="0002"><claim-text>An assembly according to claim 1, wherein the lamp housing (14) includes a flange (20) extending from a side wall (14F) thereof adjacent the sharp corner (21) to overlap with the finisher element (13).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0003" num="0003"><claim-text>An assembly according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the lamp unit includes a lens (18) joined at its periphery (17) with the lamp housing (14), the joint extending up to the sharp corner (21).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0004" num="0004"><claim-text>An assembly according to claim 3, wherein the lamp lens (18) is substantially co-planar in the area of the sharp corner (21) with a surface (12U) of the body part (12) to which the lamp unit is assembled.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0005" num="0005"><claim-text>An assembly according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the oversized radius (16) extends the recess (11) toward the inboard side of the vehicle (1) only.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0006" num="0006"><claim-text>An assembly according to any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the lamp housing (14) includes:
