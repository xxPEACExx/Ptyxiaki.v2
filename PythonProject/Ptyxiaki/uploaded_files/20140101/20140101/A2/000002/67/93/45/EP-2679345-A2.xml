Because of the nature of the compressed air power source and the expense involved in heavy duty industrial fastener driving tools, such tools are generally not suitable for use in fastening jobs where maneuvering is required, space is limited, or compressed air is not available. Manually operated fastener driving tools are also used in industrial applications. However, in many of the jobs where manually operated fastener driving tools are used, considerable operator fatigue may be involved because a manual fastener driving tool requires a large user actuation force.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A carton closing tool of the embodiments herein includes adjustment members that adjust the tool to accommodate various staple sizes and tool drive characteristics without requiring the use of hand tools. The present invention incorporates these tool free adjustment members in a stapling tool for blind fastening of cardboard, typically packing boxes. Tools of this type contain a set of two movable anvils as part of a mechanism, such that when a staple is driven, the anvils penetrate the cardboard workpiece to clinch the staple legs and are subsequently automatically retracted.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Packaging tools commonly include different adjustment devices that can affect at least one of the following: the staple leg length accepted by the tool, the tightness of the clinch, and the depth of drive. Most existing adjustment members require hand tools to actuate the adjustment members. In the embodiments described herein, the same adjustments can be made with the novel adjustment members of the present invention that do not require hand tools for adjustment.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided fastener driving tool, comprising: a housing; a drive track within the housing; a magazine connected to the housing and configured to hold a supply of fasteners and to provide a leading fastener to the drive track; a driver configured to move downward in the drive track<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> and drive the leading fastener into a workpiece during a drive stroke, and upward in the drive track during a return stroke; a mount connected to the driver; a clinching assembly operatively connected to the housing and to the mount, the clinching assembly being configured to engage the leading fastener during the drive stroke and move into a clinching position at the end of the drive stroke to clinch the fastener to the workpiece; and an adjuster configured to adjust the clinching assembly to accommodate fasteners having different lengths.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The numerous advantages of the present invention may be better understood by those skilled in the art by reference to the accompanying figures.

Attaching to the tool body 2 is a removable magazine 10 which stores the fasteners, such as staples, prior to driving, and a tool base 3 that contacts the workpiece surface during use.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, the tool includes a variable clinch adjustment thumbwheel 5 that controls the downstroke position of the clincher arms in the clinching assembly of the tool. The variable clinch adjustment thumbwheel 5 has a gripping surface with grooves that allow the user to securely grasp the thumbwheel. By turning the thumbwheel, in a first direction or a second direction, the tool increases or decreases the space between the clinching arms in the downstroke, and thereby increases or decreases the tightness of the formed staple legs.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Another adjustment member is a positionable leg length adjustment dial 7. The dial 7 is rotatable and changes the pivot axis of the clincher arms of the clincher<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> assembly between a first setting for a staple having a first length to a second setting for a staple having a second length without the use of hand tools.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A further adjustment member is a depth of drive dial 9. The depth of drive dial rotates between a range of positions to change how deep the staple can be fired to penetrate the workpiece.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the tool illustrating the crank arm 34 and the motor 26 that provides power to the tool for driving the staple. Power from the motor is transferred through a gear reduction mechanism 28 to a crank arm 34 and connecting rod 36. The connecting rod 36 is linked to a driver mounting block 22, on which is mounted the driver blade 23 and a clincher linkage 42 of a clinching assembly 40.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 3, 4, and 5</figref> show the driving assembly and fastener closing mechanism in the form of a clinching assembly that drives and clinches, respectively, the staple into the workpiece. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> shows the driving assembly in the upstroke position where the clinching assembly is in the open position. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref> show the progression of the driving and clinching assemblies and how they move toward the downward stroke. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref> illustrates the driving assembly in the downward stroke wherein the clinching assembly is positioned to be closed around a staple.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The crank arm 34 rotates using power provided by the motor 26 to the gear reduction mechanism 28. Rotation of the crank arm 34 pulls and pushes a connecting rod 36 around an upper pivot pin 37, which translates the circular motion of the connecting rod into the linear reciprocating motion of a driver mounting block 22, which may be referred to as a mount. The driver mounting block 22 is linked to the driver blade 23, which pushes the staple into the workpiece. In an embodiment, the driver mounting block 22 may be integral with the driver blade 23. The driver mounting block 22 additionally pushes a pair of clincher linkages 42 in an outward direction away from the driver mounting block. At the end of each clincher linkage is a clincher arm that is pivotable about a pivot pin 48 on the clincher linkage 42. The pivotable movement of the clincher arm forces clincher anvils 46 toward each other to close the clinching assembly around the staple forcing the staple legs to bend toward each other to close the staple in position within the workpiece.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 6 and 7</figref> show the driving and clinching mechanism in a cross-sectional view. During operation, the crank arm 34 is rotated by the output shaft of the motor gearbox. The crank arm pulls a connecting rod 36, which translates the rotation into a linear reciprocating motion of a driver mounting block 22. The driver mounting block in turn pushes the driver 23, which pushes the staple into the workpiece. The driver mounting block additionally pushes two clincher linkages 42 which in turn rotate two clincher arms 44 about a pivot pin 48 in order to clinch the staple legs.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 8 and 9</figref> show the driver blade 23 and clincher arms 44, namely clincher arm 44a and clincher arm 44b, at the bottom of the drive stroke in two different positions for driving staples of different leg lengths. In <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 8</figref>, the leg length adjustment dial 7 is set in a first setting for a first length staple leg. In <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 9</figref>, the leg length adjustment dial 7 is set in a second setting for a second length staple leg. In an embodiment, the first length staple can be shorter than a second length staple. Alternatively, in an embodiment, the first length staple can be longer than the second length staple. Long leg staples have legs that longer than the short leg staples, and allow for deeper penetration into thicker workpieces. The leg length adjustment dial 7 controls the depth of the clinch to accommodate workpieces of different thicknesses by changing the centers of rotation for the clincher arms 44, within the tool, to be closer to the workpiece. Accordingly, when the user turns the leg length adjustment dial 7 by hand, the dial 7 rotates the lower pivot pin 48 180-degrees, which changes the centers of rotation for the clincher arms 44 vertically and horizontally via two cam lobes 56, 58 on the pivot pin 48. In the long leg setting, the clincher anvils 46 extend deeper into the workpiece and come closer to each other than in the short-leg setting as a result of the centers of rotation moving lower and horizontally towards the opposite clincher arms 44.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0006">Figures 10 and 11</figref> further show the leg length adjustment mechanism described above. In <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 10</figref>, the pivot pin 48 is in a long leg setting. In <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 11</figref>, the pivot pin 48 is in a short leg setting. The pivot pin 48 has two cam lobes 56, 58. The cam lobes 56, 58 serve as the centers of rotation for the clincher arms 44, which clinch the staple during tool actuation. In <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 10</figref>, the cam lobes 56, 58 are disposed at a position higher in the tool, that is, further from the workpiece than the pivot pin 48. The axes L1 of the cam lobes are therefore higher than the axis of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> pivot pin in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 10</figref>. Each on the respective side of its mating clincher arm 44a, 44b. This causes the clincher arms 44a, 44b to be positioned further within the tool with respect to the workpiece and further apart at the conclusion of the downstroke. In <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 11</figref>, the cam lobes 56, 58 are shown at a 180 degree difference from that of <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 10</figref>. The cam lobes in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 11</figref> are lower in the tool, that is, closer to the workpiece than the pivot pin. The axes L2 of the cam lobes are therefore lower than the axis of the pivot pin in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 11</figref>. Accordingly, the clincher arms are closer together at the conclusion of the downstroke.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0007">Figures 12 and 13</figref> show the driver blade 23 and clincher arms 44 at the bottom of the drive stroke as the clinch tightness adjustment is made. <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 12</figref> shows the clinch adjustment knob 5 set to a loose clinch, and <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 13</figref> shows the knob set to a tight clinch. When the user rotates the clinch adjustment thumbwheel, the lower pivot pin 48 is moved vertically, which in turn moves the centers of rotation for the clincher arms 44 vertically. The effect of this movement is that, at the bottom of the drive stroke, the clincher arms 44 are closer to the driver blade 23 by a distance K2, and the clincher anvils 46 are closer together in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 13</figref> as compared to <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 12</figref>, where the clincher arms are farther from the driver blade by a distance K1.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 14 and 15</figref> show the clinch adjustment in a loose setting and tight setting, respectively. In a loose setting, at the bottom of the drive stroke, the clincher arms are farther apart from each other than in a tight setting where the clincher arms are closer to each other. The pivot pin 48 and the clinch adjustment thumbwheel 5 are moved. In <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 15</figref>, the pivot pin 48 is positioned higher in the tool, that is, a distance D2 that is further from the workpiece, as compared to distance D1 in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 14</figref>. The placement of the pivot pin farther away from the workpiece causes the clincher arms 44 to pivot further inward, thus coming closer to each other during the clinching of the staple and closer to the driver blade 23 than the arrangement of the clincher arms 44 in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 14</figref>.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0009">Figures 16 and 17</figref> show the tool from the rear in a cross-sectional view as the depth of drive adjustment is made. The depth of drive adjustment dial 9 is rotated by hand, which turns a drive adjustment shaft 15. The drive adjustment shaft 15 turns a pair of depth of drive cam lobes 60, 62 on each side of tool which raises and lower the housing 4 of the tool. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 16</figref>, the depth of drive cam lobe 60 is<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> integral with the depth of drive dial 9. Alternatively, the cam lobe 60 can be separate from the dial 9. The depth of drive cam lobe 62 is located at an opposite side of the shaft 15. Raising and lowering of the housing 4 of the tool also moves the motor-gear reduction housing, the driving assembly and the clinching assembly vertically with respect to the staple magazine 10 and base 3.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The fastener driving device described here represents an improvement over stapling machines of the movable anvil type which typically require tools for the adjustment of staple size or drive characteristics.
