present invention relates in first instance to a guiding component.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In particular, the present invention relates to such a guiding component which is intended for guiding a window sash part, with respect to a window casing during a movement of the window sash, which is a rotational or translational movement or a combination of both.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Moreover, such a guiding component is intended for travelling back and forward, for example on a guiding track provided on the window casing.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The guided window sash part is typically a fixed or in- and outwardly movable pin or pivot extending from a lateral side member of the window sash, but other forms of window sash parts, such as an opening or recess in a window sash member or a window sash part extending from a window sash member which is not shaped as a pin, are not excluded from the invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> The window sash can be formed by a frame having lateral side members and cross members surrounding a glazing panel.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, according to the invention a window sash for which the guiding component of the invention is intended, can also consist of a so-called structural glazing panel itself, comprising a spacer frame or spacer frame structure having spacer frame cross members and spacer frame lateral side members which are actually forming the members of the window sash.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In still another embodiment the window sash can even be just a panel to be mounted to the window casing and to be guided by a guiding component of the invention.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In most applications known in the prior art in which a window sash needs to be guided with respect to a window casing, no guiding components in the meaning of the present application are used for that purpose, but the window sash part to be guided is actually forming the guiding component itself.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Indeed, in these known cases, guiding tracks are provided at both sides of the window casing, and a window sash part such as a fore-mentioned pin or the like provided at both sides of the window sash is introduced directly into the corresponding guiding<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> track without the use of an additional guiding component and the pin can make a translational movement directly in the guiding track, most of the time also combined with and simultaneous with a rotational movement of the pin directly in the guiding track.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is obvious that this type of guidance system is rather primitive and that it is not a very good solution from a mechanical point of view.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In order to improve the guidance, also some cases are known according to the state of the art wherein guiding components are used for guiding a window sash part with respect to a window casing.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">These known guiding components are executed as a shoe having a broad base sometimes provided with wheels, the shoe being hinge mounted on the window sash part to be guided (i.e. a pin extending from a window sash member).</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The broad base of the shoe is intended for increasing the guidance of the window sash part over a guiding track, so to better guide the window sash part for as far as the translational part of its movement is concerned.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The hinge mount of the shoe to the window sash part ensures of course a better guidance of the window sash part for as far as the rotational part of its movement is concerned.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In that way the guiding component is provided with elements which are each adapted for their specific guiding purpose, i.e. for translational movements or rotational movements, and which can provide the needed guidance independently from one another, so to increase the total guiding performance.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Although these known guiding components perform very well in the windows of the known types provided with mechanisms for opening and closing a window sash with respect to a window casing by tilting, reversing, sliding and or a combination thereof in a known manner, there is a need for another kind of guiding components which make it possible to develop a new type of windows allowing other and new kinds of manipulations of the window sash, which is an aim of the present invention.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Hereby, special attention is paid to roof windows, but not exclusively to roof windows.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Indeed, according to the state of the art essentially two types of mounting a window sash to a window casing exist, i.e. a mounting wherein the window sash<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> is mounted on top of the window casing members at the outside of the window casing, as is represented in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, hereafter indicated as a top assembly, and a mounting wherein the window sash is mounted in between the window casing members, as is represented in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 2</figref>, hereafter indicated as an enclosed assembly.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">It is clear that the top assembly has the advantage that the window sash members do not obstruct the opening in the window casing so that more light can pass through the opening than with a window sash mounted in an opening of equal dimensions by applying an enclosed assembly.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">On the other hand, in an enclosed assembly of the window sash, the window has a smaller height, since the window sash is mounted within the window casing.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Furthermore, in the known roof windows the window sash is mounted by means of window fittings to the window casing in order to allow certain typical movements of the window sash.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A known type of roof window is for example illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 3</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The window sash can make a turning movement with respect to the window casing, the window sash being rotated around a side edge AA' of the window casing.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">This simple construction can be realized with a top assembly as well as an enclosed assembly of the window sash, but a disadvantage of such a window is that the outside surface of the window pane is difficult to reach for cleaning.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">This problem is solved in other types of known roof windows, a first example of which is represented schematically in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In this type of roof window the window sash can pivot around a pivot axis BB' which passes more or less centrally through the window sash.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A disadvantage of this type of windows is that it can only be realized with an enclosed assembly of the window sash, so that a large part of the window opening is obstructed for incident light.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Furthermore, when the window sash is opened, rain can rather easily enter in the building and the view of a person is restricted due to the presence of the window sash, while space inside the building is also needed during the pivoting movement.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 5</figref> illustrates a known window which is a combination of both former examples and wherein the window sash can undergo a turning movement around the side edge AA' in a turning mode of operation, as well as a pivoting movement around the central pivot axis BB' in a pivoting mode of operation.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">When opened in the turning mode of operation, this type of windows have not the above-mentioned disadvantages of the known windows having only a turning mode of operation, while the pivoting mode is practical for cleaning purposes.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Nevertheless, this type of window can only be realized with a window sash mounted in an enclosed assembly, resulting again in an important loss of light transmission compared to a top assembly.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Finally, still another type of known windows is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 6</figref>, the window sash being mounted this time such that a side edge of the window sash can slide over the window casing, indicated by the arrows in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 6</figref>, while the window sash is making simultaneously a rotating movement around a pivot axis CC'.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The known windows of this type have as advantage that they can be realized with a window sash mounted in a top assembly as well as in an enclosed assembly, but,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> when opening the window sash, the view is still obstructed partly, while rain can penetrate through an opening at the top side, which are clearly disadvantages of this type of window.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">It is therefore an objective of this invention to overcome one or more of the above-mentioned drawbacks or possibly other non-mentioned drawbacks of the known windows.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In particular it is an aim of the invention to realize a window which has at least two modes of operation, a first mode wherein the window sash can be turned around a side edge and a second mode wherein the window sash outer surface can be reversed towards the window casing for cleaning purposes, and wherein during the entire reversing movement the window sash is kept at the outside of the window casing and is not partly turning inwardly through the window casing opening.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Still another purpose of the invention is to avoid rain penetration, when the window sash is opened, and to ensure that the opening in the window casing is used to a maximum for light penetration.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The invention proposes also an interesting solution for new types of windows, especially a new type of roof window, wherein the structural strength of the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> window sash is provided substantially only by a spacer frame structure of a structural glazing panel and wherein the window sash is mounted only by using this spacer structure.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In these new types of windows, the spacer frame structure of the structural glazing panel is the principal load bearing part of the window sash, so that only a very light window sash frame can be used or even no window sash frame at all, the spacer frame structure forming in this case the window sash frame.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In order to attain these aims, the present invention first of all proposes a new type of guiding component for guiding a window sash part with respect to a window casing during a movement of the window sash, which movement is a rotational or translational movement or a combination of both, the guiding component comprising at least the following elements:
<ul><li>a track mover for guiding the guiding component in a guiding track; and,</li><li>a guiding component connection means which can be activated for making and releasing a releasable, rotatable connection between the window sash part and the guiding component, respectively in a connecting status and a releasing status.</li></ul></p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Such a guiding component according to the invention is very advantageous in that it is provided with<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> guiding component connection means, by which a rotatable or hinged connection between the guiding component and a window sash part can be temporarily made, typically in order to allow a certain mode of operation of the window wherein such a hinged and guided connection of the window sash part is needed, while by releasing the hinged connection again, the window sash can be set in another mode of operation, wherein there is no need for such a guidance of the concerned window sash part and wherein there is on the contrary a need for a free non confined movement of the window sash part.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">This is not possible with the known guiding components, since these guiding components are permanently connected to the window sash part restricting the movement of the window sash part in all modes of operation.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">A preferred embodiment of a guiding component according to the invention further comprises a track mover locking means which can be activated for locking and releasing the track mover of the guiding component, respectively for preventing in a locked status and allowing in an unlocked status a translational movement of the track mover.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Such a guiding component in accordance with said preferred embodiment allows for a locking of the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> guiding component in the guiding track under certain circumstances, for example in order to ensure its position on the guiding track corresponding to a position in which the window sash part can connect with the guiding component when needed.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The invention also relates to a mounting kit part comprising at least one guiding component in accordance with the invention, and which mounting kit part is intended for mounting a window sash to a window casing in a reversible manner and which is mountable between one lateral side member of the window sash and the window casing, and which will be described further in the text more in detail by referring to the drawings.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Furthermore, the invention also relates to a complete mounting kit for mounting a window sash to a window casing in a reversible manner, which mounting kit comprises a pair of fore-mentioned mounting kit parts according to the invention, the mounting kit parts being symmetric in shape and mountable respectively at opposite lateral side members of the window sash and window casing, the mounting kit further comprising central actuating means connectable to actuating means of each mounting kit part for their simultaneous actuation.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Finally, the invention also relates to a window comprising:

alternative not excluded to replace each wheel 6, 7 or 8 by a pair of wheels provided at opposite sides of the guiding component body 2, so to increase the lateral stability of the guiding component 1 during its translational movement over a guiding track.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Wheels 6 and 8 are provided at the longitudinal extremities of the base 3 of the guiding component 1 and are freely rotatable around their central axis on little shafts 10 which are provided fixedly on the guiding component base 3.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">These wheels 6 and 8 will hereafter briefly be indicated as being fixedly positioned wheels 6 and 8, meaning of course that they are fixedly positioned on the guiding component 1, not with respect to the guiding track.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In the

than two fixedly positioned wheels which are all<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> aligned with one another in order to ensure a fluent movement over a guiding track.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Wheel 7 is of another type in that it is freely rotatable around its central axis on a shaft 11 which is this time not fixedly positioned on the guiding component body 2, but which shaft 11 is fixedly positioned on a slider 12, this slider 12 being movable with respect to the guiding component body 2.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The wheel 7 will for that reason be indicated hereafter as a movably positioned

fulfills two main functions at the same time.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">First of all, it is a constituent part of a track mover locking means 19 of the guiding component 1, which track mover locking means 19 is intended for locking and releasing the track mover 5, respectively for preventing in a locked status, as represented in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 7</figref>, and allowing in an unlocked status, as represented in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 8</figref>, a translational movement of the track mover 5 with respect to a guiding track.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">The movably positioned wheel 7 is in the embodiment here described also a constituent part of this track mover locking means 19.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">In particular, the movably positioned wheel 7 is movable by being mounted on the slider 12 between an<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> out of line position corresponding to the locked status, represented in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 7</figref>, wherein the movably positioned wheel 7 is out of line with respect to the fixedly positioned wheels 6 and 8, and an aligned position, corresponding to the unlocked status, represented in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 8</figref>, wherein wheel 7 is aligned with the fixedly positioned wheels 6 and 8 along a direction DD' parallel to the base 3 corresponding to the direction DD' of movement on a guiding track.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">In the represented case, the slider 12 is furthermore spring activated by a torsion spring 20 acting in a direction to bring the movably positioned wheel 7 in the out of line position, corresponding to the locked status of <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 7</figref>.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">It is clear that in this embodiment the track mover locking means 19 can be activated by pushing the slider 12 into the unlocked status or by releasing the slider 12 in which case it returns automatically to its locked status.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">Secondly, the slider 12 also forms a constituent part of a guiding component connection means 21 which is, in its broadest definition, intended for making and releasing a releasable, rotatable connection between a window sash part, typically a pin extending from a window sash member, and the guiding component 1, respectively in a connecting status, represented in<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 8</figref>, and a releasing status, represented in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 7</figref>.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">In the represented embodiment, the guiding component connection means 21 comprises, on the one hand, a rounded notch 22 provided in the guiding component body 2, in particular at the top 4 in the recess 13.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">This rounded notch 22 is in this case more or less symmetric with respect to a radial direction GG' of the arc EE', has an open side 23 in a direction away from the center of curvature X and is intended for receiving and releasing a window sash part through that open side 23 of the notch 22.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">The rounded shape of the notch 22 forms a kind of bearing surface 24 for supporting window sash parts having a cylindrical shape, such as pins or shafts or the like, in a rotatable manner.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">In the represented embodiment, the guiding component connection means 21 comprises, on the other hand, a curved shutter 25, which extends from the extremity 26 of the slider 12 near the top 4 along the arc EE'.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">By being a part of the slider 12, the shutter 25 is movable with respect to the guiding component body 2, in particular between a closed position corresponding to the connecting status, represented in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 8</figref>,<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> and an open position, corresponding to the releasing status, and which is represented in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 7</figref>.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">In the closed position, the shutter 25 extends at least partially over the open side 23 of the notch 22 and forms together with the notch 22, in particular with the bearing surface 24 of the notch 22, an enclosure 27 in order to prevent a window sash part received in the notch 22 from being released from the notch 22.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">In the open position of the shutter 25, the open side 23 of the notch 22 is unobstructed by the shutter 25 in order to allow a window sash part of being received into the notch 22 or being released from the notch 22 via the open side 23 of the notch 22.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">Since, in the case represented in <figref idrefs="f0002">figures 7 and 8</figref>, the shutter 25, as well as the wheel 7, is provided on the movable slider 12, the position of both is interrelated, and as a consequence there is in this case also a direct relation between the status of the track mover locking means 19 and the guiding component connection means 21.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">In particular, the movably positioned wheel 7 is in the aligned position corresponding to the unlocked status when the shutter 25 is in the closed position corresponding to the connecting status.<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --></p><p id="p0085" num="0085">Similarly, but the other way around, the movably positioned wheel 7 is in the out
