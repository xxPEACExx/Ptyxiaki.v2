Generally, when such multiple light sources are used, one may be used for the high beam and a second one for the low beam. Often the adjustment features for these multiple beams require individual adjustment of each beam, which often results in a misalignment of the beams or the expenditure of considerable man-power and special measurements to insure that the beams are properly focused in a desired manner.
