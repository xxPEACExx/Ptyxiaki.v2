The nature of these fluids, combined with the severe conditions of heat, pressure, and turbulence to which they are often subjected, are contributory factors to the formation and deposition of contaminants, such as scales, salts, paraffins, corrosion, bacteria and asphaltenes in oil and/or gas production wells. Such contaminants also form in equipment and flow conduits used in gas production and oil production. For instance, mineral scale deposits (such as calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate and barium sulfate) often precipitate from produced oilfield water in oil and gas wells and create blockages in flow paths, especially in production flow conduits such as well tubing, well casing and flow lines. Such blockages lead to a restriction in such flow conduits. The formation and deposition of such unwanted contaminants decrease permeability of the formation, reduce well productivity and can completely block the well tubular in severe cases. In addition to mineral scale deposition, other problems caused by oil field water include corrosion, bacterial growth, paraffin deposition and asphaltene deposition. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> [0003] A common site for the formation and deposition of such contaminants in oil or gas wells is the annular space between the production tubing and casing. The annulus may be a static area or may produce gas or liquid. In low pressure gas wells, such as coal 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 bed methane wells, the gas is produced up the annulus and the liquid (water) is allowed to fall to the liquid level and is removed via a submersible pump up the tubing. Such undesirable substances as salt, scales, paraffins and asphaltenes form due to pressure and temperature changes at the perforations. Alternatively, such substances form due to comingling of incompatible waters from one set of perforations to another. The formation and deposition of such contaminants decrease permeability of the subterranean formation and reduce well productivity. For instance, in some completions, the presence of scale in the annulus may make it difficult or impossible to remove the tubing for servicing. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> [0004] In addition to being formed in oil and gas wells, such contaminants further form in flow conduits used in the production of oil, gas and other fluids. For instance, an acute problem develops when such contaminants develop in flow conduits used in gas and oil production, refineries and other fluid processing facilities. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> [0005] A number of approaches have been used to inhibit and/or remove contaminants. For example, in oil and gas production, the technique of "downhole squeezing" is commonly used to address oil field scale formation, wherein a slug of the treatment composition is injected into the annulus, using a pre-flush, squeeze, and overflush treatment before the well can be returned to normal function. However, the overflush process often flushes a significant portion of the treatment agent such the remaining treatment agent is gradually removed from the surface as oil production continues. Thus, further descaling treatments are typically required. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">[0006] Another method of treating deposits, such as mineral scales, is to apply chemicals directly to the well tubular. Such applications are commonly applied to the tubing or casing of pumping wells, either continuously or in batch form. However, this often requires specialized and expensive pumping equipment as well as associated piping and containment. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> [0007] Alternative treatment methods have therefore been sought for introducing treatment agents into oil and/or gas wells as well as flow conduits used in the production of oil and gas.

 Summary of the Invention </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> [0008] In an embodiment, treatment agent retained in a housing may be slowly and continuously released into a targeted area in a well or in a flow conduit. Within the housing there is a confinement area wherein movement of the treatment agent is restricted. Mobility of the treatment agent may be limited by a retainer. The retainer may be a screen, a porous media or any other device which is capable of minimizing migration of the treatment agent outside of the confinement area. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> [0009] The treatment agent is at least sparingly soluble in the fluid entering the housing. A portion of the treatment agent is dissolved in the entering fluid and thus becomes free to exit from the confinement area. Fluid exiting the housing contains dissolved treatment agent. The exiting fluid enters flow conduits and targeted areas of a well where the treatment agent is needed. Thus, unwanted deposits are removed or the formation of such deposits is inhibited or reduced with the treatment agent. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015">[00010] In one embodiment, the housing is situated between the flowline and the casing of the well. Fluid from the flowline may be permitted to flow through the retainer and over the solid treatment agent to dissolve an amount of the treatment agent. The chemically laden water may then be drained into the annulus of the well to treat the well and conduits exiting the well. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> [00011] Suitable treatment agents include those capable of addressing the undesired effects caused by scale formations, salt formations, paraffin deposition, emulsification (both water-in-oil and oil-in-water), gas hydrate formation, corrosion, asphaltene precipitation and paraffin formation for slow release into the well or flow conduits. Other suitable treatment agents include foaming agents, oxygen scavengers, biocides and surfactants. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017"> [00012] In an embodiment, the treatment agent may be retained in the housing in a receptacle. The retainer relatively restricts the movement of the treatment agent in the housing to the receptacle while permitting fluid flow into and out of the receptacle. At least a portion of the fluid entering the housing may flow directly into the receptacle. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018">[00013] In another embodiment, the treatment agent may be directed to flow over the treatment agent in the receptacle within the housing. Upon being moved over and/or 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 across the receptacle, dissolved treatment agent may combine with the fluid. The fluid exiting the housing contains the dissolved treatment agent. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019"> [00014] In another embodiment, the combination of receptacle and retainer may be defined by a structure resembling a perforated sleeve which rests within the housing. For instance, the receptacle may be a tubing which resides in the housing. The retainer may consist of small openings in the tubing. The small openings communicate with the interior of the receptacle. The treatment agent resides within the interior of the receptacle. Treatment agent, upon being dissolved, may then combine with the fluid. The fluid exiting the housing may contain the dissolved treatment agent. </p><p id="p0020" num="0020">[00015] In another embodiment, the confinement area(s) may be defined by the space between each of the inner walls and retainer. A flow pathway may exist between the confinement area(s). Fluid entering the housing flows over the treatment agent in one or both of the confinement areas and exits the housing with dissolved treatment agent. </p><p id="p0021" num="0021">[00016] In another embodiment, a treatment agent may be delivered to a flow conduit downstream of a well. Fluid pumped out of the well may enter a housing containing a confinement area. The treatment agent may be retained within a confinement area of the housing. As fluid moves through the housing and through the confinement area, a portion of treatment agent is dissolved in the fluid. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Brief Description of the Drawings </p><p id="p0023" num="0023"> [00017] In order to more fully understand the drawings referred to in the detailed description of the present invention, a brief description of each drawing is presented, in which: </p><p id="p0024" num="0024"> [00018] FIGs. 1 and 2 are schematic representations of methods of delivering a treatment agent into a well and flow conduit using a housing having treatment agent retained in the housing. </p><p id="p0025" num="0025"> [00019] FIG. 3 is a schematic representation of a method of delivering a treatment agent into a well and flow conduit using a housing having treatment agent retained in a receptacle within the housing. </p><p id="p0026" num="0026"> [00020] FIG. 4 illustrates a representative housing containing a receptacle for a treatment agent and a retainer.

The treatment agent is contained within a housing. Fluids flow into the housing and exit the housing with a portion of dissolved treatment agent. (The term "dissolved" used herein shall include solids which are dissolved, solubilized or entrained in the exiting fluid.) The housing is located outside of the well so no intervention into the well is necessary. The method may be run continuously or be conducted intermittently. The treatment agent may be monitored and replenished as needed. Since the housing containing the treatment agent is external to the well, filling the housing is easy, requiring no special tools. </p><p id="p0031" num="0031"> [00025] The treatment agent is typically in a solid or semi-solid state and is at least sparingly soluble in the fluid traveling through the housing The treatment agent may be of any form including beads, pellets, flakes, slurries, balls, rods, sticks or blocks. The size and shape of the solid is not critical to the success of the method provided the treatment agent can be at least partially dissolved in the fluid which passes over the confinement area or through the confinement area. In one embodiment, the treatment agent is a pellet approximately one inch in diameter and 3/8 inches tall. </p><p id="p0032" num="0032">[00026] A representative embodiment is depicted in FIG. 1 which shows housing 10 separated from well 12 by flow conduit 14. Treatment agent 16 is retained in housing 10. Treatment agent 16 is confined in housing 10 in confinement area 11. Retainer 22 relatively restricts the movement of the (solid) treatment agent in housing 10 outside of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
 confinement area 11 while permitting flow of fluid into and out of confinement area 11. In a preferred embodiment, retainer 22 is located on both ends of the confinement area, shown as 22a and 22b. </p><p id="p0033" num="0033"> [00027] Retainer 22 may be a screen, a porous media or any other device which is capable of minimizing migration of the treatment agent outside of the confinement area 11. Exemplary porous medium include porous filters or a porous solid, such as sand, diatomaceous earth, ground or crushed shells of nuts like walnut, coconut, pecan, almond, ivory nut, brazil nut, etc. ; ground or crushed seed shells (including fruit pits) of seeds of fruits such as plum, olive, peach, cherry, apricot, etc.; ground or crushed seed shells of other plants such as maize (e.g., corn cobs or corn kernels), etc.; processed wood materials such as those derived from woods such as oak, hickory, walnut, poplar, mahogany, etc. The mesh of the screen, porosity of porous medium or diameter of other devices for retainer 22 is selected such that the treatment agent is relatively unable to freely move outside of confinement area 11. </p><p id="p0034" num="0034"> [00028] Fluid from passageway conduit 24 enters housing 10 through housing entrance flow regulator 18. The fluid consists typically of oil, water or a mixture of oil and water. In an embodiment, the fluid may be water originating from a production flow line 35. Treatment agent 16 in housing 10 is at least sparingly soluble in the entering fluid. </p><p id="p0035" num="0035"> [00029] In an embodiment, fluid stream 35 may be pumped out of well 12 by a submersible pump (not shown) or pump jack 44. A portion of fluid stream 36 in flowline 39 may be diverted. Diverted fluid stream 37 may then pass into housing 10, into flow conduit 14 and back to casing 32 via the pressure differential in flowline 39 and well casing 32. The technique of diverting fluid from a fluid stream back to the casing of a well is commonly described as slip stream. </p><p id="p0036" num="0036"> [00030] Fluid flow may optionally be metered into housing 10 such as by use of a metering valve 31 located upstream of housing 10 along passageway conduit 24. Alternatively, a metering valve may be located downstream of housing 10 along flow conduit 14. In an embodiment, multiple metering valves may be present upstream 31a and downstream 31b. The location of the optional metering device(s) serves to assist in the control of fluid into and/or out of housing 10. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
 [00031] The fluid containing dissolved treatment agent flows downwardly and exits housing 10 through exit flow regulator 28. The exiting fluid enters flow conduit 14 and then enters the well through well flow regulator 30 where it continues to pass into annulus 33. Fluid stream 35 in piping 34 containing dissolved deposits may exit the well and then enter flowline 39 extending from well 12 with the assistance of the submersible pump or pump jack 44. Diverted fluid stream 37 enters well access point/valve 38 off of flowline 39. Diverted fluid stream 37 then enters passageway conduit 24 through passageway conduit flow regulator 25. The remaining portion of the fluid continues through flowline 39 as exit fluid stream 42. </p><p id="p0037" num="0037"> [00032] The treatment agent in the fluid exiting housing 10 through exit flow regulator 28 removes unwanted deposits or inhibits or reduces the formation of such deposits in the well and flow conduits leading into and out of the well. </p><p id="p0038" num="0038"> [00033] The direction of fluid flow through the housing and over or into the confinement area is not critical. The inlet to the housing may be either at the top of the housing or the bottom or side with an outlet opposite the inlet. The inlet and outlet may be on the same side of the housing. </p><p id="p0039" num="0039"> [00034] As an example, FIG. 2 illustrates an embodiment wherein fluid from passageway conduit 24 enters housing 10 through housing entrance flow regulator 18 which is located at the bottom of the housing. The fluid flow proceeds in an upwardly direction through the housing and exits housing 10 at exit flow regulator 28 located at the top of the housing. In another embodiment (not shown), fluid from passageway conduit 24 enters the housing through a side connector located at the side of the housing. The fluid containing dissolved deposits may then exit through a second side connector located at the other side of the housing. </p><p id="p0040" num="0040"> [00035] A pump may be located towards the bottom, top or side of the housing to circulate or assist in the movement of the production fluid through the confinement area containing the treatment agent. While a pump may be used to aid in moving fluid through the well production system, in a preferred embodiment, a pump is not used for moving the diverted fluid through the housing into the confinement area. A highly advantageous feature of the embodiments of the invention is that movement of diverted 
<!-- EPO <DP n="10"/>-->
