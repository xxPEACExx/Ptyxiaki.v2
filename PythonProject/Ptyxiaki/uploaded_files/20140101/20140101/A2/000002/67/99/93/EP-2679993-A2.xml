A SAW is an acoustic wave that travels along the surface of a material, and can be generated when particles in the material vibrate due to an external thermal, mechanical, or electrical force. A SAW exhibits vibration energy that is mostly concentrated on the surface of the material. The movement of a SAW in a material is affected by one or more properties of the material. A SAW sensor can be used to analyze a target material by sensing a change in a SAW caused by a change in a property of the material. For example, a change in intensity, phase, or central wavelength of the SAW may indicate the presence of a particular target material.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">A conventional SAW sensor may include a substrate formed of a piezoelectric material, an input interdigital transducer (IDT) that generates a SAW by applying an electrical stimulus to the substrate, and an output IDT that receives the SAW. In the SAW sensor, a portion between the input IDT and the output IDT in which the SAW travels is generally referred to as a delay line. A receptor having a specific binding with a desired particular target material may be disposed on a path on which the SAW travels on the substrate, for example, in the delay line.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">When a SAW is generated in the SAW sensor having the above structure and a sample including a target material is applied to the SAW sensor, the target material may combined with the receptor and change an intensity, phase, or central wavelength of the SAW that is received from the output IDT. Thus, by sensing a change in the SAW, it may be determined whether the target material exists in the sample, and the content of the target material in the sample may be precisely measured.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A SAW array sensor may be configured by arranging a plurality of SAW sensors on one substrate. By using a SAW array sensor, various types of receptors may be disposed on the substrate, so as to analyze various components of the sample at one<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> time. The SAW array sensor can suppress cross-talk that is generated due to a reflected wave generated in adjacent delay lines, and simultaneously, the size of the SAW array sensor may be reduced.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Provided are surface acoustic wave (SAW) array sensors having improved sensitivity by removing cross-talk between SAW sensors.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the presented embodiments.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to an aspect of the present invention, a surface acoustic wave (SAW) array sensor includes: an input interdigital transducer (IDT);

In this regard, the present embodiments may have different forms<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> and should not be construed as being limited to the descriptions set forth herein. Accordingly, the embodiments are merely described below, by referring to the figures, to explain aspects of the present description. In addition, an expression, such as "above" or "on", in the following layer structure may involve the case where an element or layer is referred to as being directly on another element or layer in a contact manner or being above another element or layer in a noncontact manner.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic plan view of the principle of a surface acoustic wave (SAW) array sensor according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the SAW array sensor according to the current embodiment may include an input interdigital transducer (IDT) 11, a first output IDT 12, and a second output IDT 13, which are disposed on a piezoelectric substrate 10. Each of the input IDT 11, the first output IDT 12, and the second output IDT 13 has two electrodes in which a plurality of protruding thin finger-like portions ("fingers") are interdigitated. When voltages are applied to two electrodes of the input IDT 11, the piezoelectric substrate 10 vibrates due to an electrical stimulus and thus a SAW is generated. A wavelength of the SAW generated in this way may be determined by a finger pitch of the input IDT 11, and the number of waves of the SAW may be proportional to the number of fingers of the input IDT 11. The SAW generated in the input IDT 11 travels along the surface of the piezoelectric substrate 10 in two directions of the input IDT 11, i.e., in right and left directions of the input IDT 11 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">A section between the input IDT 11 and the first output IDT 12 is a first delay line 14 via which the SAW reaches the first output IDT 12. In addition, a section between the input IDT 11 and the second output IDT 13 is a second delay line 15 via which the SAW reaches the second output IDT 13. The "delay line" is the separation between the IDTs, and the "length" of the delay line is the distance between the IDTs. Thus, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the input IDT 11, the first and second output IDTs 12 and 13, and the first and second delay lines 14 and 15 are arranged in the same line (aligned with one another, such as in a row) along a traveling direction of the SAW. A receptor (not shown) having a specific binding with a target material in a sample may be disposed on one or both of the first and second delay lines 14 and 15.

Similarly, while the SAW traveling to the right of the input IDT 11 passes through the second delay line 15, an intensity, a phase, or a central wavelength of the SAW may vary according to the amount of target material that combines with the receptor disposed on the second delay line 15.

Similarly, there is a possibility that cross-talk of signals may occur when the SAW traveling to the left of the input IDT 11 is reflected by the first output IDT 12 and then reaches the second output IDT 13. The cross-talk introduced by the reflected waves that are generated in the two adjacent delay lines 14 and 15 may disturb precise analysis of the target materials.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">For example, the SAW that reaches the first output IDT 12 may include a SAW that directly comes from the input IDT 11, a SAW that is reflected by the first output IDT 12 and then is re-reflected by the input IDT 11 (indicated by '①' in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the S AW is referred to as, in particular, a triple transient echo (TTE)), a SAW that is reflected between the first output IDT 12 and the input IDT 11 three or more times, and a SAW that is reflected by the second output IDT 13 (indicated by '②' in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>). There is a large possibility that the SAW that is reflected by the second output IDT 13 and then reaches the first output IDT 12 may interfere with a TTE signal, in particular, when a length d1 of the first delay line 14 and a length d2 of the second delay line 15 are the same.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a graph showing signals that reach the first output IDT 12 when a reflected wave is not generated in the second delay line 15.

Referring to the graph of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, a first peak is generated due to the SAW that directly comes from the input IDT 11, and a second peak is generated due to the TTE signal that is reflected by the first output IDT 12 and then is re-reflected by the input IDT 11. Since the TTE signal passes three times through the first delay line 14 on which the receptor is disposed until the TTE signal reaches the first output IDT 12, a change in the TTE signal at the second peak is larger than a change in the SAW at the first peak at which the SAW passes through the first delay line 14 only once. A change in a signal at a third peak at which the SAW passes through the first delay line 14 five times is larger than a change in the TTE signal at the second peak, but an intensity of the SAW is much smaller than an intensity of the TTE signal. For these reasons, the TTE signal is used as a signal for analyzing a target material in the sample.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph showing signals that reach the first output IDT 12 when a reflected wave is generated in the second delay line 15 when lengths of the two delay lines, namely, the first and second delay lines 14 and 15, are the same. The length of a path on which a SAW is reflected by the second output IDT 13 and then reaches the first output IDT 12 is nearly the same as that of the TTE signal. Thus, as indicated by the graph of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, a SAW (indicated by '②' in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) that is reflected by the second output IDT 13 may reach the first output IDT 12 at a time that is almost the same a time at which the TTE signal reaches the first output IDT 12.

Since the TTE signal is important in analysis of the sample, the signal that is reflected by the second output IDT 13 reaches the first output IDT 12 sufficiently prior to or later than the TTE signal, or the signal reflected by the first output IDT 12 reaches the second output IDT 13 sufficiently prior to or later than the TTE signal, so as to identify the TTE signal.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0047" num="0047"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic plan view of a SAW array sensor 100 according to another example embodiment.
