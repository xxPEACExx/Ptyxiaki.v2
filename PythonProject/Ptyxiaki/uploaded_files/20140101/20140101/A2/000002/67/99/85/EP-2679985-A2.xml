Especially, the dangers of biological terrorism are increased because of easy manufacturing of biological weapons, easy their carrying, and easy spraying therethrough. Further, the bioterrorism causes psychological chaoses and enormous economical damages by the increment of the infection through the incubation period of pathogen.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In case where the pathogen harmful to human bodies are floating in the air, they should be detected in a short time and appropriately handled. Since they exist in the form of aerosol particles, however, they are not easily found by the naked eye. To do this, thus, a special detecting system should be needed.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Further, the pathogen are dispersed as aerosols from the front of several tens kilometers in consideration of wind direction and wind velocity, and thus, when they reach the region to be damaged, their concentration becomes substantially low. Even though the concentration is extremely low, however, the damage caused by the pathogen is not decreased at all, so that it is very important to perform the sampling and detection of both of low concentration pathogen and high concentration pathogen according to the characteristics of the atmospheric environment.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A typical method for collecting and detecting the biological aerosols such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and so on is to cultivate them on media for several hours through several days. So as to recognize the biological, that is, the sample for measurement is first collected from the air, and the amount or kind of biological aerosols in the collected sample is then measured. By the way, the above-mentioned typical method requires a lot of time and endeavors and further needs the cultivation period of several hours to several days. In this case, the sample is directly cultivated on the media, and the number of colonies formed thereon is counted to check whether the biological aerosols exists or not. However, 24 hours or more are generally needed for the cultivation of the sample, and to detect fungi, one week or more is required. Through this method, accordingly, it is impossible to perform rapid detection.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">On the other hand, a laser-induced fluorescence method is widely used as a method for optically detecting the biological aerosols, and in this method, the biological aerosols are detected through the scattering light and fluorescence from the illuminated particle. However, since <u>a</u> light-collecting device for collecting weak fluorescence is not provided, it is hard to measure weak fluorescence.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to conventional equipment for detecting scattering light and fluorescence by illuminating laser to biological aerosols inclusive of fluorescent non-biological aerosols, the illumination direction of the laser beam may be deviated when external vibrations or impacts are applied to the equipment, and when it is assembled again after disassembled for the interior cleaning, furthermore, the accuracy and

invention will be in detail given with reference to the attached drawings.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">A device for real-time fluorescence detection is a device that splits scattering light and laser-induced fluorescence, which are generated when laser beam is illuminated to aerosol particles, by wavelength band, to in real time monitor the changes in the intensity of the fluorescent particles (inclusive of biological aerosols). As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG.1</figref>, the device for real-time fluorescence detection is largely composed of a particle concentrator 100 and a particle measuring unit 200 (see <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG.6</figref>) that is located inside a casing assembling body 300 disposed on the underside of the particle concentrator 100. The particle concentrator 100 and the particle measuring unit 200 are coupled separably to each other so that they can be easily cleaned and repaired when the interiors are stained and malfunctions occur.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The particle concentrator 100 is adapted to draw<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> into and separately concentrate the aerosol particles and to convey the concentrated particles to the particle measuring unit 200, so that fine changes in the intensity of air can be in real time analyzed through the concentration of the aerosol particles with high efficiency. Generally, the aerosol particles are composed of biological aerosols and non-biological aerosols. So as to perform real-time analysis for the changes of the intensity of fluorescent particles of more than 1µm (inclusive of biological aerosols with fluorescence and some of non-biological aerosols with fluorescence), the particles of more than 1µm (especially, fluorescent particles) should be counted, but really, the number of particles having such sizes is not large, thereby making it difficult to perform real-time statistical approaches thereto. Contrarily, in places where the devices for real-time fluorescence detection are located according to the characteristics of domestic areas, mostly, a lot of pollen (of more than several hundreds µm) existing in spring seasons blows, and if foreign materials are introduced for a few days into the optical chamber as a particle measuring space during the measurement of the aerosol particles, the interior of the optical chamber becomes polluted to inconveniently need frequent cleaning. Thus, the inventor has proposed the small-sized high efficiency particle concentrator 100 capable of concentrating 100 liters per minute, which achieves the real-time approach to the quantity of variation of the<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> fluorescent particles, that is, increases the reliability of the measurement of the changes in the intensity of the fluorescent particles. Additionally, the particle concentrator 100 filters only the particles of desired sizes, thereby preventing the pollution of the interior of the optical chamber. As mentioned above, the particle concentrator 100 serves to filter large particles and extremely fine particles.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG.2</figref>, the particle concentrator 100 includes: a pre-separator 110 adapted to form a passage through which the particles are drawn into and to filter particles of more than a given size; and a cylindrical casing 120 having two-staged nozzles 121 and 122 formed of a plurality of virtual impactors adapted to separate and concentrate the the particles passed through the pre-separator 110 by size through an inertial force, the cylindrical casing 120 being located vertically on the top surface of the casing assembling body 300 in which the particle measuring unit 200 is accommodated in such a manner as to be connected to the pre-separator 110.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The pre-separator 110 includes an absorption pipe 111 to which air and aerosol particles are drawn into, a filter 112 for removing insects and coarse particles contained in the the particles by using a mesh structure formed along the upper end periphery of the absorption pipe 111, a filter cap 113 adapted to cover the top end periphery of the filter 112 in such a manner as to allow the outer periphery thereof to be<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> spaced apart from the filter 112, a funnel 114 disposed inside the absorption pipe 111 to filter particles having a larger size than the particles of a target size in the aerosol particles, and a cup 115 connected to the bottom end of the funnel 114 and having air passages 115a formed on the side periphery thereof, into which the large particles filtered through the funnel 114 are put.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The cylindrical casing 120 is structured in the interior thereof to have the first stage nozzle 121 formed of a plurality of virtual impactors, through which only the particles within a range of a given size in the the particles passed through the air passages 115a of the cup 115 are passed, and to have the second stage nozzle 122 spaced apart from the first stage nozzle 121 and formed of a plurality of virtual impactors, through which only the particles within a range of the given size are separated and concentrated.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In this case, the number of virtual impactors constituting the first stage nozzle 121 is 15 through 20, and it is desirably 18 (see <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS.4a and 4b</figref>). Further, the number of virtual impactors constituting the second stage nozzle 122 is 3 through 4, and it is desirably 4 (see <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGS.5a and 5b</figref>). Each virtual impactor makes use of a virtual pipe to collect particles in the state floating in the air, so that advantageously, the particles do not scatter.

Further, the flow of air passed through the second stage nozzle 122 and then supplied to the particle measuring unit 200 disposed on the underside of the particle concentrator 100 is 1 liter per minute, as the flow of concentrated air, and the rest, the flow of air of 8 liters per minute is ejected to the side. At this time, mostly, the particles having the flow of concentrated air of 1 liter per minute passed through the second stage nozzle 122 have, for example, sizes in a range from 2µm to 10µm.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">According to the particle concentrator 100 having the above-mentioned structure, the the particles are introduced together with air through the absorption pipe 111 of the pre-separator 110 by means of the operation of a flow meter (not shown) disposed on one side of the lower end of the cylindrical casing 120. At this time, foreign materials floating in the air such as carcasses of dead insects, coarse particles and the like are filtered through the filter 112. The air<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> passed through the filter 112 is then passed through the air passages 115a of the cup 115 of the pre-separator 110, and in this process, the particles exceeding a given size, for example, the particles of more than 10µm are filtered. The filtered large-sized particles are collected in the cup 115 of the pre-separator 110, and only the particles of less than 10µm are passed through the air passages 115a of the cup 115 of the pre-separator 110 and supplied to the cylindrical casing 120.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The air passed through the air passages 115a of the cup 115 is introduced into the first stage nozzle 121 of the cylindrical casing 120, and through the 18 virtual impactors constituting the first state nozzle 121, the particles of more than 2µm are separated from the air by the inertial forces. Next, the air not passed through the virtual impactors of the first stage nozzle 121 is emitted through an outlet formed on one side of the lower end of the cylindrical casing 120. At this time, only the air of 9 liters per minute in the air of 90 liters per minute passed through the funnel 114 is passed through the first stage nozzle 121, and the rest, air of 81 liters per minute is emitted.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The air passed through the first stage nozzle 121 is concentrated by means of the four virtual impactors constituting the second stage nozzle 122 disposed below the first stage nozzle 121.

The outside nozzle 212 has a pin hole (not shown) formed on one side of the top periphery thereof, and a pin 212a is fixedly inserted into the pin hole. The concave groove 213b and the pin 212a serve as a first position determining means for determining the position of the inside nozzle 214. That is, if the inside nozzle 214 is positioned in the connection member 211 and the outside nozzle 212, the pin 212a disposed on the top periphery of the outside nozzle 212 is inserted into the concave groove 213b formed on the ring member 213a of the insertion tube 213 fixedly connected to the inside nozzle 214, thereby determining the position of the inside nozzle 214.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Further, the outside nozzle 212 has a fitting hole 212b formed on one side of the outer periphery of<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> the upper end portion thereof, into which an air introducing member 216 is fitted to introduce clean air from the outside.

Now, the structures of the eccentricity prevention inclined portion 212e and the inclined surface 222a will be in detail described. First, if it is desired to clean the inlet part 210 or the optical chamber 220 due to the extreme environmental conditions like yellow sand, the inlet part 210 should be mounted again onto the optical chamber 220 after separated therefrom. At this time, the lower end portion of the inlet part 210 has to be mounted accurately with clearance of several tens µm at a set position of the particle measuring space S in the optical chamber 220. If the inlet part 210 is not mounted accurately onto the top surface opening 222 of the optical chamber 220, that is, if the center axis of the outside nozzle 212 to be positioned into the particle measuring space S is deviated from the original mounting position in the optical chamber 220, the center axis of the outside nozzle 212 does not cross the laser beam of several hundreds µm, and even though it crosses the laser beam, it does not exist at the accurate position, which gives bad influences on the measurement of the sizes of the particles and the measurement of the intensity of the fluorescence. By the way, it is not easy to improve the accuracy in the optical particle counter through which the particles are measured. So as to solve the above-mentioned problems, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG.8</figref>, the invention adopts the structures wherein the pin 212a is inserted into the pin hole formed on the top surface of the outside<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> nozzle 212 of the inlet part 210 and the concave groove 213b into which the pin 212a is inserted is formed on the insertion tube 213 connected to the inside nozzle 214, wherein the pin 221a is inserted into the pin hole formed on the connection member 221 of the optical chamber 220 and the concave groove 212d into which the pin 221a is inserted is formed on the round projection 212c formed on the outer periphery of the outside nozzle 212 of the inlet part 210, and wherein the contacted surfaces between the lower end portion of the outside nozzle 212 of the inlet part 210 and the top surface opening 222 of the optical chamber 220 have reverse conical shapes.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Under the above-mentioned structures, when the inlet part 210 separated from the optical chamber 220 is mounted again onto the optical chamber 220, the inside nozzle 214 is mounted in such a manner as to allow the pin 212a provided above the outside nozzle 212 to be fitted to the concave groove 213b of the insertion tube 213 connected thereto, thereby preventing the center axis of the inside nozzle 214 from being misaligned. The connection member 211 and the outside nozzle 212 are mounted onto the optical chamber 220 in such a manner as to allow the concave groove 212d of the round projection 212c formed on the outer periphery of the outside nozzle 212 to be aligned to the pin 221a provided on the connection member 221 of the optical chamber 220, thereby preventing the inlet part 210 itself from being misaligned. Further,<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> the eccentricity prevention inclined portion 212e of the outside nozzle 212 is brought into close contact with the inclined surface 222a of the top surface opening 222 of the optical chamber 220, so that the center axis of the inlet part 210 is aligned to a set position of the optical chamber 220, without having any eccentricity in a horizontal direction. According to the above-mentioned structures, moreover, there is another effect that the device is stabilized against the vibrations generated by outside impacts. According to the present invention, the inclined angles of the eccentricity prevention inclined portion 212e and the inclined surface 222a are the same as each other, and they are in a range of 30.0° ± 5.0° (that is, between 25° and 35°) with respect to the center axis of the inlet part 210. Therefore, even though the inlet part 210 is mounted repeatedly onto the optical chamber 220 after separated therefrom for the cleaning work, it can be reliably mounted on the optical chamber 220 through the coupling structures between the pin 212a and the concave groove 213b and between the eccentricity prevention inclined portion 212e and the inclined surface 222a.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Under the above-mentioned configuration of the inlet part 210, the particles separated and concentrated in the particle concentrator 100 and a given flow of air are passed sequentially through the insertion tube 213, the inside nozzle 214 and the outside nozzle 212 of the inlet part 210 and then<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> discharged to the particle measuring space S (see <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG.11</figref>) of the optical chamber 220. When discharged, desirably, clean air is introduced from the air introducing member 216 mounted on the outside nozzle 212 of the inlet part 210. Like this, the clean air introduced into the outside nozzle 212 through the air introducing member 216 meets the air flowing through the inside nozzle 214 in the gap (approximately 1.3mm) between the inside nozzle 214 and the outside nozzle 212 and is then passed through the nozzle tip 215. At this time, the clean air introduced into the outside nozzle 212 is injected toward a discharging nozzle 241 in the optical chamber 220 through the nozzle tip 215, while encompassing the air existing into the inside nozzle 214. As a result, the air concentrated in the minute gap can be passed, without giving any pollution to the reflectors 231 and 232 in the optical chamber 220, thereby preventing the fine particles in the air introduced through the top end of the inlet part 210 from being attached to the inner surface of the optical chamber 220 to cause the pollution of the optical chamber 220.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">In the state where the inlet part 210 is mounted onto the optical chamber 220, the particles introduced into the optical chamber 220 through the top end of the inlet part 210 interact with the laser beam L in the particle measuring space S of the optical chamber 220 and are then drawn into through the discharging nozzle 241 disposed in the particle discharging part 240.<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> Next, the particles are passed through a filter and then discharged to the outside.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In the particle measuring space S inside the optical chamber 220, a pair of reflectors 230 is disposed to collect weak scattering light and fluorescent signals and to reflect them to the beam splitting part 270.

Especially, the surfaces of the two reflectors 231 and 232 are coated to prevent the damages caused by the impurities or ultraviolet light introduced through the inside nozzle 214 and the nozzle tip 215 of the inlet part 210. In this case, however, the spherical reflector 231 is not coated on the center portion thereof, so that the scattering light and fluorescence signals generated by illuminating the laser beam L generated from the beam<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> shaping part 250 to the particles introduced from the inlet part 210 are reflected to the aspherical reflector 232 and are advanced toward the beam splitting part 270 (see <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG.15</figref>).

In this case, the aspherical lens 254 of the light source portion 251 serves to enlarge the laser beam generated from the laser diode 253 with a magnifying power of 10, and the first lens group 255 of the beam forming and adjusting portion 252 serves as a beam size adjusting portion that enlarges the laser beam in the direction of x (in the transverse direction) with a magnifying power of 20 to 80, while the second lens group 256 of the beam forming and adjusting portion 252 serves as an aspect ratio adjusting portion that enlarges the laser beam in the direction of y (in the longitudinal direction) with a magnifying power of 10 to 20. Through such arrangements of the lenses, the adjustment of the size of the laser beam in the longitudinal and transverse directions in the particle measuring space S inside the optical chamber 220 can be freely performed. Like this, after the magnification of the laser beam is enlarged through the aspherical lens 254, the size of the enlarged beam is adjusted longitudinally and transversely, so that even though<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> the production of the laser diode during the development or after the development stops or variants thereof are produced, the same performance can be achieved only through the aligning work of the laser beam axis as will be discussed later.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">On the other hand, in case where a vehicle on which the device for real-time fluorescence detection is mounted is moved in mountainous regions, since the light source portion 251 in which the laser diode 253 is mounted is sensitive to weak vibrations caused from external impacts, there is a need to frequently perform optical alignment.

Especially, the UV or short wavelength laser beam acts with various dust and generally sticks to the lenses, and accordingly, even though the output of the laser beam is not varied greatly due to dust, the laser beam is hidden by the plurality of lenses polluted by dust and thus decreased in the output from the final end thereof, so that the accuracy of the measurement of<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> the particle sizes becomes deteriorated. This problem is realized through the comparison between the output of the laser diode itself and the output of the photodiode of the beam dump part 260 as will be explained. This is very important in the maintenance of the invention, and according to the present invention, the photodiode senses the output at the final end of the laser beam, so that if the axis of the laser beam is misaligned or if the variation of the output exceeds a limitation value, an abnormal signal is just sent to a user, thereby making the axis alignment of the laser beam performed.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">According to the present invention, that is, the light source portion 251 has the same performance just through the alignment of the axis of the laser beam, without having any alignment of the whole light source portion 251.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Hereinafter, the light source portion 251 will be explained with reference to <figref idrefs="f0015 f0016 f0017">FIGS.16 to 18</figref>.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0015 f0016 f0017">FIGS.16 to 18</figref>, the light source portion 251 has a body 251a and a cover plate 251b having a socket in which the laser diode 253 is embedded at the front of the body 251a.

A photodiode is used as the light source output detector 264.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Under the above-mentioned structure of the beam dump part 260, some of parts are fitted to each other and some of parts are integrated to each other by means of the fixation of screws, so that the assembling and<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> disassembling works of the parts are performed easily and the mounting work on the device for real-time fluorescence detection is also carried out conveniently.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">Furthermore, the opening formed between the front surface of the body 261 and the rear surface of the optical chamber 220 is sealed by means of the window 297 and the fixing ring 290, so that the internal pressure of the optical chamber 220 is maintained and the internal passage (or inner space) of the beam dump part 260 through which the laser beam is passed is cut off from the outside, thereby preventing air or light from the outside from entering the interior of the optical chamber 220 or the beam dump part 260. Accordingly, the accuracy and reliability of the measurement can be improved.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">The laser beam (incident beam) generated from the beam shaping part 250 is illuminated to the fine particles toward the particle measuring space S of the optical chamber 220 and is passed through the window 297 of the beam dump part 260. After that, the laser beam is passed through the convex lens 292 of the focal lens assembly 291 and the pin hole 293a of the diameter of 0.3mm passed through the front surface of the cap 293 of the pin hole assembly 296 and then reaches the light source output detector 264. Further, the surface of the light source output detector 264 is inclined by an angle of 10° with respect to the reference surface perpendicular to the advancing passage of the incident beam (the optical axis). Under the above structure,<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --> even though a portion of the incident beam is reflected from the surface of the light source output detector 264 in the process of measuring the intensity of the laser beam, the reflected beam is generated in different passage from the incident beam, thereby substantially decreasing an amount of reflected beam going straight toward the pin hole 293a.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">In more detail, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0022">FIG.23</figref>, the incident beam is collected to the pin hole 293a of the pin hole assembly 296 through the convex lens 292 of the focal lens assembly 291, and next, the incident beam passed through the pin hole 293a is passed through the cavity formed in the interior of the beam dump part 260 at the rear side of the pin hole 293a. Thus, as the incident beam comes near to the light source output detector 264, the width of the beam comes to be gradually expanded.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">Like this, if the incident beam expanded in width reaches the light source output detector 264, the intensity of the incident beam is detected by the light source output detector 264 and a portion of the incident beam is reflected on the surface of the light source output detector 264.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">The reflected beam generated from the surface of the light source output detector 264 is expanded in width as it comes near to the pin hole assembly 296 and is finally expanded in larger width by 20 times than the diameter of the pin hole 293a.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">If it is assumed that the photodiode made of a silicone material is used as the light source output<!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --> detector 264, the reflection rate when the incident beam is incident on the surface of the photodiode at a vertical angle (90°) is 30%, but the reflection rate when the incident beam is incident thereon with the inclination of a given angle (90°-10° = 80°) is just 0.075%. Referring to Gaussian distribution of beam, the energy of beam is just 0.2%.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">According to the beam dump part 260 of the invention, most of reflected beam generated from the surface of the light source output detector 264 is not passed through the pin hole 293a. Further, even though the reflected beam is passed through the pin hole 293a, it is passed through the region where the outside intensity is low in Gaussian distribution, so that an extremely small amount of energy is introduced into the optical chamber 220.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">As a result, the reflected light generated from the light source output detector 264 and the stray light generated in the beam dump part 260 are rarely introduced into the optical chamber 220, thereby improving the signal to noise ratio of the beam splitting part 270 and enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the measurement of the device for real-time fluorescence detection.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">The beam splitting part 270 is connected to the optical chamber 220 in a horizontally supported state through a through-hole formed on a vertical support rod 203 fixed to the support plate 201 on the underside surface thereof.<!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --></p><p id="p0099" num="0099">The beam splitting part 270 is adapted to separate and detect weak scattering light and fluorescence collected through the spherical reflector 231 and the aspherical reflector 232 disposed in the particle measuring space S of the optical chamber 220.

The scattering light is detected by the scattering light detector 274, and especially, if the biological aerosols are contained in the particles, the fluorescence is also generated together with the scattering light. Accordingly, the fluorescence is detected by wavelength band to in real time monitor the size distribution and intensity changes of the fine particle in the air. Lastly, the detected scattering light and fluorescence are converted into electrical signals through a light detecting sensor and the state of the air is in real time analyzed by using a high speed signal processing circuit. Moreover, the intensity by particle size, the intensity of the fluorescent particles by particle size, and the intensity of the fluorescence by particle size of the fluorescence of the particles existing in the air are in real time analyzed in variable time unit, thereby detecting whether harmful materials exists or not.<!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --></p><p id="p0106" num="0106">While the present invention has been described with reference to the particular illustrative embodiments, it is not to be restricted by the embodiments but only by the appended claims.
