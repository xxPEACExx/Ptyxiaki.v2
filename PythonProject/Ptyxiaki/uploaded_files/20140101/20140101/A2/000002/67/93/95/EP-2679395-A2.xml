The recording media include a base paper coated with a polymer. It is known that base papers coated with a polymer have higher glossiness and water fastness than base papers alone and can-prevent or reduce cockling. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2006240287A"><text>2006-240287</text></patcit> discloses that the surface smoothness of a base paper coated with a polymer can be improved to manufacture a high-gloss recording medium.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">There is an increasing demand for photo books and photo albums. Characteristics required for recording media for use in photo books and photo albums include image quality similar to that of silver halide photography, turnability, and opacity, which is a property of preventing an image on the back side from being seen through the front<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> side in duplex recording. Images on a recording medium that includes a base paper coated with a polymer and an ink-receiving layer can be given the feel of a silver halide photograph. Thus, such a recording medium can be used for photo books and photo albums.

In order to decrease the rigidity of the recording medium without reducing ink absorbency, the thickness of the base paper coated with a polymer may be reduced. However, a decrease in the thickness of the polymer layer may impair the degree to which the texture of the recording medium is similar to the texture of photographic paper, and recorded images cannot have the feel of silver halide photograph. A decrease in the thickness of the base paper may cause deformation or breakage of the base paper in a process of winding the base paper, resulting in poor winding of the base paper.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present inventors found that a decrease in the thickness of the polymer-coated base paper of the recording medium described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2006240287A"><text>2006-240287</text></patcit> so as to improve turnability resulted in poor winding of the base paper.

The recording medium has high turnability.<br/>
An image on the back side of the recording medium is rarely seen through the front side in duplex recording. A substrate of the recording medium is easy to wind.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Such a recording medium can be provided by the present invention.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention in its first aspect provides a recording medium as specified in claims 1 to 6.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawing.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">Figure is a schematic view of a recording medium according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><heading id="h0006">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention will be described in detail in the following embodiments.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As a result of extensive studies, the present inventors found that in order to provide images having the feel of silver halide photography and high turnability the arithmetic average surface roughness of a recording medium must be as low as 0.13 µm or less in accordance with JIS B 0601:2001 (hereinafter referred to as Ra<sub>2</sub>), a base paper of the recording medium must have a thickness of 50 µm or more and 130 µm or less, and a polymer layer disposed on the base paper (hereinafter also referred to as a "polymer-coated substrate") must have a thickness of 20 µm or more and 60 µm or less.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">However, only satisfying these conditions sometimes resulted in low opacity, and an image on the back side could be seen through the front side in duplex<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> recording. Furthermore, the substrate was difficult to wind, and deformation or breakage of the substrate could occur in a process of winding the substrate.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present inventors first studied a method for improving the surface smoothness of a polymer-coated substrate as in a known recording medium described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2006240287A"><text>2006-240287</text></patcit>. However, it was difficult to prevent an image on the back side from being seen through the front side or improve the winding of the substrate. Thus, the present inventors increased the surface roughness of a polymer-coated substrate and found that this can prevent an image on the back side from being seen through the front side and improve the winding of the substrate. Although there is no clear reason for this, the present inventors believe the reason as described below.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">First, it is supposed that an image on the back side is visible through the front side because the recording medium has high optical transparency. However, a decrease in the optical transparency of the ink-receiving layer results in poor color developability of an image. Thus, the present inventors studied a method for reducing the optical transparency of the substrate and found that the surface smoothness of a polymer-coated substrate can be<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> reduced to cause the reflection of light at an interface between an ink-receiving layer and the substrate, thereby preventing an image on the back side from being seen through the front side while maintaining the color developability of the image.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">One of the reasons for deformation or breakage of the substrate in a process of winding the substrate is the inclusion of air during winding. An increase in the surface roughness of the polymer-coated substrate or roughening of the surface of the polymer-coated substrate allows air inclusions to escape and thereby reduces deformation or breakage of the substrate.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">On the basis of these findings, the present inventors have studied the surface state of a polymer-coated substrate to improve the opacity and winding of the substrate without affecting the quality of images and turnability. The present inventors found that a polymer layer on a surface of the substrate must have an arithmetic average surface roughness (hereinafter referred to as Ra<sub>1</sub>) of 0.12 µm or more and 0.18 µm or less in accordance with JIS B 0601:2001 and a roughness curve element average length (hereinafter referred to as RSm) of 0.01 mm or more and 0.20 mm or less in accordance with JIS B 0601:2001.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Thus, these constituents can synergistically produce their effects to achieve the advantages of the present invention.</p><heading id="h0007">[Recording Medium]</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">A recording medium according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a base paper, a polymer layer disposed on the base paper, and an ink-receiving layer disposed on the polymer layer. One exemplary structure of a recording medium according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawing. The recording medium illustrated in the figure includes a base paper 1, a polymer layer 2, and an ink-receiving layer 3. The recording medium may further include another layer between the base paper 1 and the polymer layer 2, between the polymer layer 2 and the ink-receiving layer 3, or on the ink-receiving layer 3, without losing the advantages of the present invention. The base paper 1, the polymer layer 2, and the ink-receiving layer 3 are preferably stacked in this order. A recording medium according to an embodiment of the present invention may be an ink jet recording medium for use in an ink jet recording method.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In an embodiment of the present invention, the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> recording medium has an arithmetic average surface roughness Ra<sub>2</sub> of 0.13 µm or less in accordance with JIS B 0601:2001. When the recording medium has Ra<sub>2</sub> of more than 0.13 µm, images having the feel of silver halide photography may not be obtained. Ra<sub>2</sub> is preferably 0.05 µm or more, more preferably 0.10 µm or more. The arithmetic average surface roughness of the recording medium may be controlled by pressing a surface of the polymer-coated substrate with an uneven roller and applying a coating liquid for an ink-receiving layer to the surface or by pressing a surface of the recording medium with an uneven roller.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In an embodiment of the present invention, the recording medium has an opacity of 97% or more in accordance with JIS P 8149:2000. The components of a recording medium according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described below.</p><heading id="h0008">&lt;Polymer-Coated Substrate&gt;</heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">In an embodiment of the present invention, the polymer-coated substrate includes a base paper and a polymer layer, and the base paper is coated with the polymer layer. The polymer layer must be disposed on a surface of the base paper on which an ink-receiving layer<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> is to be formed. The polymer layer may be disposed on one or both sides of the base paper. The polymer layer may cover part of the surface of the base paper. The coverage by the polymer layer (the area of a surface of the base paper coated with the polymer layer/the entire surface area of the base paper) is preferably 70% or more, more preferably 90% or more, particularly preferably 100%; that is, the entire surface of the base paper is particularly preferably coated with the polymer layer. The components of the polymer-coated substrate will be described below. Base paper</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In an embodiment of the present invention, the base paper has a thickness of 50 µm or more and 130 µm or less. The base paper preferably has a thickness of 90 µm or more and 120 µm or less. When the base paper has a thickness of 130 µm or less, the recording medium becomes more flexible and has improved turnability. When the base paper has a thickness of less than 50 µm, the recording medium may have too little strength to turn over and may have low opacity; therefore an image on the back side may be seen through the front side in duplex recording. In an embodiment of the present invention, the thickness of the base paper is calculated by the following method. First, a<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> recording medium is cut with a microtome, and the cross section is observed with a scanning electron microscope. The thickness measurements at 100 or more points are averaged to determine the thickness of the base paper. The thickness of another layer in an embodiment of the present invention is also determined in the same manner.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In an embodiment of the present invention, the base paper preferably has a density of 0.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup> or more and 1.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup> or less, more preferably 0.7 g/cm<sup>3</sup> or more and 1.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup> or less, in accordance with JIS P 8118.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The base paper is mainly made of wood pulp. If necessary, the base paper is made of wood pulp and synthetic pulp, such as polypropylene pulp, or synthetic fibers, such as nylon or polyester fibers. Examples of the wood pulp include, but are not limited to, leaf bleached kraft pulp (LBKP), leaf bleached sulfite pulp (LBSP), needle bleached kraft pulp (NBKP), needle bleached sulfite pulp (NBSP), leaf dissolving pulp (LDP), needle dissolving pulp (NDP), leaf unbleached kraft pulp (LUKP), and needle unbleached kraft pulp (NUKP). These may be used alone or in combination. The wood pulp may be LBKP, NBSP, LBSP, NDP, or LDP, which contains a large amount of short fiber component. The pulp may be chemical pulp (sulfate pulp or<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> sulfite pulp) containing less impurities. The pulp may be bleached to increase the degree of whiteness. The base paper may contain a sizing agent, a white pigment, a paper strengthening agent, a fluorescent brightener, a waterretaining agent, a dispersant, and/or a softening agent. Polymer layer</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In an embodiment of the present invention, the polymer layer has a thickness of 20 µm or more and 60 µm or less. The polymer layer preferably has a thickness of 35 µm or more and 50 µm or less. The polymer layers on both sides of the base paper may have the thickness described above. When the polymer layer has a thickness of 20 µm or more, the recording medium has a texture similar to the texture of photographic paper, and images recorded on the recording medium have the feel of silver halide photography. The polymer layer having a thickness of more than 60 µm may be too rigid to turn over the recording medium.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The polymer layer may be made of a thermoplastic polymer. Examples of the thermoplastic polymer include, but are not limited to, acrylic polymers, acrylic silicone polymers, polyolefin polymers, and styrene-butadiene copolymers. Among these, the thermoplastic polymer may be a polyolefin polymer. The term "polyolefin polymer", as<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> used herein, refers to a polymer of an olefin monomer. More specifically, the polyolefin polymer may be a homopolymer or a copolymer of ethylene, propylene, and/or isobutylene. These polyolefin polymers may be used alone or in combination. Among these, the polyolefin polymer may be polyethylene. The polyethylene may be a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) or a high-density polyethylene (HDPE).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In an embodiment of the present invention, the polymer layer may contain a white pigment, a fluorescent brightener, and/or an ultramarine blue pigment to control its opacity, degree of whiteness, or hue. In particular, the polymer layer may contain a white pigment to improve its opacity. Examples of the white pigment include, but are not limited to, rutile and anatase titanium oxides. In an embodiment of the present invention, the white pigment content of the polymer layer may be 3 g/m<sup>2</sup> or more and 30 g/m<sup>2</sup> or less. For polymer layers disposed on both sides of the base paper, the total white pigment content of the two polymer layers may be in the range described above. The white pigment content of the polymer layer may be 25% by mass or less of the polymer content. A white pigment content of more than 25% by mass may result in insufficient dispersion stability of the white pigment.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In an embodiment of the present invention, the polymer layer has an arithmetic average surface roughness Ra<sub>1</sub> of 0.12 µm or more and 0.18 µm or less, preferably 0.13 µm or more and 0.15 µm or less, in accordance with JIS B 0601:2001. For polymer layers disposed on both sides, at least the polymer layer on which an ink-receiving layer is to be formed has Ra<sub>1</sub> in the range described above.
