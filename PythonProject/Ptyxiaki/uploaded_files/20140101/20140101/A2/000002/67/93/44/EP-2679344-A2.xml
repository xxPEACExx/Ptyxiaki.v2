Because of the nature of the compressed air power source and the expense involved in heavy duty industrial fastener driving tools, such tools are generally not suitable for use in fastening jobs where manoeuvring is required, space is limited, or compressed air is not available. Manually operated fastener driving tools are also used in industrial applications. However, in many of the jobs where manually operated fastener driving tools are used, considerable operator fatigue may be involved because a manual fastener driving tool requires a large user actuation force.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Existing carton closing tools, due to their structural configuration, require significant tool disassembly to replace the clinching members of the tools. The level of disassembly needed for replacing the clinching member in existing tools is difficult and cumbersome, as disassembly involves removing numerous parts of the tool, even those parts that are remotely related to the clinching operations. In some instances, replacing the clinching members requires that the entire tool be disassembled.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Replacement of clinching members is desirable in at least the following situations. Carton closing tools use different sized clinching members for different fastener applications. Therefore, replacing clinching members depending on the fastener applications is a common occurrence. Even if the same sized clinching member is used for a particular fastener application, clinching members are components that will undergo wear and need to be replaced during the life of the tool.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As a result, there is a need in the art for a more efficient and less cumbersome way to replace clinching members for different fastener applications or when clinching members are worn.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As an alternative to some of these challenges, an electrically-operated fastener driving tool can be used. An electrically operated fastener driving tool avoids the inconvenience of the compressed air power source for power-operated tools in industrial applications. An electrically operated tool can use the electrical energization of a motor or solenoid to accomplish the driving action. Such a tool can be used commercially in work areas where it would constitute an inconvenience to provide a supply of compressed air or manual labour as sources of power.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention include an electric fastener driving tool for driving staples to fasten carton flaps in a closed manner. In a further embodiment, the tool is a battery-powered fastener driving tool. The tool relies on a battery to supply energy to an electric motor when the trigger is actuated. The present invention thus obviates the disadvantages noted above. Thus, the fastener driving tool of the embodiments herein can function in the above-mentioned applications where prior art devices are inconvenient, as well as all other applications to which the prior art devices could be used. Also, the fastener driving tool is portable and thereby free from being tethered to a work area. As such, the tool can be used in a variety of locations with minimal set-up.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fastener driving tool that includes a housing, a drive track within the housing, a magazine connected to the housing and configured to hold a supply of fasteners and to provide a leading fastener to the drive track, a driver configured to move downward in the drive track and drive the leading fastener into a workpiece during a drive stroke, and upward in the drive track during a return stroke, a mount connected to the driver, and a clincher operatively connected to the housing and to the mount. The clincher is configured to engage the leading fastener during the drive stroke and move into a clinching position at the end of the drive stroke to clinch the fastener to the workpiece. The tool includes a motor configured to rotate a crank arm, and a connecting rod pivotably connected to the mount at one end portion thereof and pivotably connected to the crank arm at an opposite end portion thereof.

The battery pack 18 is configured to engage the handle end portion 16 and provide power to a motor 26 in the motor transmission unit 12 such that the tool 2 can drive one or more nails which are fed from the magazine 10. Although the battery pack 18 is illustrated as being connected to the handle end portion 16, the battery pack 18 can be located anywhere on the tool 2. In addition, although the energy storage device is illustrated as being a battery pack, embodiments of the invention are not limited to battery packs being the energy storage device.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Provided in the vertical section 8 of the housing section 4 is the driver 23 of the fastener driving assembly. A driver mounting block, i.e. mount 22 is located in a drive channel and moves through successive operating cycles, each of which includes a downward drive stroke and an upward return stroke. The mount 22 has connected thereto, the driver 23. Actuation of the driver 23 drives staples, which are sequentially fed from the magazine 10 to a drive track 20 within the housing 4, into a clincher assembly 40, which may also be referred to herein as a clincher, then into the workpiece W. As shown, the driver 23 is connected to the upper end of the mount 22 and is forced to follow the linear motion of the mount. In an embodiment, the mount is integral with the driver.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">Figures 1-4</figref>, and particularly in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2-4</figref>, a connecting rod 36 is pivotably connected at a lower end 36a thereof through a lower pivot pin 35 to a crank arm 34, which is connected to a crankshaft 32. The connecting rod 36 is pivotably connected at an upper end 36b to the mount 22 through an upper pivot pin 37. The connecting rod 36 pivots outwardly from the centre line of the mount 22 as the crank arm 34 moves the lower end 36a of the connecting rod 36. The connecting rod 36 pulls the mount 22 downward toward the nose through the drive stroke. Therefore, as the crank arm 34 rotates, the connecting rod 36 acts as a linear actuator by converting the rotational motion of the crank arm 24 into linear motion of the mount 22 through a drive stroke in the drive track 20. One complete 360-degree rotation of the crankshaft 32 and therefore the crank arm 34 is equivalent to one complete downward and upward cycle of the mount 22.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The clincher assembly 40, which is shown in more detail in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2-4</figref>, is mounted proximal to the nose of the tool 2 in a position to define the lower portion of the drive track 20. The clincher assembly 40 includes a pair of clincher linkages 42, a pair of clincher arms 44, and a pair of clincher anvils 46. During the down stroke of the mount 22, the driver 23 drives a staple into the workpiece W. The closing of the staple within the carton is achieved by the clincher assembly 40. Upper ends of the clincher linkages 42 are pivotably connected to the mount 22 such that the downward movement or downstroke of the mount 22 moves the clincher linkages 42 downward. A lower end of each clincher linkage 42 is connected to a respective clincher arm 44. The downward motion of the mount 22 causes the clincher arms 44 to rotate about a<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> pivot pin 48. The upstroke of mount 22 returns the driver 23 and the clincher arms 44 to the home or at-rest positions.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the clincher assembly 40 is shown in a retracted state. The clincher arms 44 are pivoted to the lower end of the housing section 4 by the pivot pin 48 and are further pivotable on the clincher linkage 42 by pivot members 43. Each clincher arm 44 has mounted on the outer end thereof an arcuate clincher anvil 46 which, when the clincher assembly 40 is disposed in its retracted position, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, extends arcuately downwardly from the end of the associated clincher arm 44. In order to accomplish the clinching action, the clincher anvils 46 are moved downwardly and inwardly along an arcuate path into a clinching position. This movement is accomplished in response to the downward movement of the mount 22 by means of the connecting rod 36 being pivoted at its upper end through the upper pivot pin 37, and at its lower end to the crank arm 34. In an embodiment, each clincher anvil 46 is integral with a corresponding clincher arm 44.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The clincher assembly 40, crank arm 34 and crankshaft 32 are actuated by a manual actuating mechanism or trigger assembly, generally indicated at 50, shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, which is operable to activate the motor 26. As best shown in the Figure, the trigger assembly 50 includes a trigger member 52 which is adapted to be digitally engaged by a user grasping the housing handle portion 6.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The motor 26 is actuated by the trigger assembly 50. The trigger assembly 50 is mechanically coupled to handle 6 and electrically coupled to motor 26 such that the trigger assembly selectively provides electric power to motor assembly. The motor 26 includes a rotatable output shaft 30 that extends into the gear reduction mechanism 28, which reduces the rotational speed of the output shaft 30 and causes rotation of the crankshaft 32 at the reduced rotational speed.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The electric motor 26 provides a power source to the tool 2 to operate the clincher assembly 40 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2-4</figref>. In <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the tool 2 is in a resting state. The mount 22 is in a top position before the actuating mechanism or trigger member 52 is engaged. In this state, the clincher anvils 46 are open. The leading staple S is in the magazine and connected to the remaining stick of staples.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">With the tool 2 provided with a staple supply in the manner indicated above, the staples being formed in a U-shaped or flat configuration; and with the leading staple S disposed within the drive track 20, it will be understood that when the user actuates the trigger member 52, the connecting rod 36 will be moved through a drive stroke carrying with it the mount 22, and the clincher assembly 40.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Referring now more particularly to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 3 and 4</figref>, the construction and operation of the clincher assembly 40 of the embodiments of the present invention is shown therein.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> illustrates the initial actuation of the tool when the trigger 52 is actuated, which causes the mount 22 to move through the drive stroke. During the initial portion of the drive stroke, the lower end of the driver 23 engages the crown C of the staple within the drive track 20 and moves the same downwardly. In addition, the clincher assembly 40 is operated so that the clincher anvils 46 thereof are moved into a position to receive the free ends of the legs L of the staple being driven as the latter move outwardly of the lower end of the drive track and into the workpiece. The clincher anvils 46 contact with the legs L of the leading staple S which has been pushed to the delivery end of the tool 2 by the pusher 14 of the magazine 10. At this stage, the legs L of the staple are being pushed into the workpiece W. In <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref>, the mount 22 is in a bottom position while the clincher anvils 46 are closed and fully pivoted toward each other, bending the legs L of the leading staple S toward each other. The clincher anvils 46 are also forced into the workpiece to press the legs L of the leading staple S toward each other. By the end of the drive stroke of the mount 22, the legs of the driven staple are clinched on the clincher anvils 46, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The body of the clincher arms 44 can be metallic and formed from steel, for example. Alternatively, the body of the clincher arms can be titanium or other rigid metal. Other materials that can be used to form the clincher arms include a rigid resin material, plastic or a composite material. Further, a combination of materials or material properties can be used for the clincher arms.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The motor 26 drives the transmission or gear reduction mechanism 28, which in turn can actuate and advance the mount 22 to cause the driver 23 to strike the crown C of the leading staple S shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2-4</figref>.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">For the purpose of effecting the movement of the mount 22 through successive operative cycles of movement, the battery pack 18 supplies energy to an electric motor. The motor 26, can be carried by the housing 4 or the motor-transmission unit 12 in a position parallel to the handle 6 and rearwardly of the housing section 4. The gear reduction mechanism 28, which may be a planetary gear reduction mechanism, is also carried by the housing 4 or motor-transmission unit 12. The gear reduction mechanism 28 is rotatably connected to the motor 26 through the motor output shaft 30 so that the rotation of the motor output shaft 30 rotates the gear reduction mechanism 28. The gear reduction mechanism 28 transmits a rotational force to the crankshaft 32. The crankshaft 32 is rotatably connected to the crank arm 34. The rotational energy of the motor 26 is transmitted through the gear reduction mechanism 28 to the crankshaft 32 to reduce the speed of rotation and increase the torque applied to the crank arm 34. The crank arm 34 rotates along a circular path about the crankshaft 32. When the trigger member 52 is actuated and the safety is engaged, a connection is made between the battery 18 and a microprocessor unit. If the voltage of the battery 18 is within predetermined operating limits (in terms of voltage, current and temperature) the microprocessor applies a voltage to the motor 26, which begins the actuation sequence. The motor 26 will rotate the crankshaft 32, which in turn simultaneously advances the mount 22 and extends the clincher arms 44 driving the staple into the carton or workpiece W. The motor 26 will then continue to turn, returning both the driver 23 and clincher arms 44 until the mount 22 is sensed by a proximity sensor signalling to the microprocessor that the cycle has concluded. At this point, the microprocessor sends a braking signal to the motor 26 and waits for the user to release and re-engage the trigger 52 prior to another cycle commencing. As a result, the torque is applied to the crank arm 34.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In the event the clincher anvils 46 are worn and need replacing, or a different size of clincher anvils 46 is desired, a method of replacing clincher anvils 46 in the tool 2 is provided by an embodiment of the present invention illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">Figures 5-9</figref>. The disclosed method is different and less cumbersome than that required for<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> existing carton closing tools of this type. In an embodiment of the present invention, the method includes removing an upper pivot pin cover 60 from the vertical section 8 of the housing 4, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref>. Removing the upper pivot pin cover 60 from the housing 4 exposes the upper pivot pin 37 through an aperture 62. In an embodiment of the tool 2 of the present invention, the upper pivot pin cover 60 is a resilient rubber plug that can be removed by being pried off, such as with a flat blade screwdriver. In an embodiment of the tool 2 of the present invention, the upper pivot bolt cover 60 may be a threaded plug and/or a rigid plug.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">After the upper pivot pin cover 60 has been removed from the housing 4, the exposed upper pivot pin 37 may be removed from the housing 4, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref>. As described above, the mount 22 is connected to the connecting rod 36 through the upper pivot pin 37. Therefore, when the upper pivot pin 37 is removed from the tool 2, the mount 22 is free to move from an upper position of the drive stroke vertically downward to a bottom position of the drive stroke of the driver 23, which will cause the clincher assembly 40 to also move vertically downward.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 7</figref>, the downward movement of the clincher assembly 40 causes the distal ends of the clincher anvils 46 to extend out of the vertical section 8 of the housing. <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 7</figref> also illustrates two connectors 45, which may be bolts, that connect the clincher anvils 46 to the clincher arms 44 are now coaxial with apertures 70 through the vertical section 8 of the housing. This alignment of the bolts 45 with the apertures 70 allows the bolts 45 to be removed through the apertures 70, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 8</figref>.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Upon removing the bolts 45 from the tool 2, the clincher anvils 46 are freed from the rest of the clinching assembly 40 and may be removed from the tool, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 9</figref>. In order to install new clincher anvils in the tool 2, the method described above with respect to <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">Figures 5-9</figref> may be reversed.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">For example, replacement clincher anvils may be aligned with their respective clincher arms 44, and the bolts 45 that were removed may be inserted through the apertures 70 in the housing 4. The replacement clincher anvils may then be secured to the clincher arms 44. After the replacement clincher anvils are secured to the clincher arms 44, the mount 22 and the driver 23 may be moved upward in the drive<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> track 20. The pivot pin 37 may then be inserted through the aperture 62 in the housing 4 and into the mount 22 and the connecting rod 36, thereby connecting the mount 22 to the connecting rod 36.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">As a result of embodiments of the present invention, the method of replacing the clincher anvils 46 is more user-friendly. In addition, the disclosed method of clincher member replacement minimizes the number of parts that need to be removed from the tool for access to the clincher anvils 46.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">While the fastener driving tool is illustrated as being battery-powered, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention, in its broader aspects, may be constructed somewhat differently and that aspects of the present invention may have applicability to other electrically powered driving tools, such as those powered by solar energy.
