A wide variety of spinal fixation apparatuses have been employed in surgical procedures for correction of spinal injuries and the effects of spinal diseases. Many of these apparatuses commonly use a pair of longitudinal rods running in a relatively parallel relationship to each other in combination with a mesh cage that is inserted between the vertebral bodies of the spinal column, such mesh cages are commonly constructed of titanium.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Mesh cages must be provided in a desired mesh cage length for each patient. To provide mesh cages of a desired length, medical facilities may stock only one mesh cage length to allow for a reduced inventory and to give the surgeon the ability to cut the mesh cage to the exact size needed. One method of cutting a mesh cage is for the surgeon to use a pair of tin snips to cut the mesh cage to the desired length. This method is time-consuming and leaves jagged edges to the device which can cause damage to the anatomy of the patient. Alternatively, to provide mesh cages of a desired length, medical facilities can have a large<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> inventory of mesh cages in varying sizes and configurations. However, this is not economical nor is it the best solution for the patient as the patient may need a size between ones that are available in inventory.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Therefore, a need exists for a device that can efficiently and cleanly cut a mesh cage to a desired length while not damaging the cage and provide a smooth edge to the cut mesh cage so it does not cause damage to the surrounding tissue and vasculature of the patient.</p><heading id="h0005"><b><u>Summary</u></b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">In an aspect of the present disclosure, a surgical system for providing a mesh cage includes a mesh cage and a scoring device. The scoring device includes a fixed body having proximal and distal ends, a handle, a threaded rod coupled to the handle, first and second arms, and at least one scoring disc. The first and second arms are positioned at the distal end of the fixed body and are movable with respect to one another between an open and closed condition. The at least one scoring disc is rotatably coupled to one of the first or second arms. The at least one scoring disc is configured to engage the mesh cage when the first and second arms are in the closed condition. The system can also include a mandrel having a cage support. The cage support is positionable within an inner channel of the mesh cage. The mandrel can include a handle and a bent portion. The bent portion defines an angle between the handle and the cage support. The mandrel can further include a retention assembly. The retention assembly is configured to secure the mesh cage to the mandrel in a fixed position.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In embodiments, the first arm of the scoring device is fixed to the distal end of the fixed body and is C-shaped and the second arm is slidably positioned within an opening in the distal end of the fixed body. The second arm has a first position and a second position corresponding to the open and closed conditions respectively. The second arm is operatively<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> associated with the threaded rod such that the threaded rod moves the second arm between the first and second positions.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In some embodiments, the first and second arms of the scoring device each have a proximal end pivotally coupled to the fixed body. The threaded rod engages the proximal ends of each of the first and second arms to move the first and second arms between the open and closed conditions. The at least one scoring disc can be rotatably coupled to the distal end of the first arm and a rotatable anvil can be rotatably coupled to the distal end of the second arm.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In another aspect of the present disclosure, a system for cutting a mesh cage is provided, the system comprises a mesh cage having first and second ends and having a first length; and<br/>
a scoring device for creating a score mark on the mesh cage at a position corresponding to a second length from an end of the mesh cage, the second length different from the first length, so that a portion of the mesh cage beyond the score mark can be removed.<br/>
The scoring device may be according to the scoring device described above.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a method for cutting a mesh cage includes providing a mesh cage, creating a score mark, and removing a portion of the mesh cage. Providing a mesh cage includes providing a mesh cage having first and second ends and having a first length. Creating a score mark includes creating a score mark on the mesh cage at a position corresponding to a second length from an end of the mesh cage with a scoring device, the second length different from the first length. Removing a portion of the mesh cage includes removing a portion of the mesh cage beyond the score mark.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Creating a score mark may include cutting through the mesh cage with the scoring device. Creating the score mark may include rotating and/or oscillating the scoring device about a longitudinal axis of the mesh cage.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The method may further include inserting a mandrel through an end of the mesh cage before creating the score mark. The method may also include retaining the mesh cage in a fixed position to the cage support of the mandrel with a retaining mechanism.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In embodiments, the method includes inserting an end of a mandrel through the first end of the mesh cage and inserting an end of a second mandrel through the second end of the mesh cage after scoring the mesh cage, the end of the first mandrel positioned near the score mark between the score mark and the first end of the mesh cage and the end of the second mandrel positioned near the score mark between the score mark and the second end of the mesh cage. The method may further include applying a force to another end of each of the mandrel and the second mandrel to remove the portion of the mesh cage beyond the score mark.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Further, to the extent consistent, any of the aspects described herein may be used in conjunction with any or all of the other aspects described herein.</p><heading id="h0006"><b><u>Brief Description of the Drawings</u></b></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">Various aspects of the present disclosure are described hereinbelow with reference to the drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIG. 1</b></figref> is a perspective view of the components of a system in accordance with the present disclosure;</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIG. 2</b></figref> is a perspective view of the components of the system of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> with the mesh cage positioned on the mandrel and the jaws of the scoring device in the open position;</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIG. 3</b></figref> is a perspective view of the components of the system of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> with the jaws of the scoring device in the closed condition;<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0003"><b>FIG. 4</b></figref> is a perspective view of the components of the system of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> with the jaws of the scoring device in the closed condition and the cutting plane of the scoring disc positioned at the desired length illustrating oscillation of the scoring device about the mesh cage;</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0003"><b>FIG. 5</b></figref> is a perspective view of the components of the system of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> with a portion of the mesh cage separated from another portion of the mesh cage;</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0004"><b>FIGS. 6A-C</b></figref>are a progression of perspective views of another mandrel in accordance with the present disclosure being used to separate two portions of a mesh cage at a score mark;</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0005"><b>FIGS. 7A</b> and <b>7B</b></figref> are perspective views of yet another mandrel in accordance with the present disclosure including a retaining mechanism;</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0006"><b>FIG. 8</b></figref> is a perspective view of another scoring device in accordance with the present disclosure including inner and outer arms;</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0006"><b>FIGS. 9-11</b></figref> are a progression of the scoring device of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8</figref> being used to score a mesh cage</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0007"><b>FIG. 12</b></figref> is a perspective view of yet another scoring device in accordance with the present disclosure including a scoring disc and an anvil; and</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0008"><b>FIGS. 13</b> and <b>14</b></figref> are perspective views of a kit in accordance with the present disclosure including a mesh cage and a scoring device.</p><heading id="h0007"><b><u>Detailed Description</u></b></heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">Embodiments of the present disclosure are now described in detail with reference to the drawings in which like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding elements in each of the several views.
