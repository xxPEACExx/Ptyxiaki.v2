In a gas turbine engine, for example, a compressor feeds high pressure air to the combustor or combustion chamber. The combustor then heats the air along with a fuel at a constant pressure. After combustion, the generated exhaust gases are fed from the combustor to the turbine via the nozzle guide vanes. Such an engine employed in a gas turbine plant or a combined cycle plant, for example, is operated to achieve higher operational efficiency under higher temperature and higher pressure conditions, and tends to increase emissions (for example, CO, NOx) in an exhaust gas stream. Although various factors for generation of emissions are known, the dominant one is flame temperature in a combustor.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">CO emissions in gas turbines are an important parameter for machines which are required to operate away from baseload (maximum capacity) conditions. Increased CO emission is associated with the typically lower pressures/temperatures associated with part load operation of the machine. Such conditions are characterized by inadequate consumption of CO produced in the flame front.</p><heading id="h0002">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a combustion nozzle is disclosed.

The gas turbine 10 includes a compressor 14 configured to compress ambient air. The combustor 12 is in flow communication with the compressor 14 and is configured to receive compressed air 11 from the compressor 14 and to combust a fuel stream to generate a combustor exit gas stream 13. In the illustrated embodiment, the combustor 12 includes a combustor housing 20 defining a combustion area. In one embodiment, the combustor 12 includes a can combustor. In an alternate embodiment, the combustor 12 includes a can-annular combustor or a purely annular combustor. In addition, the gas turbine 10 includes a turbine 16 located<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> downstream of the combustor 12. The turbine 16 is configured to expand the combustor exit gas stream 13 to drive an external load. In the illustrated embodiment, the compressor 14 is driven by the power generated by the turbine 16 via a shaft 18.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The combustor 12 includes a combustion nozzle for receiving compressed air 11 and the fuel stream, mix the air 11 and the fuel stream to generate an air-fuel mixture, and inject the air-fuel mixture to a combustion zone. The combustion nozzle is explained in greater detail with reference to subsequent figures.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the combustor 12 in accordance with the aspects of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrated. The exemplary combustor 12 includes a combustor housing 22 defining a combustion chamber 24. A cover assembly (not shown) may be provided on one end of the combustor housing 22. A combustion liner 26 is disposed within the combustor housing 22. The combustion liner 26 may be provided with a plurality of dilution holes.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">A combustion nozzle 28 is disposed within the combustion chamber 24. The exemplary combustion nozzle 28 includes a mixing section 30 and an exit section 32. The combustor 12 further includes a fuel plenum 34 for supplying a fuel to the combustion chamber 24. The fuel enters the combustion nozzle 28 via one or more fuel inlet holes 36 provided in the mixing section 30. The mixing section 30 also has an air inlet 38 for receiving the air stream 11 from the compressor.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In certain embodiments, the fuel may include hydrocarbons, natural gas, or high hydrogen gas, or hydrogen, or biogas, or carbon monoxide, or syngas, or inert gas, or water vapor, or oxidizers along with predetermined amount of diluents. Diluents may include nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water, steam, or the like.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The mixing section 30 of the combustion nozzle 28 is configured to mix air 11 and the fuel and generate an air-fuel mixture. The exit section 32 is configured to receive the air-fuel mixture and inject the air-fuel mixture to a combustion zone 40 of the combustion chamber 24. The exit section 32 is configured to generate turbulent flow of the air-fuel mixture in the combustion zone 40 of the combustor 12. The exit section 32 includes a plurality of jets formed in a predefined pattern on an exit surface<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> 42. The exit surface 42 with the plurality of jets is explained in greater detail with reference to subsequent figures.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the exit surface 42 having a plurality of jets 44 is illustrated. In accordance with the embodiments of the present invention, the plurality of jets 44 are spaced so to occupy a large area of the exit surface 42. In the illustrated embodiment, a core area of the plurality of jets 44 is defined as an area bounded by the farthest jets among the plurality of jets 44 from a surface center 46. In the illustrated embodiment, circumference of the core area of the plurality of jets 44 is represented by a circle 48. The plurality of jets 44 may be arranged in different patterns as explained with reference to subsequent figures.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In accordance with the embodiments of the present invention, a ratio of a core area of the plurality of jets to an exit surface area is greater than 0.25. In one embodiment of the exit section having a desired jet distribution, the ratio of the core area of the plurality of jets 44 to the exit surface area is in the range of 0.25 to 0.4. In another embodiment of the exit section having an alternate desired jet distribution, the ratio of the core area of the plurality of jets 44 to the exit surface area is in the range of 0.4 to 0.5. In yet another embodiment of the exit section having an alternate desired jet distribution, the ratio of the core area of the plurality of jets 44 to the exit surface area is greater than 0.5. It should be noted herein that although a circular nozzle is shown, it should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. Aspects of the present invention are also applicable to non-circular nozzles.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In some embodiments of the exit section having a desired jet distribution, a ratio of a diameter of the core area of the plurality of jets 44 to an exit surface diameter is in the range of 0.5 to 0.63.

Increased CO emission is associated with the typically lower<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> pressures/temperatures associated with part load operation of the machine. At such conditions, the intra-jet recirculation zones generated by conventional combustion nozzles based on arrays of jet phase are not sufficiently large to consume the CO produced at the flame front of the combustor.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">It should be noted herein that "bluff area" on the exit surface of the exit section of the nozzle leads to generation of CO. In accordance with the embodiments of the present invention, distributed jets with minimal "bluff areas" on the exit surface of the section of the nozzle enable generation of intra-jet recirculation zones sufficiently large to consume the CO produced at the flame front of the combustor. In other words, the plurality of jets 44 are spaced in such a way so as to occupy "a large area" of the exit surface 42.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>, the exit section 32 of the nozzle in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated.

The plurality of jets 44 are spaced in such a way that a spacing between two mutually adjacent jets among the plurality of jets 44 is representative of a distance extending from a center of one jet to another corresponding center of other jet among the mutually adjacent jets 44. In the illustrated embodiment, the spacing between two mutually adjacent jets is represented by "s", and diameter of each jet is represented by "d".</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In one embodiment of the exit section 32 having a desired jet spacing, a ratio of the spacing "s" between two mutually adjacent jets among the plurality of jets to the jet diameter "d" is in a range of 1.5 to 1.9. In another embodiment of the exit section 32 having an alternate desired jet spacing, a ratio of the spacing "s" between two mutually adjacent jets among the plurality of jets 44 to the jet diameter "d" is in a range of 1.9 to 2.5. In yet another embodiment of the exit section 32 having an alternate desired jet spacing, a ratio of the spacing "s" between two mutually adjacent jets among the plurality of jets to the jet diameter "d" is greater than 2.5.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>, the plurality of jets 44 formed in a hexagonal pattern on the exit surface of the exit section of the nozzle is illustrated.
