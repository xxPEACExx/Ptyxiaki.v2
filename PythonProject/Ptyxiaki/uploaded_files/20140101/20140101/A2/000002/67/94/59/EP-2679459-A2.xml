Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">For a railway vehicle that travels on non-electrified lines, a railway vehicle traction system is generally used which generates alternating-current power by causing an internal-combustion engine such as a diesel engine to drive a power generator, causes a rectifier or a power converter to convert the alternating-current power into direct-current power, and causes a power inverter to drive an alternating-current motor. As power generators, a separately-excited alternator (synchronous generator) is widely used while recently a permanent magnet generator is used in many cases. The separately-excited alternator can generate voltage by rotating. The permanent magnet generator is advantageous since the associated electric motor is reduced in size and weight and achieves higher efficiency.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2008049811A"><text>JP-2008-49811-A</text></patcit> discloses a hybrid traction system that has an engine, an induction generator, a power converter for converting an alternating current output from the induction generator into a direct current, a power inverter for converting the direct current into an alternating current to be used to drive a railway vehicle, and a storage battery device connected to a direct-current power unit of a main circuit and can effectively use regenerative electric power for braking. In addition, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2008049811A"><text>JP-2008-49811-A</text></patcit> discloses that the engine is started by driving the induction generator as an electric motor using power stored in the storage battery device connected to the direct-current power unit of the main circuit.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In addition, the induction generator is smaller and more inexpensive than synchronous motors and has a simpler structure than synchronous motors. The induction generator does not need a contactor such as a slip ring, and thus has an advantage that its reliability is higher.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">A typical traction system does not have a storage battery device for a direct-current power unit of a main circuit; therefore such a traction system cannot acquire exciting energy necessary upon activation of an induction generator, unlike the hybrid traction system described in<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2008049811A"><text>JP-2008-49811-A</text></patcit>. As a result, the typical traction system must use a synchronous generator. Thus, there is a problem that the typical traction system cannot use a small, inexpensive, and highly reliable induction generator as a power generator.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">An object of the invention is to allow even a traction system, which does not have a storage battery device for a direct-current power unit of the traction system, to use an induction generator as a power generator.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In order to address the aforementioned problems, according to the invention, a railway vehicle traction system includes an engine; an induction generator that is driven by the engine; a first power converter that converts alternating-current power output from the induction generator into direct-current power; a smoothing capacitor that smoothes the direct-current power output from the first power converter; a second power converter that converts the direct-current power output from the smoothing capacitor serving as a direct-current voltage source into alternating-current power and drives an electric motor; storage battery means for supplying power to an on-vehicle control device; and a contactor that is connected between the storage battery means and the smoothing capacitor. In the railway vehicle traction system, the contactor is closed, the smoothing capacitor is charged by the storage<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> battery means, and a current is supplied to the induction generator in order to start an operation of generating power using power charged in the smoothing capacitor.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the traction system that uses, as a power source, the induction generator mechanically coupled with the engine but does not include a large-capacity storage battery device that is used for a hybrid traction system or the like, the induction generator can be used as a power generator. Thus, the traction system that is small, inexpensive and highly reliable can be provided.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description of embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:

For example, a voltage of 24V, 72V, 100V, or 110V is often used for such on-vehicle control devices. An amount of voltage is stored in a direct-current power unit of a main circuit by supplying the power from the storage battery to the direct-current power unit, and an induction generator is activated by the voltage. In this case, the power sufficient to drive the induction generator in consideration of a loss of a power converter is supplied to the direct-current power unit of the main circuit. After completion of the supply of the power to the direct-current power unit of the main circuit, the storage battery is separated from the direct-current power unit of the main circuit by opening a contactor. Thus, after the induction generator starts generating power, insulation is ensured between the main circuit whose direct-current power unit is subject to voltages as high as several thousand volts and a power supply circuit provided with the storage battery for supplying a relatively low voltage of several ten volts to one hundred volts to the on-vehicle control devices.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">After the activation of the induction generator, the power supplied from the induction generator enables the voltage of the direct-current power unit of the main<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> circuit to be maintained and enables power to be supplied to an electric motor for driving the railway vehicle through a power inverter.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Therefore, a railway vehicle traction system including the induction generator that is small, inexpensive, and highly reliable and used as a power generator can be provided in a manner that is simple in circuit configuration.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Hereinafter, embodiments of the invention are described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h0007">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating a railway vehicle traction system according to the first embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The railway vehicle traction system illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> includes an engine 1, an induction generator (IG) 2, a power converter 3, a power inverter 4, a smoothing capacitor (FC) 5, and an electric motor 15. The induction generator 2 is driven by the engine 1. The power converter 3 converts alternating-current power output from the induction generator 2 into direct-current power. The smoothing capacitor 5 (FC) smoothes the direct-current power output from the power converter 3. The power inverter 4 converts, into alternating-current power, the direct-current power output from the smoothing capacitor 5<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> serving as a direct-current voltage supply source. The electric motor 15 is driven by the power inverter 4. In the railway vehicle traction system, a direct-current power unit of a main circuit is arranged between the power converter 3 and the power inverter 4 and connected through a contactor 7 and a current reducing element 16 to a low-voltage storage voltage 6 (of 110 V in this example) for supplying power to an on-vehicle control device, and power can be supplied from the low-voltage storage battery 6 to the smoothing capacitor 5. The current-reducing element 16 is a resistor or the like. The on-vehicle control device includes at least any of a control circuit for the power converter 3 and power inverter 4, an on-vehicle signal device such as an on-vehicle automatic train control (ATC) device, a driver's board, a central control unit for communicating with devices within the traction system, and a brake control device.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Next, operations of the railway vehicle traction system illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> are described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>.

The railway vehicle traction system according to the second embodiment includes a second power inverter 9, a transformer 10, and a rectifier 8. The second power inverter 9 is arranged between the direct-current power unit of the main circuit and the contactor 7 and converts a direct-current voltage of the storage battery 6 into an alternating current. The transformer 10 transforms an alternating-current voltage output from the second power<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> inverter 9. The rectifier 8 converts a secondary voltage of the transformer 10 into a direct current. The smoothing capacitor 5 is charged by the storage battery 6 through the second power inverter 9, the transformer 10, and the rectifier 8. Other parts are the same as the traction system illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> and constituent elements that have the same functions as those of the traction system illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> are indicated by the same reference numerals and symbols. Regarding the operations to be executed for the start of the induction generator 2, the operation of charging the smoothing capacitor 5 by the storage battery 6 through the current-reducing element 16 is replaced with an operating of charging the smoothing capacitor 5 by the storage battery 6 through the second power inverter 9, the transformer 10, and the rectifier 8. Other operations and configurations are the same as the first embodiment.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the second embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, since the smoothing capacitor 5 is charged by the storage battery 6 through the transformer 10, the storage battery 6 can be insulated from the main circuit during the charging of the smoothing capacitor 5. Specifically, there is an advantage that even if the contactor 7 fails due to a short circuit, it is possible to prevent a high voltage of the main circuit from being applied to the control power source<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> and therefore prevent the control device from being adversely affected.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In addition, by setting the ratio of the number of turns of a coil on a secondary side (side of the main circuit) to the number of turns of a coil on a primary side (side of the storage battery 6) in the transformer 10 to 1 or larger, the smoothing capacitor 5 can be charged to a higher voltage than the voltage of the storage battery 6. Thus, the induction generator 2 can be stably activated. Since energy stored in the smoothing capacitor 5 is C × V<sup>2</sup>/2 (C is capacitance of the smoothing capacitor 5, and V is the charged voltage), the charged voltage V is equal to or lower than the voltage of the storage battery 6. In order to activate the induction generator 2, it is necessary that the capacitance C of the smoothing capacitor 5 be sufficiently large in the first embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. In the second embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, on the other hand, the charged voltage V of the smoothing capacitor 5 can be freely set. Thus, even if the capacitance C of the smoothing capacitor 5 is small, energy that is sufficient to activate the induction generator 2 can be stored in the smoothing capacitor 5.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the circuit of the second embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the higher the ratio of the numbers of turns of the coils in the transformer 10, the higher energy can be<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> stored in the smoothing capacitor 5. When the smoothing capacitor 5 is charged so that the energy stored in the smoothing capacitor 5 is equal to or higher than the sum of energy necessary to activate the engine 1 and energy necessary to activate the induction generator 2, the induction generator 2 can be driven by the smoothing capacitor 5 during stop of the engine 1, and the engine can be activated. As a result, a starter motor for activating the engine 1 is not required. Thus, the system can be simplified, and the traction system that is reliable can be provided.</p><heading id="h0009">Third Embodiment</heading><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a diagram illustrating a railway vehicle traction system according to the third embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the traction system illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, an output of the transformer 10 is connected to an alternating-current input end of the power converter 3. The power converter 3 has a rectifying function that rectifies the output of the transformer 10 and achieves the charging of the smoothing capacitor 5.
