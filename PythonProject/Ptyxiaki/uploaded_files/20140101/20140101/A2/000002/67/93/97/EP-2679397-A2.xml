Thus, it was found that light waves interfere with each other at the interface between the porous layer and the outermost layer.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present inventors thought that it is important not to separate the porous layer and the outermost layer and studied the integration of the porous layer and the outermost layer. First, a coating liquid<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> prepared by mixing the materials for the porous layer (including inorganic particles and a binder) and the materials for the outermost layer (including particles having a particular particle size and a binder) was applied to a substrate. Although the occurrence of the interference fringes was reduced, ink absorbency and scratch resistance also deteriorated. This is probably because particles otherwise present on the surface of the recording medium and contributing to scratch resistance are present within the ink-receiving layer, thereby causing a deterioration in scratch resistance, and because the presence of many particles in the ink-receiving layer causes a deterioration in ink absorbency.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present inventors then studied the integration of the porous layer and the outermost layer while the scratch resistance and ink absorbency functions are separated by placing a region containing many particles having a particular particle size mainly contributing to scratch resistance close to the outermost ink-receiving layer and placing a region containing many inorganic particles mainly contributing to ink absorbency far from the outermost ink-receiving layer. As a result, the present inventors arrived at the present invention. The<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> present invention was found to reduce the occurrence of interference fringes. The present invention was also found to improve ink absorbency and scratch resistance. Although there is no clear reason for this, the present inventors believe the reason as described below.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In general, a plurality of ink-receiving layers have discontinuity in ink absorbency at their interface(s). Thus, absorbed ink may be blocked at the interface(s) because of a difference in ink absorbency between an upper layer and a lower layer. In contrast, an embodiment of the present invention involves no multilayer and does not cause a phenomenon of blocking ink absorption at an interface. Furthermore, a region farther from the outermost ink-receiving layer has higher ink absorbency. This can accelerate ink absorption and improve ink absorbency. Scratch resistance can be improved by strong bonding of particles having a particular particle size and inorganic particles with a binder.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">These constituents can synergistically produce their effects to achieve the advantages of the present invention.</p><heading id="h0006">[Recording Medium]</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">A recording medium according to an embodiment of<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the present invention includes a substrate and at least one ink-receiving layer.

The polymer layer may be disposed on one or both sides of the paper substrate.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The paper substrate is mainly made of wood pulp. If necessary, the paper substrate is made of wood pulp and synthetic pulp, such as polypropylene pulp, or synthetic fibers, such as nylon or polyester fibers. Examples of the wood pulp include, but are not limited to, leaf bleached kraft pulp (LBKP), leaf bleached sulfite pulp (LBSP), needle bleached kraft pulp (NBKP), needle bleached sulfite pulp (NBSP), leaf dissolving pulp (LDP), needle dissolving pulp (NDP), leaf unbleached kraft pulp (LUKP), and needle unbleached kraft pulp (NUKP). These may be used alone or<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> in combination. The wood pulp may be LBKP, NBSP, LBSP, NDP, or LDP, which contains a large amount of short fiber component. The pulp may be chemical pulp (sulfate pulp or sulfite pulp) containing less impurities. The pulp may be bleached to increase the degree of whiteness.

In an embodiment of the present invention, the thickness of the polymer layer is calculated by the following method. First, a recording medium is cut with a microtome, and the cross section is observed with a scanning electron microscope. The thickness measurements at 100 or more points are averaged to determine the thickness of the polymer layer. The thickness of another layer in an embodiment of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> invention is also determined in the same manner.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The polymer layers on both sides of the paper substrate may have the thickness described above. The polymer layer may be made of a thermoplastic polymer. Examples of the thermoplastic polymer include, but are not limited to, acrylic polymers, acrylic silicone polymers, polyolefin polymers, and styrene-butadiene copolymers. Among these, the thermoplastic polymer may be a polyolefin polymer. The term "polyolefin polymer", as used herein, refers to a polymer of an olefin monomer. More specifically, the polyolefin polymer may be a homopolymer or a copolymer of ethylene, propylene, and/or isobutylene. These polyolefin polymers may be used alone or in combination. Among these, the polyolefin polymer may be polyethylene. The polyethylene may be a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) or a high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The polymer layer may contain a white pigment, a fluorescent brightener, and/or an ultramarine blue pigment to control its opacity, degree of whiteness, or hue. In particular, the polymer layer may contain a white pigment to improve its opacity.
