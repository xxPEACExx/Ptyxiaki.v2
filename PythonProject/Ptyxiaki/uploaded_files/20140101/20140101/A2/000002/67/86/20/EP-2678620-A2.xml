More specifically, the invention relates to adsorption compressors integrated in a heat pump, in which the compressors make use of a thermal wave through a bed of solid adsorbents. Such compressors are for instance described in US-A-4 610 148, incorporated herein in its entirety, wherein two beds of adsorbents are used, which are arranged in a shell through which heat exchanging channels are arranged. The heat exchanging channels are connected to a closed circuit of heat exchanging fluid comprising a set of pumps, an additional heat exchanger with cooling action and a heat exchanger with heating action. The shell sides of these adsorbent beds are connected to a heat pump comprising a condenser, an expansion valve and an evaporator. These two beds each are connected both to the condenser and the evaporator side of the heat pump by means of check valves. Further examples of publications that discuss thermal waves in adsorption heat pumps are US-A-4 637 218; Jones J.A (Heat recovery systems &amp; CHP 13(1993)363-371); Pons M., Applied thermal engineering, 16(1996)395-404); Sun L.M. et al.

The water vapor originating from the adsorption beds is guided through a set of check valves to a condenser of a heat pump. There the water vapor is condensed in a high pressure condenser, and the condensed water is guided through a pressure release valve, where due to the Joules Thomson effect, the temperature decreases substantially </p><p id="p0005" num="0005">adiabatically, thus providing cooling capacity.

In order to have a </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">substantially constant cooling power in the evaporator, two adsorption beds are chosen.

Thus the Coefficient of Performance may be too low for economical service. In order to maximize the use of the heat of the heat transfer fluid, shortcuts may be integrated in both the hot and cold portions of the cycles. The clusters 26A, 26B or 26C and 26D to be cooled can be connected to the cooler 31 and the clusters 26C and 26D or 26A and 26B to be heated can be connected to the heat exchanger or heater 32. Thus substantially four modes of operation are possible. This can be performed in two ways, firstly by maintaining the flow directions in the shell sides of the clusters 26A-D or the cells 1 and secondly by switching the direction of flow when switching from cooling to heating and vice versa. </p><p id="p0227" num="0227"> In figure 10A-D a first alternative with short cuts, without changing the direction of the flow in the clusters 26A-D is represented.

In figure 10A the first mode of the cycle is represented, in which the heat transfer fluid is pumped from heater 32 through three way valve 53 to cluster 26A, in which the adsorbing material is heated.

During switching, the three way valves 54 and 55 are switched, resulting in that heater 32 and the cluster 26A are in a first separate cycle and cooler 31 and cluster 26C are in a second separate cycle. Thus cluster 26A is still further heated up, while its exit stream of heat transfer fluid now is guided back to heater 32 in stead of to the cooler 31. Meanwhile cluster 26C is still cooled down, while its exit stream is returned to the cooler 31 instead of to the heater 32. </p><p id="p0230" num="0230"> At a moment the thermal wave is fully broken through and further heating of cluster 26A as well as further cooling of cluster 26C is impossible. </p><p id="p0231" num="0231"> At that moment the cycle will be reversed, such that the cooled cluster 26C must be re-heated, the heated cluster 26A must be re-cooled.

 In this figure, the cluster 26A is now cooled down, and the cluster 26C is now heated up. Once the relative flattened (dispersed) thermal waves in cluster 26A and 26C break through, the cycle is switched to a second shortcut mode, as represented in figure 10D. In this figure, the heater 32 and the cluster 26B form a third closed cycle, while the cooler 31 and the cluster 26A form a fourth closed cycle.

In this first mode the thermal waves that break through are in fact a hot front reaching the cold side 40E of cluster 26E and simultaneously the cold front reaching the hot end 39F of cluster 26F. In the embodiment as represented by figures 7 and 8, at this moment the flow within the clusters would have been reversed. Since however the thermal wave may be more flattened (dispersed), in order to gain the performance, in the second mode, cluster 26E is further heated and cluster 26F is further cooled, however the exiting flows are diverted. In this mode, as depicted in figure 11B, the exiting flow of cluster

 At this very moment, it is less efficient to heat up the heat transfer fluid exiting cluster 26A and to use it to further heat up cluster 26C.
