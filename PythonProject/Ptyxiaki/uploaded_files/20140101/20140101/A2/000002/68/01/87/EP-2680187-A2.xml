In some embodiments, the foot pedal device 165 can be moved by a cashier to provide the best ease of use. The pedals on the foot pedal device 165 provide a user interface that allows the cashier to start, stop and reverse the direction of each conveyor belt controlled by the foot pedal device 165. In some embodiments, the foot pedal device 165 is replaced by cashier operated switches and sensors that determine the presences of an item on a conveyor belt.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The POS terminal 100 is designed to operate as an assisted terminal. A trained cashier operates the terminal 100 and stands on the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> near side of the POS terminal 100 next to foot pedal device 165. A customer wishing to purchase one or more items approaches the POS terminal 100 on the far side of the POS terminal 100 next to the input conveyor belt 104. The customer places the one or more items for purchase on the input conveyor belt 104 which transports each item to the scanner 110. As described in more detail below, the scanner 110: receives items from the input conveyor belt 104; scans each item by moving the item across the top of the scanner using a conveyor belt <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref>, 225; and delivers each item to the take away belt 106. As an item moves across the scanner 110, the scanner 110 identifies the item using a barcode on the item and determines the weight of the item if necessary. The take away conveyor belt 106 receives items from the scanner 110 and transports them to the bag well 108 for bagging.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The cashier uses the foot pedal device 165 to control all the conveyor belts on the POS terminal 100.

The control circuitry 360 provides an interface between the processor 350 and the memory 355 and between the processor 350 and a computer bus 365 used to control the communications controller 370 and the video controller 375.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The communications controller 370 includes hardware and software required to communicate with external devices and peripherals over a computer peripheral network 380. In some embodiments, the computer peripheral network 380 is implemented using the industry standard Universal Serial Bus (USB). In other embodiments, the computer peripheral network 380 may include wired or wireless communications links or both. The scanner 110, the magnetic card reader 130 and the foot pedal device 165 are connected to the computer peripheral network 380. The video controller 375 controls the information displayed on the cashier display 120 and the customer display 140.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The foot pedal device 165 has a number of pedals that are used by the cashier to control the three conveyor belts on the POS terminal 100. The cashier can start, stop and reverse the conveyor belts using the pedals. When the cashier activates a pedal that controls the conveyor belt 225 on the scanner 110, the processor 350 of the POS terminal 100 receives the request from the foot pedal device 165 and sends a command to the scanner 110 over the computer peripheral network 380. The command causes the processor 310 to implement the request from the foot pedal. The request can be to start, stop or reverse the conveyor belt 225. In some embodiments, the input conveyor belt 104 and the take away conveyor belt 106 are controlled by switches on the main housing 150 and sensors are used to start and stop the conveyor belts when items are detected on the belts. In these embodiments, the foot pedal device 165 only controls the conveyor belt 225 in the scanner 110 so the foot pedal device 165 is connected to and controlled by the scanner 110 instead of the processor 350 of the POS terminal 100.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The scanner 110 includes the computer unit 285.

In other embodiments, the computer peripheral networks 380,330 may include wired or wireless communications links or both.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The scanner 110 uses the second computer peripheral network 330 to control the conveyor belt motor 280, the imaging scanner 305 and the weigh scale 270. The conveyer belt motor 280 is controlled by the processor 310 and can be operated at different speeds and in a forward and a reverse direction. The forward direction moves items from the right side to the left side of the scanner 100. Unless otherwise stated, when the conveyor belt 225 is started, it is moving in the forward direction. The imaging scanner 305 includes all the image capture devices 265A-E, 225A-C and any illumination devices. The imaging scanner 305 captures images using the image capture devices 265A-E, 225A-C and processes the images to identify and decode optical codes. The imaging scanner 305 is controlled by the processor 310. In some embodiment, the processor 310 processes the captured images and decodes the optical code. In other embodiments, the imaging scanner 305 includes a separate processor that processes the captured images and decodes the optical code. The weigh<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> scale 270 is controlled by the processor 310 and is used to determine the weight of an item on the conveyor belt 225.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">When an item is received by the scanner 110 and identified as an item that is sold by weight, the scanner 110 moves the item to the middle of the scanner 110 and stops the conveyor belt 225. The weight of the item is determined by the weigh scale 270. The scanner 110 sends the weight to the POS terminal 100 and starts the conveyor belt 225 to move the item to the take away belt 106. An item sold by weight can be automatically identified by a barcode attached to the item and scanned by the scanner 110 or by using a manual process where the cashier identifies the item and instruct the POS terminal 100 to have the scanner 110 weigh it.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">When an item passes through the scanning area of the scanner 110 and is not identified, the scanner 110 will cause the conveyor belt 225 to reverse direction until the item is moved back into the scanning area to attempt to rescan the item for identification. If the second attempt to identify the item fails, a message will be displayed on the cashier display 120 requesting that the cashier identify the item. In some embodiments, the scanner 110 also sends the POS terminal 100 a command to stop the input conveyor belt 104 when the scanner 110 attempts to rescan an item. When the item is identified, the scanner 110 sends a command to the POS terminal 100 to start the input conveyor belt 104. In some embodiments, the number of rescans is a software parameter and can be set to a plurality of the different values by an administrator of the POS terminal 100.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062"><figref idrefs="f0006 f0007">Fig. 4</figref> is a high-level flow chart illustrating an exemplary method 400 of operating the scanner 110. At step 402, an item is received for identification by the scanner 110. In the POS terminal system 100, the item is delivered to the scanner 110 by the input conveyor belt 104. At step 405, the item is moved through the scan area using the conveyor belt 225 in the scanner 110. As the item moves off the input conveyor belt 104, it moves onto the scanner's 110 conveyor belt 225. The scan area comprises the general area between the two conveyor belts 225,104 and an area over the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> right end of the conveyor belt 225. The second aperture 245 is located on the top side 205 of the scanner 110 in the area between the two conveyor belts 225, 104. The area between the input conveyor belt 104 and the conveyor belt 225 on the scanner 110 is relatively small. Thus, the input conveyor belt 104 pushes average sized items across the area and partially onto the scanner's 110 conveyor belt 225. The partial contact with the conveyor belt 225 is sufficient in most cases for the item to be captured by the conveyor belt 225 and moved across the scanner 110. In some cases, the cashier may have to nudge the item onto the conveyor belt 225 but this is still an improvement of over picking up each item.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">At step 410, images of the item are captured by image capture devices 235A-C located in the upper housing 230 and by image capture devices 265A-E located under the second aperture 245. At step 415, the captured images are processed to decode data for any barcode that was captured.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Step 420 determines if a barcode was found and the data decoded. If a barcode was decoded, the method continues to step 423. If a barcode was not decoded, the method continues to step 435. At step 423, the decoded barcode data is transmitted to the POS terminal 100 over the computer peripheral network 380. At step 425, it is determined if a command has been received to weigh the item. The POS terminal 100 determines if the identified item is sold by weight and must be weighed. Therefore, the POS terminal must send a command that causes the scanner 110 to weigh the item if it is sold by weight. If a weigh command has been received, control is transferred to step 460. If no command has been received, the method continues at step 430. At step 430, the item moved off the scanner 110 using the conveyor belt 225.

At step 460, the conveyor belt 225 is stopped. This removes any vibrations that might prevent an accurate weight reading. At<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> step 465, the weight of the item is determined by the weigh scale 270. The weight of the item is determined by taking the weight of the item and all the elements mounted on the weigh scale 270 and subtracting the known weight of all the elements mounted on the weigh scale 270. At step 470, the weight of the item is transmitted to the POS terminal 100 over the computer peripheral network 380.

The method 400 allows an item to be rescanned once. However, other embodiments permit additional rescans as a software selectable option. At step 435, it is determined if the item has been rescanned and the rescanned failed. If it has, control passes to step 480. If the item has not been rescanned, control passes to step 440. At step 440, the direction of the conveyor belt 225 is reversed which moves the item back into the scan area. At step 445, the direction of the conveyor belt 225 is changed back to the forward direction. In some embodiments, sensors are used to determine when an item is in the scan area. In other embodiments, one or more of the image capture devices are used to capture images that are processed to determine the location of the item and when it is the scan area. Control then passes to step 405 where more images are captured in an attempt to read a barcode on the item.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The following section of the method 400 is used when a rescan of the item failed to read a barcode. At step 480, the conveyor belt 225 is stopped with the item still on it. At step 485, a message is sent for display on the cashier display 120. The message requests that the cashier identify the item on the conveyor belt 225. The message is transmitted on the computer peripheral network 380 to the POS terminal 100. At step 490, it is determined if a command to continue has been received. The cashier enters the identification for the item using the cashier keyboard 120 which it connected to the POS terminal's 100 processor 350. Before the scanner 110 can continue scanning items, the POS terminal's 100 processor 350 must send a continue command to the scanner 110.
