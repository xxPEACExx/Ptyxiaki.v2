Field</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Apparatuses, systems and methods consistent with exemplary embodiments generally relate to a display apparatus, an electronic device, an interactive system, and controlling methods thereof, and more particularly, to a display apparatus which is controlled according to a voice of a user, an electronic device, an interactive system, and controlling methods thereof.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>2. Description of the Related Art</b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">Various types of display apparatuses have developed and have been distributed with the development of electronic technologies. In particular, various types of display apparatuses including a TV have been used in homes. These display apparatuses have gradually had various functions according to demands of users. In particular, a TV has been connected to the Internet to support an Internet service. Also, a user may view a large number of digital broadcast channels through the TV.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Therefore, various input methods for efficiently using various functions of a display apparatus are required. For example, an input method using a remote controller, an input method using a mouse, an input method using a touch pad, etc. have been applied to display apparatuses.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, it is difficult to effectively use various functions of a display apparatus by using only such simple input methods. For example, if all functions of<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> a display apparatus are realized to be controlled by only a remote controller, it is necessary to increase the number of buttons of the remote controller. In this case, it is not easy for a user to learn how to use the remote controller. Also, in a method of displaying various menus on a screen to allow a user to search for and select a corresponding menu, the user is to check a complicated menu tree one by one in order to select a desired menu.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Various types of peripheral devices, such as a set-top box, a digital versatile disc (DVD) player, a home theater, etc., are connected to a display apparatus to be used. A remote controller operating along with the peripheral devices is to be separately controlled in order to control the peripheral devices. Therefore, a universal remote controller or the like capable of separately or simultaneously controlling various types of peripheral devices has been developed. However, in order to use the universal remote controller, a user has to directly search for manufacturing companies and model names of the peripheral devices and register the manufacturing companies and the model names in the universal remote controller.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, an efficient input method for controlling a display apparatus and various types of peripheral devices is required.</p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">Exemplary embodiments address at least the above problems and/or disadvantages and other disadvantages not described above.
