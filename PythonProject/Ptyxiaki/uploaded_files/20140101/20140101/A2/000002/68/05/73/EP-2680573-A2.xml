The signal input/output varies depending on a standard of a received signal or an exemplary embodiment type of image supply source or the display apparatus 100. For example, the signal input/output may receive signals/data according to the high definition multimedia interface (HDMI), universal serial bus (USB) and Component and may include a plurality of connection terminals (not shown) which correspond to the foregoing standards.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The image processor 110 processes an image signal, which is transmitted by the signal input/output, and an image signal supplied by an image supply source, according to various preset image processing operations. The image processor 110 outputs the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> processed image signal to the display 130 to thereby display an image on the display 130, based on the processed image signal.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The image processing operation of the image processor 110 may include a demultiplexing operation which divides a predetermined signal, a decoding operation which corresponds to an image format of an image signal, a de-interlacing operation which converts an interlace image signal into a progressive image signal, a scaling operation which adjusts an image signal to a preset resolution, a noise reduction operation which improves the quality as an image, a detail enhancement operation, a frame refresh rate conversion operation, etc., but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The display 120 displays an image thereon based on an image signal which is output by the image processor 110. The display 120 may be implemented by various display panels including liquid crystal, plasma, light-emitting diode (LED), organic light-emitting diode (OLED), surface-conduction electron-emitter, carbon nano-tube, and nano-crystals, but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The storage stores unlimited data therein according to a control by controller 150. The storage is implemented as a non-volatile memory such as a flash memory or as a hard disc drive. The storage is accessed by the controller 150, which reads/records/modifies/deletes/updates data stored in the storage.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The data which are stored in the storage include an operating system (OS) for driving the display apparatus 100, and various applications which are executed on the OS, and image data, additional data and setting information.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The storage may be mounted in the board 160 (to be described later); together with the controller 150 and the user input 140.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The remote control receiver 130 receives a user command from a remote distance and transmits the user's command which is input through a remote controller which is separated/spaced from the display apparatus 100.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The remote control receiver 130 may be implemented as a remote control reception board in which are mounted an IR receiver receiving an IR signal from a remote<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> controller, an LED and an eco sensor adjusts brightness which corresponds to the environment of the display apparatus 100.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The remote control receiver 130, according to an exemplary embodiment, may be structurally separated from the user input 140 which receives a user's command, and may be provided in small size, and is thus less limited in size in the arrangement of the display apparatus 10, and is provided in a desired place therein.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The controller 150 performs control operations for various elements of the display apparatus 100. For example, the controller 150 controls the image processor 110 to process an image, controls the display 120 to display the processed image thereon, receives and transmits signals/information/data through the signal input/output, performs a control operation which corresponds to a command from the remote control receiver 130 and the user input 140 to thereby control overall operations of the display apparatus 100.
