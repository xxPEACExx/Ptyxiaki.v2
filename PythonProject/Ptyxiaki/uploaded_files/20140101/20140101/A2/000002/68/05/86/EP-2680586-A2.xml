Devices like mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDA) are now being increasingly configured with image capturing tools, such as a camera, thereby facilitating easy capture of the image content. The captured images may be subjected to processing based on various user needs. For example, images corresponding to a scene captured from various viewpoints and angles may have a high amount of overlapping image portions. Such images may be processed to generate a panorama image. A panorama image refers to an image with an extended field of view (for example, a wide-angle representation) beyond that can be captured by an image sensor. The processing of images may also help in retrieving relatively similar images or deleting duplicate images from a large collection of images and help streamline browsing and storing of the images.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>SUMMARY OF SOME EMBODIMENTS</u></b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">Various aspects of example embodiments are set out in the claims.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In a first aspect, there is provided a method comprising: facilitating receipt of a source image; compressing a plurality of images based on the source image, wherein the plurality of images are associated with compression values generated on compression of the plurality of images; and identifying an at least partially matching image to the source image from among the plurality of images based on the compression values.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In a second aspect, there is provided an apparatus comprising at least one processor; and at least one memory comprising computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause the apparatus to at least perform: facilitate receipt of a source image; compress a plurality of images based on the source image, wherein the plurality of images are associated with compression values generated on compression of the plurality of images; and identify an at least partially matching image to the source image from among the plurality of images based on the compression values.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In a third aspect, there is provided a computer program product comprising at least one computer-readable storage medium, the computer-readable storage medium comprising a set of instructions, which, when executed by one or more processors, cause an apparatus to at least perform: facilitate receipt of a source image; compress a plurality of images based on the source image, wherein the plurality of images are associated with compression values generated on compression of the plurality of images; and identify an at least partially matching image to the source image from among the plurality of images based on the compression values.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In a fourth aspect, there is provided an apparatus comprising: means for facilitating receipt of a source image; means for compressing a plurality of images based on the source image, wherein the plurality of images are associated with compression values generated on compression of the plurality of images; and means for identifying an at least partially matching image to the source image from among the plurality of images based on the compression values.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In a fifth aspect, there is provided a computer program comprising program instructions which when executed by an apparatus, cause the apparatus to: facilitate receipt of a source image; compress a plurality of images based on the source image, wherein the plurality of images are associated with compression values generated on compression of the plurality of images; and identify an at least partially matching image to the source image from among the plurality of images based on the compression values.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</u></b></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">Various embodiments are illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which:

This may be done as the two images, even though capturing the same scene may capture the information with slight difference on account of difference in an angle of capture. Accordingly, alignment of pixels may be performed to obtain the view of one image in terms of other image. Accordingly, a warp may be computed to obtain one image in the view of the other image.
