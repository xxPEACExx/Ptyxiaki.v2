Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the description to refer to the same or like parts.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to an ID pattern transmission method and a transmitter using the same of the disclosure, the transmitter allocates communication resources used for transmitting an ID pattern, communication resource blocks may not encounter similarly severe fading channels, and the accuracy of the ID pattern detection in the receiver may be improved. In the following embodiments, an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system is taken as a system model for describing the spirit of the disclosure. However, the concept of the disclosure can also be applied to communication systems implemented by other configurations, and is not limited to the OFDM system.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of a transmitter according to an embodiment of the disclosure. In the present embodiment, the transmitter 100 includes a random sequence generator 110, a mapper 120 and a resource allocation unit 130. The random sequence generator 110 can generate a random sequence DS. The random sequence DS is, for example, digital data related to ID information of the transmitter 100, though the disclosure is not limited thereto. The mapper 120 is coupled to the random sequence generator 110. The mapper 120 maps the random sequence DS to an ID<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> pattern IDP. The ID pattern IDP is allocated on a frequency domain of the OFDM system, and may include a plurality of OFDM symbols on a plurality of subcarriers. For simplicity's purpose, a parameter L is used to represent the number of the OFDM symbols in the ID pattern IDP, where L is a positive integer.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The resource allocation unit 130 is coupled to the mapper 120. For example, the resource allocation unit 130 can be a peer discovery frame generator (not shown) configured in the transmitter 100 for generating a peer discovery frame. The resource allocation unit 130 can partition the ID pattern IDP into a plurality of ID segments. In detail, when the resource allocation unit 130 partitions the ID pattern IDP into S (which is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1) ID segments, where an i<sup>th</sup> (i is a positive integer between 1 and S) ID segment, for example, includes L<sub>i</sub> (which is a positive integer not less than 2) successive OFDM symbols on a single subcarrier in the frequency domain. Since the number (i.e. L) of the OFDM symbols in the ID pattern IDP is a sum of the OFDM symbols of S ID segments, L can be represented as L=L<sub>1</sub>+L<sub>2</sub>...+L<sub>S</sub>. Then, the resource allocation unit 130 can allocate the ID segments to a plurality of communication resource blocks to generate a frequency domain transmitted signal (i.e. a frequency domain transmitted signal of the peer discovery frame) having information of the ID pattern. Details of allocating the communication resources by the resource allocation unit 130 are described below with reference of figures.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref> is a schematic diagram of communication resource allocation according to an embodiment of the disclosure. In the present embodiment, it is assumed that the ID pattern IDP is partitioned into 2 (i.e. S=2) ID segments S1 and S2 by the resource allocation unit 130 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. The ID segments S1 and S2 respectively<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> include L/2 successive OFDM symbols on a single subcarrier in the frequency domain (assuming L/2 is a positive integer). Then, the resource allocation unit 130 allocates a communication resource block CS1 on a k<sup>th</sup> subcarrier to transmit the ID segment S1, and allocates a communication resource block CS2 on the k<sup>th</sup> subcarrier to transmit the ID segment S2. The adjacent communication resource blocks CS1 and CS2 are spaced by a predetermined number of symbols (which is represented by M, where M is a positive integer). Then, the resource allocation unit 130 transmits the ID segments S1 and S2 to, for example, an inverse fast Fourier transformer (IFFT) (not shown) to transform the frequency domain OFDM symbols (i.e. the OFDM symbols included in the ID segments S1 and S2) into corresponding time domain signals according to the resource allocation method of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref>, and transmits the time domain signals to a communication channel through, for example, an antenna (not shown) for device-to-device communication.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A general communication channel may have a characteristic of fading channel due to influence of environmental factors (for example, a Doppler effect and/or multi-path transmission). By spacing the transmitted communication resource blocks by the predetermined number of symbols, a time diversity gain may be obtained for the ID segments. In detail, since the communication resource blocks CS1 and CS2 are spaced by the predetermined number (i.e. M) of symbols, when the communication resource block CS1 of the ID segment S1 encounters a severe fading channel, a probability that the communication resource block CS2 of the ID segment S2 encounters the similarly severe fading channel is greatly decreased. In this way, when a receiver (not shown) receives the ID segments S1 and S2 according to the communication resource blocks CS1 and CS2, a situation that the receiver cannot<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> correctly detect the ID pattern IDP due to that both the ID segments S1 and S2 encounter severe fading is less likely to occur.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In view of the receiver, if the receiver cannot correctly detect the ID pattern IDP (i.e. has a detection error) due to that both the ID segments S1 and S2 encounter severe fading, the receiver may misjudge that the communication resource blocks CS1 and CS2 used for transmitting the ID pattern IDP belong to the aforementioned empty resources. Hence, the receiver may notify the transmitter in the same communication device to transmit the ID pattern of the communication device through the communication resource blocks CS1 and CS2. Then, if the other transmitter had been transmitted the ID pattern of the other communication device through the communication resource blocks CS1 and CS2, it may cause severe interference on the transmission of the ID pattern IDP.

The ID pattern detection method of the disclosure is described below with reference of all the components in the receiver 600. In step S710, the signal extractor 610 extracts a plurality of communication resource blocks corresponding to a plurality of ID segments of the ID pattern from a received signal having information of the ID pattern, so as to generate an ID pattern received signal SS. In step S720, the conjugate delay module 620 individually delays the ID pattern received signal SS for a symbol time, and performs a complex conjugate processing on the delayed ID pattern received signal SS to generate a conjugated delayed received signal CDS of the ID pattern. In step S730, the multiplication unit 630 multiplies the ID pattern received signal SS with the conjugated delayed received signal CDS of the ID pattern to generate a conjugated delayed multiplied received signal CDMS of the ID pattern. In step S740, the matching unit performs a matching processing on the conjugated delayed multiplied received signal CDMS of the ID pattern and a predetermined signal corresponding to the ID pattern IDP performed with a conjugate delay multiplication processing, so as to generate a differential matching value DMV. In step S750, the normalization unit 650 performs a normalization processing on the differential matching value DMV according to an average power of the ID pattern received signal SS to generate a normalized differential matching value. In step S760, the decision unit 660 determines whether the normalized differential matching value (<i>J<sub>diff-matching</sub></i>) is greater than a predetermined threshold value. If yes, the decision unit<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> 660 outputs a decision result to determine that the ID pattern is detected (step S770), and if not, the decision unit 660 outputs the decision result to determine that the ID pattern is not detected (step S780).

According to the aforementioned communication resource allocation rule, the receiver and the ID pattern detection method thereof can extract a plurality of communication resource blocks corresponding to a plurality of ID segments of the ID pattern from a frequency domain received signal having information of the ID pattern, so as to generate the ID pattern received signal, and in principle could eliminate the influence of the CFO effect through the proposed signal processing method shown in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 6</figref>.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56976220" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A transmitter (100, 100', 100", 100"'), adapted to transmit an identification pattern (IDP, IDP', IDP", IDP"') used for device-to-device communication, the transmitter (100, 100', 100", 100"') comprising:
