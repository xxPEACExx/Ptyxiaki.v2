Relatively inexpensive 3D graphics engines now provide nearly photo-realistic interactive game play on hand-held video game, home video game and personal computer hardware platforms costing only a few hundred dollars. These video game systems typically include a hand-held controller, game controller, or, in the case of a hand-held video game platform, an integrated controller. A user or player uses the controller to send commands or other instructions to the video game system to control a video game or other simulation being played. For example, the controller may be provided with a manipulator (<i>e.g.</i>, a joystick) and buttons operated by the user.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Many hand-held gaming devices include some form of camera device which may be used to capture an image or a series of images of a physical, real-world scene. The captured images can then be displayed, for instance, on a display of the hand-held gaming device. In augmented reality devices, these captured images can be modified to include additional content, such as virtual objects. However, when the physical objects being photographed move over a series of frames, these physical objects may appear to interact unrealistically (or not at all) with the inserted virtual objects. Likewise, when the virtual objects move within the displayed scene, the virtual objects may not interact in an ideal fashion with the physical objects shown in the scene.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>SUMMARY</u></b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">Embodiments provide a method, augmented reality device and computer-readable storage medium for simulating interactions using an augmented reality device.

As used herein, an augmented reality device refers to any device capable of displaying a real-time view of a physical, real-world environment while altering elements within the displayed view of the environment. As such, unlike a virtual reality device which displays a view of virtual world, an augmented reality device displays a view of the real world but augments elements using computer graphics technology. This augmented view of the real world may be referred to herein as an "augmented reality world" or an "augmented reality space."</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Such an augmented reality device may include a camera device (or multiple camera devices) used to capture a view of the real-world environment and may further include computer software and/or hardware configured to augment elements of the captured scene. For example, an augmented reality device could capture a series of images of a coffee cup sitting on top of a table, modify the series of images so that the coffee cup appears as an animated cartoon character and display the modified series of images in real-time to a user. As such, when the user looks at the augmented reality device, the user sees an augmented view of the physical real-world environment in which the user is located. Continuing the above example, as the user points the camera of the augmented reality device at the physical coffee cup on the table from different angles, the user may instead see different angles of the virtual cartoon coffee cup displayed on the augmented reality device.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">One challenge for augmented reality devices is that the virtual objects displayed on the augmented reality device may not interact realistically with objects within the physical real-world environment. That is, on augmented reality devices where virtual objects are only inserted into a captured scene in addition to or in place of physical objects within the captured scene, these devices may not realistically display interactions between the virtual and physical objects or account for dynamics effects resulting from these interactions. As described herein, dynamics refers to the motion of objects (including both physical and virtual objects) as a result of energy or forces being applied to the objects. For instance, an augmented reality device configured to replace a coffee cup on a physical table with an animated cartoon coffee cup without performing any dynamics simulation may depict less realistic interactions between physical objects (<i>e.g.</i>, a user's hand) and the inserted cartoon coffee cup, as the animated coffee cup may not respond in a realistic fashion to the interaction by the physical object. As another example, an augmented reality device that inserts a virtual ball into a visual scene without accounting for the dynamics of the virtual ball may appear less realistic to users, as physical objects (<i>e.g.</i>, a physical ball) may appear to simply move through the virtual ball (and vice versa), without any interaction.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Embodiments described herein provide techniques for simulating interactions using an augmented reality device are described. For instance, software residing on a handheld device may receive a visual scene for display. Such a visual scene may include, for instance, a plurality of frames depicting a physical real-world environment and captured using one or more cameras of the augmented reality device. The software may further identify a physical object within the visual scene. As an example, the software could identify a ball resting upon a table within the captured visual scene. Additionally, the software could identify one or more virtual objects to display within the scene. For instance, a particular augmented reality device could be configured to insert a virtual ball into the scene. The software may then simulate dynamics of interactions between the physical object and the one or more virtual objects within the visual scene.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">For example, the user could physically roll the physical ball on the table, such that the physical ball appears to collide with the virtual ball in the visual scene displayed on the augmented reality device. In this scenario, the augmented reality device could be configured with a dynamics simulation component that determines when the physical ball collides with the virtual ball within the augmented reality scene displayed by the augmented reality device. When this occurs, the dynamics simulation component could simulate a reaction of the virtual ball using a set of dynamics rules and display the reaction of the virtual ball on the augmented reality device. For example, the augmented reality device could depict the virtual ball rolling across the table, in response to the virtual ball colliding with the physical ball. Doing so provides a more realistic augmented reality scene on the augmented reality device, which in turn may enhance the user's interactions with the augmented reality device.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In a particular embodiment, software on the augmented reality device could determine one or more physical characteristics of a physical surface within the scene. For instance, such physical characteristics could include a measure of friction, a measure of surface tension, and a measure of deformability of the physical surface. The software could be preconfigured with the information on the one or more physical characteristics of the physical surface. In one embodiment, the software is configured to determine the physical characteristics of the surface based on other properties of the surface. For example, the software could determine that shiny specular surfaces are indicative of a lower coefficient of friction (<i>e.g.</i>, the surface of a patch of ice). The software could then base the simulation of the interaction between the virtual and physical objects in part on these determined physical characteristics. As an example, a virtual spider could be depicted on the augmented reality device as walking across a physical surface with a low friction coefficient (<i>e.g.</i>, a patch of ice). The software could then adjust the behavior of the virtual spider, such that the virtual spider appears to slip or even fall as it makes its way across the physical surface. Advantageously, doing so enhances the realism of the user's augmented reality experience.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an augmented reality device configured with a dynamics simulation component, according to one embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the augmented reality device 100 includes a dynamics simulation component 110, camera devices 120, a display device 130 and an accelerometer 140. Generally, the dynamics simulation component 110 is configured to detect interactions between physical objects and virtual objects within a captured scene of a real-world environment and to simulate the dynamics of these interactions to improve the realism of the augmented reality scene when displayed (<i>e.g.</i>, on the display device 130). The camera devices 120 may include cameras for capturing a visual scene. As used herein, a visual scene refers to a view(s) of the real-world environment in which the device 100 is being used. For instance, a visual scene may be a series of images (also referred to herein as "frames") of a real-world environment. The camera devices 120 may also include one or more user-facing cameras. Generally, the accelerometer 140 is a device capable of measuring the physical (or proper) acceleration of the augmented reality device 100.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As described above, the dynamics simulation component 110 may be configured to simulate interactions between physical objects and virtual objects within the augmented reality scene displayed on the augmented reality device 100. In doing so, the dynamics simulation component 110 could identify a physical object within a captured visual scene. For instance, the dynamics simulation component 110 could be configured to recognize certain predefined objects within the captured visual scene. As an example, the dynamics simulation component 110 could be pre-configured to identify a particular physical object (<i>e.g.</i>, a ball) within a visual scene based on particular characteristics of the physical object (<i>e.g.</i>, shape, colors, patterns, etc.).</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In one embodiment, the dynamics simulation component 110 is further configured to estimate the depth of the physical object within the captured visual scene. That is, although the captured visual scene may be composed of a plurality of two-dimensional frames, these two-dimensional<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> frames represent a three-dimensional space (<i>e.g.</i>, the physical environment in which the augmented device is located). As such, the dynamics simulation component 110 could analyze the captured visual scene in order to determine the depth of the physical object within the three-dimensional space. For example, the dynamics simulation component 110 could be configured to recognize certain predefined physical objects based on geometry information for the objects. Such geometry information could include, for example, the shape and size of the predefined physical objects, allowing the dynamics simulation component 110 to compare objects in a scene with the available geometry information. The dynamics simulation component 110 could use the geometry information to determine the depth of the physical objects within the visual scene. As an example, assume that the geometry information indicates that a particular ball is 3 inches in diameter and that the visual scene includes two instances of that type of ball, where the first instance is shown using 10 pixels of the visual scene and the second instance is shown using 50 pixels of the visual scene. In such an example, the dynamics simulation component 110 could determine that the first instance of the ball is further away from the camera than the second instance of the ball, as the geometry information indicates that the two physical balls are the same size but the first instance is represented using fewer pixels than the second instance.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">When a physical object is identified within the scene, the dynamics simulation component 110 could observe motion or movement (if any) of the physical object over time. In one embodiment, the dynamics simulation component 110 is configured to determine a velocity of the physical object. For instance, the dynamics simulation component 110 could monitor the physical object over a plurality of captured frames that make up the visual scene and could determine a speed and a trajectory of the physical object.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Additionally, the dynamics simulation component 110 identifies one or more virtual objects to include in the visual scene displayed on the augmented reality device 100 (<i>e.g.</i>, using display 130). As an example, the dynamics simulation component 110 could determine to display a virtual ball within the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> visual scene. Of course, such an example is without limitation and is provided for illustrative purposes only, and more generally the virtual objects could be any virtual objects capable of being displayed within the virtual scene. In addition, the dynamics simulation component 110 could be configured to identify dynamics properties and kinematics for the virtual objects, <i>e.g.</i>, speed, velocity of the virtual objects, virtual objects, etc.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The dynamics simulation component 110 then determines when an interaction occurs between the physical object and one or more of the virtual objects within the visual scene. Generally speaking, an interaction occurs when the physical object and the virtual object(s) touch one another or otherwise impart a force to one another within the three-dimensional augmented reality space represented by the displayed scene on the augmented reality device 100. For example, a physical ball and a virtual ball could be said to interact when the two balls collide with one another within the three-dimensional augmented reality space. As another example, in an embodiment where a virtual animal is displayed as standing upon a physical table top, the user could interact with the virtual animal by moving his or her hand onto the table top in the position where the virtual animal is depicted. As yet another example, a virtual ball could be rendered to roll off a table, where the rate of rate of speed of the ball mimics the actual force of gravity that would act on a physical ball rolling off a table.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In one embodiment, the dynamics simulation component 110 determines depth of the physical object within the three-dimensional space represented by the captured visual scene (<i>e.g.</i>, using predefined geometry information for the physical object) and further determines a depth (<i>i.e.,</i> a three-dimensional position) of the virtual object within three-dimensional augmented reality space. The dynamics simulation component 110 could then use depth values to render animations depicting more realistic interactions between the virtual and physical objects. For example, if a first object is closer to the camera within the three-dimensional space than a second object, the first object may simply occlude the second object rather than collide with the second object. In<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> other words, the dynamics simulation component 110 may use the depth information in order to consider all three axis of the three-dimensional space.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Upon determining that an interaction has occurred between the physical object and one or more of the virtual objects, the dynamics simulation component 110 could perform a dynamics simulation to model the interaction between the objects. For instance, in an embodiment where a physical ball collides with a virtual ball, the dynamics simulation component 110 could be configured to move the virtual ball in such a manner as to simulate a realistic collision with the physical ball. As an example, the dynamics simulation component 110 could apply a set of dynamics rules that model real-world physics to the virtual ball in order to calculate a virtual force imparted to the virtual ball from the collision with the physical ball, and the dynamics simulation component 110 could further apply the rules in order to determine the effect of the virtual force upon the virtual ball.

For example, the physical object could be a ball rolling on a controlled surface capable of being manipulated by a surface controller. In response to detecting an interaction between the physical and virtual objects, the dynamics simulation component 110 could transmit a message to the controller to apply a force to the physical ball via the controlled surface (<i>e.g.</i>, using rotors within the surface, magnets within the surface and/or the ball, etc.). In one embodiment, the physical object itself is configured to manipulate its own movement in response to a request. For example, the physical ball could be configured with a gyroscope capable of altering the motion of the ball. In such an embodiment, the dynamics simulation component 110 could, for instance, detect when the physical ball collides with a virtual object within the augmented reality space<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> and could transmit a signal to a controller within the physical ball, instructing the controller to activate the gyroscope and alter the physical ball's trajectory. As a result, the user viewing the physical ball through the augmented reality device 100 could perceive the physical ball interacting with the virtual ball, thereby creating a more realistic augmented reality experience for the user.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">Figures 2A-B</figref> provide examples illustrating augmented reality devices according embodiments described herein. <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2A</figref> illustrates a scene 200 including a table 215, on which a physical ball 225 has been rolled from starting point 220, and an augmented reality device 100 having a display 210.

Upon detecting the collision between the virtual representation 216 and the virtual ball 218, the dynamics simulation component 110 could adjust the movement of the virtual ball 218 to simulate the dynamics of the interaction between the virtual representation 216 and the virtual ball 218. Thus, in this example, the dynamics simulation component 110 determines that the virtual representation 216 and the virtual ball 218 collided at intersection point 222 and, in response, applies a virtual force to the virtual ball 218, causing the virtual ball 218 to roll from its starting location 214. Doing so may enhance user interactions with the augmented reality device 100, e.g., by enabling virtual objects (<i>e.g.</i>, virtual ball 218) to realistically interact with virtual representations of physical objects (<i>e.g.</i>, virtual representation 216) on the augmented reality device 100.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In one embodiment, the dynamics simulation component 110 is configured to apply a set of dynamics rules that define dynamics interactions for<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the augmented reality world.

The display device 210 shows a virtual representation 265 of the physical ball 230 and a virtual ball 260.

Additionally, the dynamics simulation component 110 determined that, as a result of the collision, the virtual ball 260 in turn imparted a virtual force onto the virtual representation 265. As discussed above, the dynamics simulation component 110 could be configured to alter the movement of a physical object (<i>e.g</i>., physical ball 230) using, for instance, rotors within a controlled surface (<i>e.g.</i>, table 215), a gyroscope within the physical object, magnets within a controlled surface and/or the physical object, and so on.

Advantageously, doing so provided an enhanced augmented reality experience for users of the augmented reality device 100 by creating a dynamics continuum in which virtual objects can affect the dynamics of real-world objects shown on the augmented reality device, and vice versa.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Additionally, the dynamics simulation component 110 can be configured to simulate the dynamics imparted onto a virtual object, as a result of an interaction (<i>e.g.</i>, a collision) between two physical objects. For instance, the dynamics simulation component 110 may be configured to adjust the actions of virtual characters within the augmented reality space, such that the virtual characters realistically react to the movement of physical, real-world objects. An example of this is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 3</figref>, is a diagram illustrating an augmented reality device, according to one embodiment described herein. More specifically, the scene 300 includes the table 215 and the augmented reality device 100 with display 210. Here, a first physical ball 325 and a second physical ball 330 are shown as having rolled across the table 215 from their respective starting positions of 305 and 310. For purposes of this example, assume that the physical ball 325 was at rest at starting location 305, and the ball 330 was set in motion from its starting location 310, colliding with the stationary first ball 325 at intersection point 320. As a result of the collision, the physical ball 325 rolled from its starting position 305 to its current position, while the ball 330 continued rolling but altered its trajectory before coming to rest at its depicted location.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">This collision is illustrated on the display 210 of the augmented reality device 100 as well, where a virtual representation 360 of the first physical ball 325 and virtual representation 365 of the second physical ball 330 are shown as<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> having rolled across the table from their respective starting positions of 345 and 340.

Thus, for purposes of the current example, assume that the virtual character 370 was balancing on top of the virtual representation 360 in its starting position 345, as shown by starting position 350. However, when the virtual representation 360 collided with the virtual representation 365, the dynamics simulation component 110 in the depicted embodiment determined that the resulting motion of the virtual representation 360 was too fast for the virtual character 370 to keep his balance on top of the virtual representation 360. As a result, the virtual character 370 has fallen from his starting position 350, coming to rest at the depicted location.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">By monitoring the movement of real-world objects shown on the augmented reality device's display 210 and simulation dynamics for interactions between the real-world objects and virtual objects within the augmented reality space, embodiments can create a more immersive and realistic augmented reality experience for users. For instance, continuing the above example, a user could reach his or her hand in front of the augmented reality device 100 in the position where the virtual character 370 is located, and the dynamics simulation component 110 could alter the virtual character's actions to simulate the dynamics of interactions between the character 370 and the user's hand. For example, the user could use his or her hand to pick the virtual character 370 back up once he has fallen off the virtual representation 360 and place the virtual character 370 back atop the representation 360 of the ball 325.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> Advantageously, doing so helps to create an immersive experience for users of the augmented reality device, in which the user can interact with virtual objects and characters shown on the device in real-time and the virtual objects and characters will respond to interactions with the user accordingly.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Of note, the dynamics simulation component 110 could be configured to model a set of physics-based rules when simulating the interaction of the virtual character 370 with the physical and virtual objects of the augmented reality scene. For instance, the simulated behavior of each of the characters arms, legs and joints could account for the presence of gravity or any other external impulse forces. Advantageously, doing so provides a more realistic interaction between the virtual character and objects in the augmented reality environment. Additionally, although various examples provided herein use real-world physics, it is broadly contemplated that the augmented reality world could use other rules of physics. For example, the dynamics simulation component 110 could be configured to simulate interactions between the virtual character and objects within the augmented reality world using a lower coefficient of gravity relative to the real world. More generally, embodiments may be configured to use any physics-based rules consistent with the functionality described herein.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 4</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a method of simulating dynamics of interactions between virtual objects and physical objects on an augmented reality device, according to one embodiment. As shown, the method 400 begins at step 410, where an augmented reality device captures a scene. As discussed above, the visual scene could be a series of frames (<i>i.e</i>., images) captured using a camera of the augmented reality device. The dynamics simulation component 110 then identifies physical objects within the scene (step 415). For instance, the dynamics simulation component 110 could be configured to recognize certain objects based on predefined characteristics of the objects. Such characteristics could include, without limitation, the color, shape, texture, etc. of the objects.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In the depicted embodiment, the dynamics simulation component 110 identifies one or more virtual objects to be displayed within the visual scene (step 420). Of course, although the reference examples discussed above pertain to virtual balls and virtual characters, such examples are provided without limitation and for illustrative purposes. Moreover, it is broadly contemplated that embodiments described herein can be used with any virtual object capable of being inserted into a visual scene and displayed on an augmented reality device.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">For each identified physical object, the dynamics simulation component 110 determines a corresponding velocity (<i>i.e</i>., a speed and a trajectory) (step 430). For instance, the dynamics simulation component 110 could store geometry information describing geometrical characteristics of certain physical objects, such as their real-world physical dimensions. The dynamics simulation component 110 may use this geometrical information to determine a depth of the identified physical objects within the visual scene. Additionally, this information could be used to determine the real-world velocity of these objects (<i>e.g.</i>, by monitoring the object's position over a series of frames).</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">As shown, the dynamics simulation component 110 uses this velocity information to model the dynamics of one or more of the physical objects interacting with one or more of the virtual objects (step 435). For instance, when the simulation component 110 determines a physical ball has collided with a virtual ball within the augmented reality space, it could use the velocity at which the physical ball is travelling to determine an amount of virtual force to apply to the virtual ball. This virtual force information could then be used to alter the motion of the virtual ball (<i>e.g.</i>, causing the virtual ball to roll away as a result of the collision with the physical ball).</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Additionally, in this example, the dynamics simulation component 110 could also adjust the path of at least one physical objects to simulate the physical object interacting with at least one of the virtual objects (step 440). For instance, the dynamics simulation component 110 could transmit a message to<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> a controller within the physical object, instructing the physical object to move in a certain direction as a result of the collision with the virtual object. As another example, the dynamics simulation component 110 could transmit a message to a controller associated with the surface on which the physical object is positioned, instructing the surface to alter the physical object's motion as a result of the collision (<i>e.g.</i>, using magnets within the surface and/or the physical object). Of course, such examples are provided without limitation and for illustrative purposes only, and more generally, it is broadly contemplated that any mechanism for altering the motion of the physical object may be used, consistent with the functionalities described herein.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">As discussed above, in one embodiment, the dynamics simulation component 110 could determine one or more physical characteristics of a physical surface within the scene. Such physical characteristics could include, without limitation, a measure of friction, a measure of surface tension, and a measure of deformability of the physical surface. The dynamics simulation component 110 could be preconfigured with the information on the one or more physical characteristics of the physical surface. For instance, the dynamics simulation component 110 could identify a type of a surface within the scene and could then access preconfigured physical characteristics information for the identified surface. In one embodiment, the dynamics simulation component 110 is configured to determine the physical characteristics of the surface based on other properties of the surface. For example, the dynamics simulation component 110 could determine that shiny specular surfaces are indicative of a lower coefficient of friction (<i>e.g.</i>, the surface of a patch of ice). The dynamics simulation component 110 could then base the simulation of the interaction between the virtual and physical objects in part on these determined physical characteristics. For instance, as discussed above, a virtual spider could be depicted on the augmented reality device as walking across a physical surface with a low friction coefficient (<i>e.g</i>., a patch of ice). The dynamics simulation component 110 could adjust the behavior of the virtual spider, such that the virtual spider appears to slip or even fall as it makes its way across the physical<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> surface.
