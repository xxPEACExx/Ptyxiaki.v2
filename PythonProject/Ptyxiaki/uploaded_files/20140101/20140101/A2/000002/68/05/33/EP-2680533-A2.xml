As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the HTTP-based content acquisition method in this embodiment may include the following steps:</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Step 101: A client acquires, according to an acquired content identifier, a first content corresponding to the content identifier and a validity period of the first content from a cache.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The content identifier is acquired by the client from content-related information input by a user through an input device. For example, the user inputs a web address through a keyboard, and therefore, the client acquires the web address as a content identifier; for another example, the user clicks a web page name in favorites through a mouse, and therefore, the client acquires the web address corresponding to the web page name as a content identifier.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Specifically, the client may acquire, according to the acquired content identifier, the first content corresponding to the content identifier and a validity period identifier of the first content from the cache, and therefore, may acquire, according to the validity period identifier of the first content, a validity period corresponding to the validity period identifier of the first content; or, the client may acquire, according to the acquired content identifier, the first content corresponding to the content identifier but no validity period identifier of the first content from the cache, and therefore, may use a preset validity period, for example, 0, as the validity period of the first content.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Step 102: The client displays the first content.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Specifically, the client may display the first content according to characteristic information of the first content. The characteristic information of the first content may include<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> but is not limited to the type of the content and keywords of the content. For example, if the characteristic information of the first content is a content type such as image and fiction, the client may display the first content; if the characteristic information of the first content is a content type such as news and forum, the client may give up displaying the first content; if the characteristic information of the first content is a content keyword such as registration and verification code, the client may give up displaying the first content.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Step 103: The client requests, according to the validity period of the first content, a server to verify validity of the first content.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Specifically, if the duration of caching the first content on the client exceeds the validity period, the client may request the server to verify validity of the first content.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Understandably, if the client determines that the content is valid according to the validity period of the first content, the client does not need to request the server to verify validity of the first content.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Step 104: The client requests to acquire a second content corresponding to the content identifier from the server if the validity verification performed by the server for the first content fails.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Understandably, although the validity verification performed by the server for the first content fails, it is still possible that the second content requested and acquired by the client is exactly the same as the first content.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Step 105: The client displays the second content.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Specifically, if the second content is exactly the same as the first content, the client may give up displaying the second content (but continue displaying the first content), or may further display the second content; if the second content is different from the first content, the client may display the second content.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">It should be noted that if the validity verification performed by the server for the first content succeeds, the client continues displaying the first content, and the process of this embodiment ends immediately; if the validity verification performed by the server for the first content fails, the client continues to perform steps 104 and 105 before the process of this embodiment ends.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In this embodiment, step 102 and step 103 are in no particular order, and this embodiment does not limit the implementation order.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In this embodiment, after acquiring the content identifier, the client displays the first content directly no matter whether the first content corresponding to the content identifier in the cache is valid. Moreover, while the first content is displayed, the cache is verified; if the cache is valid, no step needs to be performed, and the first content is still displayed. If the cache needs to be verified by a network-side server, the server may be requested to perform verification: If the cache is valid, no step needs to be performed, and the first content is still displayed; if the cache has expired, a second content (the updated first content) is re-acquired from the server.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In this embodiment, through a client acquires, according to an acquired content identifier, a first content corresponding to the content identifier and a validity period of the first content from a cache, and displays the first content. Meanwhile, according to the validity period of the first content, the client requests a server to verify validity of the first content. If the validity verification performed by the server for the first content succeeds, the client may continue displaying the current first content, thereby avoiding the problem that the client does not display the content until the validity verification performed by the server for the content in the cache succeeds in the prior art, shortening the time of displaying the content on the client, and improving display efficiency of the client.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">After step 102, the client may further re-acquire the first content corresponding to the content identifier after a preset time interval, and display the re-acquired first content. That is, after the preset time interval, the client performs a refresh operation automatically to acquire and display the updated first content. Specifically, if the re-acquired first content is exactly the same as the previously displayed first content, the client may give up displaying the re-acquired first content (but continue displaying the previously acquired first content), or may further display the re-acquired first content; if the re-acquired first content is different from the previously displayed first content, the client displays the re-acquired first content. In this way, the client performs a refresh operation automatically, and the user can still see the web page corresponding to the first content updated in real time, even if the user performs no operation on the web page corresponding to the first content for a long time, thereby avoiding<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the problem that the client can only re-acquire the content corresponding to the content identifier as triggered by a click operation of the user, shortening the time of re-displaying (refreshing) the content on the client, and improving display efficiency of the client.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">After step 104, after a preset time interval, the client may further re-acquire the second content corresponding to the content identifier after a preset time interval, and display the re-acquired second content. After the preset time interval, the client performs a refresh operation automatically to acquire and display the updated second content. Specifically, if the re-acquired second content is exactly the same as the previously displayed second content, the client may give up displaying the re-acquired second content (but continue displaying the previously acquired second content), or may further display the re-acquired second content; if the re-acquired second content is different from the previously displayed second content, the client displays the re-acquired second content. In this way, the client performs a refresh operation automatically, and the user can still see the web page corresponding to the second content updated in real time, even if the user performs no operation on the web page corresponding to the second content for a long time, thereby avoiding the problem that the client can only re-acquire the content corresponding to the content identifier as triggered by a click operation of the user, shortening the time of re-displaying (refreshing) the content on the client, and improving display efficiency of the client.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic flowchart of another HTTP-based content acquisition method according to another embodiment of the present invention.
