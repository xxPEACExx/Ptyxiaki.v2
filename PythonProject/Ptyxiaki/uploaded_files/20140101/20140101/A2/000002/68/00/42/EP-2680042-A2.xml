In particular, the application relates to acoustic communications for drilling rig-related operations.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>Background</u></b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">During drilling operations for extraction of hydrocarbons, a variety of communication and transmission techniques have been attempted to provide real time data from the vicinity of the bit to the surface during various phases of drilling rig operations. The use of measurements while drilling (MWD) with real time data transmission provides substantial benefits during a drilling operation. For example, monitoring of downhole conditions allows for an immediate response to potential well control problems and improves mud programs.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Measurement of parameters such as weight on bit, torque, wear and bearing condition in real time provides for more efficient drilling operations. In fact, faster penetration rates, better trip planning, reduced equipment failures, fewer delays for directional surveys, and the elimination of a need to interrupt drilling for abnormal pressure detection is achievable using MWD techniques.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">One current approach to provide real time data from the vicinity of the drill bit to the surface includes acoustic communications. Typically, an acoustic signal is generated near the bit and is transmitted through the drill pipe, mud column or the earth. It has been found, however, that the very low intensity of the signal which can be generated downhole, along with the acoustic noise<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> generated by the drilling system, makes signal detection difficult. Reflective and refractive interference resulting from changing diameters and thread makeup at the tool joints compounds the signal attenuation problem for drill pipe transmission. Such reflective and refractive interference causes interbit interference among the bits of data being transmitted.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Acoustic communications are further complicated when surface slips are used on the drill rig floor. For example, surface slips may be used to provide support during periods when drill stand is being added or removed to the drill pipe. In particular, during drilling operations additional drill pipe may be periodically installed to increase the depth of such drill pipe downhole or remove as part of a tripping operation. The surface slips generally surround an opening in the rig floor through which the upper end of the uppermost joint of drill pipe protrudes. The surface slips hold the protruded drill pipe in position (a few feet above the surface of the rig floor) to allow rig personnel and/or automated handling equipment to attach or remove drill pipe. However, the surface slips may act as a reflective point for the acoustic communications between downhole and surface instrumentation, thereby distorting and/or damping such communications.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Brief Description of the Drawings</u></b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Embodiments of the invention may be best understood by referring to the following description and accompanying drawings which illustrate such embodiments.

In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth. However, it is understood that embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known circuits, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure the understanding of this description.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">While described with reference to communications during drilling rig-related operations, embodiments may be used any other types of environments for acoustic communications. Additionally, some embodiments of the invention may be applicable during both Logging While Drilling (LWD) and Measurement While Drilling (MWD) operations while the drill pipe is stationary. Some embodiments may be performed during a logging while tripping operation, zero emissions testing, drill stem testing, etc. Additionally, some embodiments are applicable not only during drilling, but throughout the life of a wellbore including, but not limited to, during logging, drill stem testing, completing and production.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As further described below, some embodiments may include one or more instrumented surface slips. In particular, surface slip(s), which typically provide support to the drill pipe during various phases of the drilling rig-related operations, may include a communications receiver and/or transmitter. In some embodiments, the surface slip(s) may include an acoustic receiver (such as an accelerometer) positioned approximately at or near its bottom end. In some embodiments, the surface slip(s) may include an acoustic transmitter to transmit data communications to downhole instrumentation. Accordingly, as described, embodiments enable high-speed telemetry operations along the drill pipe while the drill pipe is in the surface slips. In particular, embodiments may allow for acoustic communications essentially independent of interference by the surface<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> slip(s). Moreover, embodiments allow a rig crew to install and uninstall instrumentation as part of normal rig procedures to change a pipe stand. Further, some embodiments may incorporate instrumentation into other surface equipment. For example, such instrumentation may be incorporated into pack-off material.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Figure 1</b></figref> illustrates a system for drilling operations, according to some embodiments of the invention. A system 100 includes a drilling rig 102 located at a surface 104 of a well. The drilling rig 102 provides support for a drill string 108. The drill string 108 penetrates a rotary table 110 for drilling a borehole 112 through subsurface formations 114. The drill string 108 includes a Kelly 116 (in the upper portion), a drill pipe 118 and a bottom hole assembly 120 (located at the lower portion of the drill pipe 118). The bottom hole assembly 120 may include a drill collar 122, a downhole tool 124 and a drill bit 126. The downhole tool 124 may be any of a number of different types of tools including Measurement While Drilling (MWD) tools, Logging While Drilling (LWD) tools, etc.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">During drilling operations, the drill string 108 (including the Kelly 116, the drill pipe 118 and the bottom hole assembly 120) may be rotated by the rotary table 110. In addition or alternative to such rotation, the bottom hole assembly 120 may also be rotated by a motor (not shown) that is downhole. The drill collar 122 may be used to add weight to the drill bit 126. The drill collar 122 also may stiffen the bottom hole assembly 120 to allow the bottom hole assembly 120 to transfer the weight to the drill bit 126. Accordingly, this weight provided by the drill collar 122 also assists the drill bit 126 in the penetration of the surface 104 and the subsurface formations 114.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">During drilling operations, a mud pump 132 may pump drilling fluid (known as "drilling mud") from a mud pit 134 through a hose 136 into the drill pipe 118 down to the drill bit 126. The drilling fluid can flow out from the drill bit 126 and return back to the surface through an annular area 140 between<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the drill pipe 118 and the sides of the borehole 112. The drilling fluid may then be returned to the mud pit 134, where such fluid is filtered. Accordingly, the drilling fluid can cool the drill bit 126 as well as provide for lubrication of the drill bit 126 during the drilling operation. Additionally, the drilling fluid removes the cuttings of the subsurface formations 114 created by the drill bit 126.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The drill string 108 may include one to a number of different sensors 151, which monitor different downhole parameters. Such parameters may include the downhole temperature and pressure, the various characteristics of the subsurface formations (such as resistivity, density, porosity, etc.), the characteristics of the borehole (e.g., size, shape, etc.), etc. The drill string 108 may also include an acoustic transmitter 123 that transmits telemetry signals in the form of acoustic vibrations in the tubing wall of the drill sting 108. An acoustic receiver 115 is coupled to the kelly 116 to receive transmitted telemetry signals. One or more repeaters 119 may be provided along the drill string 108 to receive and retransmit the telemetry signals. The repeaters 119 may include both an acoustic telemetry receiver and an acoustic telemetry transmitter configured similarly to the acoustic receiver 115 and the acoustic transmitter 123.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Some embodiments of different positions of surface instrumentation for communications downhole during various drilling/logging operations are now described in conjunction with <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004">Figures 2-6</figref>. In particular, <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004">Figures 2-6</figref> illustrate different configurations for surface slips and pack-off material having surface receivers and/or surface transmitters, according to some embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Figure 2</b></figref> illustrates surface slips having a surface receiver and a surface transmitter, according to some embodiments of the invention. <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> illustrates a tubing 202 positioned in a borehole 217. The tubing 202 may be a drill string (such as the drill string 108 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>), a wired pipe, a production tubing, etc. The borehole 217 includes sides 215, which may include<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> casing. An annulus 214 is formed between the tubing 202 and the sides 215. Surface slips 204A-204B are positioned within the annulus 214 at the rig floor 210. The surface slips 204A-204B may include gripping elements adjacent to the tubing 202 used to attach the surface slips 204A-204B to the tubing 202. The surface slips 204A-204B may be manual or hydraulic. The surface slips 204A-204B may provide support to the tubing 202. For example, the surface slips 204A-204B may be inserted along the tubing 202 when a pipe stand is being added or removed there from. As shown, the tubing 202 may include a joint 219, which may be the location where a pipe stand is added or removed.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As shown, the surface slips 204A-204B may include instrumentation. The instrumentation may include a surface receiver 212 and surface transmitters 206A-206B. The surface receiver 212 may be positioned at or near the top of the surface slips 204A-204B for simplicity of implementation. However, if the surface receiver 212 is positioned near the top or above the surface slips 204A-204B, the surface receiver 212 may receive acoustic signals that have undergone significant dissipation in the rig floor. In some embodiments, the surface receiver 212 may be positioned at or near the bottom end of the surface slips 204A-204B, thereby positioning the surface receiver 212 below the rig floor. In this configuration, the surface receiver 212 may receive the acoustic signals from downhole before such signals may be subject to dissipation. This position of the surface receiver 212 may increase the signal to noise ratio of the received acoustic signal, thereby potentially increasing the data bandwidth. The surface receiver 212 may be positioned approximately at or near the bottom end of the surface slip 204A, relative to its position in the borehole 217. The surface transmitter 206A and the surface transmitter 206B are respectively positioned approximately at or near the top end of the surface slip 204A and the top end of the surface slip 204B, relative to their positions in the borehole 217. The surface receiver 212 may be a number of different types of acoustic receivers including an accelerometer, a strain gage, etc. In some<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> embodiments, the surface receiver 212 and/or the surface transmitters 206A-206B may be attached (bolted, welded, etc.) to the surface slips 206A-206B. In some embodiments, the surface receiver 212 and/or the surface transmitters 206A-206B may be manufactured as a single object.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The surface slip 206A may include a signal line 208. The signal line 208 may provide a power signal to the surface transmitter 206A and/or the surface receiver 212. In some embodiments, the signal line 208 may provide a communications signal (such as data communications) to and from the surface transmitter 206A and/or the surface receiver 212. In some embodiments, the surface slips 206A-206B may be without the signal line 208 (as shown by surface slip 206B). Accordingly, a power source (such as a battery) may be a part of the surface transmitters 206A-206B and/or the surface receiver 212. Additionally, communications with the surface transmitters 206A-206B and/or the surface receiver 212 may be through wireless communications or other wired coupling (not shown). For example, the surface receiver 212 may include a storage medium to store data communications received from downhole. Such data may be downloaded there from subsequent to the removal of the surface slips 204A-204B from their support of the tubing 202.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Therefore, as described, some embodiments include an acoustic surface receiver positioned below the surface slips 206 to receive acoustic communications from downhole. Such positioning allows for acoustic communications along the tubing that is essentially independent of interference (such as reflections) caused by the surface slips 206.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Figure 3</b></figref> illustrates surface slips having a surface receiver and a surface transmitter, according to some embodiments of the invention.

The surface receiver 212 is positioned approximately near or below the bottom end of the surface transmitter 206A, relative to its position in the borehole 217.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Accordingly, as shown, the surface receiver 212 is a given distance from the gripping elements of the surface slip 204A used to attached the surface slip 204A to the tubing 202. In some embodiments, such distance may be dependent on the wavelength of the acoustic signal being transmitted from downhole to be received by the surface receiver 212. In particular, this distance may be set to avoid null points caused by the reflections by the surface slip 204A. In an embodiment, the surface receiver 212 may be approximately λ/16 and 3λ/8 from the gripping elements of the surface slip 204A. In an embodiment, the acoustic signal along the tubing 202 may operate in a frequency band of approximately 600-1800 Hertz.
