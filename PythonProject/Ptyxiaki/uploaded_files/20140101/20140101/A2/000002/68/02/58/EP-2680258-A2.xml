As a result, the use of such devices continues to increase significantly. In an attempt to provide an enhanced user experience, various technologies have been developed and evolved for use with user devices to direct users to specific content or retrieve content and applications ("resources") quickly and easily. For example, printed labeling or advertising may include two-dimensional images (e.g., Universal Product Code (UPC)) or matrix barcodes (e.g., QR Codes) that when read by video input to the user device and then converted to reveal the information encoded in the image, cause a web browser executing on the user device to be directed to a webpage. Such barcodes may be associated with a product and may include, for example, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that, when read by a user device, prompts a web browser application to retrieve related information from the URL or access product information from a webpage identified by the URL.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In some kinds of communication media, such as, television or other video presentation, it may be difficult or impractical to encode information within bar codes or other optical patterns for scanning because the clarity or resolution necessary for decoding such patterns may be lacking. Moreover, such optical techniques are not applicable to non-visual communication media, such as radio or other audio or signal media. However, the recent increases in capability of user devices allow for automated identification of information and entities based on processing of non-visual communications received by a user device. This information can then be used by a user device in a variety of ways including the retrieval or activation of resources.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>SUMMARY</u></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">Methods and computer systems for providing audio-activated resource access for user devices are provided.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In one embodiment, a computer system for providing audio-activated resource access for user devices is disclosed.

Certain embodiments of the techniques described herein may enable a user to access resources that are associated with an identified speaker or a speaker voiceprint identified in an audio stream received at a user device. In a particular embodiment, a voiceprint match may be determined by first utilizing a speaker identification software to identify voiceprint in an audio stream received as input to a user device. A central database containing pre-registered speaker identity to resource pairings may then be queried to determine whether a speaker identity to resource pairing corresponding to the identified speaker exists. The speaker may be identified by a name, number, voiceprint, or any other identifier. Based on the determination, one or more resources may be communicated to the user device for access by the user.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Embodiments of the disclosed techniques may provide a variety of benefits and features such as, for example, improved user experience, seamless navigation to a resource relevant to content consumed by a user, and improved marketing and advertising, among many others.

In embodiments where speaker identification program 247 is implemented as software, speaker recognition system 247 may be a standalone software application that may be used alone or in combination with other software applications, or it may instead be a component of a larger software application. In some embodiments, speaker<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> identification software 247 may identify a speaker in an input audio stream based on a speaker voiceprint and convert the speaker identity into text for transmission to another entity such as, for example, resolution server 220 or resource provider server 250.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In some embodiments, speaker identification program 247 may be activated and deactivated automatically. For example, speaker identification program 247 may be automatically activated upon receiving audio input via a microphone and automatically deactivated once the audio input stops. Additionally or alternatively, in other embodiments, speaker identification program 247 may be activated or deactivated by a user of user device 240. In yet another embodiment, speaker identification program 247 may be continuously active.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Resource provider server 250 may include, for example, a processor 251, memory 252, I/O devices (not shown), storage 254, and a data repository 255. Resource provider server 250 may be implemented in various ways. For example, resource provider server 250 may be a general purpose computer, a server, a mainframe computer, or any combination of these components. Resource provider server 250 may communicate with components shown or not shown in system 200 via network 210. Resource provider server 250 may be standalone or it may be part of a subsystem, which may, in turn, be part of a larger system, such as a legacy domain registration system.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Storage 254 may be, include, or be part of one or more storage devices configured to store information used by processor 251 to perform certain functions related to the disclosed embodiments. For example, storage 254 may include a volatile or non-volatile, magnetic, semiconductor, tape, optical, removable, non-removable, or other type of storage device or computer-readable media.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In one embodiment, memory 252 may include one or more programs or subprograms (e.g., a web application or service) 253 loaded from storage 254 or elsewhere that, when executed by processor 251, perform various procedures, operations, or processes consistent with embodiments of the disclosed techniques. For example, web application or service 253 may be configured to register speaker identity to resource pairings, identify resources based on provided speaker identity, and/or build user profiles based on historical data generated by performing the techniques disclosed herein such as, for example, data generated by past user and/or user device resource requests. Memory 252 may be also be configured with an operating system (not shown) that performs several functions well known in the art when executed by resource provider server 250.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Resource provider server 250 may include one or more I/O devices (not shown) that allow data to be received and/or transmitted by resource provider server 250.

Data repository 255 may include one or more files or relational and/or non-relational databases that store information and may be accessed and/or managed by resource provider server 250. The databases or other files may include, for example, data and information related to speaker identity-resource pairings as well as user profile data.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, shown is flow chart 300 illustrating embodiments of the techniques described herein for providing resource access for user devices. In step 310, a<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> speaker identity resource (e.g., a name-resource pairing, a voiceprint-resource pairing, a name-resource pairing for a particular keyword or phrase, a voiceprint-resource pairing for a particular keyword or phrase, etc.) a may be registered at a central database and/or other registries such as, for example, resolution server 220 or resource provider server 250 of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, in response to a registration request. In some embodiments, a registration request may be made by various types of devices or entities, including, for example, one or more individuals, one or more computer systems, or a resource provider such as a retailer, a marketer, or any other type of organization. As a specific example, a registration request may be made by an entity broadcasting or publishing advertisements.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In some embodiments, any speaker identity may be registered with a corresponding resource. However, other embodiments may allow registration only if the speaker is associated with the resource. For example, a speaker identity of say an actor may be registered with a related corresponding resource such as a link to the actor's website. However, the same speaker identity may not be registered with an unrelated resource such as a link to a different actor's website. In some embodiments, a speaker identity may correspond to multiple resources and/or a resource may correspond to multiple speaker identities.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In certain embodiments, a resource may provide a user further details about content being consumed by the user. A resource may also or alternatively facilitate a marketing or public service campaign. For example, in some embodiments, a resource may be, or be provided via one or more of the following: an internet protocol (IP) address or other network address, a hostname or domain name, a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), a Uniform Resource Number (URN), a URL, a phone number, an email address, a text message, an image file, a Short Message Service (SMS) location, or a Multimedia Message Service (MMS) location. Other example resources may include Media Access Control<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> (MAC) addresses, Ethernet Hardware Address (EHA) addresses, Bluetooth addresses, an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), a subscriber identity module or subscriber identification module (SIM), a Removable User Identity Module (R-UIM), an Internet exchange (IPX), X.25, BLNA, or a Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinate.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In some embodiments, a resource may be a link to, or in the form of, an electronic file, an electronic folder, or another item stored on the user device or external to the user device such as, for example, on an external storage device or server (e.g., resolution server 220 of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>). For example, an application executing on a device may retrieve a discount coupon that was previously stored on the user device (e.g., in the form of an image file) in response to the identification of a speaker's voiceprint in the audio stream played in a store. As a similar example, the discount coupon may be stored in resolution server 220 of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> and communicated to the user device and/or a user of the user device in response to the identification of a speaker's voiceprint in the audio stream played in a store.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">As another example of a resource, in a case where a user's device is not connected to the internet, such as when a user's mobile device is not subscribed to a data plan, the user device may be directed to call a pre-configured phone number. For example, a software application on the user device may communicate with one or more central databases or registries via SMS or MMS after which a response from the central database may prompt the user of the user device to call a phone number provided by the central database.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">A resource may also comprise an action in some embodiments. For example, a resource may include instructions for directing a user device, or an application or other component executing or residing on the user device, to perform actions such as receiving email, forwarding or sending email, deleting email, exchanging email, using other messaging protocols, such as, Post Office Protocol (POP), Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP),<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), or otherwise manipulating email or other messages, whether occurring in the link layer, internet layer, transport layer, or application layer. As other examples, an action may comprise directing a web browser or application executing on a user device to a particular website, displaying text, an image, or a video on a user device, directing a television to a particular channel, executing a particular application on a user device, playing sound on a user device, or any other action capable of being performed on a user device. It should be noted that actions, as well as other resources, may vary with different user devices.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In yet other embodiments, a resource may, for example, specify indices or pointers to a separate database that contains further information about how to access a resource. In some embodiments, the indices may be single or multi-bit indices into separate databases. In other embodiments, the indices may be unique data strings that serve as indices into separate databases. A separate database may be provided by third-party resolution service providers or resolution servers. In still other embodiments, a resource may be determined using a computer algorithm or logic that, for example, is capable of execution on the user device as particular software installed on the user device in the form of an application, widget, or native software.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In some embodiments, resources may be edited after registration. Editing may include, for example, changing a resource. In certain embodiments, changes can be made manually by a registering entity or automatically based on a computer algorithm or logic.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Referring still to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, in step 320, audio may be captured at a user device. For example, in some embodiments, audio may be transmitted in a region and captured by a user device such as user device 240 of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, which may be, for example, a cellular telephone, smart phone, or other user device having a microphone or other input means to capture audio.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> In step 330, speaker recognition software may be used to identify speaker in the captured audio. In some embodiments, as mentioned above with reference to speaker recognition system 247 of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, speaker recognition software may automatically identify speaker upon receipt of the audio at a user device. In other embodiments, a user may activate a software application on a user device to identify speaker in the captured audio using a speaker recognition system. For example, a user watching a television broadcast may activate an application on a user device for the purpose of obtaining additional information about the content of the broadcast. In some embodiments, the audio may be extracted directly from the broadcast signal.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As a specific example, a user may activate an application on a user device such as a smart phone, personal computer, or other similar user device by entering a predefined sequence (e.g., #555) or actuating a button on the user device. As another example, the user may be informed of the presence of audio such as by announcements on a television channel the user is watching, signs or announcements in a location such as a shopping mall or airport, by the user device itself, or via any other suitable mechanism, thereby notifying the user to activate a speaker recognition system. Alternatively, a user device may be operated in a monitoring mode, enabling the automatic activation of a speaker recognition system upon detection of audio. In another embodiment, there may be one or more cues (e.g., an audible or inaudible sound cue, an image or video cue, an electronic communication-such as SMS, e-mail, instant message, a proprietary notification system, etc.-from another program on the user device or a different computer or network, etc.) to activate the speaker recognition system.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In step 340, it may be determined whether the central database contains speaker identifier that corresponds to the identified speaker. In some embodiments, an application on<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> the user device may query an internal database to determine whether one or more identified speakers have one or more speaker identifiers. In other embodiments, the user device may transmit one or more speaker identifiers to a central database such as, for example, resolution server 220 or resource provider server 250 of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>. In some embodiments, identified speaker identifiers may be continuously transmitted to the central database. In other embodiments, identified speaker identifiers may be transmitted in accordance with a predefined time interval. In certain embodiments, identified speaker identifiers may be used to initiate the execution of an application, program, or action on a device without determining whether a database contains corresponding speaker identifiers. It should be noted that some or all of these embodiments may internally and/or externally store identified speaker identifiers for later processing.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Based on the determination, in step 350 one or more resources corresponding to contained speaker identifiers may be provided to the user device. In some embodiments, resources are provided to the user on a user device in a selectable format such as, for example, in a selectable textual and/or graphical listing of network links. For instance, an application on a user device initiated by a user, or automatically initiated upon receipt of audio at the user device, may display provided resources for selection by the user. As a specific example, provided resources may consist of one or more selectable advertisement offers that are graphically displayed to the user on the user device. Selecting one of the advertisement offers may, for example, direct a web browser executing on the user device to a website at which the offer may be fulfilled. In other embodiments, as described above, a resource may cause a user device to perform a specific action such as, for example, initiating an application, causing an application to perform a specific action, sending an email, calling a telephone number, displaying text, an image, or a video, or directing a web browser executing<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> on the user device to a specific website. In yet another embodiment, a resource may be automatically or manually bookmarked for later use or review by a user. In one embodiment, the speaker identifier and/or any meta-data on the user device or resolution server may be used as search terms against third-party databases or indexes (e.g., a search engine, etc.) and that the results of the search may be processed by a browser or other program on the user device or resolution server.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In particular embodiments of the techniques described herein, a user device may request user confirmation prior to initiating an action and/or may provide options for how the user would prefer to take various actions such as, for example, accessing a website. In some embodiments, resource requests may include derived geographical location information to ensure a location-appropriate resource. For instance, when the geographical location of a user device is considered, a provided resource may, for example, relate to the location of facilities nearest to the requesting user device or include a web page in a language corresponding to the geographical location of the user.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In some embodiments of the techniques described herein, resources provided to particular user devices, and a user's interaction with those resources, may be tracked in order to build profiles that can be used to better target information to users. For example, in certain embodiments, resource request information may be recorded by a central database or registry by noting, for example, the requesting user device, user information, the speaker identifier, and information related to the resource provided to the user device. In these embodiments, an analysis may be performed on the recorded data to analyze individual and/or aggregate profile information in order to provide tailored information to the user. Also, in some embodiments, the central database, or software or hardware on a user device or any other device, may collect details regarding a user's activities, which may be used to enable the<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> central database or registry to, for example, determine content consumption habits of the user, help advertisers better target commercials and other content to the user, develop customized resources for the user, as well as perform other similar functions.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Because use of the techniques described herein may result in users being seamlessly directed to a destination, an application with malicious intent or a legitimate application with compromised security may redirect a user to a nefarious destination thus potentially instigating fraud. Therefore, some embodiments of the techniques described herein may utilize, for example, cryptographic certificates that check for the authenticity and security of the destination resource with a database. Other mechanisms for verifying the authenticity and/or security of a destination resource may instead or also be used.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> discloses another system consistent with an embodiment of this disclosure. In this embodiment, user device 240 may still include the previously discussed processor 241 and memory 242. However, in this embodiment memory 242 may, instead of including speaker identification software 247, include signal processing software 401. Signal processing software 401 may convert an audio signal, or a portion of the audio signal, received or captured by user device 240 into a representation. The representation may be a compressed representation, an algorithmic representation, a mathematical representation, a sample, and/or a digest of the audio signal or the portion of the audio signal. Then, the representation may be transmitted over network 210 to a speaker recognition server 402. In certain embodiments, the speaker recognition server 402 may be one or more of resolution server 220 or resource provider server 250. The speaker recognition server 402 may be any device that includes a processor 403 and a memory 404. The speaker recognition server 402 may receive the compressed audio signal, or portion of the audio signal, and process it using speaker recognition software 405.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The speaker recognition software 405 may then determine an identity of the speaker in the audio signal, or portion of the audio signal. The speaker recognition server 402 may then provide the speaker identity to the user device 240 or directly to the resolution server 220.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">What follows are examples in accordance with certain embodiments of the disclosed techniques. The examples are provided merely as illustrations and are not intended to limit the disclosed techniques.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Broadcast Program Example: In one example, a user watching a television broadcast, such as of a sporting event, may desire statistics for various players or teams participating in the sporting event. The user may activate an application utilizing the techniques described herein on a user device such as, for example, a mobile telephone, a computer, television, or other electronic user device for the purpose of receiving such statistics. The user device may capture audio from the television broadcast and the application may use a speaker recognition system to identify speakers in the captured audio. For example, the user device may capture audio and identify the speaker to be "Timmy Smith." The application may send a speaker identifier (e.g., a speaker name, etc.) to a central registry, such as a VERISIGN™ registry. The central registry may then determine whether any speaker identifier to resource mappings exist that correspond to the speaker identifier and return any resources associated with the speaker identifier to the user device. For example, if the user device captures the speaker name "Timmy Smith" and sends those words to the central database, the central database may determine if a speaker name equal to the name "Timmy Smith" exists, and if so, returns the corresponding resource to the user device, which may be, for example, the URL "http://www.timmysmith.com." The URL may be displayed to<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> the user of the user device as a selectable link that when selected by the user results in the loading of a website that includes the desired statistics of the player in a web browser.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Advertising Campaign Example: As another example, a marketing company may register one or more speaker identity-resource pairings for a particular product or group of products. A consumer listening to a commercial that is transmitted via broadcast or other media transmission may be provided a resource, e.g., a web page or website, by activating an application on their phone that identifies a speaker in the commercial broadcast using a speaker identification system and that requests a resource from a central database based on the identified speaker. In some embodiments, all commercials for a particular product or group of products may include the same registered speaker identifier and, thus, the user may be directed to a common webpage regardless of which of the commercials for the particular product or group of products is broadcast to the users. In other embodiments, each individual commercial for a particular product or group of products may include a different speaker and the user may be directed to either a common webpage or different webpages for each commercial based on the different speaker identifiers.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Geographical Location Advertising Example: For a user device enabled to derive geographical location information, a speaker identifier may be used in connection with geographical location information to determine a resource appropriate for the vicinity of the requesting user device. That is, while in some cases a speaker identifier may result in the same resource being returned to all user devices from a resolution server irrespective of location, in other cases each user device may receive a resource appropriate for the vicinity of the user device from a resolution server by providing not only speaker identifiers that correspond to identified speakers captured by the user device, but also the user device's<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> current geographic location. Accordingly, the resolution server may provide different resources to requesting user devices located in different geographical locations.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Promotional Codes Example: As another example, a speaker identifier may be paired with a promotional code resource. For example, a user device may capture an advertising "jingle." An application on the user device may identify speakers in the jingle and request a resource from a resolution server based on those speaker identifiers. The resolution server may return the associated promotional code to the user device via a hyperlink displayed to the user on the user device. The user, in turn, may access a web page and may use the promotional code at the time of check-out in an e-commerce transaction to avail him/herself of discounts. As a specific example, a DISNEY™ advertisement may comprise audio that corresponds to a speaker-resource pairing, with the speaker being "Mickey Mouse" and the resource being one or more promotional codes. The user device, upon identifying the speaker "Mickey Mouse" and requesting any possible resources corresponding to the speaker may receive a promotional code. For example, a promotional code may be received that allows a customer to purchase tickets to DISNEYLAND™ at a discounted price.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Automatic Contest Registry and/or Voting Example: As still another example, a speaker may be associated with a resource hosting an online and/or broadcast contest. For example, a user may be provided with a means to cast votes for favorite contestants in television or other broadcast shows, such as, for example, AMERICAN IDOL™, AMERICA'S GOT TALENT™, or the like, in response to one or more speakers identified in the shows that correspond to a speaker-resource pairing.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Radio Example: A user listening to a breaking news broadcast may want more details on the topic of the news report. To do so, the user may activate an application that utilizes the techniques described herein to capture audio. The application may be directed to a<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> webpage or other resource that provides additional details about the news story based on identified speakers in the captured audio.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Additional Audio Signal Information Example: In one embodiment, the speaker information may be registered with additional audio signal information. The additional audio signal information may comprise, for example, one or more identifiers derived by processing the audio stream, such as audio fingerprints, audio watermarks, text from the audio signal, audio URLs, or any other identifier derived from the audio signal. More information on the use of audio URLs can be found in co-pending Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO20110238192A"><text>2011/0238192 </text></patcit>to Systems and Methods for Providing Access to Resources Through Enhanced Audio Signals, filed on March 25, 2011, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">In this embodiment, user device may receive an audio signal, as discussed above. The user may than determine a speaker identity for the audio signal using one or more of the embodiments discussed above. In this embodiment, however, the user device may also determine additional information for the audio signal. Alternatively, the audio signal may be sent to a server to have the additional information determined. The user device or server may determine the additional information by matching one or more audio fingerprints, extracting one or more audio watermarks, or performing speech-to-text translation on the audio signal. Then, the user device or server may provide the additional information and the speaker identity to the registry, which then provides a resource (or access information for the resource) registered for that combination of additional information and speaker identity.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The foregoing description of the techniques, along with associated embodiments, has been presented for purposes of illustration only.
