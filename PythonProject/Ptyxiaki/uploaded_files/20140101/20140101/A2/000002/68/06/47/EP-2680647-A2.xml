In a heterogeneous cellular network, the macro BSs are deployed in a regular and planned manner with a high transmit power (e.g., 46dBm), and the overlaid pico BSs are deployed in areas with poor coverage (e.g., the edge of a macro cell) with relatively low transmit power (e.g., 30dBm). The overlaid BS deployment may improve the coverage and may provide capacity gain by increasing spatial reuse of the spectrum.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In LTE-A Release 10 (Rel-10), the macro BSs can mute certain subframes, which are known as almost blank subframes (ABS), to reduce the interference to the pico user equipment (UE). In an ABS, most resource elements (RE) are blank and only a small amount of REs carry some system information (e.g., the cell-specific reference signals and synchronization signals). The pico UEs may thereby suffer less interference and may achieve a higher data rate when the macro BSs transmit ABSs.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In LTE-A systems, the radio resource is divided into REs and physical resource blocks (PRB). <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example structure of a Long Term Evolution/Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE/LTE-A) subframe.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the structure of an LTE/LTE-A subframe is shown in time and frequency domain.

The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be construed in a limited sense.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In an example, a power control scheme is proposed for the macro BSs to reduce their interference to pico UEs in LTE-A heterogeneous networks. In the proposed method, a pico BS chooses a set of macro BSs to report the traffic load of their victim UEs. Based on the traffic load information from one or more pico BSs, a macro BS determines its power allocation over the PRBs and shares the power allocation pattern with its neighboring pico BSs. The pico BS schedules its associated UEs for data transmission based on the received power allocation patterns from one or more macro BSs.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">For the downlink of a LTE-A heterogeneous network, the pico UEs (e.g., the UEs that are associated with pico cells) suffer strong interference from its neighboring macro BSs due to the high transmit power of the macro BSs. To improve the throughput of the pico UEs, especially those on the cell edge, a power control scheme is needed for the macro BSs to control<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> their interference to the pico UEs. Example embodiments are directed to a power control scheme to reduce the interference between macro BSs and pico UEs, which may improve the cell average and cell edge throughput of the pico UEs.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the example embodiments, a pico BS chooses a set of macro BSs to which the pico BS reports the traffic load of the victim UEs. Based on the traffic load information from one or more pico BSs, a macro BS determines its power allocation over the physical resource blocks (PRBs) and shares the power allocation pattern with its neighboring pico BSs. The pico BS schedules its associated UEs for data transmission based on the received power allocation pattern(s) from one or more macro BSs.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a heterogeneous network, in accordance with an example embodiment. In the example heterogeneous cellular network depicted in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, there is a mix of pico BSs 200-1, 200-2, macro BSs 201-1, 201-2, and UEs 202-1, 202-2, 202-3, 202-4, 202-5. The macro and pico BSs work together to serve multiple UEs in an area. The UEs on the cell edge that are associated with the pico BSs may suffer strong interference from the macro BSs. For example, UE1 202-1 is associated with pico BS1 200-1, but may suffer strong interference from macro BS1 201-1 and macro BS2 201-2; UE3 202-3 is associated with pico BS2 200-2, but may suffer strong interference from macro BS1 201-1.

At 603, the pico BS sends the traffic load information to each macro BS within the reporting set through an X2 interface. The traffic load information for the victim UEs may include the number of PRBs assigned to the victim UEs, the packet arrival rate, or the throughput. At 604, based on the traffic load reports from one or more pico BSs, a macro BS determines the power allocation pattern. At 604, the macro BS shares the pattern with one or more pico BSs (via an X2 interface) for the UE scheduling. Meanwhile, the macro BS may schedule its own UEs for data transmission based on its power allocation pattern. At 605, the pico BSs generate a data transmission schedule for the associated UEs based on the received<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> power allocation pattern.
