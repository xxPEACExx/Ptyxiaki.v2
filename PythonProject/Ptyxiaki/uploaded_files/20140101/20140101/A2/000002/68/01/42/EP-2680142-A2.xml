In an example application centric operating system environment, a user is able to launch an application by selecting an icon or some other representation of the application. In application centric operating system environments, a user is required to select a particular application that would enable a particular task to be performed. Once inside the application, the user may then take a variety of different actions to achieve a plurality of functions. For example, an email application may be opened by selecting an icon that looks like a letter. Once opened, a user may read a message, send a message and/or the like. By way of further example, a user of an email application may have three different windows open, a first window that contains a draft email message to a first person, a second window containing a received message from a second person and a third email containing an inbox. Further still, a user may also have a social media application open with a number of windows, allowing the user to switch between currently active applications. The user however always enters the application through a front end that generally starts with a splash screen followed by a home screen.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In some examples, an application centric operating system may have a process manager which may be further configured to display a list of applications and a list of windows that are tied to those one or more applications. In these cases and in an instance in which the system or user shuts down the application, then all windows related to that application may be removed and/or may disappear from view. Once removed from view, in order to access a particular feature or perform a task within the application, the user must again navigate through a splash screen and through the application to a screen that may provide the particular feature.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Additional input mechanisms may be used in conjunction with an application centric operating system, for example an input system that is configured to receive a command "call" followed by an identifier, which is configured to activate a phone LEGAL02/32836226vl<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> application and initiate a call to the provided identifier. Other short cuts such as call home or call voicemail may be used. However any shortcut, such as those identified above, are configured to open an identified application and/or are directly tied to a particular application.</p><heading id="h0003">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Methods, apparatuses, and computer program products are provided herein for enabling a task based operating environment. In some example embodiments, a software package may expose one or more tasks that it is configured to perform. A task launcher may then aggregate all of the tasks provided by the available software packages and may cause those tasks to be provided to a user via a graphical user interface (GUI). In an instance in which a task to be performed is identified, the methods, apparatuses, and computer program products described herein may determine whether the received task is configured to launch a view, cause an action to be taken or defines a topic. In an instance in which the task is configured to launch a view, a view is provided by a software package for the purpose of performing the task. In an instance in which the task is configured to cause an action to be taken, that action would be take place, and may not result in a view being launched. Finally if the task defines a topic, one or of the available software packages may provide subtasks for user selection based on the defined topic.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In some example embodiments, a method is provided that comprises receiving an input identifying at least one task to be performed.

Indeed, the embodiments may take many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. The terms "data," "content," "information," and similar terms may be used interchangeably, according to some example embodiments, to refer to data capable of being transmitted, received, operated on, and/or stored. Moreover, the term "exemplary", as may be used herein, is not provided to convey any qualitative assessment, but instead merely to convey an illustration of an example. Thus,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> use of any such terms should not be taken to limit the spirit and scope of embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As used herein, the term "circuitry" refers to all of the following: (a) hardware-only circuit implementations (such as implementations in only analog and/or digital circuitry); (b) to combinations of circuits and software (and/or firmware), such as (as applicable): (i) to a combination ofprocessor(s) or (ii) to portions of processor(s)/software (including digital signal processor(s)), software, and memory(ies) that work together to cause an apparatus, such as a mobile phone or server, to perform various functions); and (c) to circuits, such as a microprocessor(s) or a portion of a microprocessor(s), that require software or firmware for operation, even if the software or firmware is not physically present.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">This definition of "circuitry" applies to all uses of this term in this application, including in any claims. As a further example, as used in this application, the term "circuitry" would also cover an implementation of merely a processor (or multiple processors) or portion of a processor and its (or their) accompanying software and/or firmware. The term "circuitry" would also cover, for example and if applicable to the particular claim element, a baseband integrated circuit or application specific integrated circuit for a mobile phone or a similar integrated circuit in a server, a cellular network device, or other network device.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In some examples of a task based system, application icons may not be presented to the user, may be hidden or otherwise obscured in the user interface thus preventing a user from accessing an application directly. Alternatively or additionally, in some example embodiments described herein, an application may not be accessible at all via an icon or may not be directly launched by the user. Instead and in some example embodiments, a task based system is disclosed that enables a user to provide a task to be accomplished to the user interface and in response the systems and methods described herein may cause a software package to provide a view, take an action or the like, thereby enabling the user to operate in terms of tasks to be accomplished, generally the tasks to be accomplished are application agnostic.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In some example embodiments, the user interaction with a user interface may be related to a task or a topic to be performed, an end state to be achieved, an intent to be performed and/or like. In some examples, the task or topic received form the user is not application dependent, but is application independent. For example, an application independent task such as "play" may relate to subtasks such as "play music," "play video,"<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> "play a game," and/or the like. As such, the user may be prompted with those subtasks. Even in an instance in which the task provided by the user via the user interface is "play music," one or more software packages may be available that can provide music playing functionality. As such, a user may no longer be required to select a particular application and then navigate to a particular functionality of that application to perform a task, but instead may select a task without being concerned about choosing a particular software package that accomplishes the selected task.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In some example embodiments, the one or more software packages may be configured to expose one or more tasks that the software package is configured to perform. These exposed one or more tasks may then be selected by an example task management system based on the task input via the user interface. Upon receipt of a selection of the one or more tasks, the one or more software packages may be configured to launch, build, generate or other provide a view on the user interface. As is described herein, a view may include, but is not limited to a display on a user interface, a voice/audio prompt, a multimodal output and/or the like. Alternatively or additionally, the task may be configured to perform an action based on the task defined by the software package. In some cases the action may not be related to a view.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In some example embodiments, a task may be defined as a method to invoke functionality in the one or more software packages. As such, the exposed tasks by the one or more software packages function as an entry point into the one or more software packages. In other words, a software package may launch or build a view for the purpose of accomplishing the task. For example, and in response to a "play music" command, a music playing software package may be launch, build or otherwise provide a view that lists available music to be played and/or the software package may be configured to perform an action such as playing a randomly selected song without the need to open the software package and navigate to the desired functionality.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">By way of an additional example, a user may propose a task: "compose a status update." In response the system as described herein may determine that this task is related to social media applications and, as such, may be configured to build, launch or otherwise provide a view in a first social media software package that enables the user to perform a status update. Again, the status update view is built or launched via the task management system, without causing the user to navigate through the social media splash screen and through the other functionality of the software package in order to locate the status update functionality. Further, after completing the status update, a new view from a second social<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> media software package may be launched. Further and in some examples, the status update field in the second social media software package may be populated with the previously entered status update in the first social media software package. The second view may be launched in the second social media application because tasks may span multiple applications. In this case the task of performing a status update was performed across multiple applications in order to accomplish the task</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As the views are generated, a task chain is generated by the task management system allowing, for example, the user to switch between the view of the first social media software package that is configured to provide status updates and the view of the second social media software package that is configured to provide status updates without causing the user to open and close the individual software packages. Advantageously, the task chain is provided in the user interface and enables the user to navigate all of the tasks in the chain without concern for the software package that generated the task.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Alternatively or additionally, a task may result in a topic. A topic is defined as an overarching concept that may have one or more subtasks, in other words a topic may be part of a hierarchy of defined tasks. For example, a task of "play" may result in a topic of "play" because there are a number of available subtasks in a task hierarchy, such as but not limited to "play music," play video," and/or "play a game." In some examples, a task becomes a topic in an instance in which the task does not correspond to an action or a view provided by the one or more software packages 16.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a schematic representation of a task based system 10 that may benefit from some example embodiments of the present invention. The example task based system 10, in some example embodiments, comprises a user interface 12, a task management system 14, and one or more software packages 16. The example task based system 10 is configured, in some example embodiments, to enable a user to interact in a task based environment with one or more software packages 16 via a user interface 12. The user interface 12 is configured to receive one or more task requests from a user, an application, a sensor, or the like. The task requests may take the form of a selection, a text input, a voice command and/or other multimodal inputs. The user interface 12 is then configured to pass the one or more task requests to the task management system 14.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The task management system 14 may then query or otherwise determine from the one or more software packages 16 via one or more task providers 32 whether a task has been exposed by the one or more software packages that matches and/or is similar to the received task. A task matches or is similar to another task in an instance which the task<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> received via the user interface 12 has a similar intent, end state, purpose or the like to the one or more exposed tasks. Once a task is determined to match an exposed task, the exposed task may then result in a view from the one or more software packages 16 to be presented via the user interface 12 (e.g. a screen that meets the intent of the task), in an action being performed via the one or more software packages (e.g. phone call is initiated), and/or in one or more subtasks being received in an instance in which the exposed task defines a topic.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">For example, at the top level and in an instance in which a topic is not defined, a software package 16 may present, such as via the user interface 12, a task to "Play Music". If the user selects that task, via the user interface 12, the task management system 14 via the task provider 32 may not launch a view in a software package related to "play music," but, instead may cause the task provider 32 to display the subtasks of "Play Music" such as "Playlists", "Genres", "Albums", and "Artists". "Play Music" may be defined as a topic because there are a number of subtasks available, as such "play music," is set as a topic by the task management system 14.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In an instance in which the parent task "Play Music" is invoked, such as by the task management system 14, the current topic may be set to "play music". Once the topic is set by the task management system 14, each software package 16 has the opportunity to respond to the topic, via the task provider 32, with a set of subtasks for that topic. In this example, one or more software packages relating to playing music may respond with tasks for "Playlists", "Genres", "Albums", and "Artists". Other software packages may also add additional subtasks via the task provider 32.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In addition to setting a topic, tasks can also result in an action being performed or a view being displayed. In an instance in which, the task management system 14 receives a task associated with an intent, purpose and/or end state, such as when a user selects a task via the user interface 12, the task launcher 24 may take an action causing a software package to perform an action or display a view. The task launcher 24 causes a software package to take an action or display a view in an instance in which an intent of an input task matches or is similar to an intent of a task exposed by a software package 16. For example in a software package that exposes tasks for "Playlists," "Genres," "Albums," and "Artists" each task relates to an intent that causes a view in the software package to be displayed. For example a software package 16 could also expose a task based intent that starts playing a song without showing a view. In other cases a view is shown in<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> conjunction with performance of an action. In some examples, an action may not result in a view being generated.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In some example embodiments, the task management system 14 comprises a task chain manager 22, a task launcher 24 and a task repository 26.

The task launcher 24 is configured to receive the one or more tasks input from the user interface 12 and is further configured to select a task of the one or more tasks provided by the task provider 32 based on the received one or more tasks. The task chain manager 22 is configured to generate a task chain as each task is added or removed by the task launcher 24. The task chain manager 22 enables a user, via the user interface 12, to navigate forwards and backwards and/or to view any task currently in the task chain. The task repository 26 is configured to store historical task data, contextual information, user preferences and/or the like. The task launcher 24, the user interface 12 or the like may be configured to access the task repository 26 to determine one or more tasks to display to a user, determine a task selection, or the like based on the data stored in the task repository.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In some example embodiments, the one or more software packages 16 may be configured to expose one or more tasks via a task provider 32. The tasks that are exposed by the one or more software packages are configured to define the functionality provided by the software package 16.

The software package 16 may be configured to also push views and pop views via the task chain manager 22 thus enabling the one or more software packages 16 to create a view hierarchy that is managed by the task chain manager 22. In some example embodiments, the view hierarchy may be controlled by the software packages 16.
