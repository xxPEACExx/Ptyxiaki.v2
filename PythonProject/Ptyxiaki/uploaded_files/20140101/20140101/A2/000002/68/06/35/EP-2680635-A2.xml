The conventional microwave line-of-sight backhaul represents an interconnected network of microwave relays and/or microwave switches, which allows for communication between the near end mobile communications devices and the far end mobile communications devices using various microwave pathways. The conventional microwave line-of-sight backhaul includes one or more conventional backhaul nodes to route communications between the near end mobile communications devices and the far end mobile communications devices.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The conventional backhaul nodes are conventionally mounted on very large, stable ground-based masts, rooftops, and other existing structures, at vast distances apart at a height that provides a clear view over the surrounding buildings and terrain to form a macrocell. These vast distances require narrow beams of various antenna elements of the conventional backhaul nodes to be aimed very accurately, within the line-of-sight of one another, to meet network demands, such as quality of service (QoS) to provide an example. Aiming of the various antenna elements of the conventional backhaul nodes is entirely a mechanical process whereby an installer simply adjusts a direction, such azimuth, altitude, pitch, roll, and/or yaw to provide some examples, of the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> various antenna elements until reaching maximum signal strength. Additionally, the conventional backhaul nodes conventionally operate at high power levels, typically high powered, narrow beams, to allow for their communications to traverse the vast distances between them.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, environmental factors, such as wind to provide an example, can cause movement, such as jitter or vibration, of the conventional backhaul nodes as well as their associated high power, narrow beams. These environmental factors, as well as other environmental factors, such obstructions from buildings and terrain, for example, tree branches, can cause signal strengths of the conventional backhaul nodes to fluctuate, thereby making aiming of these high powered, narrow beams rather difficult. Additionally, these environmental factors can cause redirection of the high power, narrow beams of the antennas even after being properly aimed. In these situations, the high power levels of the conventional backhaul nodes are further increased to compensate for these environmental factors to maintain the network demands. The redirection of the high power, narrow beams in this manner can cause high powered microwave radiation to be directed directly at populated areas.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Additionally, loss of one or more conventional backhaul nodes can be devastating for the conventional microwave line-of-sight backhaul. For example, one or more conventional backhaul nodes can become inoperative as a result of the environmental factors. As a result, the conventional microwave line-of-sight backhaul can no longer be able to meet the network demands when one or more of the conventional backhaul nodes become inoperative due to the relatively limited number of the conventional backhaul nodes within the conventional microwave line-of-sight backhaul.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to an aspect, a monitoring and control system is provided for managing a plurality of backhaul nodes in a microwave backhaul, the monitoring and control system comprising:

The conventional microwave line-of-sight backhaul 102 includes one or more conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> to route communications between the near end mobile communications devices 104 and the far end mobile communications devices 106. Typically, one or more of the conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i>, such as the conventional<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> backhaul node 108.1 to provide an example, can include a conventional outdoor unit (ODU) to communicate with a conventional indoor unit (IDU) that is in communications with the near end mobile communications devices 104 and/or the far end mobile communications devices 106. The conventional IDU can additionally function as a communications bridge to pass communications from the near end mobile communications devices 104 and/or the far end mobile communications devices 106 to their respective ODUs.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">One of the conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> is further illustrated in an exploded view 110. As shown in the exploded view 110, the conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> conventionally includes various antenna elements 112 that are mounted onto a fixed, highly stable location 114. The fixed, highly stable location 114 represents any very large, stable ground-based mast, rooftop, and other existing structure. Conventionally, the various antenna elements 112 from one conventional backhaul node 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> are at vast distances apart from various antenna elements 112 of another conventional backhaul node 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> at a height that provides a clear view over the surrounding buildings and terrain to form a macrocell. These vast distances require narrow beams of the various antenna elements 112 of the conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> to be aimed very accurately, within the line-of-sight of one another, to meet network demands, such as quality of service (QoS) to provide an example. Aiming of the various antenna elements 112 of the conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> is entirely a mechanical process whereby an installer simply adjusts a direction, such azimuth, altitude, pitch, roll, and/or yaw to provide some examples, of the various antenna elements until reaching maximum signal strength. Additionally, the conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> conventionally operate at high power levels, typically high powered, narrow beams, to allow for their communications to traverse the vast distances between them.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">However, environmental factors, such as wind to provide an example, can cause movement, such as jitter or vibration, of the conventional backhaul<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> as well as their associated high power, narrow beams. These environmental factors, as well as other environmental factors, such obstructions from buildings and terrain, for example, tree branches, can cause signal strengths of the conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> to fluctuate, thereby making aiming of these high powered, narrow beams rather difficult. Additionally, these environmental factors can cause redirection of the high power, narrow beams of the antennas even after being properly aimed. In these situations, the high power levels of the conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> are further increased to compensate for these environmental factors to maintain the network demands. The redirection of the high power, narrow beams in this manner can cause high powered microwave radiation to be directed directly at populated areas. For example, these environmental factors can cause the various antenna elements 112 of the conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> to sag over time which requires these various antenna elements 112 to be manually re-aimed on site.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Additionally, loss of one or more conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> can be devastating for the conventional microwave line-of-sight backhaul 102. As a result, the conventional microwave line-of-sight backhaul 102 can no longer be able to meet the network demands when one or more of the conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> become inoperative due to the relatively limited number of the conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> within the conventional microwave line-of-sight backhaul 102. For example, one or more conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> can become inoperative as a result of the environmental factors. As another example, failure of certain components, such as the various antenna elements 112 and their associated electronics to provide some examples, of one or more conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> cause these conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> to become inoperative. In each of these examples, the conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> remain inoperative until on site repairs are complete. In some situations, the communications can be re-routed to bypass these inoperative conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> by reconfiguring the various microwave<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> pathways 150.1 through 150.<i>k</i> which can slow down of communications within the conventional communications network 100. However, in other situations, the various microwave pathways 150.1 through 150.k must pass through these inoperative conventional backhaul nodes 108.1 through 108.<i>i</i> which can completely stop communications within the conventional communications network 100 until on site repairs are complete.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047"><u>ADVANCEMENT IN BACKHAUL NODES</u></p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Recent advancements in microwave backhaul nodes have dramatically altered complexity of conventional microwave backhauls, such as the conventional microwave line-of-sight backhaul 102 to provide an example. A first advancement is the use of a phased array feeder (PAF) for communications among the microwave backhaul nodes as described in United States Patent Application No.: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US13435604B"><text>13/435,604, filed March 30, 2012</text></patcit>, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Unlike various antenna elements of the conventional microwave backhauls, the PAF is configurable to be dynamically aimed. The PAF represents a reconfigurable array of element antennas that is configurable to receive energy in a desired direction and to suppress energy in an undesired direction. The reconfigurable array is configurable to provide various microwave pathways to various microwave backhaul nodes. For example, the reconfigurable array can be configurable to provide a microwave pathway for communications to one microwave backhaul node, commonly referred to as point-to-point.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">As another example, the reconfigurable array can be configurable to provide more than one microwave pathway for communications to more than one microwave backhaul node, commonly referred to as point-to- multipoint. In this other example, the reconfigurable array can be physically or logically, in time and/or frequency, separated to provide these microwave pathways. For example, this logical time separation can include one or more configurations, such as from full-duplex PAF to a first microwave backhaul node for approximately fifty percent of the time to a half-duplex PAF to a<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> second microwave backhaul node for approximately twenty-five percent of the time to a half-duplex PAF to a third microwave backhaul node for approximately twenty-five percent of the time.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Second, this configurability of the PAF allows the microwave backhaul nodes to be mounted on flimsy, less stable locations such as light poles, traffic signs, telephone pole, and/or sides of short buildings to provide some examples. This ability to mount the microwave backhaul nodes on less stable structures allows microwave backhaul nodes to be placed at closer distances when compared to the conventional backhaul nodes, to form microcells. As a result of this increased density, the microwave backhaul nodes can operate at lower power levels and/or lower mounting heights when compared to the conventional backhaul nodes.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Additionally, this configurability of the PAF allows the microwave backhaul nodes to operate in environmental conditions while meeting network demands that would otherwise affect the conventional backhaul nodes. For example, when a microwave backhaul node fails or becomes inoperative, a replacement microwave backhaul node can be mounted onto any nearby structure with re-aiming of PAFs of its destination microwave backhaul node being a part of the process. Further, this configurability of the PAF allows various functions of the microwave backhaul node to be controlled centrally, such as allowing for installation, supporting breakdown, or supporting heavy loading for dynamic rerouting through other PAF pathways to provide some examples. This central controlling of the microwave backhaul node allows communications with this microwave backhaul node as well as other microwave backhaul nodes within the microwave backhaul to be dynamically re-routed in real time. This dynamic re-routing of communications within the microwave backhaul can be in response to network demands and/or environmental conditions.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Further, these closer distances between the microwave backhaul nodes permit merger of different radio access technologies, such as Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 family of wireless-networks standards, commonly referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> Microwave Access (WiMAX), a 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) communications standard, or a Wi-Fi communications standard to provide some examples, into the microwave backhaul nodes and can include bridging and switching related thereto. The central controlling of the microwave backhaul node can also be used to centrally control the bridging and switching of these different radio access technologies. A failure or malfunction at the microwave backhaul node due to these different radio access technologies can be centrally monitored and/or managed.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Third, the IDU has been integrated with the ODU within the microwave backhaul nodes as described in United States Patent Application No.: (Attorney Docket No.: 2875.9630001), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The integration of the IDU and the ODU reduces a size of the microwave backhaul nodes when compared to the conventional backhaul nodes. This reduction in the size of the microwave backhaul nodes allows these microwave backhaul nodes to be mounted on the flimsy, less stable locations when compared to the conventional backhaul nodes that are mounted on very large, stable structures.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054"><u>BACKHAUL PATHWAYS THAT USE THESE ADVANCES IN BACKHAUL NODES</u></p><p id="p0055" num="0055"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates a block diagram of a microwave backhaul according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure.
