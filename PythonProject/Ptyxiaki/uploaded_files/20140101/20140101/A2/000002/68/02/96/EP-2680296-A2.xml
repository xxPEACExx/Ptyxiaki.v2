The term "microfabrication" is used to include creating and altering structures having dimensions of tens of microns or less, including nanofabrication processes. "Processing" a sample refers to the microfabrication of structures on that sample. As smaller and smaller structures are fabricated, it is necessary to direct the beam more precisely.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">One method of accurately positioning a beam is to place or mill a fiducial, that is, a reference mark, on the sample near an area of interest, and position the beam relative to the fiducial. The term fiducial is used broadly to include any type of reference mark. A beam is initially directed to image a fiducial and an initial offset to the desired location is determined. Subsequently, the beam is periodically directed to image the fiducial and the positioning of the beam to the desired location is corrected by determining an offset between the observed coordinates of the fiducial and the original coordinates of the fiducial. The offsets are then added to the beam positioning instructions so that the beam ends up at the desired location.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a top view of a sample 100 including an area of interest 102 and a fiducial 104. Area of interest 102 is a portion of sample 100 where an imaging or milling operation is to be performed. For example, sample 100 may comprise a semiconductor wafer and area of interest 102 may comprise a particular integrated circuit feature that is to be imaged by a scanning electron microscope or focused ion beam to verify whether the feature has been manufactured to within specification. Typically, a charged particle beam is used to mill fiducial 104 in the surface of the sample near area of interest 102 so that the area of interest can be located quickly and easily among a surface having many different features. When subsequently imaged at an angle that is normal to the surface of sample 100 ("top down view"), fiducial 104 can be more readily or quickly identified by the operator of the instrument (or by automation software controlling the instrument) than the area of interest 102 itself can be identified.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, fiducial 104 becomes less identifiable as fiducial 104 is imaged at angles that are not normal to the top surface of sample 100. For angles that are nearly<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> parallel to the top surface of the sample 100, fiducial 104 may not be identifiable at all. The top surface of sample 100 is the surface that is opposite of the surface that is in contact with the sample stage holding sample 100. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1B</figref> shows a side view of sample 100 in which fiducial 104 cannot be seen. Positioning the beam for imaging or milling at this angle would require a second fiducial.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Summary of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a method for forming and using a fiducial on a sample to locate an area of interest on the sample. Embodiments of the method include forming a fiducial by depositing a block of material on a sample proximal to an area of interest on the sample, the block of material extending from the surface of the sample to a detectable extent above the surface of the sample; and milling, using a charged particle beam, a predetermined pattern into at least two exposed faces of the block of material; subsequent to forming the fiducial, detecting the location of the area of interest by detecting the location of the fiducial; and subsequent to detecting the location of the area of interest, imaging or milling the area of interest with a charged particle beam.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Embodiments of the present invention are also directed to a system comprising at least one charged particle beam, a sample stage, a sample disposed upon the sample stage, and a fiducial disposed upon the sample. The fiducial comprises a block of material deposited proximal to an area of interest on the sample, the block of material extending from the surface of the sample to a detectable extent above the surface of the sample, and a predetermined pattern milled into at least two exposed faces of the block of material.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Embodiments of the present invention are also directed to a method of forming a fiducial on a sample to locate an area of interest on the sample. Embodiments of the method include rotating the sample substantially ninety (90) degrees from an imaging position, subsequent to rotating the sample substantially ninety (90) degrees from the imaging position depositing a block of material on or near the area of interest using a charged particle beam that is directed toward the surface of the sample at an angle that is not perpendicular to the surface of the sample, and subsequent to depositing the block of material and prior to detecting the location of the area of interest rotating the sample substantially ninety (90) degrees to return the sample back to its initial position.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood.

The fiducial extends to a detectable extent into three dimensions above a surface of a sample. The three dimensional ("3D") fiducial is a single reference point that can be recognized simultaneously from different angles. Such a 3D fiducial can be used, for example, with a dual-beam system that includes an electron beam and an ion beam, such as the DualBeam™ family of instruments commercially available from FEI Company of Hillsboro, Oregon, the assignee of the present application. The 3D fiducial can be used for both electron beam image recognition and ion beam image recognition, simplifying the procedure because fewer moving parts are required. The 3D fiducial is not limited to dual-beam systems, however, and can be used with both single beam systems as well as multiple beam systems. The 3D fiducial can be applied to any automation requiring image recognition, including automated Slice and View™ instruments and instruments using AutoTEM™ and iFAST™ software, all of which are commercially available from FEI Company.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The 3D fiducial is built by depositing a block of material on a sample near an area of interest and then milling unique patterns into the top and sides. These patterns will have distinct brightness and contrast values relative to the background block material allowing for image recognition. At the eucentric location or height, the fiducial can be<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> recognized from one or more beams as well as from various stage tilt and rotation positions. Eucentric height is the height of the specimen at which its image does not move laterally as a function of specimen tilt. The 3D fiducial allows for FIB cut placement using image recognition on an almost vertical plane. Relative to the incident beam, image and cut placement have traditionally been done with a top down fiducial. The prior art top down approach is not possible with milling at glancing angles (i.e., angles that are nearly parallel to the surface of the sample that is being milled or imaged) due to the almost vertical view the FIB has while cutting down the plane. For example, a fiducial mark can be cut into the top and side of a raised Platinum pad allowing ion beam image recognition from this glancing angle. Using a 45° pre-tilt stub allows beam image recognition from additional angles.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The 3D fiducial can be used with any automated application that requires a fiducial. When the automation requires one or more beams and one or more stage positions, the 3D fiducial provides a single reference point solution. The 3D fiducial is particularly useful in charged particle beam applications, such as scanned electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and imaging and milling with focused ion beam (FIB) systems.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Turning now to the drawings, <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a top view of sample 200, including area of interest 202 and 3D fiducial 204. <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2B</figref> shows a side view of sample 200, including 3D fiducial 204.
