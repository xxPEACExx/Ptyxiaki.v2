For example, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5830054A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,830,054</text></patcit> discloses an invention of a coin dispensing device, in which coins dispensed from a coin dispensing unit are delivered through a chute to a drawer and stored in the drawer, and the coins are dispensed by taking this drawer to the outside of a casing of the coin dispensing device. In <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5830054A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,830,054</text></patcit>, a plurality of storing units are defined in the drawer, and the coins are stored separately in each storing unit according to the denomination.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the conventional coin dispensing device such as the one disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5830054A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,830,054</text></patcit>, the plurality of storing units are predefined in the drawer, and the coins are stored separately in each storing unit according to the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> denomination. However, there is a problem that, since a number of denominations of coins to be handled varies from country to country, the configuration of the chute or the drawer of the dispensing system needs to be changed according to the corresponding country. Especially in a country where the number of denominations of coins to be handled is small, setting of denominations of coins to be stored in each storing unit in the drawer cannot be flexibly adapted. Another problem is that, when one tries to dispense a large amount of coins of a particular denomination, the large amount of coins of the particular denomination cannot be dispensed due to a limited capacity of each storing unit.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention has been made in consideration of the above problems, and an object thereof is to provide a coin dispensing device and a drawer in which a plurality of coin containers having different shapes can be placed in a coin container receiving unit and a number of the coin containers installed in the drawer can be changed according to a combination of each type of the coin containers placed in the coin container receiving unit, so that a number of the coin containers in the drawer can be changed according to the number of denominations of coins to be handled, and, moreover, when one wishes to dispense a large amount of coins of a particular denomination, the large amount of coins of the particular denomination can be dispensed by using the coin container having a large capacity as the coin container corresponding to the particular denomination.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A coin dispensing device in accordance with the present invention comprises:

This makes it possible to change the number of the coin containers in the drawer according to the number of denominations of coins to be handled.

In addition, when one wishes to dispense a large amount of coins of a particular denomination, the large amount of coins of the particular denomination can be dispensed by using the coin container having a large capacity as the coin container corresponding to the particular denomination (specifically, the coin container 76b as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5B (b)</figref>).</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In the coin depositing and dispensing machine 10 of the present embodiment, the carriage 70 which the drawer 72 can be attached to and detached from is provided, and this carriage 70 is movable between the first position (see <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>) where the coins dispensed from each storing and feeding device 50 are delivered to the drawer 72 and the second position (specifically, a position outside the casing 12 of the coin depositing and dispensing machine 10) where the coins stored in each of the coin containers 76a and 76b in the drawer 72 can be removed from the coin containers 76a and 76b.

This makes it possible to store the coins delivered from the chute 68, through the opening 74a of the coin container receiving unit 74, in the collecting box 78 by removing the coin containers 76a and 76b from the coin container receiving unit 74.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Note that the coin depositing and dispensing machine 10 and the drawer 72 of the present embodiment are not limited to the above-described aspects, and various changes can be made thereto.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">For example, a coin container detecting unit for detecting the type and position of each of the coin containers 76a and 76b placed in the coin container receiving unit 74 is not limited to the coin container detecting sensor 75 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 6</figref>. As another aspect, a configuration may be adopted where each of the coin containers 76a and 76b is provided with an ID chip, and the coin container receiving unit 74 is provided with a reader, so that information on the type of the coin containers 76a and 76b is stored in the ID chip provided in the coin containers 76a and 76b, and the information stored in the ID chip of the coin containers 76a and 76b is read by the reader provided in the coin container receiving unit 74.<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --></p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The coin container used in the drawer 72 of the coin depositing and dispensing machine 10 of the present embodiment is not limited to the one, such as the coin container 76a, which stores coins dispensed from one storing and feeding device 50, or the one, such as the coin container 76b, which stores coins dispensed from two storing and feeding devices 50. As the coin container, a coin container which stores coins dispensed from three or more storing and feeding devices 50 may be used. In this case, for example, an L-shaped container or a rectangular parallelepiped container in which three coin containers 76a are combined may be used as the coin container.
