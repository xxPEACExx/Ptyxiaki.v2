In general, a noise filter circuit is comprised of a common mode choke coil, an X-capacitor, and a discharge resistor. A discharge resistor is intended to discharge residual electrical charge in the X-capacitor within a predetermined period of time specified by safety standards when a power plug is disconnected<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> from a commercial AC power source. Thus, a discharge resistor is indispensable for a noise filter circuit, and dispensing with it is very difficult. An X-capacitor, which is a common name of an across-the-line capacitor, is placed across an AC line and intended to filter out noise. Depending on the capacity of an X-capacitor, a constant of about 100 kΩ to 500 kΩ is commonly selected as the resistance value of a discharge resistor. While commercial AC power is being supplied, electric current constantly flows through a discharge resistor, and hence a power loss caused by the discharge resistor occurs. When the resistance value of a discharge resistor lies inside the above range, and an input voltage is AC 200 V, a power loss of 0.08 W to 0.4 W caused by the discharge resistor occurs. This is not a negligible loss during power-off and in sleep mode when an apparatus is plugged in.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A discharge resistor is required so as to comply with a discharge time specified by safety standards as described above, and hence it is very difficult to increase resistance value more than is necessary or dispense with the discharge resistor itself. For this reason, a noise filter circuit is disposed downstream of a relay, and the relay is turned off during power-off and in sleep mode so as to inhibit electric current from flowing through a discharge resistor so that a power loss caused by the discharge resistor can be prevented.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, if a noise filter circuit is disposed downstream of a relay, an X-capacitor as well should be inevitably disposed downstream of the relay, and when the relay is on, inrush current at the X-capacitor occurs. A relay contact<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> reaches the end of its life when a surface condition thereof deteriorates, and contact sticking or poor contact occurs. In particular, a main factor that causes the surface of a relay contact to deteriorate is arc discharge occurring when a relay is turned and off. As the amount of inrush current increases, the amount of arc discharge occurring when the relay is turned on also increases.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Moreover, in recent years, automatic shifting into power-off and energy-saving mode has been required from the standpoint of energy conservation, and as a result, the number of times a relay is turned on and off is increasing. Under such circumstances, if a noise filter circuit is disposed downstream of a relay, inrush current will occur, and in addition, the number of times inrush current occurs will increase, causing a significant decrease in the life of a relay contact.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention provides an image forming apparatus which is capable of extending the life of relay contacts even in a case where a noise filter circuit is disposed downstream of relays on a path over which commercial alternating-current power is supplied.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention provides an image forming apparatus as specified in claims 1 to 10.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention provides an image forming apparatus as specified in claims 11 to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> 15.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to the present invention, because the number of times each of the plurality of relays is turned on first is leveled out so that inrush current can be equally passed through them, the number of times each relay is turned on first can be smaller than the number of times the power to the apparatus is turned on, and the life of the relay contacts can be extended.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments (with reference to the attached drawings).</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view schematically showing an arrangement of a color printer to which an image forming apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention is applied.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram schematically showing an arrangement of a controller and its vicinity in the color printer appearing in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram showing in detail an arrangement of a power-supply device appearing in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart showing the procedure of a relay control process carried out by the controller, in particular, a CPU appearing in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram showing in detail an arrangement of a power-supply device in a color printer to which an image forming apparatus according to a second embodiment of the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> present invention is applied.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart showing the procedure of a relay control process carried out by a controller, in particular, a CPU appearing in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIGS. 7A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">7B</figref> are flowcharts showing the procedure of a relay control process carried out by a controller, in particular, a CPU in a color printer to which an image forming apparatus according to a third embodiment of the present invention is applied.</p><heading id="h0006">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings showing embodiments thereof.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view schematically showing an arrangement of a color printer to which an image forming apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention is applied.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the color printer according to the present embodiment has four image forming sections (hereafter referred to as "the image forming units") 1Y, 1M, 1C, and 1Bk that form images of respective colors, yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (Bk). These four image forming units 1Y, 1M, 1C, and 1Bk are arranged in a row at regular intervals.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The image forming units 1Y, 1M, 1C, and 1Bk are equipped with drum-type electrophotographic photosensitive members (hereafter referred to as "the photosensitive drums") 2a to 2d, respectively. Primary chargers 3a to 3d, developing<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> devices 4a to 4d, transfer rollers 5a to 5d, and drum cleaning devices 6a to 6d are placed around the respective photosensitive drums 2a to 2d. A laser exposure device 7 is disposed below an area between the primary chargers 3a to 3d and the developing devices 4a to 4d.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Yellow toner, magenta toner, cyan toner, and black toner are stored in the developing devices 4a to 4d, respectively.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The photosensitive drums 2a to 2d are rotatively driven in a direction indicated by an arrow A in the figure at a predetermined process speed by a drive unit (not shown).</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The primary chargers 3a to 3d uniformly charge surfaces of the respective photosensitive drums 2a to 2d to a predetermined negative potential using a charging bias applied from a charging bias supply (not shown).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The developing devices 4a to 4d each have toner stored therein and attach toner of the respective colors to electrostatic latent images, which are formed on the respective photosensitive drums 2a to 2d, to develop (visualize) the electrostatic latent images.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The transfer rollers 5a to 5d are disposed in respective primary transfer units 32a to 32d so as to be able to abut against the respective photosensitive drums 2a to 2d via an intermediate transfer belt 8.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The drum cleaning devices 6a to 6d each have a cleaning blade or the like for removing toner having not been transferred and remaining on the photosensitive drums 2a to 2d after primary transfer.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The intermediate transfer belt 8 is disposed on upper sides of the photosensitive drums 2a to 2d and extended between a belt driving roller 10 and a tension roller 11. The belt driving roller 10, which applies drive force to the intermediate transfer belt 8, is disposed in a secondary transfer unit 34 so as to be able to abut against the secondary transfer roller 12 via the intermediate transfer belt 8. The tension roller 11, which is placed at such a location as to face the belt driving roller 10 across the primary transfer units 32a to 32d, apply tension to the intermediate transfer belt 8.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A belt cleaning device 13 is disposed outside the intermediate transfer belt 8 and in the vicinity of the tension roller 11. The belt cleaning device 13 removes and collects toner having not been transferred and remaining on a surface of the intermediate transfer belt 8.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">A fixing device 16, which has a vertical path configuration, is disposed downstream of the secondary transfer unit 34 in a direction in which a sheet S is conveyed.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The laser exposure device 7 is comprised of a laser light-emitting device, which emits light according to a time-series digital pixel signal of supplied image information, a polygon lens, a reflection mirror, and so on. The laser exposure device 7 exposes surfaces of the photosensitive drums 2a to 2d, which have been charged by the respective primary chargers 3a to 3d, to light, thereby forming electrostatic latent images of respective colors corresponding to image information on the surfaces of the photosensitive drums 2a to 2d.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">It should be noted that although in the present<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> embodiment, the color printer is taken as a concrete example of the image forming apparatus, this is not limitative, but any of a color copier, a facsimile, and a multifunctional peripheral incorporating the functionality of a color copier, a facsimile, and a printer in one may be adopted. Also, not only those which form color images but also those which form only monochrome images may be used.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">A description will now be given of an image forming operation carried out by the color printer according to the present embodiment.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">When an image formation start signal is generated, the photosensitive drums 2a to 2d of the image forming units 1Y, 1M, 1C, and 1Bk start rotating at a predetermined process speed. Then, the surfaces of the photosensitive drums 2a to 2d are uniformly negatively charged by the respective primary chargers 3a to 3d. The laser exposure device 7 outputs a laser beam, which corresponds to an externally input color-separated image signal, from the laser light-emitting device. This laser beam exposes the surfaces of the photosensitive drums 2a to 2d to light by way of the polygon lens, the reflection mirror, and so on. As a result, electrostatic latent images of the respective colors are formed on the photosensitive drums 2a to 2d.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">After that, first, yellow toner is attached to the electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum 2a by the developing device 4a to which a developing bias of the same polarity as the polarity (negative polarity) to which the photosensitive drum 2a is charged has been applied, so that the electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum 2a<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> is visualized as a yellow toner image. This yellow toner image is primarily transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt 8, which is being moved, in the primary transfer unit 32a between the photosensitive drum 2a and the transfer roller 5a by the transfer roller 5a to which the primary transfer bias (of a positive polarity opposite to toner). At this time, toner having not been transferred and remaining on the photosensitive drum 2a is scraped off by the cleaner blade or the like provided in the drum cleaning device 6a and collected.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The intermediate transfer belt 8 onto which the yellow toner image has been transferred moves toward the image forming unit 1M. Then, in the image forming unit 1M as well, a magenta toner image formed on the photosensitive drum 2b is superposed on the yellow toner image, which lies on the intermediate transfer belt 8, in the primary transfer unit 32b using the same procedure as the primary transfer operation carried out as described above by the image forming unit 1Y.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Subsequently, in the primary transfer units 32c and 32d, cyan and black toner images formed on the photosensitive drums 2c and 2b of the image forming units 1C and 1Bk are successively superposed on the yellow and magenta toner images transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt 8 in the superposed manner. As a result, full-color toner images are formed on the intermediate transfer belt 8.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Then, a sheet S is fed in synchronization with the timing with which a leading end of the full-color toner images on the intermediate transfer belt 8 moves to the secondary transfer unit 34 between the belt driving roller 10 and the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> secondary transfer roller 12. Specifically, the sheet S is fed from a selected one of a sheet feed cassette 17 and a manual feed tray 20 to pass through a conveying path 18 and conveyed to the secondary transfer unit 34 by registration rollers 19. The full-color toner images are secondarily transferred in a collective manner onto the sheet S conveyed to the transfer unit 34 by the secondary transfer roller 12 with a secondary transfer bias (of a positive polarity opposite to toner) applied thereto.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The sheet S onto which the full-color toner images have been transferred is conveyed by the fixing device 16, which in turn heats and pressurizes the full-color toner images to thermally fix them to a surface of the sheet S. The sheet S with the toner images thermally fixed thereto is discharged onto a discharged sheet tray 22 on an upper side of the main body by sheet discharging rollers 21, and this completes the sequential image forming operation.
