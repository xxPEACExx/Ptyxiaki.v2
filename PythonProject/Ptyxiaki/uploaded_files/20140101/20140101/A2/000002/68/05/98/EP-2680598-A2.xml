Content providers use broadcast graphics and animation assets to not only identify the content provider but also to provide extras that were not originally part of the provided content. Broadcast graphics and animation assets include TV station logos and scrolling tickers.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In recent years, content providers have been forced to provide content in different formats to not only accommodate standard definition ("SD") and high definition ("HD") formats, but also varying display sizes. Although simple scaling (e.g., stretching or shrinking) can be done to change content from one format to another, broadcast graphics and animation assets may get distorted in the simple scaling process.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Content providers can avoid broadcast graphics and animation assets distortion by providing a set of broadcast graphics and animation assets that are customized for every supported format in which the content provider provides content. However, this technique is both costly and time consuming since multiple sets of the same broadcast graphics and animation assets must be created. What is desired is a solution that streamlines the production and delivery of broadcast graphics or animation assets.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The invention streamlines the production and delivery of broadcast graphics or animation assets by allowing the same graphics stream to be displayed correctly at various display resolutions and display layouts. A graphics stream is created for a base HD widescreen layout and is then scaled appropriately and/or repositioned when played for different resolutions or layouts.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The invention, in one aspect features a method, executed by one or more computer processors in communication with one or more displays, for displaying graphics on the display. The method can include using one or more computer processors to receive a graphics stream in a first playout format. The first playout format can have a first display resolution and a first display layout. The one or more computer processors can also determine a second playout format having a second display resolution and a second display layout. Furthermore, the one or more computer processors can determine an area of importance within the first display layout given the first display layout, the second display resolution, and the second display layout. A preferred position can be determined within the second display layout. The preferred position can be at a location in the second display layout that is in a relatively similar location as the area of importance in the first display layout. The one or more computer processors can covert the first playout format into the second playout format using the area of importance and the preferred position. The graphics stream in the second playout format can then be displayed by the one or more computer processors on the one or more displays.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Another aspect of the invention includes a computer program product, tangibly embodied in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium, which can display graphics on a display. The computer program product can receive a graphics stream in a first playout format. The first playout format can have a first display resolution and a first display layout. The computer program product can also determine a second playout format that includes a second display resolution and a second display layout. An area of importance within the first display layout can be determined given the first display layout, the second display resolution and the second display layout. A preferred position can also be determined given the first display layout, the second display resolution, and the second display layout. Furthermore, the computer program product can convert the first playout format into the second playout format using the area of importance and the preferred position. The graphics stream in the second playout format can then be displayed on the one or more displays.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Each of the aspects above can further employ one or more of the following advantages. In some embodiments, converting includes scaling the graphics stream from the first display resolution to the second display resolution so that the area of importance of the first display layout is scaled to fit in<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the second display layout and portions of the first display layout that are not found at the area of importance are allowed to be cutoff. Converting can also include repositioning the graphics stream into the second display layout based on the area of importance such that the repositioning places the graphics found in the area of importance at the preferred position in the second display layout.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In some embodiments, each graphic of the graphics stream can include a horizontal alignment indicator or a vertical alignment indicator. The horizontal alignment indicator can be left, center, or right. The vertical alignment indicator can be top, center, or bottom.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In some embodiments, one or more graphics of the graphics stream can be indicated as being graphics that are displayed in the second display layout. The area of importance can be determined by defining a bounded region that covers a portion of the first playout format based on the first display layout, the second display layout, horizontal alignment indicators of the one or more indicated graphics, and vertical alignment indicators of the one or more indicated graphics.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In some embodiments, repositioning the graphics stream can include shifting the graphics stream by a preset amount based on a horizontal alignment indicator, a vertical alignment indicator, the second display resolution or the second display layout. Repositioning the graphics stream can also include shifting the graphics stream by a configurable shift amount based on content provider dynamic scripts.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In some embodiments, the first display layout and the second display layout can have a layout type, for example, a widescreen layout, a pillarbox layout, a full screen layout, or a letterbox layout. The first display layout and the second display layout can also be different layout types. The first display layout and the second display layout can be different layout types.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In some embodiments, a second playout format can be determined by determining a playout format of a video stream over which the graphics stream is to be displayed, reading a hint on a playlist used to override or supplement the information from the video stream, and using a playout format based on the playout format of the video stream and the hint.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In some embodiments, the graphics stream can include a portion created by a dynamic script. Script variables can be used to indicate the display resolution and the display layout of the graphics stream.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In some embodiments, the second display resolution can be a high definition format or a standard definition format. A resolution graphic can be used to indicate the playout format. The resolution graphic can be displayed only when indicating the playout format is the high definition format.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In some embodiments, the graphics stream can be a static graphics presentation or an animated graphics presentation.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In some embodiments, a crawl graphic is displayed. Converting can remove a portion of the crawl graphic.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Further features and advantages of the present invention as well as the stricture and operation of various embodiment of the present invention are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">The advantages of the invention described above, together with further advantages, may be better understood by referring to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

As a default, the first playout format 105 can be created using a HD display resolution and a widescreen display layout. The first playout format can include a graphic 109. All graphics, including the graphic 109, can be either broadcast graphics or animation assets. All graphics, including the graphic 109, can feature items such as identifying information (e.g., logos), advertisements, news, descriptive text, content metadata, and show credits. The graphic 109 can be placed anywhere within the display that is used for displaying the first playout format 105. There can also be multiple graphics from the graphics stream 101 that are displayed, and these graphics can be converted accordingly to fit onto any possible display (e.g., any display resolution and display layout). Conversion can include scaling or repositioning.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In some embodiments, the graphics stream 101 can have any possible display resolution along with any possible display layout. A display resolution can refer to the width and height of a display, as well as the number of pixels that can be displayed. Possible display resolutions include SD or HD. A display layout can refer to the shape of a display. Possible display layouts can include widescreen, pillarbox, fullscreen, or letterbox. Specific examples of display layouts include a 1.85:1 layout, a 2.35:1 layout, a postage-stamp layout, a 14:9 letterbox layout, a 1.85:1 letterbox layout, a 2.35:1 letterbox layout,<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> or an anamorphic layout. Other layouts are also possible and the invention is expressly not limited to the foregoing.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The first playout format 105 includes an area of importance 113. The area of importance 113 is a portion of the first playout format 105 that is preserved in the conversion to a second playout format (e.g., a second display layout and a second display resolution). The area of importance 113 is determined based on the display layout of the first playout format 105 and the second playout format. The area of importance 113 can be defined by a rectangular box that covers portion of first playout format 105. In other embodiments, the area of importance can be defined by any bounded shape or region within the first playout format 105. The area of importance 113 is appropriately converted (e.g., scaled and repositioned) so that graphics found in the bounded rectangle fit in the second playout format. The area of importance 113 can act as a focal point for conversion. In other words, conversion can be done based on a relative location of the area of importance 113 in the first playout format 105, such that any scaling or repositioning ensures that the area of importance 113 is maintained in the conversion and does not get cutoff or distorted in the converted playout format. In some embodiments, indicators can be assigned to the graphics stream 101 or the first playout format 105 to indicate which graphics are to be preserved in a conversion. The area of importance 113 can be created to encompass all indicated graphics. Indicators can be assigned with a priority so that the area of importance 113 can include only graphics with indicators of a certain priority range. The converted bounded rectangle can be positioned in a relatively similar position in the second playout format as the position of the area of importance 113 in the first display layout 105. For example, if the area of importance 113 is found in the bottom right portion of the first display layout 105, the converted bounded rectangle is also found in the bottom right portion of the second playout format. Portions of the first playout format 105 that are not within the area of importance 113 can be cut off or removed in the conversion process, even if graphics are located in those portions.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In other embodiments, the display can be in communication with one or more computer processors (not shown). The one or more processors can receive the graphics stream 101 from a content provider. The one or more processors can also make the determinations necessary for converting graphics found in the graphics stream 101. Conversion, which can be executed by the one or more computer processors, can include scaling and repositioning.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In some embodiments, a user interface is utilized by a user to define parameters used for the conversion. For example, the user interface allows the user to define the area or importance by, e.g., specifying a rectangle that bounds the area of importance, or giving coordinates of the area of importance, or in the case of a graphical user interface, using a mouse to select or highlight an area of importance. In some embodiments, the user interface also prompts the user to provide the target resolution, for example in a graphical user interface, the user is prompted, via user-fillable text boxes, radio buttons, or drop down menus.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In some instances, the user interface is presented as a web page that is submitted to a server that carries out the conversion. In other embodiments, the user interface is a graphical-user-interface that is part of the converter program. In still other embodiments, the user interface is a command-line interface to the converter program and parameters are provided as command line options. Alternatively, the parameters can be provided as part of an interactive script, e.g., the first playout is specified from menu options, then the second playout is specified, and so on.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In some embodiments, conversion can be done on the fly and a user can change the parameters used for conversion as the graphics stream is being played back. A change will send a request back to the server to convert the graphics into a desired or selected display layout.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> shows a graphics stream conversion process 201 that starts with the graphics stream 101 and a video stream playout format 205. A video stream playout format 205 is a default playout format for the display that displays the converted graphics stream. The video stream playout format 205 can be determined by reading a video stream dynamic script. A video stream dynamic script is a software module that executes in sequence with a video stream allowing dynamic control over video and graphics playout. Step 209 can detect if the graphic stream 101 has a playlist that contains a hint. A hint is a dynamic script variable that indicates a desired display resolution or a desired display layout. If there is a hint, the hint is read in step 213. Step 215 determines a second playout format. Step 215 can use the graphics stream 101, the hint and the video stream playout format 205 to determine the second playout format (including a second display resolution and a second display layout). If there is no hint, the second playout format is the same as the video stream playout format 205. However, if there is a hint, then the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> second playout format can be different from the video stream playout format 205. The hints can override or supplement the video stream playout format 205. However, hints can also be ignored depending on the particular hint, the video stream playout format 205, the base graphics stream 101, or any combination of these. In some embodiments, the read hint step 213 can use a scheduler. The scheduler can schedule hints on a content provider playlist to indicate the content type necessary for playback.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The scaling system 217 can scale or change the resolution of the graphics stream 101 into the second display resolution. Scaling can be the stretching or shrinking of the display resolution. Scaling can be centered around the area of importance 113. For example, scaling can be done using center-cut down-convert scaling factors based on the area of importance 113. However, any scaling factor or process can be used in converting from the graphics stream 101 display resolution to a second display resolution, including simply scaling (see above).</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">A repositioning system 221 gives instructions on which area of the graphics stream 101 to cut or move. The repositioning system 221 can use horizontal and vertical alignment indicators specified by graphic 109. The horizontal and vertical alignment indicators can indicate a position of the graphic 109 in relation to the graphics stream 101. The horizontal alignment can be left, center, or right. A left horizontal alignment implies that the graphic 109 is in the left-hand side of the graphic stream 101. A center horizontal alignment implies that the graphic 109 is in the horizontal center of or spans the graphic stream 101. A right horizontal alignment implies that the graphic 109 is in the right-hand side of the graphic stream 101. The vertical alignment can be top, center, or bottom. A top vertical alignment implies that the graphic 109 is near or is anchored to the top of the graphic stream 101. A center vertical alignment implies that the graphic 109 is near the middle of the graphic stream 101. A bottom vertical alignment implies that the graphic 109 is near or is anchored to the bottom of the graphic stream 101. For example, <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> shows a right horizontal alignment with a bottom vertical alignment. A horizontal alignment and a vertical alignment can have different effects on the positioning of graphics in a converted graphics stream 225 based on the display resolution or the display layout. In some embodiments, the horizontal alignment and the vertical alignment can, instead, indicate a position of the area of importance 113 in relation to the graphics stream 101. The repositioning system can treat the area of importance 113 like a graphic 109 as described above.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In some embodiments, the repositioning system 221 uses a preferred position within the converted graphics stream. The preferred position is an area of a converted display layout in which the converted graphics from the area of importance 113 is found. The preferred position can be determined by the location of the area of importance 113 in the graphics stream 101, a preference indicated by a video stream playout format, or a shift amount (see below). If the preferred position is determined by the location of the area of importance 113, the preferred position can be placed in a location on the converted display layout that is in a relatively similar location as the area of importance 113 in the graphics stream 101. For example, if an area of importance 113 is found in the top left of the graphics stream 101, the preferred position can be found in the top left of the converted display layout. The preferred position can be shifted by a shift amount when the preferred position is determined by the location of the area of importance 113.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> shows how the graphics stream 101 will be converted into a second graphics stream 301 with a second playout format. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the playout graphics stream 301 has a second playout format of SD fullscreen layout. A cut portion 305 is a portion of the graphics stream 101 that is cut or lost during the conversion. The cut portion 305 can be located on any outer region of the graphics stream 101, such as the top, bottom, left or right regions of the graphics stream 101. The cut portion 305 can also be located at both the top and bottom regions, as well as both the left and right regions of the graphics stream 101. For example, <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> shows the graphics stream 101 being converted to a playout format of HD pillarbox layout 401. With the HD pillarbox layout 401, there is a left cut portion 405a and a right cut portion 405b. Converting the graphics stream 101 can be done on the fly during playout of a broadcast.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> shows a process 501 for converting a HD widescreen display layout into a pillarbox display layout. How exactly the display is affected though depends on if the target display format is in an HD resolution or in a SD resolution. Therefore, it is first determined 505 if the target resolution is an HD resolution or if it is a SD resolution. If a HD display resolution is selected, no scaling 509a is performed. If a SD resolution is desired though, a 4:3 scaling 509b is performed.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">After the scaling step (if necessary), a determination 513a or 513b of the horizontal alignment is made. The determination 513a is used for HD display resolutions, and the determination 513b is used for SD display resolutions. The determination 513a can lead to three outcomes (i.e., outcomes 517a-c). The determination 513b can also lead to three outcomes (i.e., outcomes 517c-e).</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The outcomes 517a-e determine how the graphic 109 is shifted, by a shift amount, as result of the conversion. Outcome 517a (i.e., the outcome for a conversion to HD pillarbox with a left horizontal alignment) moves the area of interest 113, including the graphic 109 to the right so the area of interest 113 (with graphic 109) sits in the left-hand side of the pillarbox area. In this situation, if the area of interest 113 is not moved, then at least a portion of the graphic 109 is cut off in the conversion. Outcome 517b (i.e., the outcome for a conversion to HD pillarbox with a right horizontal alignment) moves the area of interest 113 (including graphic 109) to the left so that the area of interest 113 (with graphic 109) sits in the right-hand side of the pillarbox area. Outcome 517c (i.e., the outcome for a conversion to SD or HD pillarbox with a center horizontal alignment) performs no shift of the area of interest 113. However, for the SD display resolution, the focal portion for scaling (i.e., a conversion area) can be the center of the widescreen area. Outcome 517d (i.e., the outcome for a conversion to SD pillarbox with a left horizontal alignment) shifts the area of interest 113 (with graphic 109) to the right by 5% of the screen width with a conversion area being in the left-hand side of the widescreen area. Outcome 517e (i.e., the outcome for a conversion to SD pillarbox with a right horizontal alignment) shifts area of interest 113 (with graphic 109) to the left by 5% of the screen width with a conversion area being in the right-hand side of the widescreen area.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In some embodiments, scaling 509a is performed for the HD display resolution. And in some embodiments where the target display is a SD resolution, scaling other than 4:3 scaling 509b, is used. For example, other aspect ratios can be used for scaling.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In other embodiments, a safety adjustment option can be used to indicate that the area of interest 113 (with graphic 109) should be shifted by a shift amount during conversion. The safety adjustment option can prevent the graphic 109 from being at the edge of a converted graphics stream and therefore potentially be cut off during the conversion. During conversion, the graphics stream 101 can be<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> repositioned using the safety adjustment option to ensure the graphic 109 is still visible in a converted graphics stream. The shift amount can also be a configurable shift amount. The configurable shift amount can move the area of interest 113 (with graphic 109) farther away from the edge of a converted display. The configurable shift amount can also be used to ensure that the graphic 109 does not get cut off. The configurable shift amount can further be used so that the area of interest 113 (with graphic 109) can be displayed anywhere in a converted graphics stream. The configurable shift amount can be set by a content provider at the time the graphics steam 101 is created or broadcast and is indicated by a script.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref> shows a process 601 for converting into a SD fullscreen display layout or a SD letterbox display layout. In either case, the vertical alignment can affect how the display is altered when converting from a HD widescreen display layout to a SD fullscreen or letterbox display layout. When converting to a SD display layout, different shift amounts can be used depending on the target display format. For example, a fullscreen display may perform different shifting than a letterbox display. If it is determined 605 that a fullscreen display is the target format, a determination 609 must be made to see if the safety adjustment option is active. If it is not, then no shift is performed. However, if it is, a determination 613a is made for the target vertical alignment for the area of interest 113 with graphic 109. Similarly, when formatting for a letterbox display format, a determination 613b is made for the target vertical alignment for the area of interest 113 with graphic 109. The determination 613a can lead to three outcomes (i.e., outcomes 617a-c).

With the safety adjustment option active, the area of interest 705 (including graphic 709) can be shifted both up and to the left. This shift causes the graphic 709 to be moved away from the extreme bottom right corner of the converted graphics stream 701. Shifting can cause graphics to appear more aesthetically pleasing. Shifting can also be done to preserve the intended spacing or presentation that has been augmented or distorted during the conversion process. <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8</figref> shows how the converted graphics stream 701 in a SD fullscreen layout is converted to a SD letterbox layout 801.
