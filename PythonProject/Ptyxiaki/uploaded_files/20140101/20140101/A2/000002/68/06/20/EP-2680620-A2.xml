These phones can now include such functions as personal digital assistant (PDA) capabilities, cameras, Internet access, WiFi access, etc. A number of software applications can be stored and/or run on the mobile devices in the same or similar manner as such applications are run on laptop or desktop computers. Unlike conventional cumbersome computers, the mobility of such phones enables applications that can provide features based on the mobility of such devices.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Some applications can provide location-based features. These features can include navigation systems, identifying locations of a person or object and determining whereabouts of a party. A number of features have been developed for determining and tracking the locations of mobile devices. Nevertheless, location based features have not been fully utilized in current phones. Phones within proximity of a location can receive benefits without being the intended target. A need therefore exists for a system having location based proximity features and methods thereof that overcome those issues described above. These, as well as other related advantages, will be described in the present disclosure.</p><heading id="h0003">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The novel features believed to be characteristic of the disclosure are set forth in the appended claims.

The description sets forth the functions and the sequence of steps for constructing and operating the disclosure in connection with the illustrated embodiments. It is to be understood, however, that the same or equivalent functions and sequences can be accomplished by different embodiments that are also intended to be encompassed within the spirit and scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present disclosure relates to communications, and more particularly, to a system having location based proximity features and methods thereof. The present disclosure describes the system and method, by way of non-limiting examples only, with particular applicability to global positioning systems (GPSs), carrier towers, WiFi markers, triangulation, near field communications (NFCs), radio frequency identification (RFID) or other concepts that can be used to derive location. In an illustrative embodiment, the system can provide communication functions that can be taken advantage of by devices that are proximate to a location. By defining a location and identifying at least one device within range of the location, communication functions can be provided to the at least one device. For example, a voicemail system can be attached to the location and when a participant gets close enough, they can be notified and be given access to a pre-recorded voicemail. The system can also provide a callback feature allowing an originating device to be contacted when another device is detected within range of the defined location.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In other illustrative embodiments, the system can provide location based calling features. A caller can make a call to a geographical location and participants within range of that defined location can answer the call. Conditional callbacks within a geographic area can be used for querying a group of selected parties within a location. The participants can decide to accept the call based on conditions placed by the caller. Ring groups for those participants can be established internally to the system. Participants within a geographic area can also be forwarded a call. Intelligent decision facilities can be part of determining whether to forward the call.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">As shown, a number of attributes can be applicable to the examples described above. Common among the communication functions can be a location point. By way of example, a location point can be a physical GPS location. The location point can be a person or other object that is in motion provided that the person or object reports its location changes such that the "range" can be recalculated with respect to finding candidates. Another common attribute between the communication functions can be that the server coordinating the voice, video, data or chat exchange does not have to provide caller identification or contact information. The server is able to initiate communications without sharing this information between connected parties.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">An exemplary system facilitating location based proximity features will be described in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003"><b>FIGURES 1</b> through <b>3</b></figref><b>.</b> <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005"><b>FIGURES 4</b> through <b>6</b></figref> depict location based voicemails and proximate user notifications through the exemplary system, while <figref idrefs="f0006 f0007"><b>FIGURES 7</b> through <b>9</b></figref> show location based proximate callbacks. <figref idrefs="f0008"><b>FIGURES 10</b> and <b>11</b></figref> illustrate location based calls through the exemplary system. <figref idrefs="f0009"><b>FIGURE 12</b></figref> depicts ring group generation and <figref idrefs="f0009"><b>FIGURE 13</b></figref> shows conditional callbacks. Call forwarding is provided in <figref idrefs="f0010"><b>FIGURES 14</b> and <b>15</b></figref><b>.</b> While these communication functions are described individually, they can be individually implemented or combined as desired.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIGURE 1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary system <b>100</b> for providing location based proximity services in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. The system <b>100</b> can provide at least one of a plurality of communication functions to devices <b>102</b> proximate to a location point <b>108.</b> Devices <b>102</b> within range can communicate with a network <b>104</b> near the location point <b>108.</b> For example, a device <b>102</b> that is located within the geographic area <b>110</b> in range of the location point <b>108</b> can communicate with the network <b>104,</b> while a second device <b>102</b> outside of the geographic area <b>110</b> cannot.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The location point <b>108</b> can be defined as a GPS address, or other coordinate system. The mobile devices <b>102</b> can communicate via a carrier or WiFi to relay their location, which can be obtained from their internal GPS, carrier tower triangulation or WiFi connection. The server <b>106</b> can determine if a mobile device <b>102</b> is in the desired area <b>110</b> of the location point <b>108.</b> This calculation can determine whether or not to trigger functionality. As such, generally, the location point <b>108</b> does not need to provide services to mobile devices <b>102</b> nor is it connected to <b>104.</b> By way of a non-limiting<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> example, the location point <b>108</b> can be a point in the middle of the woods near a cliff, and it can trigger a call between the person and the park ranger so that the park ranger can instruct that person they are in a dangerous area and need to get back onto the path.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Instead of a client-server model as discussed in the present disclosure, communication functions can feature peer-to-peer connections if the users are not "anonymous". As long as contacts in a user's mobile device <b>102</b> report their location, these communication functions can work directly on the device <b>102.</b> Alternately, the user can send their location to their contacts and they can respond with proximity information such that the user does not know their exact location if they do not wish to share it. For example, if the user added a callback on a party so that the user can get a call when the party arrives at the office, the user's phone would request the party's phone to provide a proximity update relative to the party's office. When the party arrives at the office, the user would be alerted. The user can then answer it. The party through the party's phone would be alerted. In this scenario, no server <b>106</b> is involved.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIGURE 2</b></figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary device <b>102</b> for implementing location based proximity services in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.

In this manner, the device <b>102</b> is able to take advantage of services or functionalities of the one or more remote I/O devices.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The device <b>102</b> can also include a power supply <b>218,</b> which can be implemented as one or more batteries, fuel cells, or other sources of electrical power. The power supply <b>218</b> might further include an external power source, such as an AC adapter or a powered docking cradle that supplements or recharges the batteries.

When an originating device <b>102E</b> is configured to accept anonymous callbacks, it can always broadcast its location to the server <b>106,</b> for example, through the network <b>104.</b> Typically, the device <b>102E</b> can send a NULL client identification. In turn, this can trigger the server <b>106</b> to generate a unique identification for the newly discovered client device <b>102F.</b> Similar to specified callbacks, when the client reports its location, the server <b>106</b> can actively scan its callback target zones. However, with anonymous callbacks, callbacks supporting anonymous users are scanned for a match. With specified callbacks, the client identification can be used to search the callbacks applicable to the client.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In some embodiments, each time a client device <b>102F</b> reports its location using the server generated unique identification, it can provide an address to which a response can be sent.

This can provide a brief and temporary return address that the server <b>106</b> can use to contact the client device <b>102F</b> if a callback target zone is matched. Once the server <b>106</b> scans the callback targets and no match is found, this address can be dropped. Typically, the server <b>106</b> does not permanently store the address of a client device <b>102F</b> except the originating device <b>102E.</b></p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The client contact address provided in the location update, in some embodiments, is not the final address used for connecting the call.

The client can then provide its carrier or PBX number. This can allow the client/server connection to be more secure, and optionally employ some form of authentication/encryption.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The unique client identification can simultaneously be used for anonymous and targeted callbacks. This is managed by the server <b>106,</b> which can maintain a list of anonymous callbacks and targeted callbacks. The client identification can be composed such that the server <b>106</b> can identify whether it was generated for anonymous usage or not, such that the anonymous callback list is scanned and the targeted list is scanned. Otherwise the identification can be used for specified callbacks and the anonymous list is not scanned.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The server <b>106</b> can scan the anonymous list using the location point <b>108.</b> The server <b>106</b> can scan the targeted list using the client identification.

Neither party generally knows the location of the other, or their contact information (number, name, etc). This can be controlled by the server <b>106</b> and provide complete security and anonymity. Redial, call logs, etc. typically would not be used to reestablish the call at a later date. The person's name would not be used to find alternate contact information.

The callback can be activated when a qualified target device <b>102F</b> is with range of the originator.

This can imply that a call can be originated between two anonymous users simply by their mutual proximity to a location point <b>108.</b> The system <b>100</b> can be used with social media, dating services, marketing/events and advertising.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064"><figref idrefs="f0008"><b>FIGURE 10</b></figref> is a block diagram for providing illustrative location based calls through the exemplary system <b>100</b> in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. For purposes of illustration, suppose Joe owns a coffee distribution company and supplies many Ottawa companies with their coffee and brewing equipment. One such company has had an equipment malfunction and is in need of an on-site technician to quickly come and fix the problem. Joe can have several technicians employed and at any given time they can be spread out across the city. He is not sure who is closest to the company that is available to take the service call. Using a location based call, Joe can simply request to be connected to the closest available service technician to the company. This can be done by "calling the location" through GPS coordinates and have the system <b>100</b> dynamically resolve the call to a phone number of a proximate individual.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Generally described, the system <b>100</b> can provide the ability to "call a location" and be connected to a person at that location or proximity from the location despite not knowing who that specific individual is when the call is placed.

The caller typically does not know their location. They only know the location they are calling. This can insure privacy and security. Since this uses a "predial resolution" concept, existing telephony concepts such as presence can be employed. For example, the parties who can be reached by location calling can set the presence to denote their availability to receive calls.

The processes can begin at <b>block 1100.</b> In some embodiments, a client interface to a server <b>106</b> that provides a "lookup" for locations that resolve to phone numbers can be provided. The client is not necessarily a separate application. It can be fully integrated into an existing application or service, such as a mobile smart phone that employs GPS and telephony services. The client actively reports its location to the location based directory server <b>106.</b> Clients are capable of querying this server <b>106</b> to obtain phone number based on location information.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">At <b>block 1102,</b> the server <b>106</b> can receive a selected location point <b>108</b> from the calling device <b>102G.</b> The location can be defined through GPS coordinates, carrier location (tower), WiFi location (SSID), Bluetooth® connectivity, some combination or signal triangulation method. The client interface on the device <b>102G</b> is capable of interfacing with a location based application, such as map services. A radius for the location can be determined at <b>block 1104.</b> Depending on what is searched by the client application in connection with the server <b>106,</b> the radius can be calculated. For example, the radius for coffee shops can be smaller than the radius for home furnishing stores based on the number of stores for each out there. Alternatively, the radius can be defined by the client application on the calling device <b>102G.</b></p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Using this interface, a query can be made to a location based number resolution service on the server <b>106</b> at <b>block 1106.</b> The server <b>106</b> can scan the directory and provide a list of numbers in order of proximity to the target location point <b>108.</b> For example, those devices <b>102H, 102I, 102J, 102K</b> or <b>102L</b> within the geographic area <b>110</b> shown in <figref idrefs="f0008"><b>FIGURE 10</b></figref> can be the devices scanned in the directory. Depending on the intelligence of the client application, it can use the first number or provide for a deeper<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> integration by allowing the caller to pull up information (e.g. contact card) for each individual in the target zone. At <b>block 1108,</b> those contacts proximate to the location can be provided to the requesting device <b>102G.</b></p><p id="p0070" num="0070">The server <b>106</b> can utilize local network coverage (e.g. PBX), which can use VoIP clients over 3G/4G/LTE to reach mobile users' extensions across the globe. The server <b>106</b> can also be global in scope, employed by a carrier network <b>104,</b> for example, and using PSTN numbers to provide reachability around the globe. In some embodiments, the client device <b>102H, 102I, 102J, 102K</b> or <b>102L</b> can disable or "opt out" of reporting. When a list of contacts is received, the server <b>106</b> can ping a predefined group to obtain their location and return results at <b>block 1110.</b> The active client location reporting is not required and the contacts can be provided on demand. Connections can be made based on the found devices <b>102H, 102I, 102J, 102K</b> and <b>102L.</b> The processes can end at <b>block 1112.</b></p><p id="p0071" num="0071">In a social media context, calls to anonymous individuals can be made. In this example, the "recipient" can actively report their location, for example, at a local hockey game. Those who are interested in talking to someone at the game can dial the location of the game and be connected to a person willing to participate. This can be useful for marketing and promotions. For example, consider a telephony based "Where's Waldo" game, where a radio host has prizes to give away to the first person who figures out where they are. Participants can think of the correct spot based on clues and dial the location (represented as location point <b>108)</b> to see if they can connect to the radio host. Furthermore, if the conversation was to end abruptly or on a sour note, the other party would have no way of contacting that person as the parties were connected through temporary identifications.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">In some embodiments, calling a location can be integrated into a customer relations management system for service or sales organizations to get their employees to the affected customer quickly and efficiently. Calls can be video or audio in nature. For example, a consumer can call a location point <b>108</b> where the problem is occurring so they can get to the closest employee for assistance.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">Generation of ring groups can be an extension to those concepts described above particularly when a set of contacts are desired. For purposes of illustration, suppose John wishes to make a call to a taxi proximate to a given location, whereby taxis within<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> the area constitute an unknown group of individuals within the vicinity of a defined area. The first taxi answering can get business from John. To make sure John is picked up in a timely fashion, a priority ring group can be created. Higher priorities can be given to the most proximate taxis with decreasing priorities given to those taxis extending outward from John's location.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">Advantageously, the system <b>100</b> provides for the ability to "dial a location" and set a proximity, i.e. a range from the location point <b>108,</b> that the ring group encompasses. The server <b>106</b> can provide the ability for parties to automatically be incorporated into the ring group based on their proximity to the target location. If there are no proximate users, the call can go to voicemail or a callback can be left.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">Generally described, individuals within a pre-defined range of a location can dynamically constitute a ring group. When a location point <b>108</b> is dialed, parties within the ring group can be notified simultaneous, through priority or cascading. <figref idrefs="f0009"><b>FIGURE 12</b></figref> is a flow chart depicting illustrative processes for ring group generation in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. The processes can begin at <b>block 1200.</b></p><p id="p0076" num="0076">At <b>block 1202,</b> the system <b>100</b> can promote inclusion of devices <b>102</b> into a ring group. The method of defining the ring group can vary and be dependent on a subject matter of the ring group. For example, the subject matter of the ring group can be based on the "amount of sales", "color of car" and "amount of purchases". Other subject matters can distinguish the ring groups. For purposes of illustration, consider a typical radio show, where users qualify for a trip each week, and after several months of qualifiers, the grand winner can be selected. After the event, the ring group can receive willingness of the devices <b>102</b> to enter at <b>block 1204.</b> These qualifiers can form a dynamic ring group and the radio host can dial a single number. The first person to answer can be the winner. The ring group can be stored in the server <b>106</b> where it can be accessed by calling devices or the like. The processes can end at <b>block 1206.</b></p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Ring groups can depend on a set of individuals actively broadcasting their willingness to participate in a ring group. In some embodiments, this broadcast can consist of providing their location and contact information. The mobile contact information can be withheld for security reasons and provided when required to complete a call.<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --></p><p id="p0078" num="0078">As described above, the system <b>100</b> can include a centralized server <b>106</b> to track location of individuals and provide the ring group service. Typically, a client server model is used within the system <b>100.</b> A peer-to-peer connection can also be used. A client who wishes to make contact with any particular individual can dial the location and range. This dialing can be done via a web interface or directly from a device <b>102G</b> using a GPS or web based mapping system. When the request comes into the server <b>106,</b> the server <b>106</b> can scan for a list of clients in the specified range from the location. Standard ring group functionalities can then be invoked. Differing rules can be applied by configuration or by the originator to define priority, such as giving higher priority to individuals closest to the target location point <b>108.</b></p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Generally, the rules formulated for the ring group, after being generated, can change inside the ring group as the number of qualified targets expands or contracts. Rules can change inside the ring group based on social media information, for example, giving preference to individuals who match an entry in their personal contacts such as friends or family. So long as the method of grouping can provide input into the system <b>100,</b> a ring group can be created with a unique identifier. This identifier can be dynamically populated into a user's phone.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">A ring group can be ad-hoc and defined via clients reporting their location. The ring group can extend in a radius from the target. The order in which the group is placed can depend on proximity to the location point <b>108.</b> VoIP clients with 3G/4G/LTE and public/private wireless can be used to extend coverage to outside the typical corporate location.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">In one scenario, a person can call a location of a party and mobile devices <b>102H, 102I, 102J, 102K</b> and <b>102L</b> of their friends will be alerted. In another instance, an individual's phone that has opted in for anonymous calls will ring. In either case the person is able to connect to an individual and discuss what is happening.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">Ring group generation and priorities for parties associated with the ring group, as discussed in <figref idrefs="f0009"><b>FIGURE 12</b></figref><b>,</b> can depend on their distance from the location point <b>108.</b> The target of the ring group can be transient, such that the target location changes over time. For example, John can set a ring group around a person, Jane, such that targeted individuals within 1 kilometer of that person can ring. The calling device <b>102G</b> can<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> initiate a call to the ring group using software resident on the device <b>102G</b> to control the inclusion of contact in the ring group and the ring group model.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">Conditional callbacks can be used within location calling. Typically, a conditional callback is a delayed mechanism that prompts a user for information or acceptance before initiating connectivity. The system <b>100</b> is able to facilitate a conditional offer and if an agreement is met or there is interest, a callback can be triggered, that is, the condition is fulfilled. For purposes of illustration, supposed John is in a pub and would like a taxi home. John can use a location based callback, as described earlier. However, if John is not interested in a specific cab or contact, John can query an anonymous audience in his selected area <b>110.</b> John can have $25, and if a cab is willing to take him for that amount, a connection can be made between him and that cab. As such, John can place a "context" around a callback and define the acceptance criteria.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">When a conditional query is made, a variety of devices <b>102H, 102I, 102J, 102K</b> and <b>102L</b> around the location point <b>108</b> within a range can be targeted. A person accepting offers can enter the area and be notified of John's message. When they can reject it, nothing occurs. They can also read the message and reject it and nothing occurs. They can read the message and accept it and the callback can be triggered so that the parties can arrange an exchange of service. This can be a "bi-directional" service, implying that a business can offer services or a consumer can request services. For example, "I'd like a ride to downtown for $30<sub>"</sub> can be left by a consumer waiting at the bus station. Likewise, a snow plow operator could offer "In your area now - $15 for your driveway", to attract patrons in his proximity who could help fill in gaps in his service schedule.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">As another illustration, John can have two tickets to a game for $50 on a first come first serve bases. A message can be sent to co-workers in the vicinity, without advanced knowledge of their phone numbers. Those present in the vicinity can get the message and can reply. Conditional callbacks can combine advantages of two communication models, while being able to target a non specified group of users.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Generally described, conditional proximity callbacks can be provided where the callback originator requests information or poses a question. When a target provides an acceptable answer, the callback can be activated placing both parties in communication with each other through the system <b>100.</b> The callback can terminate<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> after initial acceptance, or remain active until some other terminating condition is met. Advantageously, the system <b>100</b> can address a proximate audience to offer or request a service and provide an ordered queuing model by virtue of traditional call signaling models.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">A callback can persist as long as a "poster" is in the area or the callback can be terminated after a first connection. Typically, there is no binding agreement between the parties. The server <b>106</b> can block caller identifications such that even after activation of the callback, the numbers of both parties remains anonymous. The callback service generally does not divulge the contact information of the callback initiator insuring privacy. A conditional callback can terminate based on an originator's location. For example, an initial query can be sent "Does anyone need anything at the store while I am here." A callback can automatically terminate when the originator of the callback leave the store since they are no longer capable of providing this service.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">The conditional callback service can provide a method for an "opt in" communication that starts with a non specified message to many potential targets in a non-real time fashion, but results in the creation of a real-time communication path upon callback maturation/acceptance. The system <b>100</b> can include a location detection component, a location tracking server, a client application component, and the conditional callback component. The location detection component is capable of determining the geographical area <b>110</b> of the device <b>102G</b> hosting the client application. This can employ a carrier, WiFi, Bluetooth®, RFID, NFC, or GPS technologies, or any combination thereof, to determine a location.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">The client application can be responsible for reporting the location of the client device <b>102H, 102I, 102J, 102K</b> or <b>102L,</b> and its contact identifier, to the location tracking server <b>106.</b> The client application can obtain the client location by reading it from the location detection component. It provides the location and the contact identifier to the location tracking server <b>106.</b> The location tracking server <b>106</b> can store the location and contact identity of clients that support this feature. Given a location point <b>108</b> and range, the server <b>106</b> can determine clients within the specified coverage zone.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090"><figref idrefs="f0009"><b>FIGURE 13</b></figref> is a flow chart depicting illustrative processes for providing conditional callbacks in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. The<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> processes can begin at <b>block 1300.</b> In addition to location reporting, the client application can be capable of creating a conditional callback. This is done by accessing the client application, selecting a target location point <b>108,</b> defining the range (coverage area <b>110)</b>, offering or requesting a service and optionally setting the lifespan of the callback (which may be chronological, location based or other).</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">For example, the mobile device's map can be selected. The user can then press the location of his work on the map, which causes a list of options to appear. One of these is "Set conditional callback". The user can select this and is prompted for the condition. At <b>block 1302,</b> the conditions can be received. The user can enter "On my way home - does anyone need a drive to Kanata?". He can then ask for a range around the location point <b>108,</b> which can be defaulted to 100 meters, for example. He is also asked for a termination condition and he selects "Departure from area" from a predefined list of option. A custom option can be provided for him. An interface can be provided that allows him to select a map and get a list of options. The interface can also include options for "call", "set callback", "set conditional callback", "subscribe for location calls", and so forth. This can be applicable to other communication functions described herein and not just conditional callbacks.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">The client application can send the conditional callback information to the "conditional callback component" on the server <b>106</b> at <b>block 1304.</b> The server <b>106</b> can be responsible for managing the callback. Using the location and range, the applicable coverage area <b>110</b> can be provided to the location tacking server <b>106</b> and a list of contacts can be provided. The callback server <b>106</b> can send the conditional message to contact identifiers through their phone numbers. This list can be received by the device <b>102G</b> at <b>block 1306.</b></p><p id="p0093" num="0093">While the callback is active, the callback server <b>106</b> can periodically poll the location server <b>106</b> for an updated list to identify newcomers such that they can also receive notification. In addition to periodically polling the location server <b>106,</b> notifications can also be re-sent on the same location polling interval. At <b>block 1308,</b> the conditional message can be sent to the identified contacts.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">For clients that receive notifications, an option can be provided to accept, decline, or delay the condition. Declining can update the callback server <b>106</b> to prevent further transmission of messages to that client. Delaying typically does nothing and can cause<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> the server <b>106</b> to send the notification again at the next broadcast interval. Accepting can trigger the callback between the parties. If the callback server <b>106</b> receives a message that a target has declined, their entry can be marked in the list such that it does not receive the notification again. This can be persistent for the life of the callback, implying that if the specific client leaves the target zone and returns, they are not sent another notification.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">In some embodiments, if the callback server <b>106</b> receives a message that a target has accepted, it can provide the accepting parties contact identification to the originator. The originating device <b>102G</b> can then dial the accepting party. A call routing component (PBX, carrier) can provide the accepting client contact identification and the callback originator contact identification and a connection can be made. This can insure no party is directly provided the contact information.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">In some embodiments, the server <b>106</b> within the system <b>100</b> can provide privacy for callbacks so that the call routing component does not provide caller identifications or other methods of end user identification. The callback originator can have the final say as to whether or not to accept the callback activation. Depending on the conditions set when the callback was created, the callback server <b>106</b> can choose to clear the callback entry. For example, if the termination/expiration condition was "first acceptance", then the callback can expire after the first callback occurs. When the expiration condition is "departure from area", then the callback can expire once the originator leaves the vicinity. Using the previous example, once the callback originator leaves the office, the callback is terminated since they are no longer able or willing to take others home once they have left the office. The processes can end at <b>block 1310.</b></p><p id="p0097" num="0097">A number of variations for conditional callbacks can be provided. Conditional callbacks can be incorporated into collaborative work environments or social media tools. While the embodiments presented focused on telephony, it can use chat, email, video or other forms and models of communication. In retail sales, conditional callbacks can provide the ability to offer sales/services to local individuals. Advertising can be offered to a targeted area. Radio contests can be implemented and provide the ability to select an area of the city, pose a question and award a first caller who provides a correct answer.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098"><figref idrefs="f0010"><b>FIGURE 14</b></figref> is a block diagram for providing illustrative call forwarding to a proximate device <b>102P</b> through the exemplary system <b>100</b> in accordance with one or more<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> aspects of the present disclosure. For purposes of illustration, suppose John has a device <b>102N</b> and is busy or on a call and is unable to take other calls. Jane, who is a friend, can be sitting across from John in the pub and can take the call if it were from a mutual friend. Jim, a coworker, traveling with John on a business trip can also take the call if it was work related or from a fellow work colleague. A forwarding solution which is cognizant of John's proximate contacts and their association (friend, family, coworker) can make intelligent forwarding decisions.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">In the above illustration, call forwarding was implemented when John was busy. Call forwarding can also be extended to scenarios where he is not busy. For example, "force forward to a proximate contact" can allow John to forward an alerting call to another proximate person. In addition to forwarding to an individual in proximity, the system <b>100</b> can equally offer the ability to forward the call to an individual in proximity to the originator of the call. For example, in a sales environment where a customer is calling to request a specific service, the call can be forwarded immediately to a colleague who is just around the corner from them and in a better position to visit the customer. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0010"><b>FIGURE 14</b></figref><b>,</b> calls can be forwarded that originate from device <b>102M.</b> The sever <b>106</b> can provide the intelligent selection or the device <b>102N</b> forwarding the call can perform decision making processes as well.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">Advantageously, call forwarding can allow another device <b>102P</b> to handle a call. Other forms of communication can be used as well such as text. The system <b>100</b> can allow the forwarding number to change as people move around in their daily routines/roles, independent of time or specific user location. Contacts that are proximate to the called device <b>102N</b> can be filtered based on contact class and the class of the caller. The scope of proximity can be limited to the immediate vicinity or within a larger scope. Forwarding can occur to contacts proximate to the recipient of the call or to called party contacts that are proximate to the originator of the call. Forwarding and re-routing decisions can be based on the peer or a centralized call control that is proximity aware.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">Generally described, calls can be forwarded to a proximate contact. Proximity can be defined as the vicinity surrounding the recipient of the call or the vicinity surround the originator of the call, depending on the business situation or nature of the call. A forwarding address selection component, a proximity service and a call routing component can be provided. An alternative component can resolve a caller<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> identification to a location.

The forwarding component can then apply policy, contact classifications or other criteria to select an appropriate proximate contact at <b>block 1508.</b></p><p id="p0104" num="0104">At <b>block 1510,</b> the call can be forwarded to the selected contact, that is, device <b>102P.</b> When forwarding a call to a contact in proximity to the call recipient, the native contacts or centralized contacts can be queried to determine a list of proximate contacts. Additional policies can be applied, such as social grouping (friend, family, coworker, team members) to sort the list from pure proximity based to more role/function based. The corresponding match can then have the call forwarded to them. As with traditional call forwarding, a number of configuration options can exist to enable/disable/trigger the forwarding. The processes can end at <b>block 1512.</b></p><p id="p0105" num="0105">As described above, a number of policies can be used to forward the call. When the caller's location can be determined, the same process can be used to carry out forwarding to a contact that is proximate to the location of the caller. The forwarding address selection component can populate with addresses of contacts in proximity to the caller, rather than those in proximity to the called party. If the caller is not a known contact, the calling party identification, phone number, can be used to request location information from the network server <b>106.</b> This information can be compared to that location with that of a known individual that can accept the call.<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --></p><p id="p0106" num="0106">When the caller does not provide location based information to the network service, and other options to obtain location are not suitable, call forwarding in some embodiments is not available. However, if the location point <b>108</b> can be determined, a list of proximate contacts can be provided to the forwarding selection component. By default the closest device <b>102P</b> can be selected or additional policies can cause the forwarding component to pick the closest contact based on class association. If the caller is not recognized, it is possible on dual-mode phones to classify the call based on the number dialed, for example, if it is a work extension, it can be forwarded to the closest work contact. Numerous methods to classify and select the best proximate contact can be applied.</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">In the case where the calling party and called party share similar contacts, the forwarding selection component can determine if the caller is a shared contact and select proximity forwarding to a contact which shares a mutual trust. In either forwarding model, if the proximity is beyond a practical range, the call can be forwarded to voicemail or typical forms of forwarding can be applied. Forwarding can occur on demand, on no answer, on busy, on call originator location, on call destination location or on some other external decision based on dynamic or static data, for example, call forwarding to an employee with nothing scheduled in their electronic calendar. Multiple forms of communication can be forwarded.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">The data structures and code, in which the present disclosure can be implemented, can typically be stored on a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium.
