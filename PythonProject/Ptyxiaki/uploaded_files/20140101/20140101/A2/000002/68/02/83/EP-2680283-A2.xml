As a method of manufacturing the circular coil described above, a winding apparatus for winding a wire for a coil around a core having a circular cross section is known (<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP9148168A"><text>JP1997-148168A</text></patcit>). In the winding apparatus, the wire wound around the core into a coil shape is removed from the core to obtain the circular coil having a desired diameter.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In recent years, a speaker having an oval or oblong cross section is often used as the speaker to be used for the small-sized devices. For the speaker having the oval or oblong cross section, a non-circular coil having an oblong, oval, or ellipsoidal cross section is used.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">When the non-circular coil is manufactured by using the conventional winding apparatus, there is required a step of winding the wire around a core having an oblong, oval, or ellipsoidal cross section and removing a coil obtained by winding the wire from the core. In the conventional winding<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> apparatus described above, the wire is wound around the core under a predetermined tension. Therefore, an operation of removing the non-circular coil formed by winding the wire from the core becomes relatively difficult. In order to facilitate the removal of the non-circular coil, a wire guide is used to remove the coil from the core in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP9148168A"><text>JP 1997-148168A</text></patcit>. If the wire guide is brought into abutment against an end of the coil to forcibly remove the coil from the core, however, a predetermined tension is exerted to slide a surface coating of the wire on an inner circumference of the coil against the core. Therefore, there is a fear of damage to the coating.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The core having the oblong or oval cross section has straight-line portions, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 19. FIG. 19</figref> illustrates a cross section of a core 3 having an oval cross section. When a wire 2 is wound around the core 3 having the straight-line portions, a force for pressing the wire 2 against the straight-line portions of the core 3 is not generated even when a predetermined tension F is applied in a longitudinal direction of the wire 2, as indicated by the arrow in solid line. Therefore, when the wire 2 is wound to form a plurality of turns on the straight-line portions, the wire 2 is spaced away from the straight-line portions to bulge as indicated by arrows in broken lines without being held in contact with the straight-line portions of the core 3 by a contact resistance with the adjacent turn of the wire 2. As a result, it becomes difficult to obtain a coil having a desired shape.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and a method for manufacturing a non-circular coil, which enable a coil to be relatively easily removed from a core without damaging a coating of a wire.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and a method for manufacturing a non-circular coil, which enable a wire to<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> be wound without a bulge to obtain a coil having a desired shape.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to one aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for manufacturing a non-circular coil, comprises a pair of swinging pieces having base ends supported swingably and distal ends with a distance therebetween being increasable or reducible, an operation piece to be inserted and removed from between the distal ends of the pair of swinging pieces to increase or reduce the distance between the distal ends of the pair of swinging pieces, and a winding mechanism for winding a wire around an outer circumference of a distal end of the pair of swinging pieces with the distance therebetween being enlarged by the insertion of the operation piece so as to form a non-circular coil, wherein side surfaces of the operation piece, which avoid contact with the pair of swinging pieces, bulge outward to be curved and are formed so as to be continuous with outer circumferential surfaces of the pair of swinging pieces, around which the wire is wound, in a state in which the operation piece is inserted between the distal ends of the pair of swinging pieces.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to another aspect of the present invention, a method of manufacturing a non-circular coil, comprises an enlarging step of inserting an operation piece between distal ends of a pair of swinging pieces having base ends supported swingably and the distal ends with a distance therebetween being increasable or reducible so as to enlarge the distance between the distal ends of the pair of swinging pieces, a winding step of winding a wire around an outer circumference of a distal end of the pair of swinging pieces with the distance therebetween being enlarged by the insertion of the operation piece so as to form a non-circular coil, a reducing step of pulling out the operation piece from between the pair of swinging<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> pieces to reduce the distance between the distal ends of the pair of swinging pieces, around which the non-circular coil is formed, and a coil-removing step of removing the non-circular coil from the reduced outer circumference of the distal end of the pair of swinging pieces, wherein side surfaces of the operation piece, which avoid contact with the pair of swinging pieces, bulge outward to be curved and are formed so as to be continuous with outer circumferential surfaces of the pair of swinging pieces, around which the wire is wound, in a state in which the operation piece is inserted between the distal ends of the pair of swinging pieces.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the accompanying drawings:

A core 24 is provided to the first rotary body 26 so as to pass through a center axis thereof.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The core 24 is a bar-like member having a circular cross section. A base member 21 having a columnar shape is provided to a distal end of the core 24 so as to be coaxial therewith. A concave portion 26c (<figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>), in which the base member 21 is received, is formed on the large-diameter portion 26a of the first rotary body 26. The small-diameter portion 26b is formed so as to have a larger outer diameter than that of the core 24 which is provided coaxially with the base member 21. The core 24 is spline-coupled to the first rotary body 26, and is movable in the longitudinal direction relative to the first rotary body 26.

Therefore, the clearance is generated between the outer circumference of the distal end of the pair of swinging pieces 22 and 23 and the inner circumference of the non-circular coil 90. Thus, the surface coating on the inner circumference of the non-circular coil 90 and the outer circumference of the distal end of the pair of swinging pieces 22 and 23 are prevented from significantly slide against each other. Accordingly, even when the non-circular coil 90 is formed<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> directly on the outer circumference of the pair of swinging pieces 22 and 23, the non-circular coil 90 can be relatively easily removed from the pair of swinging pieces 22 and 23 without damaging the coating of the wire 18.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">In the embodiment described above, the case where the sectional shape of the pair of swinging pieces 22 and 23 having the increased distance between the distal ends by the insertion of the operation piece 31 is ellipsoidal and the obtained non-circular coil 90 has the ellipsoidal shape has been described. However, the sectional shape of the pair of swinging pieces 22 and 23 having the increased distance by the insertion of the operation piece 31 may be any shape as long as the side surfaces 31d and 31e of the operation piece 31 inserted between the distal ends of the swinging pieces 22 and 23 bulge outward to be curved and are formed so as to be continuous with the outer circumferential surfaces of the swinging pieces 22 and 23 so that the sectional shape does not have a straight-line portion as a whole. For example, the sectional shape of the pair of swinging pieces 22 and 23 may be a rounded square.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">In the embodiment described above, the case where the insertion/removal mechanism 40 for moving the pair of swinging pieces 22 and 23 together with the first rotary body 26 so that the operation piece 31 is inserted and removed from between the distal ends of the swinging pieces 22 and 23 has been described. However, the insertion/removal mechanism 40 may have any configuration as long as the operation piece 31 is inserted and removed from between the distal ends of the swinging pieces 22 and 23. For example, the insertion/removal mechanism 40 may have a configuration for moving the operation piece 31 in the axial direction.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">Embodiments of this invention were described above, but the above<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> embodiments are merely examples of applications of this invention, and the technical scope of this invention is not limited to the specific constitutions of the above embodiments.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">An apparatus for manufacturing a non-circular coil, includes a pair of swinging pieces, an operation piece to be inserted and removed from between the distal ends of the pair of swinging pieces to increase or reduce the distance between the distal ends of the pair of swinging pieces, and a winding mechanism for winding a wire around an outer circumference of a distal end of the pair of swinging pieces so as to form a non-circular coil, wherein side surfaces of the operation piece, which avoid contact with the pair of swinging pieces, bulge outward to be curved and are formed so as to be continuous with outer circumferential surfaces of the pair of swinging pieces, around which the wire is wound, in a state in which the operation piece is inserted between the distal ends of the pair of swinging pieces.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56976338" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An apparatus for manufacturing a non-circular coil, comprising:
