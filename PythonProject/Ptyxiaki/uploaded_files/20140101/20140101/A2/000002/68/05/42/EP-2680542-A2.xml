Domain names, which employ text characters, such as letters, numbers, and hyphens (e.g., "www.example.com"), will often be easier to remember than IP addresses, which are numerical and do not contain letters or hyphens (e.g., "128.1.0.0"). The DNS is the Internet's hierarchical lookup service for mapping character-based domain names meaningful to humans into numerical IP addresses.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Domains exist at various different "levels" within the DNS hierarchy. For example, a generic top level domain (gTLD), such as .COM or .NET, is a domain at the highest level in the DNS hierarchy. Another type of TLD is a country-code top level domain (ccTLD) such as, for example, .UK. A second-level domain (SLD) is a subdomain of a TLD (including gTLD and ccTLD), which is directly below the TLD in the DNS hierarchy. For example, .COM is the TLD and EXAMPLE is the SLD for the domain name "www.example.com."<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Registries manage the domain names of each TLD. For example, Verisign is a well-known registry, and it manages the .COM and .NET TLDs. To maintain a domain name in accordance with current regulations mandated by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the registry responsible for a TLD is required to maintain a certain minimum amount of information associated with the domain name to ensure proper identification, security features, and operability associated with the domain name. For example, all domain registrants are required to make available to the registry or the registrar their current administrative contact information. Also, in order for a domain name to work correctly, the registry must have nameserver information for the domain name to load into the registry's TLD DNS system to refer outside DNS requests to the proper authoritative DNS servers. Other information could include the registrar through which the domain name's registration took place, the registration date, the expiration date, and the status of the domain name.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Domain name registration is the process by which a "registrant" (typically an individual user or an organization) can reserve or lease the use of a domain name for a specified period of time from the date of registration. The registrant may reserve the domain name for at least one year but may reserve the domain name for up to ten years. Domain names are reserved through domain "registrars." Registrars are entities having business relationships with domain "registries," which control the domain names and maintain a domain name database for a particular TLD. Thus, a <i>registrar</i> provides the interface by which a <i>registrant</i> can reserve or lease a domain name from a <i>registry.</i> The<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> registry manages the reserved names and available names for a particular TLD and makes available certain information to the registrar through the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP). Registrars that are authorized by the registry have the ability to make reservations and check the status of domain names through the EPP. The registry provides the EPP as a communications gateway to Registrars for such purposes.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In a typical domain name registration example, a registrant may want to reserve the domain name "example.com." The registrant would contact a registrar that has a business relationship with the registry that operates the .COM TLD. For example, the company GoDaddy is a known registrar, and the company Verisign is a known registry. The registrant would query the registrar as to the availability of the domain name "example" in the .COM namespace. The registrar in turn would query the proper Registry for the .COM TLD through the EPP, and then return the results to the registrant. The Registrant may then obtain a registration of the domain name by paying a registration fee and providing information required by the registry and registrar. The registry charges the registrar for the domain name registration and the registrar collects the registration fee from the registrant.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In addition to the traditional TLDs (e.g., .COM and .NET), the domain name system and domain name registration system have also evolved to allow the use of new generic TLDs (gTLDs), which may be applied for from the regulatory body pertaining to registries and registrars, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Some of these gTLDs are often<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> referred to as "vanity" or "brand" domains, such as .MICROSOFT or .COCACOLA. ICANN also allows for "community-based" TLDs, such as .BANK or .HOTEL, and "geographic" TLDs, such as .AFRICA. Other TLDs may be contemplated by ICANN.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The creation and administration of a new TLD requires several changes to be made at a registry, at one or more registrars, and at a variety of other services, such as Whois. The Whois server typically stores and provides domain registration information, such as registration date, expiration date, status, and owner of the registered domain names. The Whois server provides a service that can be queried by users via, for example, a website on the Internet provided by a registrar or registry or via standard Telnet-like clients. With ICANN's new gTLD program for new gTLDs, hundreds of new gTLDS are expected to be created over the next few years. Registries for the new gTLDs must provide Whois services for all of them. However, creating a separate Whois service for each new gTLD is cost prohibitive and does not scale.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Thus, there exists a need in the art to automatically provide a Whois service upon the creation and provisioning of a new TLD with minimal manual intervention from registry administrative users.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary</u></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">In accordance with an embodiment, a method for establishing a top level domain may be provided. The method may comprise receiving domain data related to a top level domain (TLD) at a first computer system. The domain data may be assigned a network address of a second computer system.

Each port may be assigned (or "mapped") to, and therefore authoritative for, multiple TLDs at once.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a table providing an example of the port and network address mappings in Whois server 106 for processing Whois queries relating to a set of TLDs, consistent with the disclosed embodiments. In one embodiment, ports may be used to map TLDs to Whois server 106 for carrying out the disclosed methods. In other embodiments, other network addresses may be used, such as IP addresses or HTTP addresses. The table of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates that the TLD .IBM may be associated with port 1943. Port 1943 is therefore the authoritative port for .IBM, but may serve as the authoritative port for other TLDs. The table further illustrates that the TLD .MICROSOFT may be associated with port 1944. Port 1944 is therefore the authoritative port for .MICROSOFT, but may serve as the authoritative port for other TLDs. The table finally illustrates that the TLD .AFRICA may be associated with port 1945, making port 1945 the authoritative port for the .AFRICA TLD. While the embodiments discussed herein pertain to port mappings, the disclosure is not so limited and may include mapping to other network addresses, such as IP addresses or HTTP addresses.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The table further illustrates that each TLD may be associated with a network address. In one embodiment, the network address may include IP addresses 10.175.151.114 for .IBM and .MICROSOFT and 10.175.151.115 for .AFRICA. Other network address protocols may be used, such as HTTP.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> further illustrates that domain features defined by registry 102 or third party 136 when creating a new TLD may include an identifier indicating whether personal contact information of domain name registrants will be public or private. In one embodiment, a subset of TLDs may keep more personal contact information private, such as registrants' addresses and telephone numbers, than other TLDs. For example, the TLDs may include an identifier of "True" or "False" indicating whether personal data of registrants will be shared. When a Whois query is received relating to a domain name of a TLD with the identifier marked "False," the response to the query may include information such as the domain name, the nameserver, the registrar, the registration date, the expiration date, and the status of the domain name. However, when a Whois query is received for a domain name of a TLD with the identifier marked "True," the response may include any of the above features, and may also include the registrant's name, address, or other identifying contact information. In other embodiments, different methods may be used for indicating whether the personal contact information is allowed to be shared for a particular TLD, such as indicating whether the TLD is "thick" or "thin."</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Thus, in the example of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, if Whois server 106 receives a query for "example.africa," it may not provide to user 104 a response that includes contact information regarding the registrant. If Whois server 106, however, receives a query for "example.ibm" or "example.microsoft," it may provide the registrant's contact information to user 104 because .IBM and .MICROSOFT may allow Whois server 106 to publically share personal contact<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> information. In other embodiments, Whois server 106 may act as a premium Whois service and may provide contact information if user 104 has valid identification information using a password-protected web interface or is a preauthorized source, as discussed below as to <figref idrefs="f0007 f0008">FIGs. 7-8</figref>.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart an exemplary method 400 for providing Whois services to a TLD, consistent with the disclosed embodiments. In one embodiment, the Whois service may be provided by Whois server 106 (<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>). In step 402, registry 102 or third party 136 assigns, to a new TLD, an authoritative port in Whois server 106. For example, registry 102 may assign port 1944 to .MICROSOFT (<figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">FIGs. 2-3</figref>). Alternatively, third party 136 may request registry 102 to assign a unique Whois service to a port that is not shared with other TLDs. In this embodiment, registry 102 may allocate a separate port to that TLD, which may provide a unique Whois service to that TLD. In one embodiment, for example, registry 102 may assign port 1945 to .AFRICA if third party 136 manages the .AFRICA TLD. In other embodiments, registry 102 may assign an authoritative port in Whois server 106 to an existing TLD. For example, registry 102 may assign port 1945 (<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>) to the .COM TLD.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In step 404, registry 102 may provision the TLD in one or more registry databases 134. In one embodiment, provisioning may include at least setting up a DNS service and the Whois service for the TLD. Setting up the Whois service may include assigning a default port of Whois server 106 to the TLD, such as port 1943. Thus, a TLD may be provisioned without being assigned an authoritative port. In other embodiments, provisioning may include<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> at least adding the TLD to one or more registry databases 134 and allowing registrars to transact with registry 102 for that TLD. For example, registry 102 may have multiple databases supporting multiple TLDs. In one embodiment, registry 102 may have three databases, one supporting gTLDs, one supporting ccTLDs, and one supporting vanity TLDs. Each database may support more than one TLD. In other embodiments, third party 136 may provision the TLD in one or more databases 146.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In step 406, Whois server 106 may acquire data regarding the TLD from registry database 134 or third party database 146 and store it in database 126 of Whois server 106. For example, Whois server 106 may extract the TLD, its authoritative port, and its network address, and use that information to populate database 126. In one embodiment, Whois server 106 may replicate the data in registry database 134 in database 126. For example, Whois server 106 may copy the data stored in the table in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> from registry database 134 to database 126. In other embodiments, registry 102 or third party 136 may push data to database 126 of Whois server 106.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In step 408, Whois server 106 may begin to serve the new gTLD with the Whois service. For example, in step 410, Whois server 106 processes queries received for domain name registrations of the new gTLD, according to the methods described below (<figref idrefs="f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008">FIGs. 5-8</figref>).</p><p id="p0040" num="0040"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart for an exemplary method 500 for responding to Whois queries, consistent with the disclosed embodiments. In step 502, Whois server 106 may receive a query from user 104 at one of ports 1943, 1944,<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> 1945, or 1946 (<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>). For example, user 104 may access the Whois service provided by Whois server 106 via the Internet 150 or via Whois interface 120 and may query for "example.microsoft" at port 1943. In step 504, Whois server 106 may evaluate the query to determine which port is authoritative for the queried TLD. In this example, Whois server 106 may determine that, according to the data stored in database 126, port 1944 is the authoritative port for the queried TLD .MICROSOFT (<figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>).</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In step 506, Whois server 106 may compare the port receiving the query (e.g., 1943) to the authoritative port (e.g., 1944). Whois server 106 may determine whether the two ports match in step 508. If they do not match, Whois server 106 may reject the query in step 510. Rejecting the query may include sending a response to user 104 indicating that the query is rejected. For example, the response may include a message, such as "No Match Found," even though the queried information may exist in database 126.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">If the ports do match, Whois server 106 may search database 126 for the queried information (step 512). For example, if user 104 queried for "example.microsoft" at port 1944 (<figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>), in step 512 Whois server 106 may search for the queried information in database 126. For example, user 104 may request, and Whois server 106 may search for, objects relating to the queried TLD, such as the domain name, the nameserver, the registrar, the registration date, the expiration date, and the status of the domain name. Whois server 106 may also search for other objects, such as registrant's personal contact information.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In step 514, Whois server 106 may return the objects of the query to user 104. In one embodiment, Whois server 106 may return objects associated only with the authoritative TLD. For example, if user 104 queries for the registration date of "example.microsoft" at port 1944 (<figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>), Whois server 106 may return information relating only to the .MICROSOFT TLD. In contrast, if user 104 queries for the registration date of "example.microsoft" at port 1943, Whois server 106 may not return any information regarding the .MICROSOFT TLD (step 510).</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In other embodiments, the objects returned in the response may depend on whether Whois server 106 is allowed to disclose personal contact information for the queried TLD. For example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, Whois server 106 may be allowed to publically disclose personal contact information of registrants of the .MICROSOFT TLD. As a result, in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, if user 104 queried Whois server 106 for the name and address of the registrant of "example.microsoft," Whois server 106 may provide (step 514) a response to user 104 with the requested objects (i.e., the registrant's name and address). If, however, user 104 queried Whois server 106 for the name and address of the registrant of "example.africa" (<figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>), Whois server 106 may not provide the requested objects in a response to user 104. Whois server 106 may, however, return other objects in response to user 104's query regarding "example.africa," such as the nameserver, the registrar, the registration date, the expiration date, and the status of the domain name.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0045" num="0045"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart of an exemplary method 600 for updating the Whois data for providing Whois services to a TLD, consistent with the disclosed embodiments. In step 602, Whois server 106 may perform an accuracy check of the information in database 126. In one embodiment, Whois server 106 may perform an accuracy check of the information in database 126 based on a predetermined duration, such as every 10 seconds. Other durations may be used. In step 604, Whois server 106 may determine whether the Whois data in database 126 is current.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">If the information is current, in step 606, Whois server 106 may end the process. If the information is not current, in step 608, Whois server 106 may determine that the data in database 126 needs to be updated. In one embodiment, Whois server 106 may update database 126 with the current information. For example, Whois server 106 may update the port mapping of a particular TLD if the authoritative port has changed. In other embodiments, Whois server 106 may update database 126 with information stored in other databases, such as registry database 134. For example, Whois server 106 may determine that registry 102 has assigned a new authoritative port, port 1946, to the .MICROSOFT TLD, instead of port 1944 (<figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">FIGs. 2-3</figref>). In this example, Whois server 106 may update its port mappings in database 126 to reflect that .MICROSOFT is now served by port 1946. Whois server may then end the accuracy check process in step 606.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> is a flowchart of an exemplary method 700 for providing a premium Whois service to authorized personnel, consistent with the disclosed<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> embodiments. In step 702, Whois server 106 may authenticate user 104's username and password using, for example, a password-protected web interface. Whois interface module 120 (<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) may include a password-protected web interface. In <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>, user 104 may, in one embodiment, access a website provided by registry 102 and may provide user credentials, like a user name and password. Whois server 106 may validate the credentials to determine whether user 104 is authorized to receive sensitive information. For example, registry 102 may only authorize legal or law enforcement entities to access sensitive information related to a TLD. Sensitive information may include personal contact information of registrants, such as name, phone number, e-mail address, fax number, physical address, and the like.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In step 704, Whois server 106 may receive a Whois query from user 104 whose user credentials have been authenticated.

In step 804, Whois server 106 may determine that user 104 is on a list of pre-authorized personnel stored in a database, such as database 126. In one embodiment, Whois server 106 may determine that user 104's network address is pre-approved. For example, Whois server 106 may store the source IP addresses of the pre-authorized personnel in a database, such as database 126. Whois server 106 may determine that user 104's source IP address corresponds<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> to that of a pre-authorized person's IP address.
