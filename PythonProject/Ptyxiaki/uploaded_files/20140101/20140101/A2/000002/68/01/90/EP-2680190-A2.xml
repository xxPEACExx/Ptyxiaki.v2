For example, a computing device may use facial recognition programs to authenticate a user who attempts to gain access to one or more functionalities of the computing device or functionalities otherwise controlled by the computing device. In some common scenarios, a computing device may store images of the faces of one or more authorized users (or "enrollment images"). When a user attempts to gain access to functionalities of (or "unlock") the computing device, the computing device may capture an image of the user's face for authentication purposes. The computing device may then use facial recognition programs to compare the captured facial image to the enrollment images associated with authorized users. If the facial recognition programs determine an acceptable level of match between the captured facial image and at least one enrollment image, the computing device may authenticate the user, and grant the unlock request.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Unauthorized users may leverage vulnerabilities of facial recognition programs to cause erroneous authentication. For example, an unauthorized user may attempt to unlock a computing device using "spoofing" techniques. To cause erroneous authentication by spoofing, an unauthorized user may present a facial image of an authorized user for capture by the computing device. For example, an unauthorized user may present to the device a printed picture of the authorized user's face or obtain a video or digital image of an authorized user on a second computing device (e.g., by pulling up an authorized user's profile picture from a social networking website). Thus, an unauthorized user may attempt to use spoofing methods to gain access to functionalities of the computing device to overcome authentication constraints otherwise implemented by the computing device.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In general, the present disclosure is directed to techniques for preventing erroneous authentication caused by spoofing. A computing device may implement one or more anti-spoofing programs that detect suspected attempts to spoof, and prevent erroneous authentication due to spoofing. In some examples, the anti-spoofing techniques may be performed by programs that cause one or more hardware components of the computing device to emit light in the direction of the object of the captured facial image. The anti-spoofing programs may then identify one or more landmarks within the captured facial image, and analyze the landmarks for possible signs of spoofing. For example, the anti-spoofing programs may identify one or both eyes of the facial image as landmarks. The anti-spoofing programs may then analyze the image to detect for a presence of any reflection of the emitted light from the eyes, such as corneal glint. Based on the analysis, the anti-spoofing programs may transition the computing device from a locked state to an unlocked state when the expected glint is detected, or prevent access to the computing device when the expected glint is not detected.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The anti-spoofing programs described herein may provide one or more advantages, such as reduced chances of an unauthorized user causing erroneous authentication by spoofing. For example, the anti-spoofing programs may cause the facial recognition programs to deny authentication to a user when the analyzed images of the landmarks do not include a reflection of the emitted light at all, or when an intensity of the reflected light in the images is below a threshold intensity. In another example, the anti-spoofing programs may cause the computing device to capture two or more facial images while emitting varying intensities of light, and cause the facial recognition programs to deny authentication if the landmarks do not reflect sufficiently varying intensities of light from one facial image to another. In yet another example, the anti-spoofing programs may cause the facial recognition programs to deny authentication to a user if the image analysis indicates that the light reflected from the landmarks does not sufficiently match an expected frequency content of the emitted light. For example, a computing device may emit light beams having different colors, or frequencies, that are expected to induce in the eyes of a user a reflection of light having a corresponding frequency content. In this manner, techniques of the present disclosure may reduce the occurrence of erroneous authentication caused by spoofing. In addition, the anti-spoofing programs may reduce the usage of the facial recognition<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> programs, thus conserving computing resources and reducing power consumption (e.g., extending battery life in mobile computing devices).</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref> are conceptual diagrams illustrating an example computing device for detecting possible spoofing in captured facial images, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates computing device 102 that may capture facial images associated with a user (e.g., authorized user 126), analyze the captured facial image for possible spoofing, and determine whether to allow or deny authentication based on the analysis. Computing device 102 may include, be, or be part of one or more of a variety of types of devices, such as a mobile phone (including a smartphone), tablet computer, netbook, laptop, desktop, personal digital assistant ("PDA"), set-top box, television, biometric door lock, watch, vehicle ignition, and presence verification device, among others.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Computing device 102 may include camera lens 104 and flashbulb 122. In the example of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref>, both camera lens 104 and flashbulb 122 may be part of or coupled to a front-facing camera of computing device 102. In other examples, one or both of camera lens 104 and flashbulb 122 may be part of or coupled to a rear-facing camera of computing device 102. One or both of the front-facing and rear-facing cameras may be capable of capturing still images, video, or both. In still other examples, camera lens 104 and flashbulb 122 may be integrated to form a single component of computing device 102.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the example of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref>, computing device 102 may include a display device that displays graphical user interface (GUI) 106. GUI 106 may be displayed by a variety of display devices, including input/output capable devices such as a touchscreen or presence-sensitive display. As shown in the example of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref>, GUI 106 may include one or more GUI elements, such as lock indicator 120, unlock prompt 108, and capture icon 112.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Computing device 102 may be configured to operate in a "locked" mode, shown by lock indicator 120. In some examples, a user may actively configure computing device 102 to operate in locked mode. For example, a user may press a button (such as button 110) for a predetermined length of time to configure computing device 102 to operate in locked mode. In these and other examples, a user may tap, swipe, or otherwise interact with one or more elements of GUI 106, using an input/output capable display of computing device 102. Computing device 102 may also be configured to operate in locked mode by passive means. For example, a predetermined period of "inactivity" may configure computing device 102 to<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> operate in locked mode. Inactivity may occur due to an absence of user interaction (e.g., through button presses, contact with an input/output capable display device, etc.). The predetermined time period that configures computing device 102 to operate in locked mode may be a default time period specified by a manufacturer of computing device 102, or may be programmed by an authorized user, such as authorized user 126.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In some examples, computing device 102 may utilize facial recognition technology to stop operation in locked mode. In other words, authorized user 126 may "unlock" computing device 102 by authentication methods that use facial recognition techniques to determine whether authorized user 126 is an authorized user of device 102. More specifically, authorized user 126 may set up a facial recognition application or embedded process of computing device 102 by storing an enrollment image that represents the face of authorized user 126. Authorized user 126 may cause a camera of computing device 102 to capture the authentication using camera lens 104. Computing device 102 may store the enrollment image to one or more storage devices of computing device 102, and/or to a remote location, commonly known as "cloud storage."</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">To unlock computing device 102 using facial recognition technology, a user (such as authorized user 126) may provide an authentication image that represents at least a portion of his/her face. In some examples, the user may actively cause a camera of computing device 102 to capture the authentication image. For example, the user may face camera lens 104 and press button 110 to cause the camera to capture the authentication image. In another example, the user may tap, swipe, or otherwise interact with an area associated with capture icon 112 included in GUI 106. In still other examples, computing device 102 may automatically capture the authentication image in response to the user facing camera lens 104. As shown in the example of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref>, computing device 102 may display GUI 106 to include unlock prompt 108. In this example, unlock prompt 108 indicates that the user may simply face a camera, which may include or be otherwise coupled to camera lens 104, to cause computing device 102 to capture the authentication image. For example, when the user faces camera lens 104, computing device 102 may use a facial recognition program to determine that the image currently captured through camera lens 104 includes a representation of a human face.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Computing device 102 may then compare the captured authentication image with the enrollment image, and determine whether or not the images are sufficiently similar to each other for facial recognition purposes. For example, computing device 102 may utilize one or more facial recognition programs to compare metrics associated with the authentication image to metrics associated with the enrollment image. Some examples of metrics may include distances between facial elements (pupil-to-pupil, mouth width, etc.), contours of various facial features, pixilation corresponding to skin tone or texture, hair and/or eye color, and many others. Facial recognition programs running on computing device 102 may perform the comparison using one or more recognition algorithms, such as geometric and/or photometric approaches, three-dimensional (3D) modeling and recognition techniques, principal component analysis using eigenfaces, linear discriminate analysis, elastic bunch graph matching, pattern matching, and dynamic link matching, to name just a few. Based on comparison-based values, such as preprogrammed acceptable margins of error, facial recognition programs running on computing device 102 may determine whether or not the authentication image and the enrollment image are sufficiently similar to one another for facial recognition. In instances where the facial recognition programs grant a match, the user may successfully unlock computing device 102. Conversely, if the facial recognition programs deny a match, the user may be unable to unlock computing device 102, and computing device 102 may continue to operate in locked mode.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">However, an unauthorized user may exploit vulnerabilities of commonly used facial recognition technologies to gain access to unlock computing device 102. For example, if an unauthorized user gains possession of computing device 102 while computing device 102 is configured in locked mode, the unauthorized user may attempt to unlock computing device 102, as solicited by unlock prompt 108. To successfully authenticate, the unauthorized user may spoof one or more facial recognition programs running on computing device 102 by presenting image 124, which includes a visual representation of authorized user 126.

In many cases, a legitimate facial image (i.e., captured from an actual human face, rather than a reproduced image) will include a glint in one or both eyes. More specifically, a legitimate facial image may display a glint in the cornea (front-facing portion) of one or both eyes. In some instances, computing device 102 may use a flashbulb to induce corneal glint in a legitimate facial image.

Computing device 102 may cause flashbulb 122 to emit the multiple light beams, at predetermined and/or randomly generated time intervals. Computing device 102 may then capture authentication images associated with some or all of the multiple emitted light beams, and check for corneal glint in each captured authentication image.

For example, facial recognition eligibility module 222 may implement one or more of the facial recognition techniques discussed above to detect a representation of a human face in the captured image. In various other examples, anti-spoofing module 220 may itself determine whether a captured image includes a representation of a face, or one or more of glint detection module 224, intensity module 226, and frequency module 227 may be operable to determine whether a captured authentication image includes a representation of a face. By determining whether a captured authentication image includes a representation of a human face, anti-spoofing module 220 may eliminate those instances in which one or more of glint detection module 224, intensity module 226, and frequency module 227 unnecessarily assess images that are ineligible for facial recognition.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Anti-spoofing module 220 may then analyze the captured authentication image for qualities that are characteristic of spoofing. For example, glint detection module 224 may determine whether or not the authentication image includes a corneal glint. The presence of corneal glint in the authentication image may indicate that the authentication image is legitimate (e.g., that the subject of the authentication image is an actual human face).<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> Conversely, the absence of corneal glint in the authentication image may indicate that the authentication is spoof-based (e.g., that the subject of the authentication is reproduced image of a human face). Glint detection module 224 may first identify one or both eyes (more specifically, one or both corneas) in the authentication image. Glint detection module 224 may then determine whether corneal glint exists in the eye(s). If glint detection module 224 determines that corneal glint is absent in the authentication image, glint detection module 224 may prevent one or more facial recognition programs running on computing device 200 from performing facial recognition analysis on the authentication image. In this manner, glint detection module 224 may implement techniques of this disclosure to prevent erroneous authentication caused by spoofing.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In some examples, a spoof-based authentication image may include some level of corneal glint. For example, an unauthorized user may attempt to spoof facial recognition programs by presenting a photograph of an authorized user. The photograph may itself include corneal glint, as the photograph may have been taken directly of the authorized user. In this scenario, the spoof-based authentication image may capture the corneal glint represented in the photograph. However, the corneal glint in the spoof-based authentication image may be diminished or otherwise different when compared to the expected corneal glint of a legitimate authentication image. In such situations, one or both of intensity module 226 and frequency module 227 may implement techniques of this disclosure to detect the spoofing attempt and prevent erroneous authentication.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In various implementations, intensity module 226 may measure the intensity of the corneal glint in the authentication image, and compare the measured intensity to a threshold intensity. The threshold intensity may correspond to the intensity of corneal glint in a known legitimate authentication image. If the measured intensity is less than the threshold intensity, intensity module 226 may prevent one or more facial recognition programs running on computing device 200 from performing facial recognition analysis on the authentication image.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Additionally, intensity module 226 may measure the intensity in a number of ways. In some examples, intensity module 226 may measure the intensity based on angular metrics, such as luminous intensity or radiant intensity. In other examples, intensity module 226 may measure the intensity based on areal metrics, such as irradiance, illuminance, and luminous<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> emittance. In still other examples, intensity module 226 may measure the intensity based on a combination of angular and areal metrics, such as radiance or luminance. By measuring the intensity in two or more ways, intensity module 226 may derive a more robust measurement of the intensity before comparing the measured intensity with the threshold intensity.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In some implementations, frequency module 227 may supplement, support, or replace the functionalities performed out by intensity module 226. Frequency module 227 may be operable to measure one or more frequencies associated with the corneal glint. A frequency may manifest in the form of visible and/or invisible colors. In some examples, frequency module 227 may define an acceptable frequency range for corneal glint in a captured authentication image. The acceptable frequency range may be based on known frequencies of the respective light beams emitted by flashbulbs 216. For example, the frequency of the emitted light beam may be a median point of the acceptable frequency range. If the frequency of the corneal glint falls outside the acceptable frequency range (i.e., exceeds the upper bound or is below the lower bound of the range), frequency module 227 may prevent one or more facial recognition programs running on computing device 200 from performing facial recognition analysis on the authentication image.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Some implementations may be enhanced to improve robustness and accuracy. For example, frequency module 227 may cause flashbulbs of computing device 200 to emit two or more light beams of varying frequencies, and cause front-facing camera 214 to capture a separate authentication image associated with each light beam. In this example, the respective frequencies of the light beams may be available to frequency module 227. Based on the known frequencies, frequency module 227 may calculate a frequency coefficient that indicates a difference between the frequencies of the light beams. Frequency module 227 may then measure the reflected frequency of each corneal glint of the authentication images. Based on the reflected frequencies, frequency module 227 may calculate a "reflected frequency coefficient" that indicates the difference between the reflected frequencies. Frequency module 227 may then compare the frequency coefficient of the emitted light beams to the reflected frequency coefficient (e.g., by calculating a ratio). If the calculated ratio exceeds a preprogrammed threshold ratio, frequency module 227 may detect a spoofing attempt, and prevent one or more facial recognition programs running on computing device 200 from performing facial recognition analysis on the authentication image.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">While optical properties such as color are described for purposes of example with respect to frequency of light, these optical properties may be discerned by other types of analysis on emitted and/or reflected light.

Wavelength may be a mathematical inverse of frequency. More specifically, one may derive a wavelength from a known frequency value by dividing 1 by the frequency value. In this manner, a computing device may implement techniques of this disclosure in a variety of ways to discern qualities of corneal glint.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In some implementations, frequency module 227 may cause flashbulbs 216 to modulate the color of the emitted light beam(s). More specifically, frequency module 227 may cause flashbulbs 216 to vary the color of the emitted light beams. In turn, glint detection module 224 may compare the color of any detected corneal glint to the color of the corresponding light beam. Frequency module 227 may additionally cause flashbulbs 216 to emit a series of light beams, with varying colors in the series. Glint detection module 224 may then detect corneal glint corresponding each light beam of the series, and compare the color of each detected corneal glint with the corresponding light beam of the series. For example, glint detection module 224 may authenticate a user when the corneal glint is blue in response to an emitted blue light beam, red for an emitted red light beam, and so on.

The computing device may then detect whether or not a representation of a human face is present in the reference image (604). If no face is present in the reference image, the computing device may capture<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> the reference image again, either automatically, or by prompting a user to submit another reference image.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">If the computing device successfully detects the face in the reference image, the computing device may capture a test image (606). At the time of capturing the test image, the computing device may activate one or more light sources, such as a flashbulb, a display-based light source, etc. The computing device may then perform facial recognition on the test image (608). More specifically, facial recognition programs running on the computing device may compare the test image to one or more enrollment images stored on the computing device. Based on the comparison, the computing device may determine whether or not grant the test image a match for facial recognition purposes (610). If the test image does not qualify for a facial recognition match, the computing device may deny access to one or more functionalities controlled by the computing device (614).</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">On the other hand, if the test image does qualify for a facial recognition match, the computing device may attempt to detect a corneal glint in the test image (612). The computing device may use either objective or subjective approaches to detecting the corneal glint. In an example objective approach, the computing device may analyze the test image alone. In an example subjective approach, the computing device may detect the corneal glint by comparing the test image to the reference image.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">As discussed, the computing device may capture the reference image with light source(s) deactivated. However, the computing device may capture the test image while one or more light sources are activated. As a result, the computing device may induce corneal glint in the test image (if the test image is a legitimate facial image), but not in the reference image. If test image displays sufficient corneal glint when compared to the reference image, the computing device may detect corneal glint for purposes of step 612.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Based on the outcome of the corneal glint detection, the computing device may take various actions. If the computing device successfully detects the corneal glint, the computing device may allow access to functionalities controlled by the computing device based on facial recognition authentication (616). Based on the facial recognition match (610) and the corneal glint detection (616), the computing device may determine that the test image is a legitimate facial image, and not spoof-based. However, if the computing device fails to detect the corneal glint, the computing device may deny access by facial recognition<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> authentication (614). Based on the failure to detect corneal glint, the computing device may determine that the test image is spoof-based, and thus prevent erroneous authentication by spoofing.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">While the steps of process 600 are described in a particular order for purposes of example, a device may implement the steps in varying orders in accordance with one or more aspects of this disclosure. In some examples, the device may perform glint detection and facial recognition concurrently (or substantially concurrently). For example, the device may commence both glint detection and facial recognition at the same time, or commence one while the other is still in progress. In other examples, the device may perform glint detection before facial recognition, and vice-versa. In examples where the device performs glint detection after performing facial recognition, the device may deny authentication based on insufficient glint irrespective of the results of the facial recognition. In this manner, techniques of this disclosure may be implemented in various orders to achieve the anti-spoofing goals described herein.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">While described largely with respect to unlocking a computing device for purposes of example, techniques of this disclosure may be implemented in various scenarios. In some instances, a computing device in accordance with this disclosure may control functionalities of another device, such as a door lock. In these examples, the facial recognition programs may cause the door lock to transition from locked to unlocked state, communicating the facial recognition match using a network interface or other communication channel. Such door locks may be used in various practical scenarios, such as to control access to safeboxes containing valuable data and documents, automobiles, or storage areas used for controlled substances, such as in a medical facility. In such examples, the computing device may implement techniques of this disclosure to detect spoofing attempts and prevent erroneous authentication by facial recognition in potentially sensitive situations.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Additionally, techniques of this disclosure may be applied in the form of blink detection. A device implementing the techniques may perform blink detection either in place of glint detection or as a supplement to glint detection. In one implementation, the device may emit a light beam in the form of a bright flash. The device may cause the flash to be sufficiently bright to cause a user to blink involuntarily. The device may detect the blink (one or both eyes closed either fully or partially) in at least one captured authentication<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> image. In other implementations, the device may display a message instructing the user to blink within a particular time frame. In one such implementation, the device may capture multiple authentication images, and verify that the user blinked in an authentication image corresponding to the time when (s)he was instructed to blink. In another such implementation, the device may capture a single authentication image, and verify that the captured image includes an indication of a blink. When implemented in addition to glint detection techniques described herein, blink detection may add reliability and robustness. When implemented in a standalone fashion, blink detection may provide an alternate anti-spoofing measure by verifying that a captured image is that of a responsive user rather than a static picture or pre-recorded video of the user. In this manner, techniques of this disclosure may include the use of blink detection to perform and/or enhance anti-spoofing measures described herein.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Techniques described herein may be implemented, at least in part, in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. For example, various aspects of the described embodiments may be implemented within one or more processors, including one or more microprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), or any other equivalent integrated or discrete logic circuitry, as well as any combinations of such components. The term "processor" or "processing circuitry" may generally refer to any of the foregoing logic circuitry, alone or in combination with other logic circuitry, or any other equivalent circuitry. A control unit including hardware may also perform one or more of the techniques of this disclosure.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Such hardware, software, and firmware may be implemented within the same device or within separate devices to support the various techniques described herein. In addition, any of the described units, modules or components may be implemented together or separately as discrete but interoperable logic devices. Depiction of different features as modules or units is intended to highlight different functional aspects and does not necessarily imply that such modules or units are realized by separate hardware, firmware, or software components.

For example, the techniques may be implemented by computing devices that use other types of recognition-based technologies (e.g., technologies for recognizing a user's body characteristics of, etc.), touch-free fingerprint recognition, and others.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">Techniques described herein may also be embodied or encoded in an article of manufacture including a computer-readable storage medium encoded with instructions. Instructions embedded or encoded in an article of manufacture including an encoded computer-readable storage medium, may cause one or more programmable processors, or other processors, to implement one or more of the techniques described herein, such as when instructions included or encoded in the computer-readable storage medium are executed by the one or more processors. Computer readable storage media may include random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), programmable read only memory (PROM), erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM), electronically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM), flash memory, a hard disk, a compact disc ROM (CD-ROM), a floppy disk, a cassette, magnetic media, optical media, or other computer readable media. Additional examples of computer readable medium include computer-readable storage devices, computer-readable memory, and tangible computer-readable medium. In some examples, an article of manufacture may comprise one or more computer-readable storage media.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">In some examples, computer-readable storage media may comprise non-transitory media. The term "non-transitory" may indicate that the storage medium is tangible and is not embodied in a carrier wave or a propagated signal. In certain examples, a non-transitory storage medium may store data that can, over time, change (e.g., in RAM or cache).</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">Various examples have been described.
