Then, a resin is applied onto the chip to fabricate dummy wafers made of the chips covered with the resin on the pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet. Thereafter, an ultraviolet ray is applied from the back side (the lower side) of the silica glass substrate to weaken the pressure-sensitive adhesive force of the pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet and the dummy wafers are peeled from the silica glass substrate and the pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet.

Thus, there is a limit to the selection of a board material.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the method described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2001308116A"><text>2001-308116</text></patcit>, when the dummy wafers are subjected to dicing, the dummy wafers are already peeled from the silica glass substrate and the pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet, that is, the dummy wafers are not supported by the silica glass substrate. Thus, the dummy wafers are not capable of being subjected to dicing with excellent accuracy and as a result, there is a disadvantage that size stability of the chip component to be obtained is low.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for producing a phosphor<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> layer-covered LED in which not only using a support board having active energy ray transmissive properties, but also using a support board having active energy ray blocking properties, a phosphor layer-covered LED is capable of being easily obtained with excellent size stability;

Thus, it is not required to form the support board from a board material that allows the active energy ray to transmit therethrough to then allow the active energy ray to transmit through the support board.

To be specific, the viscosity of the varnish under conditions of 25°C and 1 pressure is, for example, 1,000 mPa·s or more, or preferably 4,000 mPa·s or more, and is, for example, 1,000,000 mPa·s or less, or preferably 100,000 mPa·s or less.
