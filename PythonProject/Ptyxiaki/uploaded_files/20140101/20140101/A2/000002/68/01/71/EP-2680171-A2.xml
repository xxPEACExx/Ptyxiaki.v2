For example, a company's sales and marketing data may be stored and managed with a Salesforce service/storage, documents may be stored in a Dropbox storage, and the company calendar might be managed in a Google Apps Calendar.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">It is important for companies who are cloud clients to consolidate their storage and have a more global vision on what it stored out there in the cloud. Data that is stored in the cloud needs to be indexed in order to be searched.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Existing indexing and crawling engine solutions are based on a time-based frequency to crawl through and retrieve data and document materials. This time-based frequency is a fixed value of regular time duration (or an interval), e.g., five seconds, five minutes, five hours, etc. Indexing tasks are scheduled for repeated execution at the regular time interval.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Most of the search engine or data warehousing services use indexing to collect and store data for informal information retrieval, such as for a query. The typical technique is to perform indexing at a predetermined time interval (<figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>) because there may be a required time needed for processing data, such as document parsing, metadata extraction, cleansing, compression, and/or maintenance. Thus, as is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, at time T1, a first indexing is performed. Various data updates occur in the system and a second indexing update is performed at time T2, which is an interval t(t1) after time T1. Subsequently, no further document updates occur, but another indexing takes place at time T3, which uses the same interval t(T1) after time T2 that was used between times T1 and T2.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Although it is known to cache data with periodic prefetching or prebuffering of data for an application based on a user's interactions with preexisting database content, such systems use only a limited set of criteria for determining the caching intervals. However, these types of systems do not take into account aspects of an enterprise in which<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> user data creation is prevalent and various restrictions of the SaaS services and usage patterns (both individual and group) must be taken into consideration.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As an enterprise's infrastructure becomes fragmented, employees and administrators have the need for a unified search capability which provides an aggregated view across the enterprise's content that takes into account usage patterns, technical restrictions, as well as business restrictions.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">In order to more efficiently utilize resources in an indexing operation across an enterprise's data, a method is provided for operating an indexing engine that parses and indexes data created by a set of users associated with a business entity on a database while interacting with a service associated to the database, the method comprising: monitoring the users' interactions with the database related to a creation of new data by one or more of the users over a predefined period of time when using the service; monitoring service availability during these interactions over the same predefined period of time; and changing an indexing frequency based on both parameters associated with the monitoring of the users' interactions and the service usage conditions (including, but not restricted to, API-request limits, cost restrictions, and content-access restrictions).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A method is also provided for operating an indexing engine that parses and indexes data created by a set of users associated with a business entity or enterprise on a database while interacting with a service associated to the database, the method comprising: monitoring the users' interactions with the database when using the service; and changing an existing indexing frequency based on parameters associated with: a) the monitoring of the users' interactions; b) an attribute selected from the group consisting of: a number of retrieval requests, a number of API requests, and access times; and c) an attribute selected from the group consisting of: a cost associated with a data request, a cost associated with a user account, and a cost associated with using or accessing a system resource.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">An associated indexing engine is further provided that parses and indexes data created by a set of users associated with a business entity on a database while interacting with a service associated to the database, the indexing engine comprising: a user interaction monitor that monitors the users' interactions with the database related to a creation of new data by one or more of the users over a predefined period of time when using the service; a service availability monitor that monitors service availability during these interactions over the same predefined period of time; and an indexing frequency adjuster that changes an indexing frequency based on both parameters associated with the monitoring of the users' interactions and the service availability.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Finally, a non-transitory computer program product is provided comprising a computer usable medium having a computer readable program code embodied therein, said computer readable program code adapted to be executed to implement the above-described methods.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Two key components defined herein are a User and a Service.

Documents or data 10 reflecting information that may be the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> target of an indexer 20 are accessed by the indexer 20 on some form of a timed basis. The indexer 20 is implemented as a software algorithm running on a computer processor which may be part of a standalone dedicated computer or may be integrated with a computer and processor that performs other related or unrelated functions.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The indexer produces a document index 30 which associates key words, attributes, etc. with the documents/data 10. The indexer 20 thus aggregates the data 10 into an easily searchable form. A retrieval system 40 can then be used to access the document index 30 to allow the user to quickly access the indexed information.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In a corporate context, by leveraging the application program interfaces (APIs) that many SaaS providers make available, an indexing solution can be built that accesses the content of individual employees (in these SaaS services) and presents the combined results in a unified search view. The set of employees or users having a relationship with a business entity share an attribute in that they have a level of access in creating and sharing data that distinguishes them from users outside of the set of employees or users of the business entity-thus, these users are associated with one another based on their affiliation with the business entity and some defined level of access to a set of data associated with the business entity. According to another view, the enterprise associated with the data can utilize access control information that it possesses to obtain access to the desired information.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">After the initial index is created, the index needs to be maintained by adding new content (from the repositories) and removing deleted content. As noted above, historically, this has been accomplished by periodically indexing the content according to a regular periodic schedule.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Various embodiments of the invention address intelligent indexing of SaaS-based content, which involves the modifying the intervals between which the information is indexed, taking into account a number of factors to account for variances in the underlying services, and also the variances in how individual users access and create content, both individually and in aggregate across a group (company). Thus, the indexing tasks can be made to operate more dynamically.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>, at time T1, a first indexing is performed. Various data updates occur in the system and a second indexing update is performed at time T2, which is an interval t(t1) after time T1. Subsequently, another indexing takes place at time T3, which uses a different interval t(T2) after time T2 than that which was used between times T1 and T2. Significantly, the difference between the indexing intervals is based on a number of factors-some of these factors are knowable by virtue of the fact that in the company context, information can be known about the various users and the data being accessed that are not knowable in an individual setting. For example, aggregate information about accesses to certain types of documents, access rights, etc., can be utilized for calculating the indexing factor.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref> illustrates various factors that can be taken into account with regard to the indexing frequency. Various embodiments of the invention disclosed herein provide an indexing solution capable of factoring in: a) user behavior factors, such as usage patterns (logins, storage volumes, data throughput demands) and user creation of data (uploads for documents, multimedia, etc.) patterns, and b) service-type factors, such as technical restrictions (bandwidth, storage capacity, etc.), and business restrictions (cost per access, etc.), to provide a unified search capability of an enterprise's fragmented infrastructure.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The user behavior factors are linked to all users accessing and creating data with the service, the data being the new data to index. This may be commercial data such as sales-related information or more a more generic form of data that may be used, e.g., on a drop box. The service-type factors are linked to the service itself. Employees and administrators have a need to see an aggregated view across the enterprise's content.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Since the SaaS-based services typically have different technical and operational characteristics and utilize differing business models to support their services (e.g., subscription-, per-user-, per-request-, and storage capacity-based) different techniques are needed to access and process the content. In addition, the usage patterns of individual users within a company may vary by service and content type.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">For example an individual in a Sales group may access Opportunity content in a Salesforce datastore/service multiple times a day, but only access legal templates stored in the service/datastore Box relatively infrequently. In contrast, a legal admininistrator may access the legal templates in Box frequently, but only rarely access the SalesOpportunity content in Salesforce.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The dynamic nature of the indexing takes into consideration the User's behaviors and availability aspects of the service. The intervals between indexing tasks are dynamically changed, based upon a calculation that may include various parameters.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref> various parameters that may be taken into account in adjusting the interval are illustrated. As can be seen, the interval may be adjusted based on usage patterns, technical restrictions, and business restrictions.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A list of parameters related to usage patterns or User behavior may include, but is not limited to: a) how actively a user interacts with a service; b) amount of time spent on a service; c) the frequency with which a user logs onto/logs off of a service; d) a last user login to a service. Technical restrictions can related to: e) peak hours (e.g., office hours); f) an amount of data stored on a service of a user; and g) the type of data itself (e.g., a word-processing document vs. call logs).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A list of parameters related to the Service itself may also incorporate technical restrictions, than may include, but is not limited to: h) API limitations; i) the amount of storage/transactions allowed per user; j) the type of data: non real-time vs. real-time (such as documents, web pages, CRM data vs. news feeds, call logs, e-mails, etc.); and k) connectivity and consumption bandwidth.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Finally, there may be business restrictions associated with accessing the information, such as cost of making a request, cost per user, and cost per storage.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>, it can be seen that User Bob accesses his Box account every hour, whereas John accesses his Box account once per day, and Jane accesses her Box account even less-only once per week. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref> further illustrates exemplary technical restrictions, where the Box restricts object retrieval requests to 1000/hr.,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> whereas the Salesforce restricts API requests to 5000/hr., and the Dropbox restricts API requests between the hours of 9-5pm. Finally, <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref> illustrates exemplary business restrictions that include pricing variances based on number of requests (for accesses to Box), users (number of users accessing Salesforce), or Dropbox (based on storage amount).</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Any combination of the above parameters could be utilized to affect the interval between indexing. Each parameter used may be calculated with a weighting factor related to how a User interacts with a certain Service. This gives the indexing engine an optimal way to handle connectivity to the service and the amount of data to be parsed in and out the engine.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The dynamic indexing can improve the processing performance. Generally speaking, for a lower frequency service, the interval between two consequent indexing actions is longer, compared to an interval that would be used for a fixed time interval. That means the number of executions over time are fewer, which thus reduces the number of process and resources, such as memory and API requests, needed for the indexing.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The indexing interval is thus lengthened for an increasingly less frequently used, less interacted with, and non-real time data service, given a sufficiently long period of time over which no changes are sent or the incremental updates and changes are minimal. Since the changes are very small (or minimally incremental), when a user queries the indices, the chances of missing relevant results or hitting outdated results are minimal as well.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In contrast, the indexing interval is thus shortened for an increasingly more frequently used highly interacted with, and real time data service.
