More specifically the invention relates to a system and method for powering a plurality of DC-motors and for measuring their positions over a wire interface.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background of the invention</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A DC motor is an electric motor that can run on direct current (also known as DC-current). Low power (e.g. &lt;1 kW) DC motors are used in many applications (e.g. toys, disk drives, etc), and can operate directly from batteries. When a constant voltage is applied to a DC-motor, it will typically rotate at a constant speed (optionally after a transient behaviour). During this rotation a voltage called "back-emf" is induced in the rotor windings, which compensates the applied voltage.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">DC-motors are not always used for continuous rotation, but also for position control, e.g. for opening or closing a valve, or setting the valve opening at a specific value. Circuitry has been developed for driving the DC motor to the desired position, and for keeping the DC-motor in that position, even when an external force is applied. Such circuits are typically called "servo systems". In order to set and maintain a desired position, the servo system needs a signal indicative of the actual motor position. Servo control can then e.g. be performed by using this position signal in a negative feedback-loop, where a difference signal is calculated between the desired position and the actual position, which difference signal may optionally be amplified, and applied to the DC-motor. Such circuits are well known in the art.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5705907A"><text>US 5,705,907</text></patcit> describes a drive control system for limiting overshoot when the actual position of the DC-motor reaches a target position. A block diagram of such a circuit is replicated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. It has a CPU 104 sending a PWM signal as a command-signal to a driver 105, which delivers power to a motor 101. A disadvantage of such motor control system is that the motor module 102 actually requires five wires, which implies additional handling and material cost. This may be important in applications where the distance between the CPU 104 and/or driver 105 on the one hand, and the motor 101 on the other hand is relatively large (e.g. larger than 50 cm), especially in high-volume, cost sensitive applications, such as e.g. air-conditioning systems for vehicles.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP0415655A"><text>EP0415655</text></patcit> describes a two-wire power and position control system between a central station 100 (i.e. the motor controller) and a remote station 102 (i.e. the motor module). <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGs. 2A, 2B and 2C</figref> of this document correspond to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGs. 5</figref> (left part), <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7 and FIG. 8</figref> of <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP0415655B1"><text>EP0415655(B1</text></patcit>), respectively. A disadvantage of this circuit is that the motor can only be driven in a single direction, which makes this circuit unsuited for many practical applications.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the invention</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is an object of embodiments of the present invention to provide a good method and system for powering and controlling a plurality of remote DC-motors.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The above objective is accomplished by a method and device according to the present invention.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a motor control system for controlling a plurality of DC-motors. The motor control system comprises:
<ul><li>a motor controller, adapted for providing a number of first power signals each for being applied to one of the DC motors and a single common second power signal for powering the plurality of DC-motors, and adapted for receiving a plurality of position feedback signals from the plurality of DC-motors;</li><li>one or more motor modules connectable to the plurality of DC-motors and comprising for each of the plurality of DC-motors a variable impedance adapted for being operatively connected to one of the DC motors and for creating an impedance indicative of a position of said one DC-motor; and</li><li>a wire interface for interconnecting the one or more motor modules and the motor controller for transferring the plurality of first power signals and the single common second power signal and the plurality of position feedback signals.</li></ul>
Each variable impedance is arranged for being powered by one of the first power signals and by the common second power signal and for generating one of the position feedback signals when the corresponding DC-motor is being powered. The number of wires of the wire interface is twice the number of DC-motors plus one. As examples only, the motor control system may be for controlling two motors, in which case five wires are sufficient, or the motor control system may be for controlling three motors, in which seven wires are sufficient.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is an advantage of embodiments of the present invention that driving and monitoring the position of a plurality of DC-motors may take place over a wire interface having less than three wires per motor. Hence, compared to prior art solutions, a reduced number of wires may be used.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Advantageously, in embodiments of the present invention each DC motor can be driven in either direction (selectively clockwise and counter clockwise), and the motor position can be read even when the motor is substantially stationary.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The motor may or may not be part of the motor module. The motor module may e.g. comprise or consist of a PCB with a potentiometer. The motor module may have a multi- pins connector for connection with the multi- wire interface. The motor module may have a plurality of two-pins connectors for connection with each of the motor terminals. The module may further have a rectifier circuit. The module may further have a voltage divider circuit.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In embodiments of the present invention, the number of DC motors is two, and the wire-interface has exactly five wires. This embodiment allows two motors to be driven over a five-wire interface instead of over a six-wire interface as known in the art, which leads to a 16% material savings, which is huge advantage, especially for mass-volume products such as automotive products, or consumer electronics products.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In embodiments of the present invention, the number of DC motors is three, and the wire-interface has exactly seven wires. This embodiment allows three motors to be driven over a seven-wire interface instead of over a nine-wire interface, which leads to a 22% material savings, which is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> a huge advantage, especially for mass-volume products such as automotive products, or consumer electronics products.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In embodiments of the present invention, the motor controller is adapted for reading the position feedback signal when the corresponding DC-motor is being powered.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">This is a different principle as the one that was used in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP0415655A"><text>EP0415655</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In embodiments of the present invention, each variable impedance is a potentiometer. The potentiometer may e.g. be mechanically connectable or connected to the shaft of the motor, and electrically connectable or connected to the terminals of the DC-motor.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In embodiments of the present invention, the potentiometer may be adapted for receiving the same power signals as the corresponding DC-motor. In such embodiments, the potentiometer may be arranged in parallel to the DC-motor, whereby the terminals of the potentiometer may be electrically connected to the terminals of the DC-motor, without any intermediate components, such as e.g. resistors, diodes, etc.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In embodiments of the present invention, the motor module may further comprise a rectifier for applying a DC voltage to its potentiometer when the corresponding DC-motor is being powered for turning in a first direction (e.g. clock-wise) or in a second direction (e.g. counter-clock-wise). In this way, a polarity change over the potentiometer may be avoided, which simplifies the position determination of the DC-motor.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In embodiments of the present invention, the motor controller may be adapted for providing a pulsed power signal as at least one of the first and second power signal. An advantage of pulsed power signals is that they can easily be generated in an integrated circuit having general purpose input-output pins, or by using a pulse-width-modulator (PWM). In addition, the generation of such signals does not require a heavy CPU-load; and Digital-To-Analog convertors (DAC) and/or external filters (e.g. RC-filters) can also be avoided. Furthermore, by applying a large voltage over the DC-motor, a large torque can be applied, so that the risk that the motor stalls is reduced. Finally, the motor torque can easily be determined by modifying the pulse duration (in case of discrete pulses), or the duty cycle (in case of a PWM-signal) of the power signals.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In embodiments of the present invention, the motor controller comprises:
<ul><li>at least one analog-to-digital-convertor for digitizing the position feedback signals;</li><li>at least one pulse width modulation module for generating at least one pulse width modulated signal as at least one of the first and second power signals;</li><li>a processing unit provided with an algorithm for determining a duty cycle of the at least one pulse width modulation module for driving the plurality of DC-motors at a plurality of predefined positions.</li></ul></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">With present state of technology, such a motor controller can be implemented in a mixed digital, mixed analogue single chip, sometimes also referred to as mixed-mode CMOS technology.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In embodiments of the present invention, the motor control system may further comprise at least one voltage divider, arranged for reducing the amplitude of the position feedback signals (Ps) to a range suitable for the at least one analog-to-digital-convertor. The voltage divider may be located on either side of the wire-interface, near the motor module or near the motor controller. Preferably there is a voltage divider for each of the position feedback signals.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In embodiments of the present invention, the or each voltage divider may consist of only two resistors. In other embodiments, the voltage divider may consist of only three resistors. An advantage of a voltage divider consisting of only two or three resistors is that it does not require active components, such as a buffer or amplifier. By selecting appropriate values for the resistors of the voltage divider and the resistance of the potentiometer, the non-linearity of the voltage divided feedback signal versus the actual motor position can be reduced, and thus the measurement error can be reduced.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In embodiments of the present invention, the motor controller may be provided with an algorithm for correcting a non-linear relation between the actual motor positions and the position feedback signals.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Where accurate motor positioning is not required, the relation can be approximated by a linear curve, or a piece-wise linear curve having e.g. two or three linear portions. However, in applications where accurate motor position is important, an accurate correction is needed, e.g. by using a look-up-table stored in memory, or by calculations using mathematical formulae.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In a second aspect, the present invention also relates to a motor module, as may be used in any of the motor control systems in accordance with the first aspect. The motor module is connectable to a plurality of DC-motors. The motor module comprises a plurality of variable impedances, each adapted for being operatively connected to one of the plurality of DC motors and for creating an impedance indicative of a position of said one DC-motor. The motor module is connectable via a wire interface to a motor controller, the number of wires of the wire interface being twice the number of DC-motors to be connected to the motor module, plus one. The motor module is adapted for receiving a plurality of first power signals, each for being applied to one of the DC-motors, and a single common second power signal for powering the plurality of DC-motors and for powering the plurality of variable impedances, and for generating a position feedback signal at a moment when the first and second power signals have different voltage levels.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Such a motor module may be especially adapted for cooperating with a corresponding motor controller over the wire interface. The motor module may also comprise the DC-motor, in which case the potentiometer may be operatively connected to the DC-motor shaft, and may be electrically connected to the motor terminals.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The motor module may for instance have a first connector with 2xN+1 pins for connection to the wire interface, N being the number of motors, and N second connectors having three pins for connecting one of the first power signals and the common second power signal to one of the motors, and for receiving the position signal from said motor.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The motor module may comprise a single PCB (printed circuit board), or multiple PCB's, interconnected to each other, but need not necessarily comprise a PCB.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In a third aspect, the invention also relates to a motor controller for controlling a plurality of DC-motors, as may be used in such motor control system, the motor controller being connectable via a wire interface to one or more motor modules connectable to the plurality of DC-motors and comprising for each of the plurality of DC-motors a variable impedance adapted for being operatively connected to one of the DC motors and for creating an impedance indicative of a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> position of said one DC-motor. The motor controller is adapted for providing a plurality of first power signals, each for being applied to one of the DC motors, and for providing a single common power signal for powering the plurality of DC-motors. The motor controller is furthermore adapted for powering the plurality of variable impedances which are adapted for generating a position feedback signal when being powered. The motor controller is adapted for reading at least one of the position feedback signals at a moment when the corresponding first power signal and the common second power signal have different voltage levels.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Such a motor controller may be especially adapted for cooperating with a corresponding motor module over the wire interface, for instance for cooperating with a motor module according to embodiments of the second aspect of the present invention.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">A motor controller in accordance with embodiments of the present invention is ideally suited for being implemented in an at least partly digital IC with a programmable CPU. By digitizing the position feedback-signal, any non-linearity of the system can be easily corrected in the digital domain. In addition, it allows the hardware to be simplified.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In a fourth aspect, the present invention also relates to a method for driving a plurality of DC-motors over a wire interface selectively in a first and second direction, whereby the number of wires of the wire-interface is twice the number of DC-motors plus one, and for reading the positions of the plurality of DC-motors. The method comprises the steps of: a) generating a plurality of first power signals and generating a single common second power signal, and applying the plurality of first power signals and the single common second power signal to the plurality of DC-motors over the wire interface, whereby at least one of the first power signals and the single common second power signal have different voltage levels for driving at least one of the DC-motors; b) generating at last one position feedback signal of said at least one driven DC-motor, and applying the at least one position feedback signal to the wire interface; c) determining at least one actual position of the at least one driven DC-motor based on the at least one position feedback signal; d) adjusting the plurality of first power signals and the single common second power signal based on the at least one actual motor position and on a plurality of predetermined motor positions, and applying the adjusted power signals to the wire interface.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Such a method is especially adapted for powering a number of DC-motors and for reading their position over a wire interface having less than three wires per motor, as in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">It is an advantage that, by applying appropriate signals to the wire interface, each motor may be driven individually to different predetermined positions. The motors may be driven in a time division multiplexed manner, that is, in time slots. In embodiments of the present invention, only one motor is driven per time-slot, while the other motors are not powered in that particular time-slot. However, it also possible to drive more than one motor per time-slot. The motors may be driven in the same or opposite directions (e.g. clockwise / counter-clockwise), or may be kept in a stationary position, or any combination hereof.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In embodiments of the present invention, it may for example be possible to apply a "short positive pulse" or a "short negative pulse" simultaneously to all motors, for simultaneously reading<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> out all of the motor positions, which is faster than reading each motor position one after the other. If the motors are in a stationary position, then preferably an opposite short pulse is applied to compensate for the first pulse.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In embodiments of the present invention, the determination of the actual position of the at least one driven DC-motor in step c) includes determining whether the corresponding momentary first power signal is larger or smaller than the common second power signal.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">For example, in case the motor is powered for turning in a first direction, e.g. "clock-wise", a first calculation may be used, and when the motor is powered for turning in a second direction, e.g. "counter-clock-wise", a second calculation different from the first calculation may be used. The calculations may be based e.g. on a first/second formula, or may be based e.g. on a first/second look-up table. This offers the advantage that a rectifier circuit can be avoided.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Generating at least one position feedback signal may include generating a position feedback signal over a variable resistance, for instance a potentiometer. In such an embodiment, the method may further comprise rectifying the first and second power signal for powering the variable resistance, e.g. potentiometer. This offers the advantage that the calculation of the actual motor position from the position feedback signal can be simplified.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In embodiments of the present invention, generating the first and second power signals may comprise providing two different signals selected from the group of a supply voltage, a ground voltage and a pulse width modulated signal during a time interval, e.g. a predetermined time interval. By using such signals, either a voltage difference equal to the supply voltage can be applied to the DC-motor to apply maximum positive or maximum negative torque, or no voltage difference to apply no torque, or a voltage with an intermediate average value to apply an intermediate average torque, during the time interval.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In embodiments of the present invention, generating a first and second power signal may comprise providing a pulse width modulated signal as one of the first and second power signals, and providing a DC signal as the other one of the first and second power signals.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Each motor for which the first power signal and the second common power signal has a different voltage level, is actively driven. One or more motors may be simultaneously driven at any instant in time.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Preferably the pulse width modulation signal and the DC signal have the same voltage level as the supply voltage. By using such signals, a voltage difference equal to the supply voltage can be applied to the DC-motor(s), allowing to provide maximum torque. This may be implemented by simply switching voltages or by using a PWM-module. Use of a PWM-module allows to create (on average) intermediate values of the torque, even for a constant time-slot.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In an example where only one motor is actively driven per time-slot, the values of the first and second power signals may be chosen so as to drive this one motor in the desired direction, e.g. clockwise, and the values of the first power signals of all the other motors may be chosen so as to provide no torque to these other motors, e.g. by applying to these motors a first power signal equal to the second power signal, or by providing as the first power signal a tri-state signal (also known as high-impedance state).<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In such an embodiment, the DC-signal may be substantially equal to half of the supply voltage.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The DC-signal may be a fixed voltage between ground and the supply voltage, e.g. having a voltage level substantially equal to half of the supply voltage. In this way a "pin" can be saved when using an IC, and software complexity can be reduced as this voltage can be made outside of the IC, while still allowing all of the DC-motors to be driven in either "clockwise" or "counter-clockwise" direction. In addition, the motors can be driven by only changing the duty-cycle of the first power signals. This embodiment has the additional advantage that all motors can be driven in each time-slot, in either direction, e.g. clockwise or counter-clockwise, substantially 100% of the time. A 50% duty cycle would typically correspond to actively maintaining the DC-motor position in a stable position, a duty cycle smaller resp. larger than 50% would cause the motor to turn in the first resp. second direction.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In embodiments of the present invention, the at least one of the first power signals may be set to tri-state. This offers the advantage that the first power signals of the motors not being actively driven need not be adapted along with the level of the second common power signal changes, as would be the case otherwise, but can remain tri-state as long as these particular motors are not being driven, nor their positions are being measured. Using tri-state signals may simplify the software, provide less switching noise, cause less current spikes in the motor and over the wire-interface, and may thus create less EMI (electro-magnetic interference).</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In embodiments of the present invention, the method may furthermore comprise digitizing the position feedback signal in an analog-to-digital-convertor.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In embodiments of the present invention, the method may furthermore comprise a step e) of reducing the amplitude of the position feedback signal. In embodiments of the present invention, reducing the amplitude of the position feedback signal may include using a voltage divider comprising passive components, e.g. comprising only passive components. By avoiding active components such as buffers, power can be saved, and the circuit can be simplified. In addition, by choosing appropriate values for the components, the actual motor position can be determined with great precision, e.g. less than 1% position error.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In embodiments of the present invention, the method may further comprise a step f) of executing an algorithm for correcting a non-linear relation between the actual DC-motor position and the position feedback signal.

Applying a constant voltage (e.g. VCC-GND = 12 V) to the potentiometer 103 has the advantage that the feedback signal Ps (on the wire P) is not directly dependent on the voltage levels of the first and second power signals Us, Ts applied over the power wires U, T to the DC-motor 101, only indirectly when the motor 101 changes position. It is to be noted that the feedback signal Ps, indicative of the rotational position of the motor 101, is present even when no power is supplied to the motor 101 over the power wires U, T. Since the feedback signal Ps is always present (time continuous) and changes gradually as the motor 101 rotates clockwise or counter clockwise, such a feedback signal Ps is ideal for use in a time-continuous analog control circuit. The circuit of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is relevant for the present application mainly as an example of a motor-system with a DC-motor capable of rotating selectively both clockwise and counter clockwise, whereby the position of the motor 101 can be determined also in a stationary position of the motor (i.e. when not rotating), and requiring five wires for powering and position feedback.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref> shows another prior art power and position control system 100, also called "control station" connected to a remote motor module 102, also called "remote station", shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2B</figref> over a two-wire interface U, T, for generating a physical displacement by a permanent magnet DC-motor 101. A pulsating voltage is applied to the link U, T as the power source for the DC motor 101. The physical displacement information of the motor 101 is extracted by the control station 100 within the off-cycles of the pulsating power signal Us on the wire U (i.e. when A is high, so that<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> transistor 106 is off and no power pulse is sent to the motor 101). The remote station 102 is arranged to sequentially connect a variable impedance 103 to form part of a voltage divider, the change in impedance being used to affect a voltage derived from the voltage divider at the control station 100. Since one of the wires T is permanently connected to ground, and the other wire U can be driven only by a value equal to either of GND or the positive power supply +V, depending on the value of the input signal A, the motor 101 can only be driven in a single direction, e.g. "clockwise". Moreover, the diode D1 only allows current to flow in one direction through the motor 101. Thus this circuit is not suitable for driving the motor 101 in both directions (selectively clockwise and counter clockwise). As described in more detail in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="EP0415655B1"><text>EP0415655(B1</text></patcit>) in relation to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7 and FIG. 8</figref> thereof, the principle of providing position feedback is based on voltage division measured "between the power pulses". Referring back to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A and FIG. 2C</figref> of the present document, when the input A is low, the pnp-transistor 106 is "on", and the voltage +V is applied to node B and thus to the line U for powering the motor 101, which will start rotating in a first direction, e.g. "clockwise" as long as the input A is low. When the input A is set high, the pnp-transistor 106 is switched "off", and a voltage division will occur (over the resistors 107, and 108 in parallel with the resistors of the motor module 102). This will cause a voltage Vc, Vd or Ve to be placed on the two-wire interface U,T, which is indicative of the position of the motor 101. The position information is thus available during the "off"-periods, i.e. at a moment when no power is delivered to the motor 101 by the drive circuit 100. The line portions corresponding to the position feedback signals are indicated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2C</figref> in thicker line width for illustrative purposes.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a motor power and position measurement system as can be used in embodiments of the present invention. The motor power and position measurement system comprises a motor control circuit 10 (left), also referred to as motor controller 10, and a motor module 2 (right). The motor module 2 is connected to the motor controller 10 via a three-wire interface 13, comprising three wires U, T, P for transporting resp. a first and second power signal Us, Ts from the motor controller 10 to the motor module 2, and a position feedback signal Ps from the motor module 2 to the motor controller 10. The motor module 2 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref> comprises a DC-motor 1, and a potentiometer 3 operatively, e.g. mechanically, coupled to the motor 1 for converting a position, e.g. rotational position of the motor 1 into a variable resistance. The motor module 2 further comprises a rectifier circuit 12, comprising four diodes D2-D5. The motor controller 10 may optionally further comprise a voltage divider 11, for reducing the voltage level of the position feedback signal Ps, e.g. to the input range of an analog-to-digital (ADC)-convertor which may be present in the motor controller 10. The motor 1 can be selectively driven in either direction, i.e. clockwise or counter clockwise, by applying suitable first and second power signals Us, Ts to the power lines U, T of the three-wire interface 13. The position of the motor 1 can be determined by means of the signal Ps placed on the third wire P by the potentiometer 3. It is to be noted that the motor 1 may also be external to the motor module 2, in which case the potentiometer 3 is operatively connectable, and electrically connectable to the motor 1. In a simple implementation, the voltage divider 11, which is optional, comprises, e.g. consists of two resistors R3, R4 connected in series, the series connection at one end being connected to ground GND, and at the other end<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> being connected to a third node (also called output node) of the potentiometer 3. But other voltage reducing circuits are also possible, e.g. a circuit comprising a buffer. However, the simplest (and cheapest) hardware solution is a voltage divider consisting of only two resistors, without a buffer.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates what happens when a first power signal Us having a momentary voltage level larger than that of the second power signal Ts is applied to the first resp. second power line U, T of the motor module 2. Suppose e.g. that during a time period AT, Us is set to a high voltage, e.g. 12V DC, and Ts is set to a low voltage, e.g. 0V DC, then a current Im will flow through the motor 1 as indicated by the arrow, for powering the motor 1 for turning in a first direction, e.g. clockwise. At the same time, i.e. while the motor 1 is being powered, a current will also flow through diode D3, potentiometer 3 and diode D4, thereby creating a voltage drop over the potentiometer 3, so as to create a position signal Ps which is applied to the third wire P of the interface 13. The value of Ps is an indication of the position of the motor 1 when powered for turning clockwise.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3C</figref> is a variant of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B</figref>, and illustrates what happens when a voltage Us having a momentary value smaller than Ts is applied to the first resp. second power line U, T of the motor module 2. Suppose e.g. that during a time period AT, Us is set to a low voltage, e.g. 0 V DC, and Ts is set to a high voltage, e.g. 12 V DC, then a current Im will flow through the motor 1 as indicated by the arrow, for powering the motor 1 for turning in a second direction opposite the first direction, e.g. counter clockwise. At the same time, i.e. while the motor 1 is being powered, a current will also flow through diode D5, potentiometer 3 and diode D2, thereby creating a voltage drop over the potentiometer 3, so as to create a position signal Ps which is applied to the third wire P of the interface 13. The value of Ps is an indication of the position of the motor 1 when the motor 1 is powered for turning counter clockwise.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">When the motor 1 is powered, the position feedback signal Ps will assume values in a predetermined range, e.g. in the range of about 0.6 V to about 11.4 V (assuming a 12 V supply voltage, and assuming a 0,6 V voltage drop over the diodes). In case the motor controller 10 is at least partly digital, and comprises an analog-to-digital convertor ADC1 in the motor controller 10, the voltage range of the feedback signal Ps needs to be reduced to the input range of the ADC, which is e.g. only 0.0 V to 1.0 V. A function of the optional voltage divider 11, if present in the motor control system 10 of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref>, is therefore to decrease the amplitude of the position feedback signal Ps to a smaller value. As an example, if e.g. R4 = 1 kΩ, and R3 = 13 kΩ, then R4/(R3+R4) = 1/14, so that the original feedback signal range in the example of about 0.6 V to about 11.4 V would, as an approximation, be reduced to a range of about 0.04 V to about 0.81 V. More exact results can be obtained by e.g. circuit simulations.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">When comparing <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B and FIG. 3C</figref> it can be seen that the node of the potentiometer 3 located at the right in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B and FIG. 3C</figref> is always the positive node, independent of whether the first power signal Us is larger or smaller than the second power signal Ts, hence the notation "+", and that the node located on the left in these figures is always the negative node, hence indicated by "-".</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">For completeness it should be mentioned that no current flows through the potentiometer 3 in case the instantaneous voltage level of Us equals that of Ts, at which moment also no power is<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> provided to the motor 1. Thus no position feedback is provided at a moment in time when the motor 1 is not being powered, i.e. when no voltage difference is applied over the motor terminals.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">It is an advantage of the circuit illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref> that the motor module 2 only requires three instead of five wires, thus saving material and handing costs, and that it enables the motor 1 to be driven selectively in either direction (clockwise or counter clockwise), which makes it suitable for many applications, and that the motor position can be read, even when the motor 1 is in a stationary position. This last aspect is further explained below.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">If the motor position is to be determined without intentionally forcing the motor 1 to rotate, a "short" pulse (e.g. less than 5 ms, or less than 1 ms, e.g. less than 500 µs) can be applied to the power wires U, T. For example Us = 12 V and Ts = 0 V (further referred to as a "clockwise power pulse") during a time period of e.g. 20 µs (microseconds). Thanks to the inertia of the motor 1, it will only marginally rotate to the right. The time period should be sufficiently large for reading the position information, and sufficiently short for not moving the motor 1 "too far" (e.g. beyond a predefined angular position). If desired, another pulse can then be applied to the motor 1 for moving the motor marginally back counter clockwise, so as to compensate the first pulse, e.g. by applying Us = 0 V and Ts = 12 V (further referred to as a "counter clockwise power pulse") during the same period. It will be clear for a person skilled in the art that the first pulse may be a "counter clockwise pulse", and that then optionally a second, "clockwise pulse" may be given to compensate for this first pulse.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">If the motor 1 needs to be moved to a desired target position, e.g. a predefined target position, which position subsequently needs to be maintained, the motor controller 10 may repeatedly, e.g. periodically apply clockwise or counter clockwise power pulses, having a fixed or a variable pulse duration, to the power wires U, T for moving the motor 1 to the desired position. Once that position is reached, "clockwise" and "counter clockwise power pulses" may alternately be applied for moving the motor 1 marginally clockwise, and marginally back counter clockwise, thereby in effect maintaining the motor position with a given torque. During these power pulses the motor position can be measured, and the duration of the "clockwise" and "counter clockwise power pulses" may be adjusted for maintaining the motor position. Alternatively, when the motor 1 has reached the target position, the motor controller 10 may put the same signal, e.g. Us = Ts = 0 V or Us = Ts = 12 V, to both power wires U and T during a predetermined time period. Such a combination is not regarded as a "power pulse", since the motor 1 will not "see" a voltage difference over its terminals. Although the examples are given for 0 V and 12 V, the present invention is not limited to these values, and other voltage values smaller than 12 V, or larger than 12 V may also be used. Instead of applying the low voltage signal such as 0 V or the high voltage signal such as 12 V, to both power wires U, T, it is also possible to leave one (or both) of the power wires U, T "floating", e.g. by putting the output pins in "tri-state" mode (also known as "high-impedance" mode). It is to be noted, however, that during such a time period the motor position cannot be read, so, after a while, a short "clockwise" or "counter clockwise power pulse" should be applied again to the lines U, T for reading the motor position, and for adjusting the position if needed.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0075" num="0075">In an embodiment where the motor controller 10 is an integrated circuit having a programmable digital processing unit CPU and general purpose input-output pins io1-io5, such power pulses may e.g. be easily created by setting some of the io-pins to logical '1' or '0'.

Thus, in a first step the position of the first motor M1 is measured as described above, e.g. by applying a short "clockwise or counter clockwise power pulse". Based on a comparison of the first target position and the actual first motor position, a suitable DC-signal and/or pulse signal and/or PWM-signal is determined and applied to the first motor 1, by providing appropriate first and second power signals Us1, Us2 and T to the five-wire interface 13. For example, if a clockwise torque is to be applied to the first motor, the first power signal Us1 to the first motor may be set to +12V, and the second power signal T to the first motor may be 0 V, but this is also the second power signal of the second motor M2. If no torque is to be exerted on the second motor M2, the first power signal Us2 to the second motor M2 may be set equal to the second power signal Ts, in this example 0 V, or may be set to tri-state. A method similar to that described in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US5705907A"><text>US 5,705,907</text></patcit> may be used to limit the overshoot. The time required for bringing the first motor M1 in its desired position depends on several factors, for example: the angular distance between the start-position and the end-position, any external force exerted upon the first motor M1,<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> etc. When the first motor M1 has reached its destination within a predefined margin of e.g. 1% or 2% or more, depending on the application requirements, the first power signal Us1 may be set to tri-state, or may be set equal to the value of Ts. In the next step the second motor M2 is brought to its target position. For example, if the second motor needs to be turned counter-clockwise, the second power signal T may then be set to +12V, and the first power signal Us2 for the second motor M2 may be set to 0V, during a second time interval, and the first power signal Us1 to the first motor may then also be set to +12V or to tri-state. And then the cycle repeats.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">Instead of bringing each motor in its desired position, one after the other, it is also possible to drive the motors M1, M2 in a time-multiplexed manner, for example to drive a first motor during a first time slot of for example 5 ms, then the second motor during 5 ms, etc, but any other method known to the person skilled in the art of driving motors, may also be used.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">It is possible for example to provide power to only one of the motors while providing no power to the other motor, e.g. by setting Us1 to +12V and Ts to 0V, and Us2 to tri-state. Alternatively it is also possible to always actively drive all first power signals Us1, Us2, e.g. by setting Us1 to +12V and Ts to 0V, and Us2 to 0V. In this case however, when the first motor is driven back and forth, in order to provide no power to the second motor M2, the signal Us2 has to change along with the second power signal, thus when Us1 is set to 0V and Ts to +12V, Us2 also needs to be set to +12V, if no power is to be applied to the second motor.

However, it is understood that embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure an understanding of this description.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">Although the invention is described by using specific values for the supply voltage VDD, for the resistance of the potentiometer 3, and for the voltage divider 11, it is clear that other values may also be used. Curves similar to those of <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 9</figref> can easily be determined e.g. by calculations using Kirchhoff's laws, or by circuit simulation tools.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><heading id="h0006"><u>REFERENCES:</u></heading><p id="p0107" num="0107"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>1</dt><dd>DC-motor</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>motor module</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>variable resistor, e.g. potentiometer</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>motor control system</dd><dt>10</dt><dd>motor controller</dd><dt>11</dt><dd>voltage divider</dd><dt>12</dt><dd>rectifier circuit</dd><dt>13</dt><dd>wire-interface</dd><dt>14</dt><dd>external H-bridge</dd><dt>15</dt><dd>wires, e.g. loose wires</dd><dt>Us</dt><dd>first power signal</dd><dt>Ts</dt><dd>second power signal</dd><dt>Ps</dt><dd>position signal</dd><dt>Vdd</dt><dd>supply voltage</dd><dt>Gnd</dt><dd>ground</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56976274" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A motor control system (4) for controlling a plurality (N) of DC-motors (1), the motor control system (4) comprising:
