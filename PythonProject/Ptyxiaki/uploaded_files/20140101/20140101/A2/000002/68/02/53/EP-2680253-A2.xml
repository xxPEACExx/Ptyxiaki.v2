In general, in a liquid crystal display device, so-called "burn-in" (also known as "screen burn-in" or "screen burn"), which results in the display device not being able to reproduce tone characteristics due to a charge bias, occurs when a DC voltage is kept applied between pixel and counter electrodes for a long period of time.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For this reason, the liquid crystal display device is driven as follows. That is, for example, an input image signal having a frame rate of 60 Hz is doubled to 120 Hz to define sub-frames, so as not to cause any charge bias. Then, the polarity of a signal voltage to be applied to liquid crystal for each sub-frame is periodically inverted with respect to a common electrode voltage (VCOM). In this case, a driving operation for inverting the polarity of a signal voltage to be applied to a liquid crystal for each sub-frame<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> is called a sub-frame inversion AC driving operation.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">On the other hand, in a hold type display device represented by a liquid crystal display device, when a following view of a moving object is made (a way of viewing a moving object while being followed by a line of sight in movie display), a motion blur according to a light output period is observed. As a technique for suppressing such motion blur, a "spatial frequency separation method" has been proposed. The "spatial frequency separation method" is a display method which concentrates spatial high frequency components involved in a motion blur on one sub-frame and reduces them in the other sub-frame. Thus, since spatial high frequency components are locally included in one sub-frame in an output image, a motion blur can be suppressed.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, in the "spatial frequency separation method", since different voltages are applied between sub-frames, an applied voltage is biased to one polarity, and burn-in is generated upon driving for a long period of time. For this reason, a technique for further suppressing a motion blur by reducing an increase in charge accumulated amount by correcting a driving waveform in the "spatial frequency separation method" according to an accumulated value of differences between sub-frames, that is, a charge<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> accumulated amount has been disclosed (patent literature 1 (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2009042481A"><text>2009-042481</text></patcit>)). Also, a technique for preventing an applied voltage from being biased by extending a polarity inversion driving period from a sub-frame unit to a frame unit has been disclosed (patent literature 2 (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2008064919A"><text>2008-064919</text></patcit>)).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">With the technique disclosed in patent literature 1, since an accumulated value of differences between sub-frames is stored, a charge accumulated amount can be estimated with high precision, while a frame memory is required. Hence, it is difficult to implement this technique in a system in which a memory band is limited.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The method of extending the polarity inversion period disclosed in patent literature 2 suffers a problem that flicker is readily viewed due to a long polarity inversion period. Since the "spatial frequency separation method" temporally divides spatial frequency components and displays them on respective sub-frames, in movie display with a quick motion, low frequency components are temporally shifted with respect to high frequency components due to their display time difference, and are often viewed as a tailing phenomenon.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention has been made in consideration of the aforementioned problems, and embodiments of the invention provide a technique for suppressing a motion blur by the "spatial frequency separation method", and eliminating a tailing phenomenon caused by a display time difference of respective frequency components.

Then, in this case, in the "spatial frequency separation method", high-frequency components involved in a motion blur are locally included in one sub-frame, thus suppressing the motion blur. On the other hand, since spatial frequency components are temporally divided and are displayed on respective sub-frames, in movie display with a quick motion, low frequency components are temporally shifted and viewed with respect to high frequency components. In this case, a viewing phenomenon of temporally shifted low frequency components will be referred to as a tailing phenomenon<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> hereinafter. In this embodiment, in order to eliminate a tailing phenomenon viewed due to a temporal barycenter shift in display, a low frequency component image is generated after images are composited between frames. An example of the functional arrangement of the image processing apparatus according to this embodiment will be described first with reference to the block diagram shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">To a frame rate conversion unit 101, images of respective frames which form a movie are sequentially input.
