When a nucleus is placed in a magnetic field, an energy state thereof is split into a plurality of energy levels by Zeeman splitting. Giving an energy equal to the difference in these energy levels (determined by frequency) as electromagnetic waves will cause absorption and emission of energy. This phenomenon is the nuclear magnetic resonance. NMR apparatuses and MRI apparatuses are widely used not only in the fields of physics and chemistry but also in other various fields, such as biology, medical sciences, pharmaceutical sciences, agricultural sciences, material sciences, and chemical engineering. For instance, they are used in structure determination and identification in organic chemistry, analysis of protein structure and intermolecular interactions, and medical MRI.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Such apparatuses can measure a subtle frequency difference due to a magnetic environment around atoms of the same isotope in a sample and relaxation in nuclear magnetic resonance. Such measurement can provide information about a chemical shift, signal intensity (quantitative determination), relaxation time, spin coupling, and NOE (nuclear Overhauser effect). Such information enables determination of the molecular structure, intermolecular interaction, and mobility. These apparatuses are advantageous in that they can perform atomic-level measurement noninvasively. On the other hand, they suffer from a problem of low measurement signal intensities (low sensitivities). This is because the numbers of atoms in which the respective energy levels are occupied follow the Boltzmann distribution and the energy difference resulting from Zeeman splitting is very small.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Because the signal intensity is proportional to the 3/2 power of the magnetic field intensity, development of NMR apparatuses and MRI apparatuses focusing on the enhancement of the magnetic field intensity has been performed. At the present day, a strong magnetic field as high as or higher than 23.5 T (i.e. 1 GHz in the resonance frequency of <sup>1</sup>H) is required in the measurement of residual magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, TROSY effect, and measurement of quadrupolar nuclei. Thus, it is expected that the magnetic field intensity will be increasing in the future with development of superconducting magnets.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">To cause nuclear magnetic resonance, an antenna (or RF coil) that transmits and receives a signal of a nuclear magnetic resonance frequency in a direction perpendicular to the direction of static magnetic field generated by a superconducting magnet is needed. A high frequency signal is transmitted to the RF coil from a power amplifier to apply a high frequency magnetic field (B<sub>1</sub> magnetic field) to a sample to be measured, thereby creating an excited state in it. Then, an NMR signal emitted from the measurement sample is received by the RF coil.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">RF coils shown in <figref idrefs="f0020">Figs. 19A and 19B</figref> are known as conventional RF coils used in NMR apparatuses and MRI apparatuses. The coil shown in <figref idrefs="f0020">Fig. 19A</figref> is described in, for example, non-patent document 1 and called an Alderman-Grant type coil. The coil shown in <figref idrefs="f0020">Fig. 19B</figref> is described in, for example, non-patent document 2 and called a saddle type coil. The number of turns of these coils is one. This is because an increase in the number of turns of an RF coil leads to a decrease in the self resonance frequency, making it impossible to be used as an RF coil at high frequencies.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The self resonance frequency is the highest value of frequencies at which a coil can behave as a coil. A coil inherently has a stray capacitance, and parallel resonance occurs between the inductance and the stray capacitance,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> leading to self resonance. At frequencies higher than the self resonance frequency, a coil does not function as a coil but a capacitor.</p><heading id="h0003">[PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS]</heading><heading id="h0004">[NON-PATENT DOCUMENTS]</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">Non-patent Document 1: <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Alderman DW, Grant DM.

The self resonance frequency of such an RF coil is approximately in the range of 900 MHz to 1 GHz. In cases where the nuclear magnetic resonance frequency exceeds 1 GHz (corresponding to a static magnetic field intensity of 23.5 T), an RF coil intended for use in an apparatus using a resonance frequency of 900 MHz cannot be used without modification. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the self resonance frequency of the RF coil to a frequency higher than the self resonance frequencies of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> conventional RF coils.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The increase in the self resonance frequency of the RF coil is required not only in NMR apparatuses with nuclear resonance frequencies higher than 1 GHz. The self resonance frequency of an RF coil is determined by the size of the RF coil and other factors. Therefore, in NMR apparatuses and MRI apparatuses using resonance frequencies lower than 1 GHz also, the limit of self resonance frequency will be reached eventually as the nuclear resonance frequency is increased with increases in the magnetic field intensity.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The simplest method of increasing the self resonance frequency is to reduce the diameter of the RF coil and/or a measurement sample. However, this undesirably leads to a decrease in the measurement sensitivity. Another method is to increase the distance between a vertical band part and a guard ring. However, in this method, although the self resonance frequency increases with a decrease in a capacitance component, the diameter of the coil becomes larger with the diameter of the measurement sample space being unchanged, resulting in an increased distance between the coil and the measurement sample. Moreover, the volume of the space that is irradiated with the high frequency magnetic field but not occupied by the measurement sample will also become larger, leading to a decrease in the efficiency of the RF coil, namely deterioration in the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> performance of the RF coil.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In view of the above-described problems, an object of the present invention is to provide an RF coil for use in measurement of nuclear magnetic resonance that has a self resonance frequency higher than those of conventional RF coils and does not cause a decrease in the measurement sensitivity.</p><heading id="h0007">[Means for Solving the Problems]</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">An RF coil according to the present invention is an RF coil used to induce or detect nuclear magnetic resonance comprising:

A main coil 102 made of a superconducting wire is wound inside a superconducting magnet 101. The main coil 102 is typically disposed in an insulating container (not shown) that can contain liquid helium or the like so as to be cooled to a temperature equal to or lower than the phase transition temperature. An NMR probe 103 is composed of a base part disposed outside the magnet and a cylindrical part inserted inside the magnet. The cylindrical part is typically inserted into a cylindrical bore 104 passing through the superconducting magnet 101 along its center axis upwardly from the lower opening.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0019">Fig. 18B</figref> is a diagram showing the inner structure of the NMR probe 103. A sample tube containing a sample solution to be measured is inserted into the NMR probe 103 from above. The NMR probe 103 has an RF coil 106, which is built therein to apply a magnetic field B<sub>1</sub> oriented perpendicular to a static magnetic field B<sub>0</sub> generated by the superconducting magnet 101. The RF coil 106 applies a high frequency magnetic field B<sub>1</sub> to a sample to induce nuclear magnetic resonance and detect (or receive)<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> electromagnetic waves (NMR signal) generated with relaxation. The diameter of a standard sample tube is 5 mm, and the diameter of the RF coil 106 is larger than 5 mm accordingly. Typically, the smallest inner diameter of the RF coil is in the range of 5.4 mm to 10 mm. The frequency of the magnetic field in the lateral direction generated by the RF coil 106 is proportional to the intensity of the static magnetic field. For instance, when the intensity of the static magnetic is 24.2 T, a magnetic field having a frequency of 1.03 GHz is needed.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">To generate a high frequency magnetic field, it is necessary for the RF coil 106 to have a self resonance frequency higher than the frequency of the high frequency magnetic field. The self resonance frequency is the highest value of frequencies at which a coil can behave as a coil. A coil has a stray capacitance, and parallel resonance occurs between the inductance and the stray capacitance, leading to self resonance. The self resonance frequency of the RF coil 106 is expressed by the following equation: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mi>f</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>π</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msqrt><mi mathvariant="italic">LC</mi></msqrt></mrow></mfrac><mo>,</mo></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="24" he="8" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
where L is the inductance of the coil, and C is the capacitance of the coil.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">A possible solution for increasing the self resonance frequency is to decrease the inductance L by reducing the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> size of the RF coil and/or decreasing the number of turns thereof. Reducing the size of the RF coil will make conventional 5-mm sample tubes unusable. The number of turns of the RF coil is one, which cannot be decreased further. Even if the self resonance frequency is increased by a reduction in the size of the RF coil, a decrease in the volume of the sample is necessitated, leading to deterioration in the measurement sensitivity.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">For the above reason, it is necessary for a solution for increasing the self resonance frequency to decrease the capacitance without changing the size of the RF coil. Capacitance components of the Alderman-Grant coil shown in <figref idrefs="f0020">Fig. 19A</figref> include a capacitance in opposed wing portions of vertical band parts, a capacitance between the vertical band parts and guard rings, and a stray capacitance between the RF coil and a metal part(s) around it. The equivalent circuit of the Alderman-Grant coil is shown in <figref idrefs="f0021">Fig. 20</figref>.

The capacitance between the vertical band parts and the guard rings is constituted by a capacitance C<sub>LG</sub> between one vertical band part and the guard rings and a capacitance C<sub>RG</sub> between the other vertical band part and the guard rings that are connected in series.

In this embodiment, the wing portions of the Alderman-Grant coil are removed, so that the areas where the vertical band parts and the guard rings face each other are decreased, leading to decrease in the capacitance. The RF coil according to this embodiment will be referred to as a straight type coil in this specification.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The RF coil 10 according to this embodiment is basically composed of an upper guide ring 11, a lower guide ring 12, and two vertical band parts 13, 14.

The left-right direction refers to a direction perpendicular to the direction of the static magnetic field. However, in some NMR apparatuses (or MRI apparatuses), the static magnetic field is oriented in a direction different from the vertical direction (e.g. in a horizontal direction). In such cases, the terms used in this specification concerning directions should be construed accordingly.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The guard rings 11, 12 are cylindrical (including elliptic cylindrical) in shape and arranged coaxially with a space therebetween along the axis of the cylinders. The vertical band parts 13, 14 are arranged outside the guard rings 11, 12 and extending in the up-down direction. The vertical band parts 13, 14 are arranged outside the guard rings 11, 12 and opposed to each other. In this embodiment, the vertical band parts 13, 14 have circular arc shapes (including elliptic arc shapes) in their horizontal cross sections running along the outer circumference of the guard rings 11, 12. In this embodiment, the upper ends of the<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> vertical band parts 13, 14 and the upper end of the upper guard ring 11 are at the same level, and the lower ends of the vertical band parts 13, 14 and the lower end of the lower guard ring 12 are at the same level. However, it is not essential for the ends of the vertical band parts 13, 14 and the ends of the guard rings to be at the same level, but they may be at different levels.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">A cylindrical dielectric member (not shown) such as a quartz tube is provided between the vertical band parts 13, 14 and the guard rings 11, 12.

Therefore, if the RF coil is rigid enough to be able to keep its shape independently, the cylindrical dielectric member may be eliminated.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Power supply to the coil may be provided in any suitable manner. For example, power may be supplied through the vertical band parts and the guard rings, through the two vertical band parts, or through the two guard rings.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In this embodiment, the edges of the vertical band parts 13, 14 with respect to the circumferential direction are straight. In this respect, the coil of this embodiment differs from the Alderman-Grant coil, in which the vertical band parts have wing portions provided near the guard rings.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> While the axial end portions of the vertical band parts in this embodiment may be tapered, it is preferred that the vertical band parts be straight in the axial region in which the guard rings do not exist. This region will be hereinafter referred to as the "window", in this specification.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">With this configuration, the areas where the vertical band parts and the guard rings face each other are decreased, and the capacitance is decreased accordingly. Therefore, the self resonance frequency can be increased. On the other hand, the coil size and the inductance are not decreased. Therefore, the measurement sensitivity is not lowered. A further advantage is that since the edges, through which current flows, are not angled in the window region, no loss occurs. A still further advantage is that the shape of the RF coil is simple, so that it tends not to disturb the evenness of the static magnetic field (B<sub>0</sub>). A sill further advantage is that manufacturing of the coil is easy thanks to its simple shape.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> shows the result of analysis of characteristics of the RF coil according to this embodiment performed by simulation. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a chart called a Smith chart, which shows complex impedances at different frequencies in a case where a power supply port is attached to the RF coil.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047"><!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> First, the simulation method used will be described. In the simulation, transient response analysis was carried out using three-dimensional high frequency electromagnetic field simulation software MICOWAVE STUDIO developed by CST. Two short wires were attached to the two vertical bands of the RF coil respectively, and a balanced power supply port matched to 50 ohms was attached to connect the free ends of the two wires. In this analysis, high frequency pulses are input from the power supply port, and the response of the RF coil thereto is computed using the FDTD method, which is a time-domain electromagnetic field analysis method. The result in the frequency domain can be obtained by Fourier-transforming the pulse input and the result in the time domain. Results that can be obtained include magnetic field distributions, electric field distributions, and current distributions at respective frequencies in the object of the analysis, storage and loss of energy caused by them, and complex impedances at respective frequencies (Smith chart) as response for the power supply port. The self resonance frequency of the RF coil can be determined by analyzing the Smith chart thus obtained . It is also possible to evaluate the performance of the RF coil using the above-described results in combination.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In cases where results of simulation and values obtained by measurement performed on the RF coil actually made are to be compared, the dimensions of the gaps between the vertical band parts and the cylindrical dielectric part<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> such as the quartz tube and between the cylindrical dielectric part such as the quartz tube and the guard rings (typically less than 0.1 mm) may be taken into account in the simulation to improve accuracy of analysis. However, this leads to a vast number of computational meshes and long computation time. For this reason such computation is not performed in typical cases. In terms of relative values such as a change in the self resonance frequency depending on the shape of the RF coil, there is no significant difference between a value obtained by simulation taking into account the dimensions of gaps and a value obtained by simulation not taking into account them. Therefore, simulation not taking into account the dimensions of gaps can provide computation with high accuracy, and the results are reliable. When the RF coil is used in an NMR apparatus or an MRI apparatus, the resonance frequency of the RF coil varies depending on the measurement sample. A typical countermeasure against this is the use of a trimmer capacitor for adjustment connected to the RF coil. Providing the trimmer capacitor for adjustment increases the capacitance, leading to a lowering of the resonance frequency. Therefore, in the actual design, analysis, and manufacturing of the RF coil, it is necessary to take them into account in determining the resonance frequency of the RF coil.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In the Smith chart, the complex impedance at each frequency is represented by a point. As the frequency<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> becomes higher, the point typically shifts clockwise. If the point representing the complex impedance of a certain device at a certain frequency exists in the upper half of the Smith chart, the device will behave as an inductance at this frequency. If the point exists in the lower half of the Smith chart, the device will behave as a capacitance.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In the case of an actual device or simulation for analyzing it, the complex impedance may change in a complicated manner, and the point on the Smith chart may revolve plural times with increasing frequency in some cases. This indicates that the device has various magnetic fields, electric fields, and current distributions (modes) that vary from one frequency range to another. This is also the case with the RF coil. The mode in which the RF coil can generate a high frequency magnetic field in a direction perpendicular to the static magnetic field is the first mode, namely in the lowest frequency range among the frequency ranges existing in the upper half of the Smith chart. Therefore, the self resonance frequency, which represents the limit of usability as an RF coil, is a frequency corresponding to the point that passes the rightmost point of the Smith chart downward earliest among the points representing complex impedances that revolve clockwise on the Smith chart with increasing frequency.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">From another viewpoint, the RF coil of this embodiment can be regarded as a parallel resonance circuit<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> of inductance (L) and capacitance (C). The complex impedance of the LC parallel resonance circuit is infinite at the resonance frequency, and it is located at the rightmost point of the Smith chart.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The self resonance frequency of an RF coil according to this embodiment designed for use with an NMR sample tube having a diameter of 5 mm was computed by the above-described method. The result was 1066 MHz. On the other hand, in the case of a conventional Alderman-Grant RF coil with two separated vertical bands having the same diameter design, the self resonance frequency obtained as the result was 842 MHz. Therefore, it was verified that the self resonance frequency was increased greatly by 224 MHz and that the RF coil according to the embodiment can be used at higher frequencies.</p><heading id="h0012">&lt;Modification of First Embodiment&gt;</heading><p id="p0053" num="0053">In the above-described first embodiment, the vertical band parts have straight shapes. The vertical band parts may have tapered shapes (normal tapered shapes) with their widths becoming smaller toward the ends in their end portions 13u, 13b, 14u, 14b with respect to the axial direction. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1B</figref>, the vertical band parts may be straight in the window region in which the guard rings are not exist and tapered in the region in which the guard rings exist. Alternatively, tapering may be beginning from the window region. It is preferred that the<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> vertical band parts have rounded shapes without angled sharp edges in their end portions. Not having angled edges can lead to reduced loss. The tapered shapes allow a further reduction of the areas where the vertical band parts and the guard rings face each other, leading to a further reduction of the capacitance.</p><heading id="h0013">&lt;Second Embodiment: Separate Wing Type&gt;</heading><p id="p0054" num="0054"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3A</figref> shows the outer appearance of an RF coil according to the second embodiment.

In this embodiment, such capacitance is attributed to two capacitors in a series arrangement formed between the vertical band parts and the separate wing parts. If the distances between the vertical band<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> parts and the separate wing parts in this embodiment are equal to the distances between the wing portions in the Alderman-Grant coil, the capacitance component in this embodiment can be made equal to half the capacitance component in the Alderman-Grant coil. If the distances between the vertical band parts and the separate wing parts in this embodiment are larger than half of those in the Alderman-Grant coil, the overall capacitance component in this embodiment can be made smaller. Moreover, as with in the first embodiment, the self resonance frequency can be increased with a decrease in the capacitance resulting from a decrease in the areas where the vertical band parts and the guard rings face each other.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> shows the result of analysis of characteristics of the RF coil according to this embodiment performed by simulation. <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a Smith chart showing complex impedances at different frequencies in a case where a power supply port is attached to the RF coil.

Therefore, the capacitance between the guard ring 31 and the vertical band part 34 becomes smaller, and the combined capacitance through the guard ring 31 also becomes smaller.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065"><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 7</figref> shows the result of analysis of characteristics of the RF coil according to this embodiment performed by simulation. <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 7</figref> is a Smith chart showing complex impedances at different frequencies in a case where a power supply port is attached to the RF coil. The self resonance frequency of an RF coil according to this embodiment designed for use with an NMR sample tube having a diameter of 5 mm was computed by the above-described method. The result was 876 MHz. On the other hand, in the case of a conventional Alderman-Grant RF coil with two separated vertical bands having the same diameter design, the self resonance frequency obtained as the result was 842 MHz. Therefore, it was verified that the self resonance frequency was increased a little by 34 MHz and that the RF<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> coil according to the embodiment can be used at higher frequencies. Then, the RF coil was modified to have vertical band parts that are shortened in their straight portions as shown in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 10B</figref>, and simulation was performed again for this modified RF coil. The result was that the self resonance frequency was increased to 1148 MHz. This result revealed that the self resonance frequency of the RF coil according to the present invention can easily be increased by modifying the shape of the straight portions.</p><heading id="h0016">&lt;Modification of Third Embodiment&gt;</heading><p id="p0066" num="0066">The shape of the RF coil according to the third embodiment can be modified in various manners.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">In the third embodiment also, as with in the first and second embodiments, the vertical band parts may have tapered shapes (normal tapered shapes) as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6B</figref>. In the case of this embodiment, the straight end portion (not having a wing portion) of the vertical band part is tapered. In the case where the straight portion of the vertical band part is tapered, the wing portion may have a shape having a width that becomes larger toward the end (reverse tapered shape) as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6C</figref>. In <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6C</figref>, the degree (or angle) of tapering of the vertical band parts and the degree of tapering of the wing portions are the same so that the distances between them are constant. However, the degrees of tapering need not be necessarily the same. If they are designed to have different degrees<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> of tapering, the distances between the vertical band parts and the separate wing parts may become either larger or smaller toward the ends.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">The straight end portion of the vertical band may have a shape having a width that becomes larger toward the end (reverse tapered shape) instead of becoming smaller toward the end. In this case, the wing portion may have either a straight shape or a shape having a width that becomes smaller toward the end (normal tapered shape).</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">The vertical band parts and the wing portions may form an angle other than 90 degrees.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 6D</figref>, both of the two vertical band parts 33, 34 may be provided with wing portions. In the illustrated case, in the upper region, the lengths along the circumferential direction of the wing portions 34c, 34d of the vertical band part 34, which are opposed to the wing portions 33a, 33b of the vertical band part 33 respectively with respect to the circumferential direction, are shorter than the lengths along the circumferential direction of the wing portions 33a, 33b. In the lower region, similarly, the lengths along the circumferential direction of the wing portions 33c, 33d of the vertical band part 33, which are opposed to the wing portions 34a, 34b of the vertical band part 34 respectively with respect to the circumferential direction, are shorter than the lengths along the<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> circumferential direction of the wing portions 34a, 34b. This modification may be regarded as a modification of the RF coil shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6A</figref>, in which the straight portions of the vertical bands are modified to have wing portions shorter than the wing portions of the opposed vertical bands in their end regions. This modification may also be regarded as a modification of the Alderman-Grant coil, in which the lengths along the circumferential direction of the two opposed wing portions are different. In the case shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 6D</figref>, in the upper end region, the lengths along the circumferential direction of the wing portions of the vertical band part 33 are larger and the lengths along the circumferential direction of the wing portions of the vertical band part 34 are smaller. However, this is not essential. For example, the length along the circumferential direction of the wing portion 33a may be larger than the length along the circumferential direction of the wing portion 34c, and the length along the circumferential direction of the wing portion 34d may be larger than the length along the circumferential direction of the wing portion 33b. In other words, the point is that the wing portions opposed to each other have different lengths along the circumferential direction. In the RF coils having such a feature, capacitances between the vertical band parts and guard rings have a difference. In consequence, the combined capacitance between the vertical bands through a guard ring is smaller than that in the case in which the two capacitances equal to each other are<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> connected in series like in the case of the Alderman-Grant coil.

However, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0018">Fig. 17A</figref>, one vertical band part may be designed to be straight on both ends, and the other vertical band part may have wing portions on both ends. More specifically, while one vertical band part 33 is straight in both the upper and lower end regions, the other vertical band part 34 has wing portions 34a, 34b projecting toward the vertical band part 33 in the upper end region and wing portions 34c, 34d projecting toward the vertical band part 33 in the lower end region. The end portions of the straight vertical band part 33 may be tapered (in either normal tapering or reverse tapering), and the wing portions may also be tapered (in either normal tapering or reverse tapering).</p><heading id="h0017">&lt;Other Modifications&gt;</heading><p id="p0072" num="0072">The above descriptions are directed merely to illustrative embodiments of the present invention, and the RF coil according to the present invention can be implemented in various ways.</p><heading id="h0018">(1.

In particular, in cases where the vertical band parts have straight shapes (including tapered shapes) in the end region, it is preferred that ends of the vertical band parts be at a level different from the end of the guard rings so as to make the capacitance smaller.
