For example, pixel clusters (RGB clusters) formed by red, blue, and green light emitting diodes, which are associated with diverse lightning effects, have been connected in series when used in different lighting bodies for rendering possible long-distance lighting strings.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Such lighting equipments are mostly designed according to the appearance of the architecture. When the desired lighting coverage of the building is greater or the lighting design is more complicated, a greater number of light-emitting diode (LED) driver ICs must be connected in series to form a longer string of the pixel clusters.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, control signals for controlling all stages of the LED driver IC in such a long string and serially connected pixel cluster are not a single global signal. For example, the control signal for the LED driver IC in one stage may come from the control signal for the LED driver IC in the previous stage. Therefore, the control signal that is inputted into one stage may be shifted in its duty cycle as the result of the transmission, and that may lead to distortion in later stages because of the cumulative effect of the shifts occurring in the previous stages. To solve this problem, conventional methods directly compensate the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> control signal before the control signal is inputted into the next stage. However, the compensated control signal may only target the distortions of certain types and not be the "one-size-fits-all" solution for all above-mentioned shifts.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In addition, in the context of the serially connected stages noises in the previous stages may propagate into subsequent stages, affecting all serially subsequent connected stages. In short, the propagation of the noises that enter into the picture of the transmission at one stage may further result in the erroneous decoding in the subsequent stages, leaving the conventional control circuits to be desired.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">In view of the above problems, the instant disclosure discloses a single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus and method and serially connected single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatuses. The proposed apparatus is capable of synchronously transmitting the signals and minimizing the accumulation of the signal attenuation and the propagation of the noises.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The instant disclosure discloses a single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus for receiving and transmitting a serial packet. The serial packet has a plurality of signal segments, wherein each of the signal segments includes a data field and a stuff time symbol. The data field has multiple logic 0/1 signal symbols, and the accumulated numbers of the logic 0/1 signal symbols in each of the data fields are the same. Each of the data fields is followed by the stuff time symbol. The single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus processes the serial packet to output the signal segments sequentially. After the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus outputs the data field which is from the previous inputting signal segment, the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus continues outputting the stuff time symbol until the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus starts to processes the next inputting signal segment in the received serial packet, which may be the current inputting signal segment.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In one embodiment, at the time the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus begins to process the current inputting signal segment, the same single wire<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> signal regeneration transmitting apparatus begins to output the data field from the previous inputting signal segment. And the current inputting signal segment is subsequent to the previous inputting signal segment in the received serial package.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In one embodiment, the time duration of each of the signal segments received by the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus is the same as the time duration of each of the signal segments outputted by the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In one embodiment, the time duration of each of the data fields outputted by the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus is fixed. The duty cycles of each of the logic 0 signal symbols and each of the logic 1 signal symbols are fixed as well.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In one embodiment, the time duration of each of the stuff time symbols outputted by the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus is adjustable.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In one embodiment, the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus resets if failing to receive the serial packet within a predetermined period of time.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In one embodiment, when the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus processes the current inputting signal segment, the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus counts the logic 0/1 signal symbols in the data field of the current inputting signal segment in order to generate a counting number. The single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus determines whether the counting number and a preset number match. If the counting number does not match the preset number, the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus stops outputting any signal segments until the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus resets. And after the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus resets it may receive and process the next inputting serial packet.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In one embodiment, the logic 0 signal symbol, the logic 1 signal symbol, and the stuff time symbol are RZ code.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In one embodiment, the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus includes a signal decoder, a signal register, and a signal encoder. The signal decoder receives the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> serial packet and decodes every signal segment of the serial packet in order to generate a corresponding bit segment when receiving the stuff time symbol. The signal register is coupled to the signal decoder for storing the bit segments sequentially. When the signal decoder decodes the current signal segment, the signal register outputs the bit segments associated with the data field of the previous inputting signal segment. The signal encoder is coupled to the signal register to receive the bit segments, and transforms each of the bit segments to the data field for output. Thereafter, the signal encoder outputs the stuff time symbol until the signal decoder starts to decode next inputting signal segment.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In one embodiment, the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus further comprises a first controller and a selector. The first controller is coupled to the signal decoder to receive the serial packet and the stuff time informing signal in order to confirm the location of the stuff time symbol at the serial packet, and to count the counting numbers of the logic 0/1 signal symbols between the two stuff time symbols before outputting a first control signal. Each of the stuff time informing signals corresponds to each of the stuff time symbols. The selector is coupled to the signal encoder and the first controller for receiving the first control signal, an idle signal and the signal segments outputted from the signal encoder. Then, the elector selects the signal segments outputted from the signal encoder, or the idle signal as the output.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one embodiment, the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus further includes a second controller and a signal processor. The second controller is coupled to the signal decoder to receive the stuff time symbol informing signals and counts the stuff time symbol informing signals in order to output the second control signal. Each of the multiple stuff time symbols corresponds to one of the stuff time symbols in received serial package. The signal processor is coupled to the signal register and the second controller to receive the bit segments of the signal register and the second control signal. The processor decides whether to copy the bit segments of the signal register according to the second control signal.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In one embodiment, the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus further includes a detector. The detector is coupled to the signal decoder to detect whether the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> signal decoder receives the serial packet continuously in order to generate a reset signal to reset the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The instant disclosure further discloses a serially connected single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatuses. The single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatuses are serially connected, wherein the time duration of the data fields in the signal segments received by the first single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus is the first time duration, and the time duration of the data fields of the signal segments outputted by all single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatuses is the second time duration. The second time duration is fixed, and the first time duration is greater than the second time duration, and the time duration of each of the signal segments outputted by the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus is equal to the time duration of the signal segment received by the first single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In one embodiment, each of the signal segments may correspond to the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus one by one, and each of the signal segments in the serial packet is outputted to the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus in a reversed order.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The instant disclosure discloses a method utilized by the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus. The method includes receiving a serial packet having multiple signal segments. Each of the signal segments includes a data field and a stuff time symbol, each of the data fields has multiple logic 0/1 signal symbols, the accumulated numbers of the logic 0/1 signal symbols in each of the data fields are the same, and each of the data fields is followed by the stuff time symbols. The method includes processing the serial packet in order to output the signal segments sequentially, and after each single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus outputs the data field of the current signal segment, it outputs the stuff time symbols until it starts to process the next inputting signal segment.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The instant disclosure further discloses the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus and method utilizing the same and the serially connected single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatuses. The single wire signal regeneration transmitting<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> apparatus is capable of synchronously transmitting the signals due to the time duration of the signal segments outputted by the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus has been set to be the same as the time duration of the signal segments received by the first one of the serially connected single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatuses. Furthermore, the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus outputs logic 0/1 signal symbols in approximately fixed operating period and time duration, so as to minimize the cumulative effect of the signal attenuation, Next, the apparatus in every stage receives the signal segments simultaneously by having the sequence of the signal segments of the serial packet properly arranged. In addition, the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus may minimize the propagation of the noise by checking the numbers of the logic 0/1 signal symbols between two stuff time symbols.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0023" num="0023"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of a single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus according to one embodiment of the instant disclosure;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> is a relation diagram of a serial packet, a signal segment, a data field, a logic 0/1 signal symbol, and a stuff time symbol according to one embodiment of the instant disclosure;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a detailed schematic diagram of a single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus according to one embodiment of the instant disclosure;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is the signal transmission diagram of the signal decoder unit, the signal register unit, and the signal encoder unit according to one embodiment in the instant disclosure;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> is the schematic diagram of the logic 0/1 signal symbol between the two stuff time symbols according to one embodiment of the instant disclosure;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6</figref> is another schematic diagram of the logic 0/1 signal symbol between the two stuff time symbols according to one embodiment in the instant disclosure;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic diagram of a serially connected single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatuses according to one embodiment of the instant disclosure;<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 8</figref> is a relation diagram of a serial packet SDI, a signal segments SDO1, SDO2, and SDO3 according to one embodiment of the instant disclosure; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow chart of a method utilizing the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus according to one embodiment of the instant disclosure.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0006"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b></heading><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the schematic view of a single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus 100. The single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus 100 is applied to receive serial packets, wherein each of the serial packets (SDI) has a plurality of signal segments (or in other words, the serial packet is formed by a plurality of signal segments). Each of the signal segments includes a data field and a stuff time symbol (ST). Furthermore, each of the data fields includes multiple logic 0/1 signal symbols, and an accumulated number of the logic 0/1 signal symbols in each of the data fields are the same. Each of the stuff time symbols ST is adapted to follow each of the data fields in the signal segments, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to the embodiment, the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus 100 is applied to receive a serial packet, and process the serial packet to output the signal segments (SDO) sequentially. During the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus 100 receives the current inputting signal segment (e.g., a second signal segment), the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus 100 outputs the data field which is from previous inputting signal segment (e.g., a first signal segment). And after the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus 100 finishes outputting the data field for the current inputting signal segment, the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus 100 continues outputting the stuff time symbol (ST) until it starts to process the next inputting signal segment (e.g., a third signal segment). The stuff time symbol (ST) is adapted to ensure the time duration of each of the signal segments (SDO) outputted by the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus 100 would be substantially the same as the time duration of each of the signal segments (SDI) the same single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus 100 receives.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Furthermore, the single wire signal regeneration transmitting apparatus 100 includes a signal decoder 110, a signal register 120, and a signal encoder 130. The signal decoder 110 is applied to receive and decode the serial packet SDI.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The signal decoder 110 generates a corresponding bit segment after decoding every signal segment in the serial packet SDI. Since the signal register 120 is coupled to the signal decoder 110 for storing the bit segments outputted by the signal decoder 110 sequentially, after the signal decoder 110 decodes one signal segment (e.g., the first signal segment) the signal decoder 110 outputs the bit segment (from the data field of the first signal segment) to the signal register 120 where the first signal segment is stored temporarily. Similarly, when the signal decoder 110 decodes another signal segment (e.g., the second signal segment), the signal decoder 110 outputs the bit segment corresponding to the second signal segment (from the data field of the second signal segment) to the signal register 120 where the second signal segment is temporarily stored.
