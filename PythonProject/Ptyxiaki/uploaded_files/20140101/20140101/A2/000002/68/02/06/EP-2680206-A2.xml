The "conditional payments" defined by the present invention is a conditional payment such that a purchaser and a seller are willing to fulfill an appointment to pay the payment amount there between. If a purchaser buys some goods, then he or she may request to a provisional approval at first. If the purchaser reaches a satisfactory situation such as arrival of the goods, satisfaction about the quality of the goods or the service, etc., he or she may requests to a real approval by selecting characters representing the so-called "<img id="ib0007" file="imgb0007.tif" wi="10" he="5" img-content="character" img-format="tif" inline="yes"/>".</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">In the conditional payments, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 5C</figref>, the secure payment system (10) may judge whether the purchaser<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> sufficiently reaches a satisfactory situation such as arrival of the goods, satisfaction about the quality of the goods or the service, etc., or not after a certain period of time (may be controllable) has elapsed (=step 84). If the purchaser sufficiently satisfied, the secure payment system (10) changes the provisional approval with the formal approval (=step 85). The secure payment system (10) can postpone the formal approval or cancel the provisional approval in accordance with the responses of the purchaser and the seller (=step 86). If the secure payment system (10) did not receive any response from the purchaser or the seller, it can automatically approve the conditional payment after a certain period of time has elapsed. Thus, a conditional approval process (=L15a) is finished.

Alternatively, the purchaser can easily find the franchise number of the seller by using the positional information process (16) so as to eliminate the need to enter the franchise number directly.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">If a purchaser accesses to the secure payment system (10) through the purchaser's mobile phone (20), the payment-receiving terminal (40) and the purchaser's mobile phone (20) will be placed in the same coordinate position. In general, the location of the franchise store, that is the seller, is constant and the location of the purchaser's mobile phone (20) may be changed in accordance with the movement of the purchaser. If the purchaser searches information for a dealer to sell the product he or she is going to buy by using the purchaser's mobile phone (20), then the secure payment system (10) may perceive a coordinate position of the purchaser's mobile phone (20) while running the positional information process (16).

If the purchaser selects any one franchise store among the plurality of franchise stores shown in the screen, the franchise number may be automatically inputted into the phone page of the purchaser's mobile phone (20) while running the information management process (11) and customer management process (12).
