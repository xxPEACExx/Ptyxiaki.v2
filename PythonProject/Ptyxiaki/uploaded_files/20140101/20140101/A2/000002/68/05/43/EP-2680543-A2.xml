The client computer identifies a unique Internet Protocol ("IP") address for each of these other computers. The client computer may know the IP address of a computer, or it may need to determine this IP address from a domain name using the Domain Name System (DNS).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">DNS allows people using the Internet to refer to domain names, rather than IP addresses, when accessing websites and other online services. Domain names, which employ text characters, such as letters, numbers, and hyphens (e.g., "www.example.com"), will often be easier to remember than IP addresses, which are numerical and do not contain letters or hyphens (e.g., "128.1.0.0"). In addition, a domain name may be registered before an IP address has been acquired. The DNS is the Internet's hierarchical lookup service for mapping the character-based domain names meaningful to humans into the numerical IP addresses used by internet devices.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Top-level domain (TLD) servers are responsible for maintaining zone information (usually second-level domains) and for answering the queries directed to registered domains. For example, Verisign, Inc. operates the generic top-level domains (gTLDs) for .com and .net.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The process of establishing a web site on the internet typically begins with a registrant registering a specific domain name through a registrar. The registrant may be an individual or organization that identifies a domain name, such as "example.com." The registrant contacts a registrar to process the name registration, who in turn sends the necessary domain name service information to a registry. Once the registry receives the domain name service information from the registrar, it inserts that information into a centralized database and propagates the information on the internet so that users around the world may find the domain names. The registry also provides information back to the registrar after this process is complete.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Clients of DNS systems may attempt to initiate large-scale updates of domain name service information. Such large-scale updates, however, have the potential to disrupt DNS service due to the vast amount of information that the DNS system must process. Thus, a need exists for a high-volume, high-speed approach for processing domain name service information able to effectively accommodate such large-scale updates without disruption to, or perceived sluggishness by, the client.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>SUMMARY</u></b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">Systems and methods for instantaneously updating a DNS system database using partitions and atomic switching are described, consistent with disclosed embodiments. In one embodiment, database entries may be generated based on the receipt of DNS records. One such database entry may include a flag indicating whether a partition corresponding to the received DNS records is in use. In another embodiment, a database entry may include a flag indicating whether a partition corresponding to the received DNS records is active. A new partition may be created in a database, and the received DNS records may be stored in the new partition. A specific flag may be toggled, indicating that the new partition corresponding to the received DNS records is active.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In another embodiment, systems and methods for storing records received from a client to a hard disk and simultaneously saving the records into a database in batches are described, consistent with disclosed embodiments. For example, DNS records received from a client may be stored in a memory while additional DNS records continue to be received. The DNS records may be transferred in batches from the memory to a hard disk, and the information associated with each DNS record may be written to a file. Preexisting information for each received DNS record stored in a database may be written to a separate file, and the two files may be compared to determine which DNS records in the database need to be updated.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In yet another embodiment, systems and methods for using a transparent proxy that filters DNS-related web traffic received by the DNS system are described, consistent with disclosed embodiments. In response to receiving DNS-related web traffic, such as a network packet, the received traffic may be filtered based on a user-configured IP address list. Acceptable traffic may be encoded and forwarded to a destination relay, which may then decode the forwarded traffic before performing further processing. Use of the transparent proxy and filter offers improved protection for a DNS system against distributed denial of service ("DDOS") attacks.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the application, as claimed.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the application and together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the application.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></b></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate several embodiments and, together with the description, serve to explain the disclosed principles.

Furthermore, the changes may be stored using various formats, such as logical change records or sendfile lines.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the file identifying database entries and the corresponding changes may then be copied to distribution unit 330 and validation unit 335. The file may be copied in parallel. The file may also cross a firewall 325 in order to reach distribution unit 330 and validation unit 335. Distribution unit 330 may copy the file to the resolution sites 340. The file may again be copied in parallel. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, resolution sites 340 may be configured so as to not load the file until receiving an indication that the file is valid. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, validation unit 335 may load the changes contained in the file and attempt to apply the changes to the databases contained in resolution sites 340. The validation unit may, for example, perform various checks to ensure that the databases contained in resolution sites 340 remain consistent. After attempting to load the file, validation unit 335 may record whether the file is valid or invalid. If the file is determined to be valid, validation unit 335 may generate a new file, such as a control file, indicating that the file is valid. Finally, validation unit 335 may provide the newly-generated<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> file to distribution unit 330, which in turn may copy the newly-generated file to resolution sites 340.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating exemplary processes for instantaneously updating a DNS system database containing DNS records by using partitions and atomic switching, consistent with disclosed embodiments. The use of partitions and atomic switching may improve the performance of a DNS system. In Step 410 of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>, a file containing DNS records may be received. For example, the file may be a zone file or a file describing a particular zone. As another example, the DNS records may be resource records. An entry in a first database may be generated at Step 420. Each entry in the first database may relate to a particular zone, or a version of a particular zone, and the DNS records associated with the zone. The first entry in the first database may be associated with all of the zones that are not large enough to be partitioned. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, entries in the first database may include a first field including a zone name, a second field including an indication of whether a partition, located in a third database, corresponding to the zone name is in use, and a third field including a description of the partition, located in the third database, corresponding to the zone name. The first database may be referred to as a "Resource Records Partition Table."</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">An entry in a second database may be generated at Step 430. Each entry in the second database may relate to a particular zone or a version of a particular zone. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, entries in the second database may include a first field including a zone name, and a second field including a status bit or "flag" indicating whether a partition, located in a third database, corresponding to the zone name is active or not. For example, the status bit may be set to "0" or "N" in order to indicate that the partition corresponding to the zone name is not active, and it may be set to "1" or "Y" to indicate that the partition corresponding to the zone name is active. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, a pre-existing entry in the second database may correspond to another version of the zone name associated with the newly generated entry. The status bit of the pre-existing entry may be set to "1," indicating that the partition corresponding to that version of the zone name is active. The second database may be referred to as a "Zone Table."</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">At Step 440, the status bit field corresponding to the newly-generated entry in the second database may be set to "0." At Step 450, a new partition may be created in the third database. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the new partition may be associated with the newly generated entries in the first and second databases, respectively. For example, the newly generated entry in the first database may include a description (e.g., identifying the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> location) of the new partition. Similarly, the newly generated entry in the second database may include a status bit field set to "0," indicating that the new partition is not yet active.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">At Step 460, the DNS records received at Step 410 may be stored in the new partition created at Step 450. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the DNS records may be stored in the new partition in units of one or batches of DNS records. The batches may vary in size; for example, one possible batch size may be 100,000 DNS records. Also consistent with disclosed embodiments, the DNS records, including batches of DNS records, that have been stored in the new partition may be transferred to DNS resolution sites. DNS resolution sites may include one or more servers or server systems, and may be physically located all over the world. At Step 470, the status bit field corresponding to the newly-generated entry in the second database may be toggled to "1," indicating that the new partition has become active. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the status bit field of a pre-existing entry in the second database corresponding to another version of the zone name associated with the newly generated entry may be set to "0," indicating that the partition corresponding to that version of the zone name is no longer active.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Consistent with disclosed embodiments, a partition corresponding to a previous version of the file may be deleted at Step 480. The partition may correspond to, for example, an inactive version of the file, and may therefore contain outdated DNS records. Similarly, at Step 490, an entry in the second database corresponding to a previous version of the file may be deleted. The entry may correspond to an inactive version of the file. At Step 495, an entry in the first database corresponding to a previous version of the file may also be deleted. Similarly, the entry may correspond to an inactive version of the file. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the respective deletions described above may occur in any order, including deletions occurring in parallel, and are not limited to the order as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating exemplary processes for storing records received from a client to a hard disk and simultaneously saving the records into a database in batches, consistent with disclosed embodiments. In Step 510 of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>, a DNS records may be received from a client. A client may include one or more general purpose computers, servers, or any devices capable of communicating over a network. At Step 520, the DNS records may be stored in a memory while continuing to receive DNS records from the client. The DNS records may then be transferred from the memory to a hard disk at Step 530. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the DNS records may be transferred in units of one<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> or batches. The batches may vary in size; for example, one possible batch size may be 100,000 DNS records.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">At Step 540 of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>, information associated with each DNS record received from the client may be stored into a first file. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the first file may be located on the hard disk, and the file may be written in a way to facilitate copying of the information associated with each DNS record into a database. Additional DNS records received from the client may continue to be stored into the first file. At Step 550, for each DNS record received from the client, information associated with the DNS record preexisting in a database may be stored into a second file. The second file may be written simultaneously while receiving additional DNS records from the client. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the second file may be located on the hard disk, and the file may be written in a manner similar to the format of the first file. At Step 560, information stored in the first file may be compared with information stored in the second file. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the first file may contain updated DNS records for a particular zone, and the second file may contain the preexisting (non-updated) DNS records for the same zone. Comparing the DNS records stored in the two files may, therefore, highlight those DNS records that have been updated. At Step 570, based on the comparison, updated information associated with the DNS records received from the client may be stored in the database. Storing only the updated information into the database, rather than storing all of the DNS record information received from the client, may result in time savings and greater efficiency. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the updated information may be stored in units of one or batches, in accordance with the exemplary methods described in connection with <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>, above. The batches may vary in size; for example, one possible batch size may be 100,000 DNS records.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating exemplary processes for facilitating batch copying of DNS records received from a client to a database through the use of Oracle code, for example, consistent with disclosed embodiments. At Step 610 of <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref>, a file containing DNS records may be transferred over a network. For example, one or more database servers may be communicatively connected to the network. The network may also use an Oracle-compatible file system. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the file may be an Oracle file type. At Step 620, the file may be modified by executing an Oracle-based command. For example, an Oracle-based command may modify the format of the information stored in the file. The DNS records contained in the modified file may be stored into a database containing DNS records at Step 630. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the DNS records may be<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> stored in the database in response to a command issued through an Oracle server over the network. Using the exemplary methods described in connection with <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref> may result in greater efficiency because a large number of DNS records may be stored in a single transaction, obviating the need to perform a large number of individual store transactions for the individual DNS records. Of course, exemplary processes for facilitating batch copying of DNS records may be implemented using other object-relational database management systems and associated code.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating exemplary processes for using a transparent proxy that filters DNS-related web traffic received by the DNS system, consistent with disclosed embodiments. DNS-related web traffic may be received at Step 710. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, DNS-related web traffic may include one or more network packets. For example, network packet types may include User Datagram Protocol ("UDP") packets and Transmission Control Protocol ("TCP") packets. At Step 720, the received traffic may be filtered, based on, for example, a configured IP address list. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the IP address list may be user-configured to specify name servers or host names authorized to communicate with a DNS system, such as the exemplary DNS systems described in connection with <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>. For example, web traffic with a source IP address that does not correspond to a legitimate host may be blocked. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the received traffic may be filtered based on, for example, an examination of the application layer communications. Received traffic that do not conform to a particular protocol, such as the DNS protocol, for example, may be blocked. A destination to forward the filtered traffic may be determined at Step 730. For example, the destination may be a zone relay, such as the zone relay 135 described in connection with <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the destination relay may be determined based on status checks of the destination relays and/or the use of a round robin decision scheme.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Next, the information contained in the filtered traffic may be encoded at Step 740. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, encoding may include rewriting the fields of a network packet. For example, the headers of a UDP packet may be rewritten so that the destination address is the destination relay determined at Step 730, the source address is a proxy, such as DDOS protection proxy 125 described in connection with <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, and the client IP address is appended at the end of the packet, thereby increasing the packet's length. The filtered traffic may then be forwarded to the destination relay at Step 750. Forwarding the filtered traffic to the destination relay may cause it to cross through a firewall, such as firewall 130 described in connection with <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. At Step 760, the information in the filtered traffic<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> may be decoded. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, decoding may include performing the inverse of the encoding method. Additional processing may be performed on the filtered traffic at Step 770. The processing may occur within the Linux kernel. Using the exemplary methods described in connection with <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref> may offer greater protection against DDOS attacks through the use of a user-configured IP address list and the removal of public IP addresses from filtered traffic that has been forwarded to a destination relay.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The foregoing descriptions have been presented for purposes of illustration and description.
