Namely, the apparatus prepares an operating manual list, which is edited by document preparation software used in a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> general-purpose PC, having a format that can be displayed on a display of the plant.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In preparing an operating manual list in a plant, it must be ensured that an operating manual list which is held as a master copy in its paper form and a computerized operating manual list that is to be displayed on a display system of a central control panel are identical, and any problem such as garbled characters and the difference of the line feed position as a result of format conversion does not occur with the content of the operating manual list.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In addition, as a result of the content of the computerized operating manual list becoming multifunctional, a lot of information is described in the operating manual list, and such information must be in cooperation with a monitoring screen and a warning display system; therefore, an operating manual list must be prepared in the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format. The apparatus for preparing an operating manual list according to an embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">FIG. 1 to FIG. 5</figref>.</p><heading id="h0007">(Embodiment 1)</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a flow chart showing the preparation procedure of an operating manual list in an apparatus for preparing an<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> operating manual list according to the Embodiment 1, <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> are diagrams showing the content of the operating manual list before and after format conversion in the apparatus for preparing an operating manual list according to the Embodiment 1, <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram illustrating the operation of the format conversion in the apparatus for preparing an operating manual list according to the Embodiment 1, <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram showing an operating manual list display system for an operating manual list prepared by the apparatus for preparing an operating manual list according to the Embodiment 1, and <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram showing a method of determining the suitability of the operating manual list prepared by the apparatus for preparing an operating manual list according to the Embodiment 1.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, an operating manual list display system 2 includes a plant computer system 3 for controlling a plant, a plant display 4 for displaying an operating manual list, and a CBP system 5 for description in a CBP format so that the operating manual list file is displayed on the plant display 4. The plant computer system 3 includes a plant computer database 30 in which an actuating signal database 30a required for a plant operator to operate an actuator and monitoring information, a monitoring information database 30b and a screen database 30c are stored. Corresponding to the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> plant computer database 30, the CBP system 5, which is connected to the plant computer system 3 through a network 6, includes a CBP database 50 in which an actuating signal database 50a in a CBP format, a monitoring information database 50b and a screen database 30c are stored. The information in the CBP database 50 is displayed on a display screen 40 of the plant display 4 in response to the data ID of the actuating signal, data ID of the plant data and the number of the target screen. The plant operator uses the operating manual list display system 2 to operate the plant while making a confirmation with the plant display 4 for monitoring the plant on a supervisory console of the central control panel based on the operating manual list.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Note that the Computer Based Procedure (CBP) is a computerized operating manual list described in XML so that the information from the plant computer system 3 is compatible with the display format of the plant display 4. The CBP system 5 has a function of displaying an operating manual list 11 used in the monitoring operation of the plant together with the plant computer system 3.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Next, the preparation procedure of an operating manual list in the apparatus for preparing an operating manual list according to the Embodiment 1 of the present invention will<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> be described with reference to a flow chart of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. When an operating manual list is required to be prepared or revised, first, an implementor of the operating manual list uses a general-purpose document preparation software to prepare an operating manual list file in the document format. The prepared operating manual list file is entered in an apparatus for preparing an operating manual list 1 (step S1). Then, the entered operating manual list file 10 is automatically converted from the document format into the XML format (step S2). Subsequently, the operating manual list file converted into the XML format is substituted with the CBP XML format suitable for the CBP which is the display format of the plant display (step S3). Finally, the suitability of the substitution of the operating manual list file substituted with the CBP XML format is determined, and, if needed, the modification is made (step S4). As a result of this flow, the conversion of the operating manual list file 10 prepared by the document preparation software into the operating manual list file 11 with the format (CBP XML format) suitable for the display format of the plant display 4 is completed.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> show the operating manual list file 10 prepared by the document preparation software (<figref idrefs="f0002">FiG. 2A</figref>) and the operating manual list file 11 converted into the CBP XML format (<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2B</figref>). For example, the document format (A)<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> includes the descriptions of pump A, parameter B, request screen EM-1; however, in the CBP XML format (B), pump A is converted into operation button (ON, OFF), parameter B into a real value 1.123 psi, and request screen EM-1 into an EM-1 link button. In this manner, the operating manual list 10 prepared in the document format is divided into the smallest work items (Step units). For the information obtained by the division, a function and the content of the procedure are stored in database with one Step taken as 1 unit. The divided operating manual list file is reconstructed in the operating manual list 11 in the CBP XML format that is the display format using the XML format so that the operating manual list file is displayed on the plant display 5.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Next, specific operation in the apparatus for preparing an operating manual list will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. First, procedures described in the operating manual list file 10 prepared in the document format are classified into the smallest operation units (Steps) (process P1). The operating manual list file classified into the smallest operation units (Steps) is converted into a tabular format defined in the XML format (process P2). At the same time, functions in the Steps are classified (process P3). With reference to the content of each Step whose function is classified, the operating manual list file converted into the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> XML format is substituted with the CBP XML format that is the display format of the plant display 3, and parameters are displayed and operation buttons are linked with the display library (process P4). Specifically, when substitution is made on a document file with &lt;p- parameter A&gt;, it is determined that this function is to display the ID of the parameter A, and a parameter display program is set to display the parameter A. That is to say, in the format conversion from the document file, the information required for a program incorporated in the CBP system is extracted (such as, data ID). Further, the content of the procedure in each Step whose function is classified is classified (process P5) so that the content in the Step is displayed in the CBP format (process P6). Here, referring to the style setting of the document file of the operating manual list 10, and the fact that the formatting is in the XML format, the content of the function that the document file indicates is determined, which is, in turn, substituted with a function defined in the CBP format. As a result of such conversion, the operating manual list 11 in the CBP XML format which is the display format of the plant display 4 is completed. The completed operating manual list file 11 is entered in the CBP system 5 in the operating manual list display system 2 shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, the left half side 40a of the display<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> screen 40 of the plant display 4 in the operating manual list display system 2 is an operating manual list display section showing real data for the plant. The right half side 40b is an error log display section showing an error log (described later). The operating manual list implemented in the operating manual list display system 2 includes (1) a function of requesting a monitoring screen, (2) a function of displaying a parameter, and (3) a function of operating an auxiliary machine. Such information is necessary for a monitoring operation, The information to be displayed is identical to that for the central control panel.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In order to obtain such monitoring information, a parameter or an operation button that is to be displayed in each Step of the operating manual list must be determined, and this information is extracted from the description in the document file 10 of the operating manual list. The method of the extraction is as follows: in the case of (1) a function of requesting a monitoring screen, by specifying a description format as &lt;R-EM1&gt;, this function is determined to be that of requesting an EN-1 screen. In this case, 'R' indicates a request for a screen, and EM-1 indicates the number of the screen. Similarly, by setting (2) and (3) as &lt;P-XXXX&gt; and &lt;C-YYYY&gt;, respectively, the content of the function that the description in the document file 10 of the operating manual<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> list achieves can be determined.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In addition, XXXX and YYYY indicate the parameter IDs of the plant computer database 30 in the plant computer system 3, and the IDs of the monitoring information and the actuating signal are set for the interface programs of the CBP system 5 and the plant computer system 3. Thus, only by converting the operating manual list 10 in the document format into the operating manual list 11 in the CBP XML format, the cooperation of the CBP system 5 and the plant computer system 3 can be determined uniquely, and the information such as XXXX and YYYY is stored in the CBP database 50.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram showing a method of determining the suitability of the operating manual list prepared. Here, the operating manual list display system 2 determines the suitability of the prepared operating manual list file 11 in the CBP XML format. First, in the determination process J1, in the operating manual list file 11, the plant data ID base and the screen database stored in both of the plant computer database 30 and the CBP database 50 in the operating manual list display system 2 are compared. Here, whether there is a parameter or an operation button that does not exist is checked. That is to say, by making a comparison of screen data and parameter IDs, the database difference is extracted and<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> an error is detected. By establishing the one-to-one correspondence with the specified format, a description in the specified format in which the error exists is determined, and a part of the description in the specified format in which the error is included, and a part of the present description which must be modified are determined. At the same time, communication errors occurring in the communication between the CBP system 5 and the plant computer system 3 are collected, and these error logs are transmitted to the apparatus for preparing an operating manual list 1.
