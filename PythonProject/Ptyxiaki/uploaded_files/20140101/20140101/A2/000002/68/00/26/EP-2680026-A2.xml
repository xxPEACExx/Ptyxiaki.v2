Some of such means of transport are, for example, equipped with passenger supply modules (often also referred to as passenger service units or personal service units (PSUs)), in order to supply passengers of the means of transport individually or display information.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The passenger cabin of a modern commercial aircraft is normally fitted with a multiplicity of PSUs which are each assigned to one passenger seat row and are arranged underneath overhead luggage compartments in a position accessible to the passengers sitting on the passenger seats. A typical PSU, as described for example in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE102009058849A1"><text>DE 10 2009 058 849 A1</text></patcit>, comprises a loudspeaker, a display element, on which for example a fasten seat belt sign is displayed, as well as one or more reading lamp(s). Furthermore, an individually adjustable air nozzle is integrated in a conventional PSU for each passenger seat of a seat row.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In conventional cabin architectures of aircraft, the seats and accordingly also the seat rows are arranged at fixed seat positions, i.e. aircraft usually have a fixed cabin architecture. To each seat row there is usually assigned a PSU. Accordingly, above each seat row in each case at least one PSU is arranged and installed. In order to be able to carry more or fewer passengers, if required, in subregions of the aircraft cabin or the entire aircraft cabin, increasingly a more flexible cabin layout is sought. For this purpose, the seats may be displaced to increase or decrease the seat spacing in the longitudinal direction of the aircraft. Accordingly, in some cabin architectures the PSUs may be repositioned.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Several or all of the PSUs of a means of transport are normally each coupled to an interface of a so-called Decoder Encoder Unit (DEU). In conventional aircraft architectures, a DEU of type A (DEU A) forms the interface between the "Cabin Intercom and Data System" (CIDS) and the systems relevant to the passengers. A DEU A can supply a plurality of, e.g. up to three, passenger seats and is usually laid above the seats along the entire cabin. With the CIDS it is possible to check, monitor and test numerous cabin systems. For example, announcements to passengers, the internal communication of the flight crew, the illuminated warning and information signs, the general cabin lighting, the lighting of the escape routes, and entertainment systems (video, music; in relation to aircraft normally referred to as In Flight Entertainment (IFE)) are managed by the CIDS. The communication between the central computer of the CIDS (the so-called director) and the cabin systems takes place via the said DEUs.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to control functionalities of the PSUs, e.g. electrical functionalities such as the loudspeaker output or the output of information on the display element, usually an indirect addressing of the PSU to be controlled takes place by means of the DEU interface to which the PSU to be controlled is attached. The indirect addressing of the PSUs by means of the DEU does not allow the physical installation position, i.e. the actual position of the PSU, to be deduced. The correlation between logic address and physical position, for example the assignment of the PSU to the corresponding seat row number in the cabin, usually takes place manually by the installation personnel.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Although methods for network-wide topology recognition using network protocols such as the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) or measurement of cable lengths/transmission times by means of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) enable a very accurate determination of the logic sequence of apparatuses, such as PSUs, connected to the DEU, they do not allow the actual arrangement of the terminal equipment, such as its position, in the cabin of the means of transport to be deduced.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a locating device, a locating system having such a locating device, an aircraft having a locating system of this type, an associated method and a computer program, by means of which apparatuses which are arrangeable on board a means of transport can be reliably located in a simple manner.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">This object is achieved by the subject matter of Claims 1, 7, 9, 10 and 14. Specific embodiments emerge in each case from the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to a first aspect, a locating device for locating at least one apparatus which is to be located and is arrangeable on board a means of transport, for example on board an aircraft, is provided. The locating device comprises a detecting unit and a computing unit. The detecting unit is configured to detect or to receive an audio signal wirelessly transmitted by the at least one apparatus to be located. The computing unit is configured to determine the distance of the at least one apparatus to be located from the detecting unit based on the audio signal transmitted by the at least one apparatus to be located and on a first information signal assigned to the audio signal and transmitted via a first deterministic data connection.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The assignment between the audio signal and the first information signal may be understood to mean that the audio signal and the first information signal are related to one another. This relationship may, for example, define that the audio signal and the first information signal are temporally related to one another and/or are assigned to the same apparatus to be located, such as e.g. are transmitted from the same apparatus to be located. The temporal relationship may, for example, be that the first information signal indicates the transmission of the audio signal by the apparatus to be located or indicates the time of transmission of the audio signal by the apparatus to be located. The indication of the time of transmission of the audio signal by the first information signal may, for example, be realised by a temporally correlated transmission of the audio signal and the first information signal.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Assignment may furthermore be understood to mean that the first information signal comprises information which identifies the audio signal more closely and/or which identifies the unit transmitting (emitting) the audio signal (the apparatus to be located) more closely. For example, both the audio signal and the first information signal may be transmitted by the same apparatus to be located. The audio signal is at least partly transmitted via a wireless interface, such as an air interface, and the first information signal is transmitted via the first deterministic data connection.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">By the determination of the distance of the at least one apparatus to be located from the detecting unit, the locating device has successfully located the at least one apparatus to be located. Locating is therefore to be understood herein as meaning determining the distance between the at least one apparatus to be located and the detecting unit. Specific configurations of the locating device furthermore allow, as will<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> be described below, determination of the position, such as e.g. the relative position of the apparatus to be located, in relation to the detecting unit or determination of the absolute position of the apparatus to be located in the means of transport.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The audio signal may be understood to mean any form of sound signal which can be emitted by a loudspeaker present in the apparatus to be located or arranged on the apparatus to be located. The apparatus to be located may, for example, be connected to a network or be arranged in a network. The network may have different network topologies, such as a ring topology, a star topology, a tree topology or a bus topology. For example, the network may be constructed as a deterministic data network having one or more data buses.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">If a multiplicity of apparatuses to be located are present, all of the apparatuses to be located may be connected, via suitable interfaces, to a single deterministic network, such as a single data bus. Alternatively to this, a first subset of at least one of the multiplicity of apparatuses to be located may be connected to a first deterministic data network, such as a first data bus, and a second subset of at least one other of the multiplicity of apparatuses to be located may be connected to a second deterministic network, such as a second data bus.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The term of deterministic data network, deterministic data connection or deterministic data channel may, for example, be understood as meaning that the delay and/or the fluctuation (jitter) of the data network, the data connection or the data channel are known and constant. By virtue of the deterministic data connection (the deterministic data channel), the computing unit can make temporal statements about the first information signal. Furthermore, the computing unit can take account of the first information signal (which may also be referred to as the first data signal) to determine the distance of the at least one apparatus to be located from the detecting unit.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The computing unit may, for example, be configured to determine, based on the first information signal, the time of transmission of the audio signal from the at least one apparatus to be located. The computing unit may furthermore be configured to take account of the determined time of transmission of the audio signal on the determination of the distance of the at least one apparatus to be located from the detecting unit.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">If the computing unit knows the time of transmission of the audio signal, it can calculate the sound propagating time from the difference of the time of transmission of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the audio signal from the apparatus to be located and the time of reception of the audio signal at the detecting unit. The sound propagating time (sometimes also referred to as propagating time for short) of the audio signal may be understood to mean the time required by the audio signal to cover the path from the apparatus to be located as the audio source to the detecting unit as the audio sink. From the sound propagating time, the computing unit, taking account of the speed of sound in the medium present, e.g. air, can deduce the length of the path between audio source and audio sink, i.e. the distance between the apparatus to be located and the detecting unit.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">If a plurality of apparatuses are to be located, the detecting unit can determine the distance of the corresponding apparatus from the detecting unit from the sound propagating time of the respective audio signal transmitted by the plurality of apparatuses to be located. If, for example, there are a plurality of apparatuses to be located, each arranged at a different location, the computing unit can determine the distance of each of the plurality of apparatuses to be located from the detecting unit.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to a first possible embodiment of the locating device according to the first aspect, first of all the detecting unit can detect an audio signal transmitted by one of the plurality of apparatuses to be located. The transmission of the audio signal is communicated to the computing unit with the aid of the first information signal. The first information signal may be transmitted, offset by a specific time interval relative to the audio signal, by the apparatus to be located which is transmitting the audio signal. The time interval may also be zero, so that the audio signal and the first information signal are transmitted by the apparatus to be located at least almost simultaneously to one another. If it is now assumed that the first information signal is transmitted at a substantially higher speed (e.g. at 2e8 m/s) (speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s; i.e. the notation 3e8 m/s is used herein instead of the notation 300000000 m/s) than the audio signal (which is transmitted e.g. at the speed of sound of 343 m/s) and was transmitted simultaneously with the audio signal, the time of reception of the first information signal at the computing unit at least almost corresponds to the time of transmission of the audio signal. Thus, the computing unit knows the approximate time of transmission of the audio signal and can determine (from the approximate time of transmission and the time of reception of the audio signal) the approximate sound propagating time of the audio signal from the apparatus to be located transmitting the audio signal, to the detecting unit. With the aid of the approximate sound propagating time, the computing unit can determine the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> distance between the apparatus to be located which is transmitting the audio signal and the detecting unit, taking account of the speed of sound.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Purely by way of example, it may be assumed that the first information signal is transmitted at a speed of 2e8 m/s over a maximum cable length of 100 m (i.e. the maximum length of the first deterministic data connection is 100 m). Given a transmission speed of the audio signal of 343 m/s (speed of sound in air at 20°C), this results, even without knowing the exact cable length (i.e. without knowing the length of the first deterministic data connection) in a resolution of the location of better than 0.02 mm, i.e. the distance of the apparatus to be located from the detecting unit can be determined to an accuracy of at least 0.02 mm and, if necessary, the position of the apparatus to be located can be determined to an accuracy of at least 0.02 mm. Even allowing additionally for a network element with a delay of 2-3 µs, a location resolution of better than 1 mm can still be achieved, i.e. the distance of the apparatus to be located from the detecting unit can be determined to an accuracy of at least 1 mm and, if necessary, the position of the apparatus to be located can be determined to an accuracy of at least 1 mm.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to a second possible embodiment of the locating device according to the first aspect, the first information signal may, for example, have sender address information about a logic sender address of the apparatus to be located. The sender address information may, for example, comprise information about the logic sender address or comprise the logic sender address itself. The sender address may, for example, be a temporary sender address. In accordance with this second possible embodiment, the computing unit can be configured to determine the time of transmission of the audio signal based on the sender address information.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to a first variant of this second possible embodiment, it is conceivable, for example, that an assignment between sender address and signal propagating time is stored in the computing unit. For example, a signal propagating time may be assigned to each sender address. Thus, a first signal propagating time may be assigned to a first sender address, a second signal propagating time to a second sender address, etc. Alternatively to this, according to a second variant of the second possible embodiment, it is conceivable that the computing unit can deduce the length of the first deterministic data connection from the sender address transmitted in the first information signal. The length may, for example, be obtained from the network topology known to the computing unit. From the length of the first deterministic data<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> connection, the computing unit can deduce the propagating time of the first information signal by the determinism of the first data channel.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Different signal propagating times of the first information signal may result from the fact that the first deterministic data connection between an apparatus to be located which is designated by the first sender address and the computing unit is different from (e.g. different in length from) the first deterministic data connection between an apparatus to be located which is designated by the second sender address and the computing unit. From the sender address transmitted to the computing unit with the first information signal, the computing unit can determine the signal propagating time to be expected of the first information signal and from this deduce the time of transmission of the first information signal transmitted via the first deterministic data connection.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In summary, according to the first possible embodiment, the computing unit can deduce the time of transmission of the audio signal by means of the time of reception of the first information signal. For example, the computing unit can equate the time of transmission of the audio signal with the time of reception of the first information signal (assuming that the propagating time of the first information signal is markedly faster than that of the audio signal and the first information signal and the audio signal were emitted simultaneously). According to the second possible embodiment, the computing unit can deduce the signal propagating time of the first information signal and thus also the time of transmission of the first information signal from the sender address.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The first information signal and the audio signal may be transmitted at a predetermined and/or variable temporal offset from one another. According to a first possible realisation of the locating device according to the first aspect, which may be combined with each of the above-described embodiments, the first information signal and the audio signal may be transmitted simultaneously by the apparatus to be located. Alternatively to this, according to a second possible realisation of the locating device according to the first aspect, which may be combined with each of the above-described embodiments, it is conceivable that the first information signal and the audio signal are transmitted by the apparatus to be located, offset by a time interval from one another which is previously known to the computing unit and/or adjustable.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">According to the first possible realisation, the computing unit can immediately deduce the time of transmission of the audio signal from the determined time of transmission<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> of the first information signal, since the two times of transmission correspond. According to the second realisation, to determine the time of transmission of the audio signal, the computing unit can take account of the previously known offset between the transmission of the audio signal and the transmission of the first information signal, in order to derive the time of transmission of the audio signal from the time of transmission of the first information signal.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The computing unit may furthermore be configured to determine the propagating time or sound propagating time of the audio signal from the determined time of transmission of the audio signal from the at least one apparatus to be located and from the time of reception of the audio signal at the detecting unit. The computing unit can determine the distance of the at least one apparatus to be located from the detecting unit from the sound propagating time of the audio signal.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the case of a multiplicity of apparatuses to be located, the distance determination of the apparatuses may take place, for example, successively. The order of the determination may, for example, be based on the (temporary) address of the apparatuses.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">According to a first possible configuration of the locating device according to the first aspect, which may be combined with each of the above-described embodiments and/or realisations, the computing unit and the detecting unit may be combined in a common unit. In this case, the time of reception of the audio signal by the detecting unit can be immediately known to the computing unit or the time of reception of the audio signal can be communicated to the computing unit by the detecting unit at least approximately without delay or with a negligible delay. In accordance with the first possible configuration, the computing unit can thus determine the sound propagating time of the audio signal without further information.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">According to a second possible configuration of the locating device according to the first aspect, which may be combined with each of the above-described embodiments and/or realisations, the detecting unit and the computing unit may be arranged spatially separated from one another. The detecting unit may, for example, be connected to the computing unit via a second deterministic data connection. The detecting unit may be configured to output a second information signal via the second deterministic data connection on reception (e.g. immediately on reception) of the audio signal. The signal propagating time of the second information signal from the detecting unit to the computing unit may, for example, be ignored by the computing unit or<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> may be known to the computing unit or may be derived from the network topology by the computing unit. The computing unit may use the signal propagating time of the second information signal to determine the time of reception of the audio signal at the detecting unit. For this, the computing unit may, for example, determine the time of reception of the audio signal at the detecting unit by subtracting the signal propagating time of the second information signal from the instant (point of time) at which it receives the second information signal. Alternatively, the computing unit (when ignoring the propagating time of the second information signal) may equate the time of reception of the second information signal (at the computing unit) with the time of reception of the audio signal at the detecting unit.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The computing unit may furthermore be configured to determine the position of the at least one apparatus to be located on board the means of transport based on the determined distance of the at least one apparatus to be located from the detecting unit. For this, the computing unit may, for example, take account of the topology of the network and/or the geometry or architecture of the cabin of the means of transport. The position of the detecting unit may be previously known to the computing unit, e.g. by a calibrating operation.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">For example, the detecting unit may be arranged in the cabin such that the audio signals arrive from one direction only. It is, for example, conceivable that the detecting unit is for this purpose situated in the front region of the cabin and is arranged, in the direction of travel or flight of the means of transport, farther forwards than the apparatuses to be located. This allows the computing unit to deduce the position of the apparatus to be located based on the determined distance between the apparatus to be located and the detecting unit.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Moreover, the detecting unit may be arranged offset from the centre axis of the means of transport. If subsets of apparatuses formed from the apparatuses are arranged, for example, axially symmetrically to the centre axis and the detecting unit is arranged offset from the centre axis, the computing unit can determine for each apparatus to be located an individual and unique distance to the detecting unit and derive unique positions therefrom. Additionally or alternatively to this, even without an offset of the detecting unit (i.e. even if the detecting unit is situated on the centre axis of the means of transport), the computing unit can determine unique positions even if the subsets of apparatuses are arranged axially symmetrically. For this purpose, the computing unit may, for example, take account of the network topology. It is conceivable that a first subset of apparatuses to be located is connected to the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> computing unit via a first deterministic data connection and a second subset of apparatuses to be located is connected to the computing unit via a further first deterministic data connection, etc. Depending on from which of the first deterministic data connections the computing unit receives the first information signal, the computing unit can deduce the subset of apparatuses to which the corresponding apparatus belongs. If the computing unit additionally takes account of the determined distance, it can determine a unique position of the apparatus to be located.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The automatic position determination makes it possible to eliminate costly manual position determination of the apparatuses.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The computing unit may furthermore be configured to allocate a logic address to the at least one apparatus to be located. This logic address may, for example, replace the sender address. The address allocation may, for example, take place after the position determination. For the allocation of the address, the computing unit may, for example, take account of the determined position of the at least one apparatus to be located. The address allocation may take place via the same first deterministic data connection via which the first information signal was previously sent.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The position determination of the apparatus(es) to be located and the address allocation make it possible to reliably allocate a logic address automatically to an installation position of the apparatus.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">According to a second aspect, a locating system for locating at least one apparatus which is to be located and is arrangeable on board a means of transport, for example on board an aircraft, is provided. The locating system comprises a locating device as described herein and the at least one apparatus to be located. The locating system may, for example, comprise a multiplicity of apparatuses to be located.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The locating system may have a microphone or be configured as such. The at least one apparatus to be located may comprise a passenger supply module having at least one loudspeaker or be configured as such. To emit the audio signal, the loudspeaker present in the passenger supply module may be used.

The method has the steps: detecting, by a detecting unit, an audio signal wirelessly transmitted by the at least one apparatus to be located; and determining, by a computing unit, the distance of the at least one apparatus to be located from the detecting unit based on the audio signal transmitted by the at least one apparatus to be located and on a first information signal assigned to the audio signal and transmitted via a first deterministic data connection.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The method may furthermore comprise determining, by the computing unit, the time of transmission of the audio signal from the at least one apparatus to be located based on the first information signal. The determined time of transmission of the audio signal may be taken into account on the determination of the distance of the at least one apparatus to be located. For example, the first information signal may have sender address information about a logic sender address of the apparatus to be located. The time of transmission of the audio signal may be determined based on the sender address information.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The method may furthermore comprise determining, by the computing unit, a propagating time of the audio signal from the determined time of transmission of the audio signal from the at least one apparatus to be located and from the time of reception of the audio signal at the detecting unit.

This communication is referred to below as the second data signal.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">According to a first alternative, the propagating time of the first data signal compared with the sound propagating time of the audio signal is ignored, since it is assumed that the speed of the first data signal is substantially greater than that of the audio signal (e.g. a speed of the first data signal of 2e8 m/s and a speed of the audio signal of 343 m/s (speed of sound in air at 20°C)). The server 20 knows the time of reception at which the first data signal has arrived at it. Furthermore, the server 20 can equate the time of transmission of the first data signal with the time of reception of the first data signal, since it ignores the propagating time of the first data signal. Since it is known to the server 20 that the audio signal and the first data signal have been transmitted simultaneously, the server 20 has also determined the time of<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> transmission of the audio signal via the determination of the time of transmission of the first data signal.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">According to a second alternative, the PSU 30a transmits its temporary sender address in the first data signal from the PSU 30a to the server 20. With the aid of the sender address, the server 20 can establish the path/length of the first deterministic data connection between the PSU 30a and the server 20. This can be done, for example, as a result of the fact that for each sender address the associated path/length of deterministic data connection is known to the server 20. Since both the delay and the jitter on the first deterministic data connection are known to the server 20, the server 20 can establish the signal propagating time of the first data signal. Furthermore, the server 20 knows the time of reception at which the first data signal has arrived at it. From the time of reception of the first data signal and the signal propagating time of the first data signal, the server 20 determines the time of transmission of the first data signal.

The server 20 can now determine the time of reception of the audio signal at the detecting unit 10 by subtracting the signal propagating time of the second data signal from the time of reception of the second data signal at the server 20. Alternatively, the server 20 can ignore the signal propagating time of the second data signal.

The shortest determinable distance belongs to the PSU 30a, the second shortest to the PSU 30b, the third shortest to the PSU 32a, etc. Thus, the server 20 can determine the position of the audio source (step 306).</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">Even given any desired arrangement of the detecting unit 10 relative to the centre axis, e.g. on positioning of the detecting unit 10 on the centre axis, unique position determination is possible.

However, the PSUs 30a-36a on the left-hand side are attached to a different data bus 22a than the PSUs 30b-36b of the right-hand side, the PSUs 30b-36b of the right-hand side being attached to the data bus 22b. Additionally, a central seat row could optionally be connected to the server 20 via a further, separated data bus. When the server 20 now receives the first data signal belonging to the audio signal via the left-hand data bus 22a, the server 20 can deduce therefrom that the audio signal comes from the left-hand side (without the server having to take account of address information of the PSUs 30a-36b). Together with the determined distance, the server 20 thereby determines a unique position of the PSU 30a (step 306).<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p id="p0075" num="0075">Subsequently, the positions of the further PSUs can be determined or an address allocation to the PSU 30a can optionally take place.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">In the latter case, after the position has been determined by the server 20, an address is allocated to the PSU 30a (step 308). This takes place, for example, on the same data channel on which the PSU 30a has previously communicated its audio transmission, i.e. on the channel via which the first data signal was sent. The temporary sender address of the PSU 30a communicated with the audio transmission is replaced by the address allocated by the server 20. In this way, an automatic address allocation takes place.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Subsequently, the steps 302-304 or the steps 302-306 or the steps 302-308 may be repeated for the further PSUs.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">The object to be located is automatically located in a simple manner by the above-described embodiment, with the aid of an audio sink arranged at a previously known position and an audio source present at the object to be located. Furthermore, its exact position can be automatically determined. Finally, the address allocation can also take place automatically.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">In the above-described locating device and the above-described locating system, no special equipment is required, but resort may be had to an architecture which is present anyway. By using architecture which is present anyway, no additional infrastructure and no conversion of the PSUs is required. The automatic position determination of the apparatus eliminates the expenditure of time on manual position determination. Through the automatic assignment between logic address and physical position, the possibility of errors during installation is reduced.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56976561" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Locating device (2) for locating at least one apparatus (30a-36b) which is to be located and is arrangeable on board a means of transport, for example on board an aircraft, the locating device (2) comprising:
