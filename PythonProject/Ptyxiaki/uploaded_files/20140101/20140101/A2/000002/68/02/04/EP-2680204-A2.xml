Examples of such functions include data and voice communications, capturing images and video via a camera, recording audio, playing music files and outputting music via a speaker system, and displaying images and video on a display. Some terminals include additional functionality which supports game playing, while other terminals are also configured as multimedia players. More recently, mobile terminals have been configured to receive broadcast and multicast signals which permit viewing of contents, such as videos and television programs.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Generally, terminals can be classified into mobile terminals and stationary terminals according to a presence or non-presence of mobility. And, the mobile terminals can be further classified into handheld terminals and vehicle mount terminals according to availability for hand-carry.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">There are ongoing efforts to support and increase the functionality of mobile terminals. Such efforts include software and hardware improvements, as well as changes and improvements in the structural components which form the mobile terminal.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As a mobile terminal is equipped with an NFC (near field communication) function, it is able to support a payment service function for price payment. And, an NFC function of a related art is enabled only if a display is turned on. However, since the NFC function is enabled in a manner that a user just tags the mobile terminal, it is uncomfortable for the user of the mobile terminal to turn on the display in order to use the NFC function. And, the demand for a method of relieving the discomfort is rising.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention are directed to a mobile terminal and controlling method thereof that substantially obviate one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a mobile terminal and controlling method thereof, by which an NFC (near field communication) function can be used despite that a display is turned off.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in the disclosure herein as well as the accompanying drawings.

For instance, the wireless communication unit 110 can include a broadcast receiving module 111, a mobile communication module 112, a wireless<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> internet module 113, a short-range communication module 114, a position-location module 115 and the like.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The broadcast receiving module 111 receives a broadcast signal and/or broadcast associated information from an external broadcast managing server via a broadcast channel.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The broadcast channel may include a satellite channel and a terrestrial channel.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The broadcast managing server generally refers to a server which generates and transmits a broadcast signal and/or broadcast associated information or a server which is provided with a previously generated broadcast signal and/or broadcast associated information and then transmits the provided signal or information to a terminal. The broadcast signal may be implemented as a TV broadcast signal, a radio broadcast signal, and a data broadcast signal, among others. If desired, the broadcast signal may further include a broadcast signal combined with a TV or radio broadcast signal.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">At least two broadcast receiving modules 111 can be provided to the mobile terminal 100 in pursuit of simultaneous receptions of at least two broadcast channels or broadcast channel switching facilitation.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The broadcast associated information includes information associated with a broadcast channel, a broadcast program, a broadcast service provider, etc. And, the broadcast associated information can be provided via a mobile communication network. In this case, the broadcast associated information can be received by the mobile communication module 112.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The broadcast associated information can be implemented in various forms. For instance, broadcast associated information may include an electronic program guide (EPG) of digital multimedia broadcasting (DMB) and electronic service guide (ESG) of digital video broadcast-handheld (DVB-H).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The broadcast receiving module 111 may be configured to receive broadcast signals transmitted from various types of broadcast systems. By nonlimiting example, such broadcasting systems include digital multimedia broadcasting-terrestrial (DMB-T), digital multimedia broadcasting-satellite (DMB-S), digital video broadcast-handheld (DVB-H), DVB-CBMS, OMA-BCAST, the data broadcasting system known as media<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> forward link only (MediaFLO®) and integrated services digital broadcast-terrestrial (ISDB-T). Optionally, the broadcast receiving module 111 can be configured suitable for other broadcasting systems as well as the above-explained digital broadcasting systems.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The broadcast signal and/or broadcast associated information received by the broadcast receiving module 111 may be stored in a suitable device, such as a memory 160.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The mobile communication module 112 transmits/receives wireless signals to/from one or more network entities (e.g., base station, external terminal, server, etc.) via a mobile network such as GSM (Global System for Mobile communications), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), WCDMA (Wideband CDMA) and so on. Such wireless signals may represent audio, video, and data according to text/multimedia message transceivings, among others.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The wireless internet module 113 supports Internet access for the mobile terminal 100. This module may be internally or externally coupled to the mobile terminal 100. In this case, the wireless Internet technology can include WLAN(Wireless LAN) (Wi-Fi), Wibro (Wireless broadband), Wimax (World Interoperability for Microwave Access), HSDPA(High Speed Downlink Packet Access), GSM, CDMA, WCDMA, LTE (Long Term Evolution) etc.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Wireless internet access by Wibro, HSPDA, GSM, CDMA, WCDMA, LTE or the like is achieved via a mobile communication network. In this aspect, the wireless internet module 113 configured to perform the wireless internet access via the mobile communication network can be understood as a sort of the mobile communication module 112.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The short-range communication module 114 facilitates relatively short-range communications. Suitable technologies for implementing this module include radio frequency identification (RFID), infrared data association (IrDA), ultra-wideband (UWB), as well at the networking technologies commonly referred to as Bluetooth and ZigBee, to name a few.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The position-location module 115 identifies or otherwise obtains the location of the mobile terminal 100. If desired, this module may be implemented with a global positioning system (GPS) module.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">According to the current technology, the GPS module 115 is able to precisely calculate current 3-dimensional position information based on at least one of longitude, latitude and altitude and direction (or orientation) by calculating distance information and precise time information from at least three satellites and then applying triangulation to the calculated information.
