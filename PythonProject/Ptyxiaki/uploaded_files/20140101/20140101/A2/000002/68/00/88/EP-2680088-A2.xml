When the shaft is inserted into a bearing included in the main body of the image forming apparatus, the photosensitive drum is rotatably supported.

In other embodiments, however, the image forming apparatus may be a color multi-function peripheral, a color printer, a facsimile machine, or another apparatus that forms a toner<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> image on a sheet. In the descriptions below, the term "sheet" refers to a copy sheet, a coated sheet, an overhead projection (OHP) sheet, a thick sheet, a postcard, tracing paper, or another sheet that undergoes image forming processing or any processing other than image forming processing.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The image forming apparatus 1 includes a main body 2, which is a substantially rectangular parallelepiped. The main body 2 includes a lower body 21, which is a substantially rectangular parallelepiped, an upper body 22, disposed above the lower body 21, which is a substantially rectangular parallelepiped, and a linking body 23 that links the lower body 21 and upper body 22 together. The linking body 23 extends along the right edge and rear edge of the main body 2. Sheets on which printing processing has been performed are discharged into a discharge space 24 enclosed by the lower body 21, upper body 22, and linking body 23. Particularly, in this embodiment, sheets are discharged to a discharge unit 241 placed on the upper surface of the lower body 21 and to a discharge tray 242 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>) placed above the discharge unit 241.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">An operation unit 221 placed on the front side of the upper body 22 includes, for example, a liquid crystal display (LCD) touch panel 222. The operation unit 221 is formed so as to accept information related to image forming<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> processing. The user can input, for example, the number of sheets on which printing is to be performed, a print density, and the like through the LCD touch panel 222. Main components located in the upper body 22 are a device configured to read images of manuscripts and electronic circuits that are responsible for controlling the image forming apparatus 1.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A pressing cover 223, placed on the upper body 22, is used to press a manuscript. The pressing cover 223 is attached to the upper body 22 so as to be vertically swingable. The user upwardly swings the pressing cover 223 and places a manuscript on the upper body 22. The user can then operate the operation unit 221 causing a unit placed in the upper body 22 to read the image of the manuscript.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">A manual tray 240 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>) is placed on the right side surface of the lower body 21. The upper end 240B of the manual tray 240 is vertically swingable with its lower end 240A acting as a pivot point. When the manual tray 240 is downwardly swung and is positioned so as to extend to the right of the lower body 21, the user can place sheets on the manual tray 240. A sheet on the manual tray 240 is pulled into the interior of the lower body 21 in response to a command entered by the user through the operation unit 221, after which the sheet undergoes image forming processing and is then discharged to the discharge space 24. There is an<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> internal space S (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>), in which various types of units described later are located, in the lower body 21.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The image forming apparatus 1 includes, in the internal space S, a cassette 110, a feed unit 11, a second feed roller 114, a resist roller pair 116, and an image forming unit 120. The feed unit 11 includes a pickup roller 112 and a first feed roller 113. The feed unit 11 feeds out a sheet P to a sheet transport path PP. The sheet transport path PP extends from the feed unit 11, and after passing the resist roller pair 116, passes a transfer position TP located in the image forming unit 120.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The cassette 110 stores sheets P. The cassette 110 can be pulled from the lower body 21 in a direction in which the front of the image forming apparatus 1 faces (direction out of the drawing sheet of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>). In the lower body 21, the sheets P stored in the cassette 110 are upwardly fed out. Each sheet P then undergoes image forming processing in the lower body 21 in response to a command entered by the user through the operation unit 221, after which the sheet P is discharged to the discharge space 24. The cassette 110 has a lifting plate 111 that supports the sheet P. The lifting plate 111 is inclined so as to upwardly push the top edge of the sheet P.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The pickup roller 112 is positioned so as to be placed on the top edge of the sheet P that has been upwardly pushed<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> by the lifting plate 111. When the pickup roller 112 is rotated, the sheet P is drawn from the cassette 110.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The first feed roller 113 is located downstream of the pickup roller 112 in the sheet transport direction. The first feed roller 113 further feeds out the sheet P to the downstream side in the sheet transport direction. The second feed roller 114 is located inward (left side in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>) of the lower end 240A of the manual tray 240. The second feed roller 114 transports sheets P on the manual tray 240 to the interior of the lower body 21. The user can selectively use sheets P accommodated in the cassette 110 and sheets P placed on the manual tray 240.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The resist roller pair 116 regulates the position, in a direction orthogonal to the sheet transport direction, of the sheet. Thus, the position of an image formed on the sheet P is adjusted. The resist roller pair 116 forms a nip part between the rollers. In the image forming unit 120, the resist roller pair 116 transports the sheet P to the image forming unit 120 so that the transport is timed with a transfer of a toner image onto the sheet P. The resist roller pair 116 also functions to correct a skew of the sheet P, if any.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The image forming unit 120 includes a photosensitive drum 121, a charger 127, an exposing device 128, a developing device 124, a toner container 125, a transfer<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> roller 126, a cleaning unit 35, and a static eliminator 50.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The photosensitive drum 121 is shaped like a substantially cylindrical body. The photosensitive drum 121 enables an electrostatic latent to be formed on its circumferential surface and supports a toner image matching the electrostatic latent.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">When a prescribed voltage is applied to the charger 127, it substantially uniformly charges the circumferential surface of the photosensitive drum 121. The exposing device 128 emits laser beams to the circumferential surface, which has been charged by the charger 127, of the photosensitive drum 121. The laser beams are emitted according to the image data outputted from an external apparatus (not illustrated), such as a personal computer, that is connected to the image forming apparatus 1 in such a way that communication is possible therebetween. As a result, an electrostatic latent corresponding to the image data is formed on the circumferential surface of the photosensitive drum 121.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The developing device 124 supplies toner to the circumferential surface of the photosensitive drum 121 on which the electrostatic latent has been formed. The toner container 125 supplies toner to the developing device 124. Specifically, the toner container 125 supplies toner to the developing device 124 sequentially or as necessary. After<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the developing device 124 has supplied toner to the photosensitive drum 121, the electrostatic latent formed on the circumferential surface of the photosensitive drum 121 is developed (visualized). As a result, a toner image is formed on the circumferential surface of the photosensitive drum 121. The developing device has a developing roller 124A that supports toner on the circumferential surface. The developing roller 124A is positioned facing the photosensitive drum 121 at a developing position. The developing roller 124A is rotationally driven and supplies toner to the photosensitive drum 121.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The transfer roller 126 is positioned facing the circumferential surface of the photosensitive drum 121 at the transfer position TP. The transfer roller 126 is rotationally driven at the transfer position TP in the same direction as the photosensitive drum 121.

The air flow then passes through the openings Z formed in the drum flange 121C and enters the cylindrical interior of the<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> drum sleeve 121A (see the arrows D41, D42, and D43 in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> and the arrow D9 in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref>). In this embodiment, the bearing 121C2 of the photosensitive drum 121 is located inward of the flange part 121C1 in the axial direction. The openings Z are formed so as to extend in the axial direction by using the clearance between the flange part 121C1 and the bearing 121C2 in the axial direction. Thus, the amount of air passing through the openings Z can be increased. As a result, an air flow having a large amount of air is led to the cylindrical interior of the photosensitive drum 121, and therefore the photosensitive drum 121 is efficiently cooled. This suppresses the increase in temperature of the photosensitive drum 121 and thereby suppresses toner and an additive of the toner from adhering to the surface of the drum sleeve 121A.

However, the present invention is not<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> limited to this embodiment. For example, a variation as described below can be used.
<ol><li>(1) Although in the above embodiment the linking rib 122 is a plate-like member that has a slight thickness in the rotational direction of the photosensitive drum 121 and also has a defined width in the axial direction of the photosensitive drum 121, the present invention is not limited to this. <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10A</figref> is a front view illustrating a drum flange 121D in a variation of the drum flange 121C, and <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10B</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the drum flange 121D in the variation of the drum flange 121C. The variation is <b>characterized in that</b> slanted ribs 123 are used instead of the linking ribs 122 in the above embodiment. The slanted rib 123 has a slanted surface that is slanted along the rotational direction of the drum sleeve 121A. In other words, unlike the linking rib 122 described above, the inner edge of the slanted rib 123 in the axial direction (edge in front on the drawing sheet of <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10A</figref>) is shifted in the direction indicated by the arrow D102, with respect to the outer edge in the axial direction (edge in back on the drawing sheet of <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10A</figref>). As a result, the side surface of the slanted rib 123 is slanted in the rotational direction. In other words, the slanted rib 123 has a slanted surface that is slanted from the inner side in the axial direction toward the outer side in the axial direction<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> along the rotational direction of the photosensitive drum 121. With this type of drum flange 121D, when the photosensitive drum 121 having the drum flange 121D is rotationally driven in the direction indicated by arrow D101 in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10A</figref>, air flow actively flows toward the cylindrical interior of the photosensitive drum 121 (toward the front on the drawing sheet of <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10A</figref>). That is, the linking rib 122 doubles as a rotational fan that generates an air flow directed to the interior of the photosensitive drum 121.</li><li>(2) Although, in the above embodiment, the openings Z formed in the drum flange 121C have been described as being located at an end in the axial direction of the photosensitive drum 121, the present invention is not limited to this. Openings Z may also be formed in the drum flange 121C at the other end of the photosensitive drum 121. That is, a pair of drum flanges 121C, each of which has openings Z, is placed at both ends of the drum sleeve 121A. In this structure, a stable air flow is formed in the cylindrical interior of the photosensitive drum 121 in the axial direction. Therefore, the cooling of the photosensitive drum 121 is further enhanced.<br/>
In the variation in which the slanted rib 123 is used, at least one of a pair of drum flanges having slanted ribs slanted in a direction, with respect to the rotational direction of the photosensitive drum 121, opposite to the<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> direction in which the slanted rib 123 is slanted may be located at a side end of the photosensitive drum 121, the side end being opposite to the drum flange 121D. This type of slanted rib has a slanted surface slanted from the outer side in the axial direction toward the inner side in the axial direction along the rotational direction of the photosensitive drum 121. In this structure, these slanted ribs generate an air flow directed toward the outer side of the photosensitive drum 121. Therefore, the air that has flowed into the cylindrical interior of the photosensitive drum 121 due to the slanted ribs 123 is exhausted to the outside of the photosensitive drum 121.</li><li>(3) Although the above embodiment has been described where the drum shaft 121B functions as a fixed axis, the present invention is not limited to this. The drum shaft 121B may be an axial part that is secured to the photosensitive drum 121 in an integrated manner and rotates together with the photosensitive drum 121. In this structure, the drum shaft 121B is secured to the bearing 121C2 of the photosensitive drum 121 in an integrated manner. When the photosensitive drum 121 is attached to the lower body 21, the top of the drum shaft 121B is inserted into the through-hole 21R1 formed in the back wall 21R, after which the drum shaft 121B is pivotably supported by the main body bearing 21J. When a driving unit (not illustrated) and the<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> top of the drum shaft 121B are mutually linked, a rotational driving force is transmitted to the photosensitive drum 121. As a result, the photosensitive drum 121 becomes rotatable. In this variation, the drum shaft 121B functions as a rotational axis that is rotated together with the photosensitive drum 121.</li></ol></p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Even though the present invention has been described with reference to some embodiments highlighted in the figures and in the detailed description it shall be understood that any feature or features or any combination thereof specifically described in one embodiment may also be implemented in other embodiments.
