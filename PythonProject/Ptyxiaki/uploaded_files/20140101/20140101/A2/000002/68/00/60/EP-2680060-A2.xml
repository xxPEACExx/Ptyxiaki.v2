In an imaging system, it occurs when light from one point of an object does not converge into (or does not diverge from) a single point after transmission through the system.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Aberrations can be expressed as discrepancies from paraxial theory. In terms relating to the underlying mathematics of the system, aberrations can be categorized as first order, third order, fifth order, seventh order, etc.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>First order aberrations</u></b></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><p id="p0005" num="0005">Chromatic aberration arises because the index of refraction of a material is different for light of different wavelengths. First order chromatic aberration consists of two components, focus shift, and magnification differences for various wavelengths. A common example of this effect is observed when white light striking a prism breaks up into colored rays. As result of this effect, the image formed by a lens will be different for each color component of light.</p><heading id="h0005"><b><u>Third order aberrations</u></b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">For finite field angles and apertures, light rays do not focus neatly at a point. Accordingly, no precise image is formed. These deviations from focus may be described by third order theory in terms of the five "Seidel" aberrations. These are monochromatic aberrations characterized by certain geometric effects.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Spherical aberration - Spherical aberration is an axial aberration and so may be completely described by meridional rays. Light rays in the paraxial region focus at a different point than light rays going through the periphery of the lens. The distance between the two foci is the lateral spherical aberration. The case where the peripheral rays are more bent than the paraxial rays is called positive spherical aberration. The case where the peripheral rays are bent and the peripheral focus is farther from the lens, is called negative spherical aberration. The lateral spherical aberration is proportional to the square of the entrance pupil diameter.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Spherical aberration can be controlled by balancing surfaces having positive spherical aberration with surfaces having negative spherical aberration, or by using a small aperture stop.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Coma - Like spherical aberration, coma is an aperture dependent aberration. However, unlike spherical aberration it only affects off-axial<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> rays. The comatic blur is asymmetric and "comet shaped", hence the name coma.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Coma may be eliminated in a lens by appropriate choice of curves. It may be minimized by using a small aperture stop</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Curvature of field -In curvature of field a plane object is sharply imaged, but on a curved surface. The surface on which the image is formed is called the Petzval surface.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Curvature of field may be corrected by balancing components contributing negative field curvature with components contributing positive field curvature.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Distortion -In distortion, the object is sharply imaged but does not retain its shape. There are two kinds of distortion, barrel distortion and pincushion distortion, so named because of their effect on the image of a square grid target.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Distortion can be corrected by balancing surfaces contributing barrel distortion to those contributing pincushion distortion. A perfectly symmetric system will have no distortion. Changing the aperture size has no effect on distortion.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Astigmatism - Astigmatism refers to the differing focal positions for rays in the tangential and sagittal planes. While each plane focuses to a perfect point, in the astigmatic image these focus planes are not coincident. Astigmatism is not present on-axis, but increases as the field angle increases.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Astigmatism can be corrected by balancing components contributing negative astigmatism with components contributing positive astigmatism.</p><heading id="h0006"><b><u>Fifth order aberrations</u></b></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">There are nine secondary or fifth-order aberrations:<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Secondary spherical aberration - there is one form of fifth order spherical aberration, and there are two forms of fifth order oblique spherical aberration.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Secondary coma - there is one form of fifth order linear coma, and there are two forms of fifth order elliptical coma.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Secondary curvature of field - there is one form of fifth order sagittal field curvature.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Secondary distortion - There is one form of fifth order distortion.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Secondary astigmatism - there is one form of fifth order astigmatism</p><heading id="h0007"><b><u>Optical Systems</u></b></heading><p id="p0023" num="0023">A lens or group of lenses can be arranged to form an optical system. The lenses in such systems are typically arranged such that they are all coaxial with the same optical axis, although for some applications this may not necessarily be the case.

Some examples of lens designs include five element lens designs, reverse telephoto lens designs, and Biogon™ type lens designs.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">However, prior lens designs of each of these types have not been known to be correctible for all 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> order aberrations.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">It is therefore desired to provide lens design forms that account for these deficiencies</p><heading id="h0008">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0026" num="0026">Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a five element lens design that is correctable for all 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> order aberrations.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">It is a further object of the invention to provide a reverse telephoto lens design that is correctable for all 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> order aberrations</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">It is another object of the invention to provide a six element Biogon type lens design that is correctable for all 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> order aberrations.</p><heading id="h0009">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating a five element lens design according to aspects of the invention.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating another five element lens design according to aspects of the invention.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram illustrating a further five element lens design according to aspects of the invention.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram illustrating a reverse telephoto lens design according to aspects of the invention.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 4a</figref> is an enlarged view of the reverse telephoto lens design illustrated by <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram illustrating Biogon-type lens design according to aspects of the invention.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram illustrating a four element lens design according to aspects of the invention.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram illustrating another five element lens design according to aspects of the invention.</p><heading id="h0010">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating a five element lens design 100 which is correctable for all 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> order aberrations according to aspects of the invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Lens design 100 includes the following lenses, arranged coaxially and in order, described from the object (not shown) to the image plane 101:</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Lens 110, which is a positive meniscus lens, arranged with its concave side oriented toward the object.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Lens 120, which is a negative meniscus lens, arranged with its concave side oriented toward the object.
