The support portion 51 of the support 50 is located between the current sensor 33 and the control circuit board 40. The support 50 includes a conical support boss 51a. The support boss 51a is located between the U-phase output terminal U and the V-phase output terminal V. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, a through bore 51b is formed in central section of the distal end of the support boss 51a. The distance from the upper surface of the support portion 51 to the distal end of the support boss 51a conforms to the axial length of the conductive collars 53. Accordingly, when the control circuit board 40 is supported by the collars 53 on the support portion 51, the conductive collars 53 and the support boss 51a are located between the support portion 51 and the control circuit board 40, and the conductive collars 53 and the support portion 51 form a space 54 between the support portion 51 and the control circuit board 40.

The signal terminals 35 of the current sensor 33 extend through the terminal insertion bores 51d of the support portion 51 and the terminal connection bores 40b of the control circuit board 40. A screw 38, which functions as a fastener, is inserted through the screw bore 40a of the control circuit board 40 and the insertion bore 51b and fastened to the threaded bore 36a of the coupling boss 36. This integrally fastens together the control circuit board 40, the support portion 51 (support boss 51a), and the current sensor 33 (coupling boss 36). More specifically, the portion of the control circuit board 40 extending around the screw hole 40a and the distal end of the support boss 51a are located between the head 38a of the screw 38 and the distal end of the coupling boss 36.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Accordingly, when the current sensor 33 is coupled, the distal end of the support boss 51a is in planar contact with and pressed against the lower surface of the control circuit board 40, and the distal surface of the coupling boss 36 is in planar contact with and pressed against the inner surface of the support boss 51a.

The support portion 51 is arranged between the control circuit board 40 and the current sensor 33. The screw 38 extends through the screw bore 40a of the control circuit board 40 and the support portion 51 and is fastened to the threaded bore 36a of the coupling boss 36 of the current sensor 33. The screw 38 thus couples the current sensor 33 to the control circuit board 40. This eliminates the need for installation space of the current sensor 33 on the control circuit board 40 and allows for the use of the single screw hole 40a. Thus, a greater area on the control circuit board 40 may be used for electronic components and the like compared to when the control circuit board 40 includes installation space of the current sensor 33 and more than one screw 38 is used to couple the current sensor 33 to the control circuit board 40. In addition, the lower surface of the control circuit board 40 and the upper surface of the support portion 51 define the space 54, which is set in correspondence with the distance between the top of the support boss 51a and the upper surface of the support portion 51. The space 54 allows electronic components to be mounted on the lower surface of the control circuit board 40.

The control circuit board 40 and the support portion 51 are fastened to each other by the threaded bore 36a of the current sensor 33 and the screw 38. Here, the lower surface of the portion of the control circuit board 40 from which the current sensor 33 is suspended is in planar contact with the support boss 51a. Thus, the support boss 51a of the support portion 51 increases the rigidity of the portion of the control circuit board 40 from which the current sensor 33 is suspended. In addition, vibration of the current sensor 33 is transmitted to the control circuit board 40 in addition to the support portion 51. This disperses the vibration of the current sensor 33 to the support portion 51 and the control circuit board 40 and therefore decreases the vibration of the current sensor 33, the control circuit board 40, and<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the support portion 51.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The advantages of the present embodiment will now be described.
<ol><li>(1) The screw 38 extends through the control circuit board 40 and the support portion 51 and is fastened to the threaded bore 36a of the current sensor 33. The current sensor 33 is suspended from the control circuit board 40, and the support portion 51 is arranged between the current sensor 33 and the control circuit board 40. This eliminates the need for installation space of the current sensor 33 on the control circuit board 40. Further, the mount area for electronic components and the like on the control circuit board 40 is increased compared to when the current sensor 33 is arranged on the control circuit board 40.</li><li>(2) The screw 38 fastens the current sensor 33, the support portion 51, and the control circuit board 40 together. The portion of the control circuit board 40 from which the current sensor 33 is suspended is reinforced by the support boss 51a of the support portion 51, which is in contact with this portion. Accordingly, even when vibration is transmitted to the current sensor 33, the vibration is dispersed to the support portion 51 (support boss 51a) and the control circuit board 40. This decreases the vibration of the current sensor 33. Thus, the solder connections S of the signal terminals 35 of the current sensor 33 are less likely to be affected by vibration and less likely to be damaged.</li><li>(3) The support portion 51 is arranged between the control circuit board 40 and the current sensor 33. This reduces vibration and deformation of the control circuit board 40 compared to when the current sensor 33 is suspended from the control circuit board 40 directly and the support portion 51 is not arranged between the current sensor 33 and the control circuit board 40.</li><li>(4) The current sensor 33 includes the insertion holes 33a near the longitudinal ends. The coupling boss 36 and the signal terminals 35 are arranged between the insertion holes 33a, and the signal terminals 35 are proximal to the coupling boss 36. In addition, the coupling boss 36 is used to fasten the current sensor 33 to the control circuit board 40 and the support portion 51 with the screw 38. Thus, in the control circuit board 40 and the current sensor 33, the portions near the coupling boss 36, which is engaged with the screw 38, are least susceptible to vibration. The arrangement of the signal terminals 35 adjacent to the coupling boss 36 reduces vibration of the signal terminals 35 and avoids damage of the solder connections S.</li><li>(5) The coupling boss 36 is arranged in the longitudinally middle section of the current sensor 33. Thus, the current sensor 33 is well-balanced when suspended from the control circuit board 40, and the fastening requires only the single coupling boss 36. A pattern is not arranged around the screw bore 40a on the control circuit board 40. Thus, the use of the single bore 40a allows for a greater mount area on the control circuit board 40.</li><li>(6) The single screw 38 fastens the current sensor 33 to the control circuit board 40. This facilitates the installation of the current sensor 33 compared to when more than one screw 38 is used to fasten the current sensor 33 to the control circuit board 40.</li><li>(7) The support portion 51 is made of a synthetic resin, and the support boss 51a is formed integrally with the support portion 51. This facilitates the fastening<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> of the current sensor 33 with the screw 38 compared to when the support boss 51a is discrete from the support portion 51.</li><li>(8) When the control circuit board 40, the support boss 51a, and the coupling boss 36 are fastened together, the coupling boss 36, which projects from the current sensor 33, is inserted in the support boss 51a, which projects from the support portion 51 of the support 50. In addition, the support boss 51a separates the lower surface of the control circuit board 40 from the upper surface of the support portion 51. Unlike a structure that lacks the support boss 51a and has the entire lower surface of the control circuit board 40 in contact with the entire upper surface of the support portion 51, the lower surface of the control circuit board 40 and the upper surface of the support portion 51 define the space 54 where electronic components and the like can be arranged. Thus, electronic components can be mounted on the lower surface of the control circuit board 40. This increases the mount area for electronic components on the control circuit board 40.</li></ol></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be embodied in many other specific forms without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
