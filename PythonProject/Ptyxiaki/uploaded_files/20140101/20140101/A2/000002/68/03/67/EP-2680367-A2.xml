Moreover, in order to draw the attention of the consumers, electronic devices today are mostly equipped with metal back covers to improve the uniqueness and appearance design thereof.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For the purpose of miniaturization, the antenna of the electronic device is usually formed directly on an outer surface of a plastic housing by LDS (laser direct structuring) technology, so as to obtain effective radiation space for the antenna. However, such a design requires higher production costs. Besides, due to the appearance design with metallic sense, an additional antenna window needs to be formed on the metal back cover of the electronic device, so that the antenna configured<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> on the metal housing can have better radiation efficiency. However, such a configuration may ruin the overall design of the appearance.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In other words, it is a big challenge to design an electronic device that not only satisfies the requirements for miniaturization and appearance design but also reduces production costs and maintains antenna radiation efficiency.</p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The invention provides an electronic device which uses an opening and a metal line in a metal housing to form an excitation path of a loop antenna and utilizes the metal housing to improve the appearance design of the electronic device.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The invention provides an electronic device which includes a metal housing, a first opening, a first metal line, a first grounding point, and a first current zero point. The first opening passes through the metal housing. The first metal line is disposed inside the first opening, wherein a first end of the first metal line is electrically connected to a side of the first opening, and a second end of the first metal line includes a first feeding point.

Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, an electronic device 10 includes a metal housing 100, a first opening 110, a first metal line 120, a first grounding point GP1, a first current zero point ZP1, and a first feeding point FP1. Herein, the first opening 110 passes through the metal housing 100. The first metal line 120 is disposed inside the first opening 110. In addition, a first end of the first metal line 120 is electrically connected to a side SD1 of the first opening 110, and a second end of the first metal line 120 includes the first feeding point FP1. In this embodiment, the metal housing 100 is a back cover of the electronic device 10, for example, and the first metal line 120 and the metal housing 100 are integrally formed. However, it should be noted that the invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The first grounding point GP1 and the first current zero point ZP1 are located on the side SD1 of the first opening 110. Herein, the metal housing 100 forms a first loop antenna to transmit or receive a first radio frequency signal by a first excitation path EP1 from the first feeding point FP1 to the first grounding point GP1. Herein, the first loop antenna is a half-wavelength loop antenna, for example, and thus a length of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the first excitation path EP1 is a half of a wavelength of the first radio frequency signal, for example. In addition, it is known from the characteristics of the loop antenna that the first excitation path EP1 has the first current zero point ZP1 thereon.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">For instance, <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the excitation path of the loop antenna according to an embodiment of the invention. As indicated by the arrow in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, a current is fed to the half-wavelength loop antenna via the first feeding point FP1. Moreover, the current from the first feeding point FP1 and an excitation current from a system ground plane are reverse to each other. Therefore, the first current zero point ZP1 is formed on the excitation path from the first feeding point FP1 to the first grounding point GP1. In addition, the first current zero point ZP1 is located approximately at a center of the first excitation path EP1. That is, in this embodiment, a distance from the first current zero point ZP1 to the first grounding point GP1 is a quarter of the wavelength of the first radio frequency signal, for example. The first current zero point ZP1 on the excitation path EP1 is located near a juncture between the first end of the first metal line 120 and the side SD1, for example.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">It is noted that, in this embodiment, the metal housing 100 is electrically connected to the system ground plane (not shown) in the electronic device 10. Moreover, in actual application, the electronic device 10 can transmit a signal from the first feeding point FP1 to a transceiver therein (not shown) via a coaxial line (not shown), wherein an inner conductor of the coaxial line is electrically connected to the first feeding point FP1, and an outer conductor of the coaxial line is electrically connected to the system ground plane. Besides using the coaxial line to feed the signal, the electronic device 10 can use a conductive element, such as a contact spring or a pogo pin, to replace the coaxial line and reduce transmission loss of the signal.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates examples of the shapes of the first opening 110 and the first metal line 120 in this embodiment, but it should be noted that the invention is not limited thereto. Persons skilled in the art may adjust the shapes of the first opening 110 and the first metal line 120 according to the frequency and impedance matching of the first radio frequency signal they need. Specifically, the first opening 110 has a rectangular shape or an irregular geometrical shape, and the first metal line 120 has a strip shape or an irregular geometrical shape, for example.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In another embodiment of the invention, the electronic device 10 further forms a plurality of loop antennas by the metal housing. For instance, <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic view of a part of an electronic device according to another embodiment of the invention. In comparison with the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the electronic device 10 of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> further includes a second opening 210, a second metal line 220, a second grounding point GP2, a second current zero point ZP2, and a second feeding point FP2.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the second opening 210 passes through the metal housing 100. The second metal line 220 is disposed inside the second opening 210. In addition, a first end of the second metal line 220 is electrically connected to a side SD2 of the second opening 210, and a second end of the second metal line 220 includes the second feeding point FP2. Accordingly, the metal housing 100 forms a second loop antenna to transmit or receive a second radio frequency signal by a second excitation path EP2 between the second grounding point GP2 and the second feeding point FP2. In addition, a length of the second excitation path EP2 is a half of a wavelength of the second radio frequency signal, and a distance from the second current zero point ZP2 to the second grounding point GP2 is a quarter of the wavelength of the second radio frequency signal, for example.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Similar to the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the metal housing 100, the first metal line 120, and the second metal line are 220 integrally formed. Moreover, persons skilled in the art may adjust the shapes of the second opening 210 and the second metal line 220 according to the frequency and impedance matching of the second radio frequency signal they need. Furthermore, the electronic device 10 can transmit a signal from the second feeding point FP2 to a transceiver therein through a conductive element, such as a coaxial line, a contact spring, or a pogo pin.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">It should be noted that the electronic device 10 can form two loop antennas to operate in different frequencies by the first excitation path EP1 and the second excitation path EP2. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the metal housing 100 forms the first loop antenna that operates in 2.4GHz by the first excitation path EP1 and forms the second loop antenna that operates in 5GHz by the second excitation path EP2, for example. However, it should be noted that the invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Further, in another exemplary embodiment of the invention, the electronic device 10 also includes a function module 230, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. The function module 230 is a camera module, for example. Herein, the function module 230 is fixed to the metal housing 100 by fastening elements 231 and 232. It should be noted that, even if the current zero point of the loop antenna is connected to other metal elements nearby, a resonance mode of the loop antenna is not affected. Therefore, the fastening elements 231 and 232 are configured respectively corresponding to the first current zero point ZP1 and the second current zero point ZP2. That is, in actual application, the metal housing 100 further includes two openings (not shown), which respectively pass through the parts of the metal housing 100 that correspond to the first<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> current zero point ZP1 and the second current zero point ZP2. Accordingly, the fastening elements 231 and 232 respectively pass through the two openings to fix the function module 230 to the metal housing 100.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">It is worth mentioning that, in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the electronic device 10 further includes decorative thin films 240 and 250 to improve the appearance design of the electronic device 10. The decorative thin films 240 and 250 respectively fill the first opening 110 and the second opening 210. Moreover, the decorative thin films 240 and 250 can be formed to have an appearance of metallic sense, so as to maintain the uniformity of the appearance of the metal housing 100.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In conclusion of the above, the invention provides an electronic device that uses the opening on the metal housing and the metal line in the opening to form the excitation path of the loop antenna. Accordingly, the metal housing satisfies the requirement of appearance design, and furthermore the electronic device can utilize the metal housing to receive or transmit radio frequency signals to maintain the radiation efficiency of the antenna. The combination of the antenna and the housing also helps miniaturize the electronic device. In addition, because the metal housing and the metal line are integrally formed, the appearance quality of the electronic device is further improved and the production costs thereof are reduced.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56976724" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An electronic device (10), comprising:
