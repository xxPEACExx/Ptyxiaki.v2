When the light control unit 120 defines the areas according to the information, the light control unit 120 obtains the light property setting corresponding to the information from the storage unit 110 and simultaneously refers to the positions of the defined areas to generate the image signal.

After the light control unit 120 transmits the control signal to the multi-directional lighting unit 130, the multi-directional lighting unit 130 analyzes the control signal to adjust one of a color setting and a DMD (Digital Micro-mirror Device) status setting or a combination<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> thereof, so as to achieve the effect of simultaneously projecting different light beams to at least two latest-defined areas. Specifically, the DMD status setting includes a spectrum setting related to color, determining which micro-mirrors are set to ON (i.e. a status allowing light beams to pass), and setting time for switching the micro-mirrors between ON and OFF (e.g. a time ratio of ON to OFF of the micro-mirrors in the time of an image). It should be noted that the different light beams projected to different areas have different light colors and/or light intensities, for example. For instance, when two light beams having the same color are projected to two areas, one of the two light beams may be brighter and the other may be darker (different light intensities). Moreover, if the light intensity is 0, no light beam is projected. Therefore, the light beam may be projected only to one area and not to the other area. In addition, the projected two light beams may have different colors, such as red and green.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">The following embodiments explain an operation of the image capturing device 100 which adopts a capturing method with light assistance.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">In an embodiment, given that the user uses the image capturing device 100 to take a photo of the persons before the image capturing device 100, the signal processing unit 140 detects three faces in the preview image, and the image capturing device 100 is currently set to the night mode (the flashlight of the image capturing device 100 is set to ON in this mode). The light property setting corresponding to the image feature information stored in the storage unit 110 regulates to flash an artificial daylight (D50 light beam) to all the areas of the faces. When the user presses the shutter button, the light control unit 120 generates the control signal that sets the spectrum and ON/OFF of the micro-mirrors according to the areas where the three faces are located and the light property setting stored in the storage unit 120, and transmits the control signal to the<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> multi-directional lighting unit 130. Accordingly, the multi-directional lighting unit 130 adopts a specific RGB spectrum (e.g. R:x1.2, G:x1, B:x0.6) according to the control signal and sets the micro-mirrors belonging to the areas of the faces to full-ON, and then projects light beams at a speed of 1/30 second, for example. It is noted that, in another embodiment, the light control unit 120 adjusts positions of the light beams projected from the multi-directional lighting unit 130 according to a position offset of the multi-directional lighting unit 130 and the capturing unit 150 in the image capturing device 100, so as to assure that the light beams from the multi-directional lighting unit 130 are completely projected to the areas of the faces.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">In an embodiment, given the signal processing unit 140 further analyzes whether the persons before the image capturing device 100 smile after performing signal processing on the preview image, the light control unit 120 controls the multi-directional lighting unit 130 to project different light beams to the areas of the faces based on degrees of smile and project no light beam to the areas where no face appears according to the light property setting stored in the storage unit 110. For example, given the person in an area smiles, the light control unit 120 controls the multi-directional lighting unit 130 to project a yellow light beam to the area. If the person in the area only gives a slight smile, the light control unit 120 controls the multi-directional lighting unit 130 to project an orange light beam to the area. If the person in the area does not smile, the light control unit 120 controls the multi-directional lighting unit 130 to project a red light beam to the area.

Moreover, in the case that all the persons have smile, the multi-directional lighting unit 130 projects a yellow light beam to all the areas of the faces. In this embodiment, the light control unit 120 directly generates the image signal, turns on the multi-directional lighting unit 130, and transmits the image signal to the multi-directional lighting unit 130.

To be more specific, if any of the persons blinks, the light control unit 120 controls the multi-directional lighting unit 130 to continuously project a red light beam to all the areas of the faces (and project no light beam to the areas where no face appears), and the light control unit 120 controls the multi-directional lighting unit 130 to project a green light beam to all the areas of the faces when no one blinks. The capturing unit 150 automatically obtains the capture result after the green light beam is projected, and the light control unit 120 instantly controls the multi-directional lighting unit 130 to project light beams to the areas of the faces when the image is captured based on whether any of the persons blinks when the shutter button is pressed. For instance, if any of the persons blinks when the image is captured, the light control unit 120 controls the multi-directional lighting unit 130 to project a red light beam to all the areas of the faces.

On the other hand, an effect similar to using a stage spotlight to illuminate the target is also achieved during the capture.
