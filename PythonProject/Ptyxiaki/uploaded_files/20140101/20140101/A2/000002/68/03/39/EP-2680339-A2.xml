Therefore, it is preferable to permit attachment of only a battery apparatus having a suitable capacity, to the battery attachment section, and not to permit attachment of a battery apparatus not having a suitable capacity.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Thus, conventionally, e.g., around the middle of an attachment surface of the battery attachment section of the electronic equipment, a projection (recess) is provided which projects outward from the attachment surface, and in a bottom surface of the battery apparatus which faces the above-mentioned attachment surface, a recess (projection) is also provided so as to be hollowed out from the bottom surface<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> of the battery apparatus. And it is configured such that only when the projection and the recess match, attachment of the battery apparatus to the attachment section is permitted, and such that when they do not match, attachment of the battery apparatus to the battery attachment section is prohibited (see, e.g., Japanese Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP3427900B"><text>3427900</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Further, a battery charger as electronic equipment for charging the battery apparatus needs to set proper charging current values for supply to a plurality of types of battery apparatus, each having a different characteristic (capacity, suitable charging current, or the like). Thus, e.g., a switch for switching charging current values is provided on the battery charger, and a user operates the switch according to the battery apparatus.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, if the recess is provided around the middle of the attachment surface or the bottom surface of the battery apparatus or the electronic equipment, due to the fact that substrates and electronic components are disposed around the middle of the attachment surface and the bottom surface, the size of the battery apparatus or the electronic equipment must be increased, depending on the depth of the recess, and this configuration has been disadvantageous in miniaturizing the battery apparatus and the electronic equipment.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further, in the case where the switch for switching charging currents is provided on the battery charger, the user must operate the switch for each different characteristic of the battery apparatus, and this configuration has been disadvantageous in improving their operability. The present invention has been made in view of such circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide a battery apparatus and electronic equipment, in which the battery apparatus having<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> a characteristic compatible with the electronic equipment can be suitably attached to the electronic equipment, and which are advantageous in miniaturizing themselves and improving their operability.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further, another object of the present invention is to provide electronic equipment which can operate suitably according to a characteristic of a battery apparatus, and which is advantageous in enhancing its usability.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Disclosure of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">To achieve the above-mentioned objects, a battery apparatus of the present invention is characterized as follows. The battery apparatus includes: a case having a width, a thickness, and a length; a battery cell accommodated inside the case; and a battery-side terminal provided on an end surface which is positioned at one of ends of the case in a length direction and which is electrically connected to the battery cell. A bottom surface positioned on one side of the case in a thickness direction is aligned with an attachment surface of a battery attachment section of electronic equipment to attach the battery apparatus by sliding the case along the length direction thereof, and the battery-side terminal comes in contact with an attachment section-side terminal of the battery attachment section. The battery-side terminal is provided on the end surface, and an identification section for identifying a characteristic of the battery apparatus is provided at a location which is on the end surface and which is on a side of the battery-side terminal in the width direction. The identification section is configured with an identification recess formed in a manner open to the end surface, and at least one of a position, a cross-sectional shape, and<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> a length of the identification recess is formed on the basis of the characteristic of the battery apparatus.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Further, electronic equipment of the present invention is electronic equipment having a battery attachment section to which a battery apparatus is releasably attached, and is characterized as follows. The battery apparatus includes a case having a width, a thickness, and a length; a battery cell accommodated inside the case, and a battery-side terminal provided on an end surface which is positioned at one of ends of the case in a length direction and which is electrically connected to the battery cell. The battery-side terminal is provided on the end surface, and an identification section for identifying a characteristic of the battery apparatus is provided at a location which is on the end surface and which is on a side of the battery-side terminal in the width direction. The identification section is configured with an identification recess formed in a manner open to the end surface, and at least one of a position, a cross-sectional shape, and a length of the identification recess is formed on the basis of the characteristic of the battery apparatus. The battery attachment section is provided with an attachment section-side terminal which connects to the battery-side terminal in a state in which.a bottom surface positioned at one end of the case in a thickness direction is aligned with an attachment surface of the battery attachment section to attach the battery apparatus by sliding the case along the length direction thereof, and an identification projection which is inserted into the identification recess of the battery apparatus having the characteristic usable for the electronic equipment.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Furthermore, electronic equipment of the present invention is electronic equipment having a battery attachment<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> section to which a battery apparatus is releasably attached, and is characterized as follows. The battery apparatus includes a case having a width, a thickness, and a length; a battery cell provided inside the case; and a battery-side terminal provided on an end surface which is positioned at one of ends of the case in a length direction and which is connected to the battery cell. The battery-side terminal is provided on the end surface, and an identification section for identifying a characteristic of the battery apparatus is provided at a location which is on the end surface and which is on a side of thebattery-side terminal in the width direction. The identification section is configured with an identification recess formed in a manner open to the end surface, and at least one of a position, a cross-sectional shape, and a length of the identification recess is formed on the basis of the characteristic of the battery apparatus. The battery attachment section is provided with an attachment section-side terminal which connects to the battery-side terminal in a state in which the battery apparatus attached to the battery attachment section, and detection means for detecting at least one of the position, the cross-sectional shape, and the length of the identification recess of the battery apparatus, wherein the characteristic of the battery apparatus is determined on the basis of a detection result by the detection means.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">As a result, according to the battery apparatus and the electronic equipment of the present invention, attachment of the battery apparatus having a characteristic usable for the electronic equipment, to the battery attachment section is permitted by the identification projection being inserted into the identification recess. On the other hand, the identification recess of the battery apparatus not having a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> characteristic usable for the electronic equipment does not have the identification projection inserted thereinto, and thus, attachment of the battery apparatus not having the characteristic usable for the electronic equipment, to the battery attachment section is prohibited by the identification projection not being inserted into the identification recess. As a result, the battery apparatus having the characteristic compatible with the electronic equipment can be attached suitably.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Further, in the battery apparatus, portions which are inside of an end surface at one end of the case in the length direction and which are on both sides of the battery-side terminal in the width direction are left as a dead space where neither boards nor electronic components are disposed. Thus, even if the identification recess is provided in the end surface of the case, the size of the case is not increased. Therefore, this configuration is not a hindrance to miniaturizing the battery apparatus.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Furthermore, according to the battery apparatus of the present invention, when the battery apparatus has been attached to the battery attachment section of the electronic equipment, at least one of the position, cross-sectional shape, and length of the identification recess of the battery apparatus is detected by the detection means, whereby a suitable charging operation compatible with the characteristic of the battery apparatus can be performed on the basis of this detection result. Therefore, this configuration is advantageous in enhancing the usability of the electronic equipment.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>Brief Description of Drawings</b></heading><p id="p0016"

Thus, even if a battery apparatus 100 having the identification section 18 not correctly configured, i.e., a battery apparatus 100 which is not a genuine product, has been attached to the battery charger 400, only a normal charging operation is permitted, prohibiting a quick charging operation in which a charging current greater than in a normal charge is supplied to the battery apparatus 100. Thus, neither the battery apparatus 100 nor the battery charger 400 are unreasonably loaded. Consequently, this configuration is advantageous in implementing a suitable charging operation.</p><p id="p0138" num="0138">While the two identification recesses 1802, 1804 are provided as the identification section 18 of the battery apparatus 100 in each of the above-mentioned embodiments, one, or three or more identification recesses may be provided.
