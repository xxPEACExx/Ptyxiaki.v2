Radar level gauging is generally performed either by means of non-contact measurement, whereby electromagnetic signals are radiated towards the product contained in the tank, or by means of contact measurement, often referred to as guided wave radar (GWR), whereby electromagnetic signals are guided towards and into the product by a probe acting as a waveguide. The probe is generally arranged to extend vertically from the top towards the bottom of the tank. The probe may also be arranged in a measurement tube, a so-called chamber, that is connected to the outer wall of the tank and is in fluid connection with the inside of the tank.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The transmitted electromagnetic signals are reflected at the surface of the product, and the reflected signals are received by a receiver or transceiver comprised in the radar level gauge system. Based on the transmitted and reflected signals, the distance to the surface of the product can be determined.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">More particularly, the distance to the surface of the product is generally determined based on the time between transmission of an electromagnetic signal and reception of the reflection thereof in the interface between the atmosphere in the tank and the product contained therein. In order to determine the actual filling level of the product, the distance from a reference position to the surface is determined based on the above-mentioned time (the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> so-called time-of-flight) and the propagation velocity of the electromagnetic signals.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Most radar level gauge systems on the market today are either so-called pulsed radar level gauge systems that determine the distance to the surface of the product contained in the tank based on the difference in time between transmission of a pulse and reception of its reflection at the surface of the product, or systems that determine the distance to the surface based on the frequency difference between a transmitted frequency-modulated signal and its reflection at the surface. The latter type of systems are generally referred to as being of the FMCW (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) type.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For pulsed radar level gauge systems, time expansion techniques are generally used to resolve the time-of-flight.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Such pulsed radar level gauge systems may have a first oscillator for generating a transmission signal formed by pulses for transmission towards the surface of the product contained in the tank with a transmitted pulse repetition frequency f<sub>t</sub>, and a second oscillator for generating a reference signal formed by reference pulses with a reference pulse repetition frequency f<sub>ref</sub> that differs from the transmitted pulse repetition frequency by a known frequency difference Δf. This frequency difference Δf is typically in the range of Hz or tens of Hz.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">At the beginning of a measurement sweep, the transmission signal and the reference signal are synchronized to have the same phase. Due to the frequency difference Δf, the phase difference between the transmission signal and the reference signal will gradually increase during the measurement sweep.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">During the measurement sweep, the reflection signal formed by the reflection of the transmission signal at the surface of the product contained in the tank is correlated with the reference signal, so that an output signal is only produced when a reflected pulse and a reference pulse occur at the same time. The time from the start of the measurement sweep to the occurrence of the output signal resulting from the correlation of the reflection signal and the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> reference signal is a measure of the phase difference between the transmission signal and the reflection signal, which is in turn a time expanded measure of the time-of-flight of the reflected pulses, from which the distance to the surface of the product contained in the tank can be determined.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Since the accuracy of the frequency difference Δf between the transmission signal and the reference signal is important to the performance of the pulsed radar level gauge system, the second (and/or the first) oscillator can be controlled by a regulator that monitors the frequency difference Δf and controls at least one of the first and the second oscillator to achieve a frequency difference that is known and sufficiently close to the desired frequency difference Δf<sub>des</sub> for which the pulsed radar level gauge system is designed.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">To provide a stable regulation, the regulator may need in the order of hundreds of samples of the frequency difference Δf, which corresponds to a time duration which can be as long as 20 - 30 seconds due to the low value of the frequency difference Δf that is desired to achieve a sufficient time expansion.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Accordingly, currently available pulsed radar level gauge systems may need to be powered for a substantial period of time before the actual filling level measurement can start.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US7412337B"><text>US 7 412 337</text></patcit> discloses a method aimed at reducing the time needed to control the first and/or second oscillator to achieve the desired frequency difference Δf. In the method according to <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US7412337B"><text>US 7 412 337</text></patcit>, the gradient of at least two control variable-difference frequency data points is determined, and on the basis of the gradient and the difference frequency, an operating point of the control is determined and the control algorithm is adjusted. The method according to <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US7412337B"><text>US 7 412 337</text></patcit>, however, appears relatively complicated and cumbersome, and there also appears to be room for further improvement in respect of reducing the time needed for the control.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary</u></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">In view of the above, a general object of the present invention is to provide an improved pulsed radar level gauge system and method, and in particular a pulsed radar level gauge system and method enabling a more energy efficient filling level determination.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to a first aspect of the present invention, it is therefore provided a method of controlling a pulsed level gauge system comprising: transmission signal generating circuitry for generating an electromagnetic transmission signal in the form of a first pulse train having a first pulse repetition frequency; a propagation device connected to the transmission signal generating circuitry and arranged to propagate the electromagnetic transmission signal towards a surface of a product contained in a tank, and to return an electromagnetic reflection signal resulting from reflection of the electromagnetic transmission signal at the surface of the product; reference signal generating circuitry for generating an electromagnetic reference signal in the form of a second pulse train having a second pulse repetition frequency; and processing circuitry for determining a filling level of the product based on the electromagnetic reflection signal, the electromagnetic reference signal and a known frequency difference close to a predetermined frequency difference between the first pulse repetition frequency and the second pulse repetition frequency, wherein the method comprises the steps of: acquiring a signal indicative of a present operating temperature; determining an initial frequency control parameter for control of at least one of the transmission signal generating circuitry and the reference signal generating circuitry based on the present operating temperature and a plurality of data sets each comprising data indicative of a previous operating temperature and a previously determined frequency control parameter that resulted in the predetermined frequency difference, or a known frequency difference close to the predetermined frequency difference, between the first pulse repetition frequency and the second pulse repetition frequency at the previous operating temperature; and controlling, starting from the initial frequency control parameter, at least one of the transmission signal<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> generating circuitry and the reference signal generating circuitry to achieve the known frequency difference between the first pulse repetition frequency and the second pulse repetition frequency at the present operating temperature.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In cases when the initial frequency control parameter results in a frequency difference that is sufficiently close to the desired frequency difference, the step of controlling at least one of the transmission signal generating circuitry and the reference signal generating circuitry to achieve the known frequency difference may simply involve to control the transmission signal generating circuitry and/or the reference signal generating circuitry using the initial frequency control parameter. If it is determined that the resulting frequency difference (the known frequency difference) differs only slightly from the desired frequency difference, then this can be compensated for by the processing circuitry.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The present invention is based on the realization that the time it takes to control the transmission signal generating circuitry and/or the reference signal generating circuitry to achieve a frequency difference that is sufficiently close to the desired frequency difference is not constant but depends on a difference between the frequency control parameter (such as voltage) that results in the desired frequency difference and the initial frequency control parameter at which the control procedure is started. Generally, if the initial frequency control parameter is close to the "final" frequency control parameter (the frequency control parameter that results in the known frequency difference that is sufficiently close to the desired frequency difference), the control procedure will take less time than if the initial frequency control parameter is further from the "final" frequency control parameter.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The present inventors have further realized that the above-mentioned "final" frequency control parameter will vary for the pulsed level gauge system mainly depending on the operating temperature of the transmission signal generating circuitry and the reference signal generating circuitry, and that the time to achieve the desired frequency difference can be shortened considerably if the present operating temperature is checked and the initial<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> frequency control parameter is selected depending on the present operating temperature.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">If a frequency difference is sufficiently close to the desired frequency difference will depend on the system design, in particular the design of band pass filters etc. If it is deemed by the system designer that acceptable measurement performance for a given application can be achieved within a certain range around a desired frequency difference, then the frequency difference values within that range are sufficiently close to the desired frequency difference.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Hereby, more efficient control of the difference frequency than was previously possible can be achieved, which means that the time from powering up the pulsed level gauge system until a reliable filling level determination can be performed can be shortened considerably. This in turn provides for a more energy-efficient pulsed level gauge system, since intermittent operation with shorter active periods can be used. This is particularly useful for battery-powered pulsed level gauge systems, and can provide for a longer battery life and/or a higher update rate.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The present operating temperature may advantageously be the present operating temperature of the part of the level gauge system containing the transmission signal generating circuitry and the reference signal generating circuitry.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The initial frequency control parameter may, for example, be determined by selecting the closest match among the stored data sets. Alternatively, the initial frequency control parameter may be determined through interpolation or extrapolation using the stored data sets.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to various embodiments of the present invention, the method may further comprise the step of storing a data set comprising data indicative of the present operating temperature and a present frequency control parameter for the present operating temperature.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In these embodiments, the pulsed level gauge system is a self-learning system that will gradually build a better database of operating temperatures and corresponding frequency control parameters that resulted in the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> predetermined frequency difference at the corresponding operating temperature. This provides for a gradually reduced startup time of the pulsed level gauge system, that in turn results in a further improved energy-efficiency as discussed above.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Alternatively, or in addition, a temperature characterization may be performed in production or following installation of the pulsed level gauge system. To perform such a temperature characterization, the operating temperature of the pulsed level gauge system (at least the transmission signal generating circuitry and/or the reference signal generating circuitry) may be varied among a set of operating temperatures, and the frequency control parameters for each of the operating temperatures in the set of operating temperatures be stored together with the corresponding operating temperatures.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Through such a temperature characterization and pre-storing of data sets, the pulsed level gauge system can have the desired shortened startup time already directly following installation of the pulsed level gauge system.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">According to various embodiments of the present invention, at least one of the transmission signal generating circuitry and the reference signal generating circuitry may comprise a voltage controlled oscillator and the frequency control parameter may then be a control voltage provided to the voltage controlled oscillator.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The method according to the present invention may further comprise the step of determining the filling level based on the electromagnetic reflection signal, the electromagnetic reference signal and the known frequency difference between the first pulse repetition frequency and the second pulse repetition frequency. Using the known frequency difference, time-expansion techniques can be used to determine the time-of-flight of the electromagnetic transmission signal to the surface and back. Such techniques are, <i>per se</i>, well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">According to a second aspect of the present invention, it is provided a pulsed level gauge system for determining a filling level of a product contained in a tank, the pulsed level gauge system comprising: transmission<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> signal generating circuitry for generating an electromagnetic transmission signal in the form of a first pulse train having a first pulse repetition frequency; a propagation device connected to the transmission signal generating circuitry and arranged to propagate the electromagnetic transmission signal towards a surface of the product contained in the tank, and to return an electromagnetic reflection signal resulting from reflection of the electromagnetic transmission signal at the surface of the product; reference signal generating circuitry for generating an electromagnetic reference signal in the form of a second pulse train having a second pulse repetition frequency; processing circuitry for determining a filling level of the product based on the electromagnetic reflection signal, the electromagnetic reference signal and a known frequency difference between the first pulse repetition frequency and the second pulse repetition frequency; and frequency control circuitry for controlling at least one of the transmission signal generating circuitry and the reference signal generating circuitry to achieve the known frequency difference between the first pulse repetition frequency and the second pulse repetition frequency, wherein the pulsed level gauge system further comprises: a memory for storing a plurality of data sets, each comprising data indicative of a previous operating temperature and a previously determined frequency control parameter for the previous operating temperature; and a temperature sensor for providing a signal indicative of a present operating temperature of the pulsed level gauge system.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The propagation device may be any device capable of propagating electromagnetic signals, including transmission line probes, waveguides and various types of radiating antennas such as horn antennas, parabolic antennas, rod antennas, array antennas etc.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">It should be noted that the processing circuitry as well as the frequency control circuitry may be implemented as one or several microprocessors comprised in the level gauge system. The processing circuitry, the frequency control circuitry, the memory and the temperature sensor may be implemented as individual microprocessors or as integrated functions in a single microprocessor or circuit board.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The tank may be any container or vessel capable of containing a product, and may be metallic, or partly or completely non-metallic, open, semi-open, or closed. Furthermore, the filling level of the product contained in the tank may be determined directly by arranging the propagation device to propagate the transmission signal towards the product inside the tank, or indirectly by arranging the propagation device inside a so-called chamber located on the outside of the tank, but being in fluid connection with the inside of the tank in such a way that the level in the chamber corresponds to the level inside the tank.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Either or both of the transmission signal generating circuitry and the reference signal generating circuitry may comprise a voltage controlled oscillator circuit, which may comprise a crystal oscillator. Alternatively, either or both of the transmission signal generating circuitry and the reference signal generating circuitry may comprise a resonator element formed by electronic circuitry comprising a portion with inductive characteristics and a portion with capacitive characteristics.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The pulsed level gauge system may additionally comprise measurement circuitry configured to form a measurement signal comprising a sequence of values, each value representing a time correlation between a pulse of the electromagnetic reference signal and the electromagnetic reflection signal.

A level gauge system configured for wireless communication may often also be required to receive power from a local energy store, such as a battery or similar. To keep the maintenance cost of the level gauge system 1 down, battery life should be as long as possible, preferably in the order of several years, which means that it is important to design the level gauge system 1 for a very low average energy consumption, without compromising the performance of the level gauge system 1 in terms of, for example, accuracy and ability to monitor changes in the tank 2.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">A widely used scheme for handling situations where the average energy consumption is important is schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig 2</figref>.
