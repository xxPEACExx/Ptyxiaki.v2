Technical Field</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to an apparatus and method for displaying a menu in a mobile device, and more particularly, for displaying a menu with efficient use of a screen of the mobile device.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>2. Description of the Related Art</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Various technologies for mobile devices are currently developed. Particularly, as touch screen mobile devices have evolved, where the touch screen functions as a convenient input unit, the technology development for a user interface of the mobile device has accelerated.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In a touch screen mobile device, when a particular application is executed, menus for providing various functions on the application can be displayed on the touch screen. For example, an environment setting menu for setting an environment of the mobile device, or a menu including drawing tools in a drawing application and the like, can be displayed. Further, the mobile device can detect a user's touch gesture such as a touch for selecting an item or an icon included in the menu through the touch screen.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, the mobile device has a disadvantage of a relatively small display unit in comparison with a desktop PC. Accordingly, when one or more menus with multiple selections is displayed on the touch screen, a considerable portion of the relatively smaller touch screen may be hidden by the menu.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Further, in a hierarchical menu structure including a higher menu (main menu) and a lower menu (sub-menu) associated with the higher menu, when an icon of the lower menu is desired to be executed, the higher menu is first accessed and then the lower menu is sequentially accessed. Accordingly, when the user wants to execute an icon belonging to the lower menu or to a sub-menu of the lower menu (e.g., from a "lowest menu"), the user is required to sequentially access the higher menu, the lower menu, and the lowest menu, and then the icon belonging to the lowest menu. As a result, the user repeats such a process of executing the menus multiple times. Therefore, in order to execute the icon<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> belonging to the lowest menu, the user inconveniently performs many touches to gain access to the desired icon and execute its associated function.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Furthermore, in order to execute the icon of the lowest menu, it is required to display a plurality of menus from the higher menu to the lowest menu on the display unit of the mobile device. However, as described above, the mobile device has a relatively small display screen, a considerable portion of which becomes hidden by the plurality of menus when the menus are displayed. Accordingly, the user cannot maximally use an optimized touch screen for displaying a screen of the mobile device.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention provides an apparatus and a method for displaying a menu capable of efficiently using a screen of a mobile device.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for displaying a menu in a mobile device. An object generating event is detected for at least one selected menu item icon of at least one menu displayed on a touch screen. When the object generating event is detected, an object is generated and displayed, which performs an equivalent function to that of the at least one selected menu item icon.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In accordance with an embodiment, there is provided an apparatus for displaying a menu in a mobile device, the apparatus including a touch screen for displaying a screen of the mobile device; and a controller configured to detect an object generating event for at least one selected menu item icon of at least one menu displayed on the touch screen, and to generate and control display of an object for performing an equivalent function to that of the at least one selected menu item icon when the object generating event is detected.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In accordance with a menu displaying method and apparatus in a mobile device according to an embodiment, there is an advantage of executing a function of a menu item icon only by executing an object after generating the object having the same function as that of the menu item icon.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Therefore, in accordance with a menu displaying method and method in a mobile device according to an embodiment, there is an advantage of optimizing a touch screen and maximally using the optimized touch screen.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0005"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram schematically illustrating an example mobile device which may incorporate embodiments of the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart of a menu displaying method in a mobile device according to an embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> depicts screen examples illustrating an implementation of the menu displaying method of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> depicts screen examples illustrating an alternative execution of the menu displaying method of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG.2</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG 5</figref> depicts screen examples illustrating an alternative execution of the menu displaying method of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart of a menu displaying method in a mobile device according to another embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> depicts screen examples illustrating an execution of a menu displaying method in a mobile device according to another embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart of a menu displaying method in a mobile device according to another embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> depicts screen examples illustrating an execution of a comparative example for a menu displaying method in a mobile device.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref> depicts screen examples illustrating an execution of a menu displaying method in a mobile device according to another embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11</figref> depicts screen examples illustrating an execution of a menu displaying method in a mobile device according to another embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref> is a flowchart of a menu displaying method in a mobile device according to an embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 13</figref> depicts screen examples illustrating an execution of a menu displaying method in a mobile device according to an embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 14</figref> depicts screen examples illustrating an execution of a menu displaying method in a mobile device according to an embodiment of the present invention.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0006"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</b></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

A menu example thereof is depicted in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> 3</figref>, screen (a). That is, a menu 202 in the form of a rectangular bar of side-by-side icons includes menu item icons 203-1, 203-2, 204, 203-3, 2-3-4 and 203-5 displayed on the touch screen 200.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The menu item icons 203-1 to 203-5 and 204 refer to icons for performing predetermined functions used in the mobile device. For example, one menu item icon may be a pen icon 204 for performing a function of drawing a line on the screen in a drawing application used in the mobile device. Other icons may be a storage icon 203-1 for storing the drawing in the storage unit in the drawing application, a text icon 203-2 for inputting a character text, an eraser icon 203-3 for deleting a drawn part, a return icon 203-4 for canceling a previously performed function, and a re-execution icon 205-5 for re-executing a previously canceled function. Many other possible icons for performing various other functions can be alternatively or additionally displayed. The menu 202 is a set including one or more menu item icons 203-1 to 203-5 and 204. In this example, the menu 202 may be a set having a bar shape in which the menu item icons are arranged in a row; however, various other configurations are possible. Further, the menu 202 may include a menu termination icon 208 for removing the menu 202 from the touch screen. When the menu 202 is so removed, it may be caused to reappear via a predetermined touch gesture in a predetermined area of the screen 202; or by a voice command or other input command. With continued reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, at step 12, it is determined whether an "object generating event" is detected. This event refers to an event for generating an object via a predetermined type of touch input on a menu item icon (or icons), to select and activate the menu item touched. That is, the object generating event corresponds to an event for the selected one or more menu item icons 203-1 to 203-5 and 204 (hereafter, "the menu icons" for brevity). The predetermined touch input on the selected menu item(s) can be designated as any one or more of a single tap, a plurality of taps, a long touch (i.e., a simple touch maintained for more than a predetermined duration), a linear drag, a non-linear drag or a rotational drag. If the object generating event is detected at step 12, then at step 14 an object (or objects, if multiple icons are selected) is generated for performing the same function as that of the selected menu icon, and the generated object is displayed on the touch screen.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">An example of an object generating event is shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, in the transition from screen (a) to screen (b). A drag gesture in a downward direction is<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> performed on menu icon 204, which is recognized as a touch input that generates a corresponding object for the touched icon 204. In response, the controller 110 generates an object 206 for performing the same function as that of the menu icon 204 and displays the generated object on the touch screen 200. In this example, the object 206 can perform a function of the pen icon 204 for performing the function of drawing a line on the screen in the drawing application used in the mobile device.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">It should be noted, the generated object 206 can be generated with the same appearance as the selected menu icon 204, thus being rendered as a copy of the selected menu icon, as shown in the examples of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. Alternatively, the generated object can be rendered in a different appearance or size. Further, in the example drag operation of screens (a) and (b), the generated object 206 appears to be dragged as a copy of the selected icon 204 to a current position of the drag, and the original menu 202 remains in an unchanged state. The user may then simplify the display screen by deleting the original menu 202 via touching the X ion 208, resulting in a screen with only the generated object, as shown in screen (c). In an embodiment variant, when the drag operation is performed on a selected icon 204 to generate the corresponding object 206 at a screen position away from the menu 202, the menu 202 may be caused to automatically disappear; the menu can then be caused to reappear upon detection of a predetermined input command. In another variant, only the icon 204 initially disappears from the menu 202 when the object 206 is generated; the remaining icons can be caused to disappear when the X icon 208 is touched.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">At a next step 16 of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the controller 110 detects an "object executing event" for the generated object 206. The object executing event can be a touch input on the object 206, e.g., a single tap, a multi-tap, e.g., double tap, , a long touch, any drag type, or In the example of screen (c), a user performs a single tap as a new touch input (event), resulting in the display shown in screen (d). That is, when the object executing event is detected by the controller 110, it executes a function of the object in step 18. For example, as shown in screed (d), the function of the pen icon is executed, i.e., for drawing the line on the screen in the drawing application, which is the function of the menu item icon 204.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Accordingly, in accordance with the menu displaying method in the mobile device according to the embodiment of the present invention, the object<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> for performing the same function as that of the selected menu icon is generated and the function of the menu icon can be executed just by executing the object. That is, in accordance with the exemplary menu displaying method, even when the menu disappears as shown in screen (c), the function of the menu icon can be executed by just executing the object. Further, in the example embodiment, the function of the pen icon for drawing the line on the screen in the drawing application, which is the function of the menu item icon, can be executed by executing the object also in an area where the menu disappears as shown in screen (c). Accordingly,, there is an advantage of simplifying the touch screen for subsequent interaction operations with the selected function. Further, a predetermined input command can be designated to cause the menu 202 to reappear, such as a touch input on a certain portion of the screen.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIGs. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref> depict example screens illustrating an execution of a menu displaying method in a mobile device according to another embodiment of the present invention.

Furthermore, when the object 206 touches at least one side of the touch screen and thus bounces from the one side, the object 206 can stop after moving by a predetermined distance according to an intensity of the flicking 302. For example, in screen (c), the object 206 can move in a direction<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> of a top side of the touch screen 200 by the flicking detected by the controller 110. Further, when the object 206 touches the top side of the touch screen 200, the object 206 may bounce from the top side. Furthermore, the object 206 can stop after moving by the predetermined distance according to the intensity of the flicking 302 as shown in screen (c) Accordingly, as shown in screen (d), the user can perform the drawing action on the area near the mountain and the tower by first moving the object 206 to an area away from the mountain and the tower, and then inputting another predetermined command on the object 206 (executing the object).Thus the user can optimize the screen of the mobile device, facilitating a desired operation with the optimized screen.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart of a menu displaying method in a mobile device according to another embodiment of the present invention. <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG 7</figref> depicts screen examples illustrating an execution of this method.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, , steps 20, 22 and 24, which generate the object 206 from the menu 202, are the same as steps 10, 12 and 14, respectively of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.

The sub object generating event refers to an event for generating a sub object which will be described below. The sub object generating event may be a touch input on the object 206, which may be any of the touch inputs noted above, e.g., single tap, multi-tap, long touch, any type of drag, or flick. A voice command could also be used to generate the sub object. In the example of <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>, screen (b), a new touch input 400 on the obj ect 206 is made to initiate the sub object generating event. Note that prior to, or after, this new touch input 400, the menu 200 image may have been caused to disappear (as illustrated in (b)) via touch input on the X icon 208.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">In the next step 28, when the sub object generating event is detected by the controller 110, the controller 110 generates a sub object for performing a sub function of the function of the object, and displays the generated sub object on the touch screen. The sub function may be a function of a lower menu item icon of the one or more menu item icons corresponding to the object.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">For example, the sub object generating event may be touch input 400, e.g., a long touch or tap on the object 206 as shown in (b). Accordingly, when the touch input 400 is detected sub objects 402 to 409 are generated and displayed, for performing sub functions of the function of the object 206. In the example, the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> object 206 performs the same function as that of the menu item icon 204 which is the pen icon for drawing the line on the screen in the drawing application. Accordingly, the sub function of the object 206 may be the function of the lower item icon of the pen icon For instance, the lower item icon of the pen icon may be a line thickness icon for selecting a thickness of the pen. Accordingly, the controller 110 can generate the sub objects 402 to 408 for performing the function of selecting the line thickness which is the sub function of the object 206, and display the generated sub objects on the touch screen as shown in screen (c). At this time, the controller 110 can place and display the sub objects 402 to 408 in the area near the object 206 in a radial form surrounding the object 206.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, in the next step 30, the controller 110 detects a sub object executing event, whereupon the sub function of the object is performed. The sub object executing event may be an event for touching the sub object. Here, the touch input may be any of the types mentioned above. For example, as shown in screen (d), in a case where the sub object executing event is the touch on a sub object 408, when a touch input 410 on the sub object 408 is detected, the sub object can be executed by the controller. At this time, as shown in screen (e), when the function of the sub object is selecting the line thickness, the controller 110 selects a line thickness corresponding to the function of the sub object on which the touch 410 is detected, and displays the line on the touch screen..</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Accordingly, as compared to conventional methodology, the embodiment enables, the user to execute a lower menu item icon through a small number of touches. As mentioned, conventional methods require the user to open a series of hierarchical menus to access and execute a sub menu such as the line thickness menu exemplified in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>. The present approach, by contrast, enables such access and execution in a shorter period of time, via direct execution of the objects as described.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069"><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart of a menu displaying method in a mobile device according to another embodiment of the present invention. <figref idrefs="f0009">FIGs. 9</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0010">10</figref> illustrate screen examples to exemplify different implementations of the embodiment.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Steps 40 and 42 of the method are the same as steps 10 and 12, respectively, of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>; however, in screen (a) of <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, icon 504 of a first menu 502 is selected to generate an object. But instead of generating an object such as<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> 206 similar or identical to the selected menu icon 504, a second menu 506 is automatically generated. Thus, in step 44, the object generated is the second menu 506 (note that step 44 also includes execution of the menu 506). First menu 502 includes a first menu item icon such as a pen icon 504 for performing a pen function displayed on a touch screen 500. When a first touch for executing the pen icon 504 is detected, the second menu 506 is displayed, which includes first lower menu item icons 507, 508 and 509 of the pen icon 504, as shown in screen (b). These icons can be a pen type icon 507 for selecting a pen type, a line thickness icon 509 for selecting a line thickness, and a color icon 508 for selecting a line color. Further, when a second touch for executing the color icon 508 is detected by the controller, the controller displays a third menu 510 including second lower menu item icons of the color icon 508 as shown in screen (c). The second lower menu item icons may include a red icon (R), an orange icon (O), a yellow icon (Y), a green icon (G), a blue icon (B), a navy icon (N), a purple icon (P), and a white icon (W). For instance, when a third touch for executing the purple icon (P) 512 is detected by the controller, the controller can execute a function of drawing a purple line on the touch screen as shown in screen (d).</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">According to the comparative example shown in screens (a) to (d) of <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, all of the first menu 502, the second menu 506, and the third menu 510 are displayed to execute the purple icon 512 at the lower level, such that a larger portion of the touch screen is hidden by the three menus 502, 506 and 510. Accordingly, when executing the low menu item icons, an area in which the drawing is possible becomes smaller.

However, if a touch for a menu hiding icon is detected at step 46, a menu hiding function is performed, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>, screens (a) through (d). Referring to screen (a), menus 602, 606 and 610 can be the same as menus 502, 506 and 510 of <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>. (Note that an "X" icon such as 208 of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is not included in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIGs. 9</figref> or <figref idrefs="f0010">10</figref>, for reasons that will become apparent below.) First menu 602 includes a first menu item icon such as a pen icon 604 for performing a pen function displayed on touch screen 600. When a first touch for executing the pen icon 604 is detected by the controller 110, the controller 110 can display the second menu 606<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> including first lower menu item icons of the pen icon 604 on the touch screen. The first lower menu item icons include a pen type icon 607 for selecting a pen type, a line thickness icon 609 for selecting a line thickness, and a color icon 608 for selecting a line color. Further, when a second touch for executing the color icon 608 is detected by the controller, the controller can display a third menu 610 including second lower menu item icons of the color icon 608 (analogous to color icon 508 described above). In the example of <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG 9</figref>, once the purple icon 512 is selected, its function is executed as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, screen (d), but the three menus 502, 506 and 510 remain displayed, blocking a portion of the display screen. In the implementation of <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>, when a predetermined touch input is detected on a lower icon such as the purple icon 612, an object 614 is generated and displayed, for performing the same function as icon 612 when subsequently executed. Thus, in the method of <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> corresponding to the implementation of <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>, an additional object 614 is generated (besides the object 606) in response to additional touch input.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">In a next step, the controller 110 can detect a touch on a menu hiding icon for temporarily hiding at least one menu displayed on the touch screen in step 46. For example, referring to screen (b) of <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>, a menu hiding icon 616 is displayed on the touch screen. (Icon 616 may be initially displayed along with menu 602, or alternatively it is displayed only after at least one of the sub menus 606, 610 is displayed.) The menu hiding icon 616 has a function of temporarily hiding at least one menu displayed on the touch screen. Accordingly, the controller 110 can detect the touch on the menu hiding icon 616 as shown in the transition from screen (b) to (c).</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">In a next step, when the touch is detected by the controller 110, the controller 110 can hide at least one menu except for the second object from the touch screen in step 48. For example, referring to screen (c), when the touch on the menu hiding icon 616 displayed on screen (b) is detected, the controller 110 can hide the at least one menu 602, 606, and 610 except for the object 614 from the touch screen 600. Further, when a step of detecting a touch on a menu return icon 618 for returning at least one menu temporarily hidden from the touch screen and the touch are detected, the menu displaying method may further include a step of returning at least one hidden menu on the touch screen. Therefore, in the presently described embodiment, at least one menu 602, 606, and 610 except for the object 614 can be hidden from the touch screen and returned on the touch<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> screen by detecting touches on the menu hiding icon 616 and the menu return icon 618. Accordingly, the object 614 is excluded from a process in which at least one menu is hidden. Therefore, the object 614 is not hidden even when at least one menu is hidden as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>, screen (c), and thus the user can execute the object 614 with ease. For example, in a case where the object 614 performs the same function as that of the purple icon 612 for drawing the purple line on the touch screen, when an object executing event for executing the object 614 is detected by the controller 110, the controller 110 can execute the function of drawing the purple line as shown in screen (d). At this time, since at least one menu is hidden, there is an advantage of performing the drawing in an area where at least one menu had been displayed.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">. Therefore, in accordance with the menu displaying method in the mobile device according to the afore-described embodiment of the present invention, the touch screen can be optimized and maximally used in the mobile device having a smaller display unit in comparison with a desktop PC.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076"><figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11</figref> depicts screen examples illustrating an execution of a menu displaying method in a mobile device according to yet another embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Referring to screen (a), a first menu 702 including a first menu item icon such as a pen icon 704 for performing a pen function is displayed on a touch screen 700. Further, when a first touch for executing the pen icon 704 is detected by the controller 110, the controller 110 can display a second menu 706 including first lower menu item icons of the pen icon 704 on the touch screen. The first lower menu item icons include a pen type icon 707 for selecting a pen type, a line thickness icon 709 for selecting a line thickness, and a color icon 708 for selecting a line color. Further, when a second touch for executing the color icon 708 is detected by the controller, the controller can display a third menu 710 including second lower menu item icons of the color icon 708 (analogous to icon 508 described above). At this time, when an object generating event for the blue icon (B) 712 included in the second lower menu item icons is detected by the controller 110, the controller 110 can generate a first object 714 for performing the same function as that of the blue icon 712 and display the generated object on the touch screen 700. Further, when an object generating event for the purple icon (P) 716 included in the second lower menu item icons is detected by the controller 110, the controller 110 can generate a second object 718 for performing<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> the same function as that of the purple icon 716 and display the generated object on the touch screen 700.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Further, as seen in screen (a), a menu hiding icon 711 is displayed on the touch screen. The menu hiding icon 711 has a function of temporarily hiding at least one menu displayed on the touch screen. When a touch input is detected on icon 711, at least one menu is hidden from the touch screen, but the generated objects 714 and 718 are not hidden, as illustrated in screen (b). The menu hiding icon 711, after executed to hide the menus, is converted to a menu return icon 713 which can be executed to return the menus (in the same manner as menu return icon 618 described above.)</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">According to another embodiment of the present invention, the objects 714 and 718 are excluded from a process in which at least one menu is hidden. Therefore, the objects 714 and 718 are not hidden even when at least one menu is hidden as shown in screen (b), and thus the user can execute the objects 714 and 718. As shown in screen (b), a plurality of texts 720 to 726 are displayed (these were omitted in screen (a) for clarity, but it can be assumed the texts were generated prior to, or after, the generation of the menus of screen (a)).If objects 714 and 718 were never generated, then in order to change colors of the plurality of texts 702 to 726, the user could execute icons (for example, blue icon 712 and purple icon 716) corresponding to the lower menu item icons included in the third menu 710 of screen (a). However, as shown in screen (b), with the objects 714 and 718 already displayed, the user can change the colors of the plurality of texts via touch input on these objects, without the hierarchical touch operations otherwise required. That is, as shown in screen (c), when a touch on the first text 720 is detected by the controller immediately after a first object executing event for executing the first object 714 for performing the function of the blue icon 712 is detected by the controller, the controller can change the color of the first text to blue. (Alternatively, the text 720 is first touched, then the object 714 is touched to automatically change the color of the text to blue.) Further, as shown in screen (d), when a touch on the second text 722 is detected by the controller immediately after a second object executing event for executing the second object 718 for performing the function of the purple icon 716 is detected by the controller, the controller can change the color of the second text to purple. (Or, the text 722 is touched first, then the object 718 is touched to change the text color to purple.)<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Accordingly, with the present embodiment as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11</figref>, color change operations can be performed using a smaller number of touches. For instance, without the second object generation technique of <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11</figref> to generate objects such as 714, 718, in order to change plural colors of the texts to other plural colors, the user would need to touch the text and then also perform up to three additional touch inputs to pull down the desired color menus. When colors of ten text units are changed to other colors, this would require thirty or more additional touches. With the approach of <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11</figref>, the number of touches required to achieve the same result is significantly reduced.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081"><figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref> is a flowchart of a menu displaying method in a mobile device according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idrefs="f0013">FIGs. 13</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0014">14</figref> show screen examples illustrating the method.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">In this method, at least one menu including menu item icons on a touch screen 800 are first displayed in step 50. Next, an object generating event is detected for one or more menu item icons from the at least one displayed menu (step 52). When the object generating event is detected, an object for performing the same function as that of the one or more menu item icons is generated and displayed(step 54). Steps 50 to 54 are equivalent to steps 10 to 14 described in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> so their detailed descriptions will be omitted. In the example of <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG, 13</figref>, two objects 802 and 804 are generated, in a manner similar to that described and shown for the color changing objects 714, 718 in screen (a) of <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11</figref>.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">With the at least one generated object thus displayed, it may be easily removed by the user in accordance with the embodiment. To this end, at step 56, of the controller detects whether an object deleting event for deleting the object has occurred. The object deleting event refers to an event for deleting the object from the touch screen, e.g., by dragging or flicking the object to a predetermined recycle bin area. The object deleting event may alternatively or additionally be a different type of predetermined touch input on the object, e.g., a tap, multi-tap, long touch, or certain type of drag.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG 13</figref>, screens (a) to (c), a first object 802, a second object 804, and a menu hiding icon 801 are displayed on the touch screen 800. Further, the controller 110 can allocate a predetermined recycle bin area 806 to the touch screen 800. The predetermined recycle bin area 806 may be predetermined by the controller 110 of the mobile device, or may be determined by the controller<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> 110 after reception of a user's input. Further, the controller 110 can display an indicator or an area indication for indicating the predetermined recycle bin area 806 allocated to the touch screen 800 on the touch screen 800. Furthermore, the object deleting event may be an event for dragging the object to the predetermined recycle bin area. That is, referring to screen (b) of <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 13</figref>, the object deleting event may be an event for dragging the second object 804 displayed on the touch screen 800 to the predetermined recycle bin area 806.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">Further, referring to screen (a) of <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 14</figref>, the first object 802, the second object 804, and the menu hiding icon 801 are displayed on the touch screen 800. Further, the controller 110 can allocate a predetermined recycle bin area 812 to the touch screen 800. The predetermined recycle bin area 812 may be one or more sides of the touch screen 800, such as the left side 812as shown in screen (b) of <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 14</figref>. The one or more sides of the touch screen corresponding to the predetermined recycle bin area 812 may be predetermined by the controller 110 of the mobile device, or may be determined by the controller 110 after reception of a user's input. Further, as shown in screen (b), the controller 110 can display an indicator or an area indication 812 for indicating the one or more sides of the touch screen corresponding to the predetermined recycle bin area on the touch screen 800. Furthermore, the object deleting event may be an event for flicking the object to the predetermined recycle bin area. That is, as shown in (b), the object deleting event may be an event 810 for flicking the first object 802 displayed on the touch screen 800 to the left side 812 of the touch screen.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Accordingly, at step 58, the object is deleted from the touch screen when the object deleting event is detected.

Further, when the event for flicking 810 as shown in (b) of <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 14</figref> is detected, the controller 110 can delete the first object 802 from the touch screen 800 as shown in (c) of <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 14</figref>.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">The embodiments of the present invention can be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of the hardware and the software.
