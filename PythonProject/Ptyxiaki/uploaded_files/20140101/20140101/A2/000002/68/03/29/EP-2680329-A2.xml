The support sheet 12 may be a thermal release sheet in which the pressure-sensitive adhesive force is capable of being reduced by heating (to be specific, a thermal release sheet such as REVALPHA (manufactured by NITTO DENKO CORPORATION)) or an active energy ray irradiation release sheet in which the pressure-sensitive adhesive force is capable of being reduced by application of an active energy ray (for example, an ultraviolet ray and an electron beam) (to be specific, an active energy ray irradiation release sheet described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2005286003A"><text>2005-286003</text></patcit> or the like).
