Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">For example, as is described in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2010071270A"><text>2010-71270</text></patcit> (<patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2010071270A"><text>JP 2010-71270 A</text></patcit>), there is known an exhaust emission control system for an internal combustion engine, which includes a NOx purification catalyst and a reducing agent supply mechanism. The NOx purification catalyst purifies nitrogen oxides (NOx) in exhaust gas. The reducing agent supply mechanism supplies a reducing agent to an exhaust passage. The reducing agent is utilized to purify NOx at the NOx purification catalyst. In the reducing agent supply mechanism, urea aqueous solution that serves as the reducing agent is supplied to an addition valve via a supply tube. The urea aqueous solution is stored in a tank. The urea aqueous solution is injected from the addition valve to the exhaust passage. The injected urea aqueous solution is heated by the heat of exhaust gas. Thus, the urea aqueous solution changes into ammonia by the hydrolysis of urea. The ammonia is supplied to the NOx purification catalyst and is adsorbed by the NOx purification catalyst. Thus, NOx flowing into the NOx purification catalyst is reduced and purified.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the internal combustion engine described in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2010071270A"><text>JP 2010-71270 A</text></patcit>, engine operation is automatically stopped when a predetermined stop condition is satisfied, and engine operation is automatically restarted when a predetermined restart condition is satisfied. Then, in the exhaust emission control system described in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2010071270A"><text>JP 2010-71270 A</text></patcit>, at<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the time of a manual stop of the internal combustion engine through off operation of an ignition switch, the reducing agent is recovered from the supply tube of the reducing agent supply mechanism. Thus, damage to the supply tube is suppressed. Damage to the supply tube occurs due to freezing of the reducing agent remaining in the supply tube during an engine stop. On the other hand, at the time of an automatic stop of the internal combustion engine, recovery of the reducing agent from the supply tube is prohibited.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Incidentally, during an automatic stop of the internal combustion engine, high-temperature exhaust gas stays in the exhaust passage. Therefore, when the reducing agent remains in the addition valve at the time of an automatic stop of engine operation, the reducing agent in the addition valve boils due to the heat of high-temperature exhaust gas. Thus, the metal material of the addition valve may corrode. Then, it is conceivable that, in order to suppress corrosion of the addition valve, the reducing agent is recovered from the supply tube at the time of an automatic stop as in the case of the method at the time of a manual stop. However, when the reducing agent is recovered from the supply tube in the same manner as the method performed at the time of a manual stop, it takes time to supply the reducing agent to the addition valve at the time of an automatic restart of engine operation. Thus, it is not possible to promptly add the reducing agent into the exhaust passage.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The invention provides an exhaust emission control system for an internal combustion engine, which is able to promptly start injection of a reducing agent from an addition valve at the time of an automatic restart of engine operation while suppressing metallic corrosion of the addition valve due to boiling of the reducing agent remaining in the addition valve at the time of an automatic stop of engine operation, and a control method for the exhaust emission control system.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A first aspect of the invention provides an exhaust emission control system that is applied to an internal combustion engine in which an automatic stop of engine operation is carried out when a predetermined stop condition is satisfied and an automatic<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> restart of engine operation is carried out when a predetermined start condition is satisfied, that includes an addition valve that supplies a reducing agent to an exhaust passage and a supply tube that supplies the reducing agent to the addition valve, and that recovers the reducing agent in the supply tube at the time of a manual stop of engine operation as a result of off operation of an ignition switch, wherein, at the time of the automatic stop, the reducing agent in an amount that is smaller than a recovery amount of the reducing agent at the time of the manual stop is recovered from the supply tube.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the above configuration, the reducing agent is recovered from the supply tube not only at the time of the manual stop of the internal combustion engine but also at the time of the automatic stop of the internal combustion engine. Therefore, at the time of the automatic stop as well, the reducing agent is recovered from the distal end portion of the addition valve, which is exposed to high-temperature exhaust gas. Thus, it is possible to suppress corrosion of the metal material of the addition valve by suppressing boiling of the reducing agent in the addition valve at the time of the automatic stop of engine operation. In addition, when the reducing agent is recovered at the time of the automatic stop, a smaller amount of the reducing agent than the recovery amount of the reducing agent at the time of the manual stop is recovered. Therefore, at the time of the automatic stop, it is possible to cause a larger amount of the reducing agent to remain in the supply tube as compared to that at the time of the manual stop. Thus, by promptly supplying the reducing agent to the addition valve at the time of the automatic restart, it is possible to promptly inject the reducing agent from the addition valve to the exhaust passage.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the exhaust emission control system according to the first aspect of the invention, a recovery amount of the reducing agent at the time of the automatic stop may increase as a temperature of exhaust gas in the exhaust passage at the time of the automatic stop rises.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">When the temperature of exhaust gas is high, the supply tube also easily rises in temperature. Therefore, when the reducing agent remains in the supply tube, the reducing agent easily boils in the supply tube, and the metal material of the supply tube<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> easily corrodes. With the above configuration, as the temperature of exhaust gas is higher and the reducing agent more easily boils in the supply tube, a larger amount of the reducing agent is recovered. Therefore, it is possible to suppress corrosion of the supply tube by suppressing boiling of the reducing agent in the supply tube.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the exhaust emission control system according to the first aspect of the invention, when a temperature of exhaust gas in the exhaust passage at the time of the automatic stop is higher than a predetermined temperature, the reducing agent may be injected from the addition valve at the time of the automatic stop and then the reducing agent may be recovered from the supply tube.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">With the above configuration, when the temperature of exhaust gas is higher than the predetermined temperature, the reducing agent is injected from the addition valve. When the reducing agent is injected, a relatively low-temperature reducing agent is supplied from, for example, a tank, or the like, to the addition valve, so the addition valve is cooled. In addition, the addition valve is cooled by the heat of vaporization of the reducing agent injected. Thus, it is possible to suppress damage to components that constitute the addition valve due to high-temperature heat.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the exhaust emission control system according to the first aspect of the invention, an injection amount at the time when the reducing agent is injected from the addition valve at the time of the automatic stop may increase as the temperature of exhaust gas in the exhaust passage at the time of the automatic stop rises.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">With the above configuration, as the temperature of exhaust gas is higher and the addition valve more easily rises in temperature, a larger amount of cooling reducing agent is injected. Therefore, it is possible to further cool the addition valve.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the exhaust emission control system according to the first aspect of the invention, a period during which the reducing agent is injected from the addition valve at the time of the automatic stop may extend as the temperature of exhaust gas in the exhaust passage at the time of the automatic stop rises.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">With the above configuration, as the temperature of exhaust gas is higher and the addition valve more easily rises in temperature, the period during which a cooling<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> reducing agent is injected extends. Therefore, as the temperature of exhaust gas is higher and the addition valve more easily rises in temperature, it is possible to inject a larger amount of cooling reducing agent.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A second aspect of the invention provides a control method for an exhaust emission control system that is applied to an internal combustion engine in which an automatic stop of engine operation is carried out when a predetermined stop condition is satisfied and an automatic restart of engine operation is carried out when a predetermined start condition is satisfied, that includes an addition valve that supplies reducing agent to an exhaust passage and a supply tube that supplies the reducing agent to the addition valve, and that recovers the reducing agent in the supply tube at the time of a manual stop of engine operation as a result of off operation of an ignition switch. The control method includes, at the time of the automatic stop, recovering the reducing agent from the supply tube in an amount that is smaller than a recovery amount of the reducing agent at the time of the manual stop.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">Features, advantages, and technical and industrial significance of exemplary embodiments of the invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like numerals denote like elements, and wherein:

The automatic stop control and the automatic restart control are known, so, hereinafter, the outline of the automatic stop control and automatic restart control will be described. In the automatic stop control, for example, when the vehicle speed is "0" and an automatic stop condition that, for example, the accelerator pedal is not depressed, is satisfied, the control device 80 executes an automatic stop of engine operation on the condition that these conditions are satisfied. In the automatic restart control, when a restart condition that, for example, the accelerator pedal is depressed during an automatic stop, is satisfied, the control device 80 automatically restarts the internal combustion engine 1.

In the addition control, an urea additive amount just enough to reduce NOx that is emitted from the internal combustion engine 1 is calculated on the basis of the engine operating state, and the like. In the addition control, the valve opening state of the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 is controlled such that the urea aqueous solution of the calculated urea additive amount is injected from the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 to the exhaust passage 26. Thus, NOx in exhaust gas is reduced and purified. Addition of urea aqueous solution for reducing and purifying NOx is carried out continuously during engine operation. When engine operation is stopped, addition of urea aqueous solution for reducing NOx is also stopped. The urea aqueous solution addition control is stopped also during the above-described automatic stop of engine operation, and, when engine operation is automatically restarted, the urea aqueous solution addition control is automatically started.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In this way, when engine operation is stopped, addition of urea aqueous solution is also stopped. Here, the control device 80 executes recovery control at the time of a manual stop of the internal combustion engine 1. A manual stop of the internal combustion engine 1 is carried out through off operation of the ignition switch 25. The recovery control is executed by rotating the pump 220 in the reverse direction. In the recovery control, all the amount of urea aqueous solution in the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 and the urea aqueous solution supply tube 240 is recovered. Thus, it is possible to suppress damage to the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 or the urea<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> aqueous solution' supply tube 240. Damage to the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 or the urea aqueous solution supply tube 240 occurs due to an increase in the volume of urea aqueous solution, remaining in the urea aqueous solution supply tube 240 or the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230, through freezing during a stop of the internal combustion engine 1.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Incidentally, during an automatic stop of the internal combustion engine 1, high-temperature exhaust gas stays in the exhaust passage 26. Therefore, when urea aqueous solution stays in the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 during an automatic stop of the internal combustion engine 1, the urea aqueous solution in the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 may boil due to the heat of high-temperature exhaust gas and the metal material of the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 may corrode. Then, in the present embodiment, in order to suppress such corrosion of the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230, urea aqueous solution that has been supplied to the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 is also recovered at the time of an automatic stop. When urea aqueous solution is recovered at the time of an automatic stop in a manner similar to that at the time of a manual stop, it takes time to supply urea aqueous solution to the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 at the time of an automatic restart of engine operation. Thus, it is not possible to promptly execute addition control for adding urea aqueous solution to the exhaust passage 26. Then, in the present embodiment, at the time of an automatic stop, urea aqueous solution in an amount that is smaller than a recovery amount of urea aqueous solution at the time of a manual stop is recovered.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Hereinafter, recovery control for recovering urea aqueous solution at the time of an automatic stop will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. The control device 80 executes urea aqueous solution recovery control at the time of an automatic stop in accordance with the procedure of processes shown in the flowchart of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.

As described above, when the automatic stop execution condition is satisfied, the automatic stop execution flag is set to the "ON" state. The control device 80 automatically stops engine operation through a process other than the process shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>. Thus, determination in step S10 as to whether the automatic stop execution flag is set to the "ON" state corresponds to determination as to whether an automatic stop of engine operation is being executed. When it is determined in step S10 that the automatic stop execution flag is not set to the "ON" state (NO in step S10), the process proceeds to step S18. In step S18, a count value C of the counter 80c is reset to "0". After the count value C is reset to "0", the process proceeds to step S19. In step S19, an urea aqueous solution recovery flag is set to an "OFF" state. The count value C is to measure a recovery period of urea aqueous solution. In addition, the urea aqueous solution recovery flag is used for the control device 80 to execute recovery control for recovering urea aqueous solution in the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 and the urea aqueous solution supply tube 240 on the condition that the urea aqueous solution recovery flag is set to the "ON" state. That is, when negative determination is made in step S10, the internal combustion engine 1 is in operation, and it is not required to execute urea aqueous solution recovery control during an automatic stop. Therefore, when negative determination is made in step S10, the count value C is reset to "0", and the urea aqueous solution recovery flag is set to the "OFF" state. Then, the control device 80 once ends the process. In step S18, when the count value has been already set to "0", the count value is kept at "0" as it is. In addition, in step S19, when the urea aqueous solution recovery flag has been already set to the "OFF" state, the urea aqueous solution recovery flag is kept in the "OFF" state. On the other hand, when it is determined in step S10 that the automatic stop execution flag is set to the "ON" state (YES in step S10), it is estimated that an automatic stop has been carried out, so the process proceeds to step S11.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In step S11, it is determined whether the urea aqueous solution recovery flag is set to the "ON" state.

When it is determined in step S12 that the automatic stop execution flag has not been set to the "ON" state in the last process (NO in step S12), the process proceeds to step S13. That is, when the urea aqueous solution recovery flag is not set to the "ON" state and the automatic stop execution flag has not been set to the "ON" state in the last process, the current process is the process that is executed immediately after the automatic stop execution flag enters the "ON" state. Therefore, it is estimated that urea aqueous solution recovery control has not been executed during the current automatic stop period.

In this way, in the present embodiment, by recovering urea aqueous solution also at the time of an automatic stop, boiling of urea aqueous solution in the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 at the time of an automatic stop of engine operation is suppressed, with the result that corrosion of the metal material of the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 is suppressed. In addition, the urea aqueous solution supply tube 240 tends to rise in temperature as the second exhaust gas temperature TH2 rises, so, by setting the recovery amount of urea aqueous solution to a larger amount, part of urea aqueous solution in the urea aqueous solution supply tube 240 is also recovered.

The counter determination value α is set to an integer larger than or equal to "1".

Thus, by promptly supplying urea aqueous solution to the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 at the time of an automatic restart, it is possible to promptly inject urea aqueous solution from the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 to the exhaust passage 26.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">(2) In the present embodiment, the recovery amount of urea aqueous solution at the time of an automatic stop is increased as the temperature of exhaust gas in the exhaust passage 26 at the time of an automatic stop rises.

In this respect, according to the present embodiment, a larger amount of urea aqueous solution is recovered as the exhaust gas temperature rises and urea aqueous solution more<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> easily boils in the urea aqueous solution supply tube 240, so it is possible to appropriately suppress corrosion of the urea aqueous solution supply tube 240 by suppressing boiling of urea aqueous solution in the urea aqueous solution supply tube 240.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Next, one embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 5</figref>.

This suppresses damage to the components, such as the coil, that constitute the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 due to high-temperature heat. In addition, in the present embodiment, after injecting urea aqueous solution in this way at the time of an automatic stop, as in the case of the above-described embodiment, in order to suppress boiling of urea aqueous solution in the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230, urea aqueous solution in the urea aqueous solution supply tube 240 is recovered.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Hereinafter, urea aqueous solution injection and recovery control at the time of an automatic stop in the present embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006">FIG. 3 to FIG. 5</figref>.

In step S35, the count value C of the counter 80c is reset to "0". After the count value C is reset to "0", the process proceeds to step S36. In step S36, the urea aqueous solution recovery flag and the urea aqueous solution injection flag both are set to the "OFF" state, and the control device 80 once ends the process. In the present embodiment, as will be described later, the count value C indicates an injection period during which the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 carries out injection for cooling and a recovery period during which urea aqueous solution is recovered. In addition, the urea aqueous solution injection flag is used for the control device 80 to execute injection control for injecting urea aqueous solution at the time of an automatic stop on the condition that the urea aqueous solution injection flag is set to the "ON" state. That is, when negative determination is made in step S20, the internal combustion engine 1 is in operation, and it is not required to recover urea aqueous solution and to execute injection control for cooling the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230. Therefore, the count value C is reset to "0", and both the urea aqueous solution recovery flag and the urea aqueous solution injection flag are set to the "OFF" state.

Subsequently, the process proceeds to step S25. In step S25, on the basis of the second exhaust gas temperature TH2, a recovery amount of urea aqueous solution and a counter determination value α corresponding to the recovery amount are set, and an injection amount of urea aqueous solution and a counter determination value β corresponding to the injection amount are set. The recovery amount of urea aqueous solution and the counter determination value α are set by applying the detected second exhaust gas temperature TH2 to the map shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> as in the case of the above-described embodiment.

That is, when the exhaust gas temperature is lower than or equal to the<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> predetermined temperature TS and the exhaust gas temperature is not so high, the components, such as the coil, that constitute the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 are less likely to be damaged due to heat. Therefore, it is not required to cool the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 by injecting urea aqueous solution. Thus, the injection amount is set to "0". On the other hand, when the exhaust gas temperature is higher than the predetermined temperature TS, the components that constitute the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 are likely to be damaged due to heat, and, as the second exhaust gas temperature TH2 rises, the components that constitute the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 are more likely to be damaged by heat. Therefore, the injection amount of urea aqueous solution is set to a large amount. Then, in step S25, the counter determination value β corresponding to the injection amount is set. The counter determination value β is a value that corresponds to a period during which the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 is opened in order to inject urea aqueous solution in the set injection amount. The counter determination value β is set to an integer larger than or equal to "1" when the second exhaust gas temperature TH2 is higher than the predetermined temperature TS.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">.

In step S27, the urea aqueous solution injection flag is set to the "ON" state. The control device 80 executes injection of urea aqueous solution by opening the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 on the basis of the urea aqueous solution injection flag set to the "ON" state. Injection of urea aqueous solution is carried out continuously during a period in which the urea aqueous solution injection flag is set to the "ON" state. Then, the process proceeds to step S28. In step S28, the current count value C is calculated by adding "1" to the count value C of the counter 80c. In this way, when the injection amount of urea aqueous solution based on the second exhaust gas temperature TH2 exceeds "0", urea aqueous solution is injected from the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 in order to cool the addition valve 230.<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --></p><p id="p0072" num="0072">When the process shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 4B</figref> is executed after the urea aqueous solution injection flag is set to the "ON" state in step S27 as described above, affirmative determination is made in the upstream step S22 (YES in step S22).

The control device 80 stops injection of urea aqueous solution on the basis of the urea aqueous solution injection flag set to the "OFF" state. That is, when it is determined that the count value C of the counter 80c is larger than or equal to the counter determination value β, it is estimated that urea aqueous solution in the injection amount set on the basis of the temperature of exhaust gas in the exhaust passage 26 during an automatic stop has been injected, so injection of urea aqueous solution is ended. Even when the second exhaust gas temperature TH2 is higher than the predetermined temperature TS but is not so high, a small injection amount of urea aqueous solution may still be able to cool the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 to such an extent that it is possible to suppress heat damage to the addition valve 230. In such a case, the counter determination value β is set to "1" in the upstream step S25. Therefore, in the process initially executed after an automatic stop, affirmative determination is made in step S29 (YES in step S29), and the process proceeds to step S30.

The recovery of urea aqueous solution is carried out continuously during a period in which the urea aqueous solution recovery flag is set to the "ON" state. When it is determined in the upstream step S26 that the injection amount does not exceed "0" (NO in step S26), the process proceeds from step S26 to step S32 by skipping the above-described processes in step S27 to step S31. In step S32, the urea aqueous solution recovery flag is set to the "ON" state. That is, when the injection amount does not exceed "0", the injection amount "0" is set to "0" because it is not required to cool the urea aqueous solution addition valve 230 by injecting urea aqueous solution.

The recovery amount is smaller than that at the time of a manual stop of the internal combustion engine 1 as a result of off operation of the ignition switch 25. Therefore, a larger amount of urea aqueous solution remains in the urea aqueous solution supply tube 240 as compared to that at the time of a manual stop.
