As a result, boiling food and bubbles in the pot body may overflow through the gap between the rattling pot lid and the opening of the pot body, thereby dirtying the pot body and the surroundings.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">One of the main reasons that the lid rattles and food in the pot body overflows is an increase in the steam pressure in the pot body.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">To address the problems associated with an increase in steam pressure,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> one or more holes that let steam out of the pot body may be provided at the lid.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">More specifically, an appropriate number of holes having an appropriate size may be provided at the lid such that steam generated inside the pot body can be properly released so as to prevent rattling and spillage during cooking.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, the appropriate number and size of such holes may vary depending on the type and amount of food to be cooked in the pot body. Accordingly, it is almost impossible to provide holes that are appropriate for every pot lid in terms of size and quantity.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Most of the related-art pot lids are equipped with a hole enlarging element capable of adjusting the size of holes by being lifted or lowered in accordance with the steam pressure inside a pot body, as shown in Korean Utility Model No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="KR4211341"><text>4211341</text></patcit>, Korean Utility Model No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="KR419066"><text>419066</text></patcit> and Korean Patent No.<patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="KR6981196"><text> 6981196</text></patcit>, entitled "A Cooker Lid with Prevent Overflowing of Foods", "The Overflow Preventing Lid for Cook Pot" and "The Pot Lid for Preventing Overflow", respectively.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However, such hole enlarging element generally has a complicated structure, thereby increasing the manufacturing cost of a pot lid while appear less cost-effective.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Also, there is a limit in enlarging the size of holes of a pot lid with the use of a hole enlarging element. Also, once steam is quickly released from a pot by enlarging the size of holes with the aid of a hole enlarging element, the pressure inside the pot body may no longer be maintained to be high and may thus become inappropriate for recipes requiring high-pressure cooking. In addition, water may too often need to be added into the pot due to excessive water evaporation during cooking.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0003">Technical Problems</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">To address the aforementioned problems associated with the related art, the present invention aims at providing an anti-overflow pot lid which is capable of minimizing an increase in the manufacturing cost thereof by simplifying the structure of an element thereof for preventing a pot lid rattling and spillage or leakage and is also capable of preventing excessive steam release and excessive water evaporation during cooking and enabling food to be cooked under high pressure by allowing steam generated in the pot to condense to water and releasing the water into the pot body, without the need to change the number and size of existing outlet holes thereof.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present invention also aims at providing an improved, anti-overflow pot lid which has a recessed portion configured to be removable from a lid body and can thus be easily cleaned and hygienically maintained.</p><heading id="h0004">Technical Solutions</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to an aspect, an anti-overflow pot lid includes: a lid body configured to be curved to protrude, and to cover an opening of a pot body; a recessed portion configured to be recessed downward from the lid body; one or more inlet holes configured to be formed at an upper part of the recessed portion and let in steam generated in the pot body; and one or more outlet holes configured to be formed at a lower part of the recessed portion and let out water drops obtained by liquefying the steam into the pot body.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The recessed portion may be formed by forming a steam vent hole at the center of the lid body, a further-recessed portion may be formed below the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> recessed portion to collect water condensed from steam therein, and the outlet holes may be formed at the further-recessed portion.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The recessed portion may be formed in the shape of a jar with a larger diameter in the middle than at the top or the bottom thereof.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to another aspect, an anti-overflow pot lid includes: a lid body configured to be curved to protrude, and to cover an opening of a pot body; a first protrusion configured to protrude from the top of the lid body 10 and have a steam vent hole formed at the top thereof; a second protrusion configured to be formed in an L shape and protrude from the lid body within the vicinity of the first protrusion; an inlet hole configured to be formed at an upper part of the second protrusion and guide steam generated in the pot body into the first protrusion; and an outlet hole configured to be formed through the lid body and release water condensed from the steam into the pot body.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to another aspect, an anti-overflow pot lid includes: a lid body configured to be curved to protrude, and to cover an opening of a pot body; a protrusion configured to protrude from the top of the center of the lid body, form a ring-shaped space therein and include a central space surrounded by the ring-shaped space and a steam vent hole formed at the top of the central space; a plurality of inlet holes configured to be formed on an inner sidewall of the protrusion that forms the ring-shaped space, and guide steam generated in the pot body into the central space; and an outlet hole configured to be formed through the lid body at the bottom of the central space and release water in the central space into the pot body.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to another aspect, an anti-overflow pot lid includes: a lid body configured to be curved to protrude, and to cover an opening of a pot body;<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> a steam vent hole configured to be formed through the center of the lid body; a stopping board configured to have an outer rim that engages with an extended rim of the pot body so as to be able to be held and supported by the pot body; an inlet hole configured to be formed to vertically penetrate the stopping board and guide steam generated in the pot body into the space above the stopping board; and an outlet hole configured to be formed to vertically penetrate the stopping board and release water condensed from the steam into the pot body.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to another aspect, an anti-overflow pot lid includes: a lid body configured to be curved to protrude, and to cover an opening of a pot body;<br/>

During cooking, the lid body 10 maintains both the temperature and the pressure inside the pot body P to be high, and prevents excessive steam release.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The lid body 10 may be formed of a transparent material such as tempered glass so as for a user to easily identify the progress of cooking from inside the pot body P.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The lid body 10 is formed to be curved and protrude. The lid body 10 except for the rim thereof is located higher than the pot body P when coupled to the pot body P. Accordingly, the inner surface of the lid body 10 can be prevented from collisions with boiling food (such as water or food materials mixed in water) from the pot body P.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The lid body 10 may guide steam and bubbles generated in the pot body P during cooking toward the center of the inside of the lid body 10 so that the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> pressure applied to the rim of the anti-overflow pot lid L by the steam and bubbles can decrease while preventing the steam and bubbles from leaking through the gap between the lid body 10 and the pot body P.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The recessed portion 20 is recessed downward form the center of the lid body 10 and forms an empty space therein. The inlet holes 30 and the outlet holes 40 are formed at upper and lower parts, respectively, of the recessed portion 20. The inlet holes 30 and the outlet holes 40 receive and temporarily store therein steam generated in the pot body P, and let out water obtained by condensing the steam into the pot body P.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Since the recessed portion 20 is formed at the center of the lid body 10, steam or bubbles generated during cooking can be easily guided into the recessed portion 20 along a curved inner surface of the lid body 10 or through the inlet holes 30.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The steam or bubbles guided into the recessed portion 20 are released into the pot body P. As a result, the pressure applied to the rim of the lid body 10, which is coupled to the pot body P, decreases. Accordingly, the rattling of the anti-overflow pot lid L can be prevented.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">When the pressure applied to the rim of the anti-overflow pot lid L is not uniformly maintained, the rim of the anti-overflow pot lid L may be lifted in areas where the pressure from the inside of the pot body P is relatively low. In this case, the anti-overflow pot lid L may rattle. However, since the recessed portion 20 is formed at the center of the lid body 10 such that steam condensed therein can be released into the middle of the pot body P, certain parts of the rim of the lid body 10 can be prevented from being affected more than other parts of the rim of the lid body 10 by the steam from the pot body P, and thus, the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> pressure applied to the rim of the lid body 10 can be uniformly maintained.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The bottom of the recessed portion 20 is located above an imaginary line connecting either side of the rim of the lid body 10. For example, when the lid body 10 is coupled to the pot body P, the bottom of the recessed portion 20 may be located outside the pot body P.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The recessed portion 20, which is a space for receiving and temporarily storing therein steam generated in the pot body P, may be formed in various shapes. For example, the recessed portion 20 may be formed in the shape of a jar with a larger diameter in the middle than at the top or the bottom thereof.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">According to this embodiment, steam introduced from the pot body P into the recessed portion 20 contacts external air and thus condenses into water, instead of being released to the outside, and the water with a lower temperature than the steam in the pot body P is released back into the pot body P, thereby preventing the rattling of the anti-overflow pot lid L or overflow of food from the pot body P. To minimize the release and removal of steam from the pot body P, the recessed portion 20 may be formed in such a shape to discharge steam introduced thereinto downwardly.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">For this reason, the recessed portion 20 may be formed in the shape of a jar, and the inlet holes 30 may be formed at an upper part of the recessed portion 20 to face downward.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Not only steam but also bubbles may be introduced into the recessed portion 20 through the inlet holes 30. Some bubbles may readily pop and turn into water, but some bubbles may remain unpopped for a long time even after introduced into the recessed portion 20, depending on their characteristics (such as viscosity).<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0043" num="0043">If more and more bubbles remain unpopped, rather than turning into water, after introduced in the recessed portion 20, the recessed portion 20 may be flooded with the bubbles.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">To address this problem, the recessed portion 20 may be formed in the shape of a jar with a larger diameter in the middle than at the top and the bottom thereof such that as large a space as possible can be secured in the recessed portion 20, and that the flooding of the recessed portion 20 with bubbles can be delayed.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The further-recessed portion 21 is formed at the bottom of the recessed portion 20 to face downward. The outlet holes 40 are formed at the further-recessed portion 21.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Water condensed in the recessed portion 20 is gathered in the further-recessed portion 21, and the gathered water can be released into the pot body P through the outlet holes 40 at the same time.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Without the further-recessed portion 21 at the bottom of the recessed portion 20, the outlet holes 40 are likely to be blocked by bubbles from the pot body P, and as a result, water condensed in the recessed portion 20 may not be able to be properly released into the pot body P through the outlet holes 40. However, if the further-recessed portion 21 is provided at the bottom of the recessed portion 20, the outlet holes 40 can be prevented from being blocked by bubbles from the pot body P, and condensed steam in the recessed portion 20 can be smoothly released into the pot body P through the outlet holes 40.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The inlet holes 30 and the outlet holes 40 are formed at upper and lower parts, respectively, of the recessed portion 20. The inlet holes 30 and the outlet holes 40 receive steam from the pot body P, and release condensed water into the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> pot body P.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Steam introduced into the recessed portion 20 through the inlet holes 30 condenses into water, and at the same time, the temperature of the steam decreases. The temperature of the condensed steam is about 1 to 2 degrees lower than the steam in the pot body P.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In response to the condensed steam with a relatively low temperature being released into the pot body P, bubbles in the pot body pop and thus disappear, and the temperature of the steam at the top of the pot body P decreases so that the steam pressure in the pot body P decreases. Accordingly, the rattling of the anti-overflow pot lid L or spillage of food through the gap between the anti-overflow pot lid L and the pot body P can be prevented.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The outlet holes 40 may be formed at the bottom of the recessed portion 20 so as to smoothly release water from the recessed portion 20. However, there is a risk of the outlet holes 40 being clogged by boiling food from the pot body P.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">To address this problem, the outlet holes 40 may be formed at a location that cannot be easily reached by boiling food from the pot body P. For example, the outlet holes 40 may be formed on a lateral surface of the further-recessed portion 21.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The engaging portion 11 is formed along the rim of the lid body 10. The engaging portion 11 has a lower part that is to be inserted into the pot body P and an upper part that is to engage with the rim of the opening of the pot body P. The silicon packing 50 is coupled to the engaging portion 11, and can be placed in firm contact with the inner surface of the pot body P.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The engaging portion 11 is formed in the form of a frame that surrounds<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> the rim of the lid body 10. A groove 12 in which to receive the silicon packing 50 is formed on a portion of the engaging portion 11 to be inserted into the pot body P.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">An expansion space 51 is formed inside the silicon packing 50.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The expansion space 51 is filled with a gas with a high volumetric thermal expansion ratio. For example, the expansion space 51 may be filled with air.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The outer diameter of the silicon packing 50, which is coupled to the engaging portion 11, is less than the inner diameter of the pot body P. Accordingly, the anti-overflow pot lid L can be easily coupled to the pot body P without any hindrance from the silicon packing 50.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">During cooking, in response to the silicon packing 50 being heated due to an increase in the temperature inside the pot body P, the expansion space 51 expands such that the outer diameter of the silicon packing 50 may become greater than the inner diameter of the pot body P. Accordingly, the silicon packing 50 can be firmly attached onto the inner surface of the pot body P with no gap therebetween, and thus, the rattling of the anti-overflow pot lid L can be prevented.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">If the air pressure inside the pot body P is increased with the use of the engaging portion 11, bubbles in the pot body P can be easily popped and removed.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">That is, boiling water in the pot body P means that the air pressure in the pot body P is equal to the external air pressure.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In general, the air pressure on the ground surface is about 1 atm, and water boils at a temperature of 100°C. However, in the mountains where the<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> air pressure is lower than on the ground surface, water boils at a temperature of below 100°C.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In response to the water beginning to boil in the pot body P due to an increase in the temperature in the pot body P, bubbles are generated. Since the bubbles dissolve into the contents of the pot body P and thus have viscosity, they stay longer than the water in the pot body P.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">In the case of an ordinary pot, there is not much difference in pressure between the inside and the outside of the pot, and thus, bubbles from the pot do not easily pop even when overflowing out of the pot.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">On the other hand, when the anti-overflow pot lid L is firmly coupled to the pot body P through the engaging portion 11, the pressure in the pot body P can be increased to above 1 atm in accordance with an increase in the steam pressure inside the pot body P, and the boiling temperature of water in the pot body P can become higher than 100°C. For example, the pressure and the boiling temperature of water in a pressure cooker may become higher than 1.2 atm and 120°C, respectively.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">That is, water in the pot body P may boil at a temperature higher than 100 °C, and bubbles may be generated at a pressure of at least 1 atm. Most of the bubbles may pop and may all turn into steam due to a difference in pressure between the inside and outside of the anti-overflow pot lid L near the inlet holes 30 and the outlet holes 40.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Accordingly, since the pressure inside the pot body can be increased due to the presence of the engaging portion 11, bubbles generated in the pot body P can be easily removed.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The anti-overflow pot lid L may have a modified structure, as illustrated<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">That is, referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>, a recessed portion 20 may be formed by forming a partition 16 which divides the space in a lid body 10.
