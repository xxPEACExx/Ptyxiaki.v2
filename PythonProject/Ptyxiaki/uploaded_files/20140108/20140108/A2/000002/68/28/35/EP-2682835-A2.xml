More particular, the technical field relates to systems and techniques where readily available operating variables are employed for monitoring heat exchanger fouling.</p><heading id="h0003">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">Aircrafts are often operated in contaminant-prone environments, including in desert areas. The contaminant-prone environments, coupled with levels of maintenance that are practiced by particular airlines, often lead to accumulation and build-up of contamination on the narrowest passages of environmental control systems (ECSs), namely and often heat exchangers in the ECSs. Accumulated contamination may lead to reduction of performance over time, and in some cases may lead to failures that cause aircraft-on-ground (AOG), customer dissatisfaction, and elevated repair costs. Airframers and airlines in general prefer to avoid fixed maintenance cleaning intervals, instead preferring on-condition maintenance due to the high cost of removing and cleaning the ECSs at fixed intervals. In addition, on-wing cleaning is not often very practical.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Accumulation of contamination, also referred to as fouling, in heat exchangers of the ECSs has been investigated in the past. In particular, past investigations have focused upon causes of fouling and methods to avoid or mitigate such fouling. Other efforts have focused on detecting fouling in the heat exchangers of the ECSs, with appropriate steps taken to clean or provide notification of excessive fouling after detection. Conventional methods for detecting fouling in the heat exchangers of the ECSs include:<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> -->
<ol><li>1. Examination of the heat transfer coefficient or heat conductance,</li><li>2. Simultaneous observations of pressure drops and mass flow rates,</li><li>3. Conducting temperature measurements,</li><li>4. Ultrasonic or electrical measurements,</li><li>5. Weighing of heat exchanger plates, and</li><li>6. Modeling the heat exchanger and comparing the prediction with filed data.</li></ol></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The conventional methods for detecting fouling all are prone to drawbacks. For example, to be sufficiently accurate, the conventional methods 1-3 require that the heat exchangers present successive steady states, i.e., the inlet temperatures and flows must be stable for a period long enough to be able to compute or measure the values of interest. Conventional method 4 is a local method limited to portions of the heat exchangers and cannot be generally applied to the heat exchangers as a whole. Conventional method 5 requires that the process be stopped, with the heat exchangers being disassembled for measurement. Such requirements are too restrictive or costly. Conventional method 6 is reliant upon the quality and fidelity of the mathematical modeling itself. For example, a Diagnostics, Prognostics and Health Management (DPHM) solution is known for aircraft ECS heat exchangers to detect on-line fouling by use of a dynamic non-linear mathematical model. The model parameters are a function of mass flow rates and core and fin temperatures. Measurements of the inlet and outlet temperatures and the mass flow rates are used for model parameter estimation with Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF). However, not all values that are employed in conventional mathematical modeling are available via measurements within conventional heat exchangers, and often require invasive sensing equipment. For example, mass flow rates and heat capacities are difficult to measure and require the invasive sensing equipment.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Accordingly, it is desirable develop new techniques for contamination monitoring of heat exchangers that could alert a maintenance crew in advance to prepare for a timely removal or cleaning of the heat exchangers and thereby minimize disruption when contamination levels exceed acceptable thresholds.

The ECS 10 includes an air conditioning machine (ACM) 16 that is adapted to transfer of heat from a bleed flow 18 that is provided by an engine 20 of the aircraft to a ram flow 22 that is provided from outside ambient air for purposes of circulating air to a cabin 24 of the aircraft. The ACM 16 may include one or more heat exchangers 12, 14 and, in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, includes two heat exchangers 12, 14.

More specifically, the correlation is programmed into the maintenance system 26, with the processor 28 of the maintenance system adapted to receive data regarding the operating variable(s) at issue and further adapted to execute the correlation. The data may be gathered via an embedded sensor or sensors 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, such as existing sensors in ECSs or new embedded sensors that are incorporated into the ECSs for purposes of gathering the desired data. The sensors as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> include a pressure sensor 32, an inlet temperature sensor 34 and an outlet<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> temperature sensor 36 for the bleed flow 18 into and out of the first heat exchanger 12, and an inlet temperature sensor 38 and an outlet temperature sensor 40 for the bleed flow 18 into and out of the second heat exchanger 14. It is to be appreciated that positioning and configuration of the sensors 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is only representative, and additional sensors may be present that are not shown. In an embodiment, the data from the embedded sensors 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 is gathered via the controller 30 and provided to the maintenance system 26 for analysis and decision. In an embodiment, the correlation that is programmed into the maintenance system relies only upon data that is provided from existing pressure sensors and/or temperature sensors that are included in the ECS. In various embodiments, the operating variable upon which the correlation relies is chosen from inlet temperatures of input streams into the heat exchanger and outlet temperatures of output streams out of the heat exchanger, heat exchanger pressure drop, overall heat transfer coefficient value, speed of rotation of an air conditioning machine that includes the heat exchanger, and combinations thereof. Such operating variables are generally available with embedded sensors of existing ECSs.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In an embodiment, mathematical models may be employed within the correlations that are programmed into the maintenance system, although in other embodiments it is to be appreciated that a direct correlation of heat exchanger fouling to the operating variable may be established without reliance on mathematical models. In an embodiment, a mathematical model that uses heat exchanger effectiveness is provided to relate heat exchanger fouling to heat exchanger effectiveness. In order to define the effectiveness of a heat exchanger, a maximum possible heat transfer that can be hypothetically achieved in a counter-flow heat exchanger of infinite length is first determined. To explain, one fluid will experience the maximum possible temperature difference, which is the temperature difference between the inlet temperature (T<sub>h,i</sub>) of a hot stream (e.g., the bleed stream 18) and the inlet temperature (T<sub>c,i</sub>) of a cold stream (e.g., the ram flow 22). Determination of effectiveness proceeds by calculating the heat capacity rates (i.e. mass flow rate multiplied by specific heat) for hot fluids (C<sub>h</sub>) in the hot stream and cold fluids (C<sub>c</sub>) in the cold stream, respectively, and denoting the smaller one (min(C<sub>c</sub>,C<sub>h</sub>)) as C<sub>min</sub>. The reason for selecting the smaller heat capacity rate is to include the maximum feasible heat transfer among the working fluids, determined by the slowest heat transferring fluid. A quantity:<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> <maths id="math0001" num="(1)"><math display="block"><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>max</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>C</mi><mi>min</mi></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mfenced separators=""><msub><mi>T</mi><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>T</mi><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></mfenced></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="73" he="12" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
is then found, where q<sub>max</sub> is the maximum heat that could be transferred between the fluids.

The mathematical model derived in equation (5) for heat exchanger effectiveness relies upon temperatures alone, which are generally easier to measure than other quantities in equations (1), (2), and (3).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In accordance with the techniques described herein, a determination is made as to whether the measured operating variable corresponds to excessive heat exchanger fouling. Excessive heat exchanger fouling, as referred to herein, represents a degree of fouling that is pre-determined to require action in response to the heat exchanger fouling (e.g., replacement, cleaning, inspection or other attention that could be initiated by the fouling indicator 42). The determination may be made in accordance with the correlation that is programmed into the maintenance system 26, using the processor. For example, in an<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> embodiment where the mathematical model that uses heat exchanger effectiveness is provided to relate heat exchanger fouling to heat exchanger effectiveness, <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> shows the heat exchanger effectiveness computed from equation (5) for an original condition heat exchanger and a degraded (fouled) heat exchanger, with the plus signs 44 representing values for heat exchanger effectiveness for original condition heat exchangers and with dots 46 representing heat exchanger effectiveness for degraded heat exchangers. In particular, the original condition heat exchanger may represent a heat exchanger prior to use, while the degraded heat exchanger represents the same heat exchanger at the time that the measurements are taken. The difference in effectiveness under the two conditions provides a clear indication of fouling and may be employed to render a determination of whether the heat exchanger is excessively fouled. It is to be appreciated that <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is illustrative of effectiveness differences between original condition heat exchangers and corresponding degraded heat exchangers, and that specific differences between effectiveness for original condition heat exchangers and corresponding degraded heat exchangers that warrant service may be established based upon particular applications. Differences in effectiveness for the heat exchanger may be tracked over time to render a determination regarding excessive fouling. A cumulative sum (CUSUM) test can be performed to detect fouling in the heat exchanger over time. A CUSUM control chart is a type of time-weighted control chart that displays the CUSUMs of the deviations of each sample from the target value. Because it is cumulative, even minor drifting in the process mean will lead to steadily increasing cumulative deviation values. The CUMSUM control chart is useful in detecting difference in effectiveness values that are slowly deviating from target values due to contamination. If a trend develops, it may be taken as evidence that the contamination has built-up. As an example, w threshold level of 15-20% of the clean effectiveness value can be specified and a warning can be sent to the maintenance crew that the heat exchanger needs attention. Alternatively, a determination on excessive fouling may be made based on a single measurement of difference in effectiveness. For example, in an embodiment, a calculated difference in effectiveness of at least about 0.1, such as from about 0.1 to about 0.5, or such as from about 0.2 to about 0.3, may represent a determination that the degraded heat exchanger should be serviced.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In another embodiment, when the inlet temperatures of the hot stream and the cold stream into the heat exchanger and the outlet temperatures of the hot stream and cold stream out of the heat exchanger for both a hot side and a cold side are known, those<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> temperature values are gathered and a mathematical model that uses Log Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD) is provided to relate heat exchanger fouling to the LMTD.

The LMTD computed from equation (6) is plotted in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> for the same data for which effectiveness was plotted in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, with plus signs 48 representing LMTD for original condition heat exchangers and with circles 50 representing LMTD for degraded heat exchangers. The rise in LMTD can be used as an indicator of the heat exchanger fouling. In particular, the original condition heat exchanger may represent a heat exchanger prior to use, while the degraded heat exchanger represents the same heat exchanger at the time that the measurements are taken. The difference in LMTD under the two conditions provides a clear indication of fouling and may be employed to render a determination of whether the heat exchanger is excessively fouled in the same manner as described above. It is to be appreciated that <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is illustrative of LMTD differences between original condition heat exchangers and corresponding degraded heat exchangers, and that specific differences between LMTD for original condition heat exchangers and corresponding degraded heat exchangers that warrant service may be established based upon particular applications. For example, in an embodiment, a calculated difference in LMTD of at least about 1, such as from about 1 to about 10, or such as from about 2 to about 5, may represent a determination that the degraded heat exchanger should be serviced.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In another embodiment of a technique, heat exchanger pressure drop is employed for determining fouling. In particular, a correlation of heat exchanger fouling to heat exchanger pressure drop is provided and programmed into the maintenance system. This technique is applicable when pressure sensor(s) are provided that are adapted to directly measure pressure drop within the heat exchanger, which may include directly measuring pressure drop within the ECS. External contamination on the core of the heat exchanger will be difficult to measure in an open system. However, for internal heat exchanger core and passages, this approach is feasible. To employ embodiments of this technique, it may<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> be necessary to modify existing ECSs to include additional pressure sensors (not shown), which add cost and weight.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In another embodiment of a technique, a mathematical model that uses heat exchanger heat exchanger number of transfer units (NTUs) is provided to relate heat exchanger fouling to the heat exchanger NTUs. In the technique of this embodiment, existing sensors in a typical ECU are used to determine real time overall heat transfer coefficient value (UA) of the heat exchanger. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, contamination/fouling is shown both inside 52 and outside 54 a generic duct passage 56 of a heat exchanger. The UA value is used to analyze heat transfer contamination fouling of heat exchangers. It includes the effect of hot and cold side convection, conduction, and fouling resistance (R<sub>f</sub>) of a heat exchanger, with fouling resistance (R<sub>f</sub>) represented by equation (7): <maths id="math0007" num="(7)"><math display="block"><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">R</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn><mo>/</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">U</mi><mi>actual</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn><mo>/</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">U</mi><mi>clean</mi></msub></math><img id="ib0007" file="imgb0007.tif" wi="58" he="12" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>

A is a heat exchanger total outer heat transfer area. UA value can be determined via the NTU formula of equation (9), using the heat capacity rate (C) of the bleed flow (which is also referred to above as the hot stream): <maths id="math0009" num="(9)"><math display="block"><mi>NTU</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>UA</mi><mo>/</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi><mi>bleed</mi></msub></math><img id="ib0009" file="imgb0009.tif" wi="54" he="11" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
Equation (9) is correct if the bleed flow into the heat exchanger is the minimum capacity rate fluid, which it generally is. However, in some cases like cruise, the ram flow (which is also referred to above as the cold stream) may be reduced so that the cold side capacity rate may be lower. If both the bleed mass flow rate and the ram mass flow rate can be estimated from onboard data (bleed mass flow rate should be available and ram mass flow rate may be estimated from ACM speed or ram door position and flight conditions, determined during flight testing), then equation (9) would use the definition of NTU= UA/C<sub>min</sub>, where C<sub>min</sub> = MIN (m<sub>c</sub>.c<sub>h</sub>, m<sub>h</sub>. c<sub>h</sub>).<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">For a Cross flow (single pass) heat exchanger such the one used typically in air conditioning systems (both fluids unmixed), equation (10) is a curve fit for the series solution for cross flow heat exchangers. Performance codes for cross flow heat exchangers use series solution rather than the curve fit so the accuracy is improved at higher NTU values. This series could also be used above NTU values greater than about 7 for improved accuracy.

In the procedure in accordance with the mathematical model of equation (10), it can be seen that the effectiveness of the heat exchanger (E) is a direct function of the NTU and, hence, the contamination fouling as reflected in the overall heat loss coefficient U.
