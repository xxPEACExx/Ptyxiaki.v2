Once in the mould, the molten metal solidifies against the water-cooled mould walls to form a solid shell. This shell containing the liquid metal, now called a strand, is withdrawn continuously from the bottom of the mould, The strand is supported by closely spaced, water-cooled roll lines which act to support the walls of the strand against the ferrostatic pressure of the still-solldifying liquid within the strand. To increase the rate of solidification, the strand is sprayed with large amounts of water. Finally, the strand is cut into predetermined lengths. The strand may then continue through additional roll lines and other mechanisms which flatten, roll or extrude the metal produce into its final shape.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The roll lines used in continuous casting plants are exposed to high thermal stresses, since the cast metal strands leave the mould at a temperature of over 900°C, in particular in the case of steel strands.

The billet guiding roller comprises a central rotary shaft and at least one cylindrical roller tube (a "roll mantle") which is supported on said shaft in a rotationally fixed manner. Coolant channels located at a constant distance from the outer surface of the cylindrical roller tube, pass through the roller tube. The coolant passages are distributed uniformly in the interior of the cylindrical roller tube at, or near its periphery, and are formed by through bores. Coolant from a coolant line, which is arranged in the central rotary shaft, is supplied to the coolant passages at one end of the cylindrical roller tube, and returned from the coolant passages to the coolant line at the other end of the cylindrical roller tube via branch lines that extend radially through the cylindrical roller tube between the coolant passages and the coolant line.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">An object of the invention is to provide an improved internally cooled roll mantle for a roll line of a continuous casting apparatus comprising a rotatable shaft having a coolant line, whereby the roll mantle is arranged to be supported on the rotatable shaft in a rotationally fixed manner, and whereby the roll mantle comprises at least one coolant channel arranged to be in fluid communication with the coolant line.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">This object is achieved by a roll mantle that comprises a first end region, a second end region and a central region in between the first end region and the second end region, whereby the central region extends along at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80% or at least 90% of the length of the roll mantle, and whereby the at least one coolant channel comprises at least one coolant inlet and/or at least one coolant outlet located within the central region of the roll mantle, i.e. anywhere within the central region of the roll mantle and not at its ends or within its end regions.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Roll mantles are subjected to extreme wear due to the high loads, high temperatures, high temperature variations, high humidity, high corrosion and high contamination during use. By arranging at least one coolant inlet and/or at least one coolant outlet within the central region of the roll mantle and not within the end regions of the roll mantle, there will be no exposed sealing means at the end regions of the roll mantle which ends regions are subjected to the high loads, high temperatures, high temperature variations, high humidity, high corrosion and high contamination. The coolant inlet(s) and/or coolant outlet(s) and any necessary sealing means will instead be located at a less loaded and relatively cool part of the roll mantle and shaft. The lifetime of sealing means around the coolant inlet(s) and/or coolant outlet(s) will therefore be extended and the sealing means will not therefore have to be replaced as frequently</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It should be noted that the expression "a rotatable shaft having a coolant line" is not necessarily intended to mean a rotatable shaft having a single coolant line.

A channel, hole or cavity may for example be machined in the roll mantle and then at least one coolant channel may be formed by providing at least one partitioning means inside the machined channel, hole or cavity to form at least one coolant channel having at least one coolant inlet and at least one coolant outlet.

After undergoing any ladle treatments, such as alloying and degassing, and arriving at the correct temperature, molten metal 10 from the ladle 12 is transferred via a refractory shroud to a tundish 14. Metal is drained from the tundish 14 into the top of an open-base mould 16. The mould 16 is water-cooled to solidify the molten metal directly in contact with it. In the mould 16, a thin shell of metal next to the mould walls solidifies before the middle section, now called a strand, exits the base of the mould 16 into a cooling chamber 18; the bulk of metal within the walls of the strand is still molten. The strand is supported by closely spaced, water cooled roll lines 20 which act to support the walls of the strand against the ferrostatic pressure of the still-solidifying liquid within the strand. To increase the rate of solidification, the strand is sprayed with large amounts of water as it passes through the cooling chamber 18. Final solidification of the strand may take place after the strand has exited the cooling chamber 18.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the illustrated embodiment the strand exits the mould 16 vertically (or on a near vertical curved path) and as it travels through the cooling chamber 18, the roll lines 20 gradually curve the strand towards the horizontal. (In a vertical casting machine, the strand stays vertical as it passes through the cooling chamber 18).</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">After exiting the cooling chamber 18, the strand passes through straightening roll lines (if cast on other than a vertical machine) and withdrawal roll lines. Finally, the strand is cut into predetermined lengths by mechanical shears or by travelling oxyacetylene torches 22 and either taken to a stockpile or the next forming process. In many cases the strand may continue through additional roll lines and other mechanisms which might flatten, roll or extrude the metal into its final shape.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref> shows a roll line 20 according to an embodiment of the present invention, namely a common shaft roll line 20.

It should however be noted that the at least one roll mantle 28 of a roll line 20 according to the present invention need not necessarily be a cylinder or of a symmetric shape of uniform cross section, and its outer surface need not necessarily be continuous or smooth, but may be of any shape, size and design depending on their function and/or location in a continuous casting plant.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Further modifications of the invention within the scope of the claims would be apparent to a skilled person. For example, even though the present invention concerns a roll mantle comprising at least one coolant channel that is arranged to be in fluid communication with a coolant line in a rotatable shaft when in use, the so-called coolant channels in the roll mantle may be utilized for any purpose, i.e. they are not only suitable for transporting coolant through at least part of the roll mantle.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56983114" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Roll mantle (28) for a roll line (20) of a continuous casting apparatus comprising a rotatable shaft (24) having a coolant line (30), whereby the roll mantle (28) is arranged to be supported on said rotatable shaft (24) in a rotationally fixed manner, and whereby said roll mantle (28) comprises at least one coolant channel (32) arranged to be in fluid communication with said coolant line (30), <b>characterized in that</b> said roll mantle (28) comprises a first end region (ER1), a second end region (ER2) and a central region (CR) in between said first end region (ER1) and said second end region (ER2), whereby said central region (CR) extends along at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80% or at least 90% of the length (L) of said roll mantle (28), and whereby said at least one coolant channel (32) comprises at least one coolant inlet (36) and/or at least one coolant outlet (42) located within said central region (CR) of the roll mantle (28).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0002" num="0002"><claim-text>Roll mantle (28) according to claim 1, <b>characterized in that</b> it comprises an outer surface (34) and each said at least one coolant channel (32) is arranged at a non-constant distance from the outer surface (34) of the roll mantle (28).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0003" num="0003"><claim-text>Roll mantle (28) according to claim 1 or 2, <b>characterized in that</b> said at least one coolant inlet (36) and/or said at least one coolant outlet (42) is/are arranged at the centre of said roll mantle (28).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0004" num="0004"><claim-text>Roll mantle (28) according to any of the preceding claims, <b>characterized in that</b> said roll mantle (28) has an inner surface (40) and said at least one coolant channel (32) is arranged to extend from the inner surface (40) of the roll mantle (28) towards the outer surface (34) of the roll mantle (28).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0005" num="0005"><claim-text>Roll mantle (28) according to any of the preceding claims, <b>characterized in that</b> said at least one coolant channel (32) is arranged to extend in a straight line towards the outer surface (34) of the roll mantle (28).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0006" num="0006"><claim-text>Roll line (20) for a continuous casting apparatus, <b>characterized in that</b> said roll line (20) comprises at least one roll mantle (28) according to any of the preceding claims.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0007" num="0007"><claim-text>Roll line (20) according to claim 6, <b>characterized in that</b> sealing means are provided between said rotatable shaft (24) and said at least one roll mantle (28).<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0008" num="0008"><claim-text>Continuous casting apparatus, <b>characterized in that</b> it comprises at least one roll mantle (28) according to any of claims 1-5 and/or at least one roll line (20) according to any of claims 6-7.</claim-text></claim></claims><drawings mxw-id="PDW16671413" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --><figure id="f0001" num="1,2"><img id="if0001" file="imgf0001.tif" wi="165" he="196" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --><figure id="f0002" num="3,4"><img id="if0002" file="imgf0002.tif" wi="165" he="218" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --><figure id="f0003" num="5,6"><img id="if0003" file="imgf0003.tif" wi="165" he="220" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --><figure id="f0004" num="7,8"><img id="if0004" file="imgf0004.tif" wi="165" he="205" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --><figure id="f0005" num="9"><img id="if0005" file="imgf0005.tif" wi="165" he="161" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><copyright>User acknowledges that Fairview Research LLC and its third party providers retain all right, title and interest in and to this xml under applicable copyright laws.
