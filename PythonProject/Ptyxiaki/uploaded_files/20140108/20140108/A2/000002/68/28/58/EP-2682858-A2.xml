The delivery of documents to a mobile device have been typically limited to downloading via e-mail or from network based document sources or data stores such as a website through hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) or file transfer protocol (FTP) mechanisms. As mobile devices provide a more acceptable reading and presentation experience and move towards replacing paper based documents, the need for carrying paper documents can be reduced particularly when operating between a desktop office based work environment and a portable or mobile work environment. The presentation of documents on varying mobile device formats provided by differences in screen size and display resolution can present a sub-optimal experience when the document provided has not been generated with constraints of the mobile device in mind. In addition, integration of mobile devices into the networked office environment has been limited by lack of integration with existing document delivery infrastructure. In addition the transfer of electronic documents to a mobile device has required knowledge of mobile device identifiers and passkeys to initiate a document transfer and do not provide permission based access which can be controlled by the mobile device user.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Therefore there is a need for an improved system and method of document delivery to a mobile device using mobile device based permissions.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>SUMMARY</u></b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">In accordance with an aspect there is provided a method of document delivery to a mobile device using mobile device based permissions the method comprising: sending a print permission request from a sending device to a server coupled to a communications network providing a user identifier; receiving confirmation of acceptance of the print permission request at the sending device from the server; and adding the user identifier to a printer driver on the sending device, the user identifier presented in a print dialog box on the sending device when an electronic document is to be formatted and transferred from the sending device to a mobile device associated with the user identifier.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In accordance with another aspect there is provided a system comprising: a mobile device for receiving electronic documents, the mobile device operable to associate a permission with a user identifier associated with the sending device; a server for locating the mobile device on a network; a sending device for sending documents to the mobile device, the documents transferred by a printer driver from within a document application on the sending device, the printer driver providing formatting of the document to be received by the mobile device, the client device operable for sending a print permission request to the server providing a user identifier associated with the mobile device and a user identifier of the sending device; and the server locating the mobile device associated with the user identifier of the mobile device and providing the print permission request to the mobile device, the mobile device associating a permission with the user identifier of the sending device and providing confirmation to the sending device of acceptance of the print permission request, the sending device adding a user identifier to the printer driver for subsequent sending of documents to the mobile device from the sending device.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In accordance with yet another aspect there is provided a non-transitory computer readable memory containing instructions for document delivery to a mobile device using mobile device based permissions, the instruction which when executed by a processor of a sending device performing: sending a print permission request from a sending device to a server coupled to a communications network providing a user identifier associated with the mobile device and a user identifier associated with the sending device; receiving confirmation of acceptance<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> of the print permission request at the sending device from the server; and adding the user identifier of the mobile device to a printer driver on the sending device, the user identifier of the mobile device presented in a print dialog box on the sending device when an electronic document is to be formatted and transferred by the printer driver from the sending device to a mobile device.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In accordance with still yet another aspect there is provided a method of electronic document transfer permission management, the method comprising: receiving at a sending device an invitation to associate a print permission to a user identifier associated with a mobile device; providing confirmation of acceptance of the invitation from the sending device to a server coupled to a network; and assigning a user identifier provided in the invitation in a printer driver at the sending device, the user identifier presented in a print dialog box on the sending device when an electronic document is to be formatted and transferred from the sending device to a mobile device associated with the user identifier.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further features and advantages of the present disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in combination with the appended drawings, in which:

It will be appreciated that for simplicity and clarity of illustration, where considered appropriate, reference numerals may be repeated among the figures to indicate corresponding or analogous elements. In addition, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments described herein. However, it will be understood by those of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> ordinary skill in the art that the embodiments described herein may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the embodiments described herein. Also, the description is not to be considered as limiting the scope of the embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Mobile devices enable a user to access data and documents in a convenient portable format. The disclosed system and method enables documents to be transferred/moved onto a mobile device for review or reference by, for example, making the transfer simple and straight forward so that it may be easy for non-technically literate users (e.g. administrative assistant putting documents on their executive's mobile device). From a sender's perspective the transfer mechanism can work whether the mobile device is on a local network (relative to the sender) or on a remote network when the sender does not know the actual location of the mobile device. The user of the mobile device can assign permissions to the sender regarding how and when documents can be transferred to the mobile device. In addition the user of the mobile device can invite a sender to enable document printing and a sender device can request the permission to send documents via the printer driver to the mobile device.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows a representation of a system for document printing to a mobile device. To transfer documents from a sending device 104, the mobile device 102/152 is presented using a printer metaphor accessible within an operating system and applications of the sending device 104, such as document creation applications such as word processing, presentation, spreadsheet, photo editing, drawing, or communication applications such as e-mail. The mobile device 102/152 is represented as a printer on a sender device 104 and the user 'prints' electronic documents 101 to the mobile device 102/152. The mobile device 102 may be connected to a wireless interface 111 to a local area network (LAN) 110 or may be connected to a remote LAN having wireless capability or wide area network (WAN) 150 such as a wireless service provider network through a wireless interface 151. The sender device 104 may be a personal computer or computing device that supports printer functionality comprising at least a processor 105 and memory 106<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> for executing instructions to provide applications that enable a user to direct documents to a printer. The memory 106 can store an operating system 107 and applications 108 which can access a mobile device printer driver 109 that can be installed on the sender device 104 and configured to 'point' to one or more mobile devices 102/152 or associated user accounts. The mobile device printer driver 109 on the sender device 104 is configured with identification information associated with one or more mobile devices 102/152 or user identifiers and may also include security or credential information. Similar to using a network printer 112, the user is not exposed to the details of connecting to the printer once it is configured. Documents can therefore be transferred from the sender device 104 using the mobile device printer driver 109, enabling document transfer to be conveniently transferred using the known printer driver metaphor.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">By using the printer metaphor to transfer documents, the sender may be able to control both the content and the presentation of the electronic document 101 transferred to the mobile device 102/152 as compared to a file transfer mechanism (e.g. FTP) that would only allow the sender to control the content (i.e. picking the file to be transferred). The use of a mobile device printer driver 109 on the sender device 104 may allow the sender to influence presentation aspects such as, for example, page format, margins, orientation, page range, and other similar presentation aspects based upon constraints of the mobile device 102/152. The electronic document 101 may be transferred to the mobile device 102/152 in one of one or more pre-established file formats (e.g. PDF or PS). The sender does not need to be concerned with the presence of an application that supports a particular file format (e.g..DOC, .XLS, .PPT, .PS, .PDF) on the mobile device 102/152.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Each mobile device 102/152 that is configured to receive electronic documents 101 via the printer driver 109 mechanism may expose one or more share directories in its file system that may each be a target for electronic document 101 delivery. Various forms of privileges, permissions and access control can be enabled to provide security for the share directory. Each mobile device 102/152 may be able to support multiple share directories each potentially having different privilege and access control setting (e.g. a corporate share directory and a personal<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> share directory on the same mobile device 102/152) that can be associated with credentials or privileges associated with the sender device 104 or a user of the sender device 104. In some implementations, the mobile device 102/152 may also receive print permission requests from a user of the sending device 104 to enable transfer of electronic documents 101. The requests may be provided, for example, through the printer driver 109 or initiated through alternate communication applications such as an instant/voice/video messaging, e-mail message, text messaging, social networking or a dedicated messaging protocol on the sender device 104. The print permission request may be accepted or denied by a user of the mobile device 102/152 and may also define additional permission for, for example, the number of transfers that may be permissible. In addition, in some implementations, the mobile device 102/152 may initiate an invitation to a sending device 104, for example, by providing identification of the mobile device 102/152 and identification of mobile device printer driver 109 required to facilitate printing of documents to the mobile device 102/152. In some implementations, the acceptance or invitation may include parameters associated with aspects of the mobile device 102/152 which may be used by the mobile device printer driver 109 of the sending device 102/152 to format the electronic document when sending the electronic document to the mobile device 102/152. The printer driver 109 may be installed as part of the operating system of the sending device and provided as a resource to which documents can be sent to.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">From time-to-time in response to changes in the mobile device 102/152 network context, for example when connecting to a new network 150 by a wireless interface 151, the mobile device 102/152 may register with a server 132 by providing it's current network address, such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address. In some implementations, the mobile device 102/152 may also provide the names of its one or more share directories and device interface identifiers (IDs), such as a media access control (MAC) address associated with the network address. Alternatively, this information may be pre-configured or stored at the server 132. If the mobile device 102/152 has access through multiple interfaces, the registration may include identification of multiple network addresses and device interface IDs.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The server 132 may be located so that it is accessible by any mobile device 102/152 that has connectivity to the Internet 130 or any widely available wired or wireless connection medium. The server 132 may maintain mobile device configuration information such as, for example, user ID, network address ID, device interface ID, share directories, access privileges/permissions, dropbox locations associated with one or more mobile devices 102/152. The mobile device may be associated with a user account identifier such as, for example, a user name or e-mail address. In some implementations, an account or user identifier may be associated with multiple mobile devices enabling a document to be directed to one or more of the mobile devices. For example, one account may have multiple mobile devices such as, for example, a tablet device and a smartphone, associated with it, where a print request may send a document to both devices, or, for example, only to an active or accessible device. The server 132 may be a distributed service executed by one or more computers or servers having processors 133 and associated memory 134 for executing instructions. The server 132 may also process invitation requests from the sender device 104 to the mobile device 102/152 and vice versa.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">When the mobile device printer driver on the sender device 104 wants to transfer an electronic document 101 to the mobile device 102/152, the sender device 104 may send a print request to the server 132. The request may contain, for example, a device identifier or a user identifier. The user may select user ID or devices that have already been associated with the printer driver, or may initiate a request to allowing access to the mobile device 102/152, via the printer driver. In some implementations, in response to the print request, the server 132 may provide one or more network address identifiers and/or device interface identifiers of the target mobile device 102/152 and may also provide a share directory identifier if one is not already pre-selected. Alternatively, the server 132 may request connection information from the mobile device 102/152 which may in turn be provided to the sender device 104. A transfer mechanism incorporated in, or associated with, the mobile device printer driver may then use, for example, the mobile device IP address to establish a connection with the mobile device 102/152. In some implementations, the transfer mechanism may use a universal resource locator<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> (URL) identifier associated with the mobile device 102/152. The URL may define a hyperlink transfer protocol (HTTP), HTTP secure (HTTPS) or file transfer protocol (FTP) address which may allow a session to be initiated between the sender device 104 and the mobile device 102/152 using secure socket layer or transport layer security (SSL/TLS). In an HTTP or HTTPS transfer the sender device can utilize HTTP post to transfer the electronic document 101. Depending on the location of the mobile device 102/152 relative to the sender device 104, different connection delivery techniques may be required to transfer the electronic document 101. The sender device 104 can determine if a direct connection can be performed with the mobile device 102 and will initiate a connection to transfer the electronic document 101. If the mobile device 152 has an IP address on another network 150 then any intervening firewalls and/or Network Address Translators (NAT) 120 or 140 may interfere with connectivity and an alternate connection mechanism may be required to successfully deliver the electronic document 101. The mechanisms may include the use of protocols such as, for example, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)/Session Description Protocol (SDP), Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol through Network Address Translators (STUN), Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN), and Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) provided by the server 132 or one or more other servers. When connection to the mobile device 104/152 is not possible, a network dropbox 136 may be utilized to transfer documents to a location by utilizing, for example, network storage. The mobile device 152 may periodically check the network dropbox 136 for new electronic documents 101 or access the dropbox 136 based upon receipt of a kicker packet from the sender device 102 providing notification of the presence of an electronic document 101.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> shows an example message flow for granting permissions to a sender device 104. When the mobile device 102/152 changes network context, for example by registering on a new network, such as through a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) registration where the device 152 receives a new network address, a registration message (202) may be sent to the server 132 coupled to a network 130 accessible by the mobile device 102/152. Alternatively, the mobile device 152 may recognize that a networking device interface is activated, that may have a fixed or a previously assigned network address, to trigger sending<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> of the registration message. The registration message may comprise at least a device identifier and a network address and may also include a device interface identifier such as a MAC address, and/or include a target directory for receiving the electronic documents 101 on the mobile device 102/152. When the mobile device 102/152 has multiple network interfaces active, the registration may include identification of multiple network addresses and network interface identifiers.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">At the sending device 104, such as a personal computer, when the user selects to print an electronic document 101 to the mobile device 102/152, or the user ID associated with the mobile device 102/152, the mobile device print driver 109 may send a request (204), referred to herein as a print permission request, to the server 132. The print permission request may identify the mobile device 102/152 by a unique identifier or by the user ID and may be initiated via the print driver 109 or via another communication application such as instant/voice/video messaging, social networking, or e-mail application which would then associate the user ID with the printer driver 109.. The print permission request may be in the form, for example, of an instant/voice/video message, text message, e-mail message or HTTP post request. The print permission request may identify a user ID, for example an e-mail address or unique user name identifier. The server 132 may determine the mobile device 102/152 associated with the user ID and forward the print permission request to the mobile device 102/152 (206) this message from the location server 132 may be in a different format. For example, the server 132 may communicate the print permission request to the mobile device 102/152 using session initiation protocol (SIP). When the mobile device 102/152 accepts the print access request the permission may be granted to the sender device 104 (208).</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The server 132 may maintain the permission or acceptance state, and enable document relay facilities when the mobile device 102/152 is not directly accessible to receive the printed electronic document 101. The granting of the request may also include a URL or a secure URL to grant access to the mobile device 102/162 that can be used to transfer the electronic document 101. The sender device 104 can then initiate transfers (210) to the mobile device 102/152 using the received URL or may be required to initiate a print access request as<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> described in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>. Alternatively, the transfer of the information may utilize SIP to facilitate the electronic document transfer. The mobile device 102/152 may also provide security information such as a password, token or certificate to the sender device or the mobile device 102/152 may use the server 132 or other central server as a certificate authority to connect to the mobile device 102/152. The server 132 may forward the URL to the sender device 104. The sender device 104 may use this URL to push the file to the mobile device 102/152 with an HTTP post or an HTTPS post if security is required or other direct peer-to-peer transfer mechanism such as FTP. The electronic document 101 may be formatted to be compatible with the mobile device based upon desired parameters in the print driver, parameters provided in response the print access permission request, or by performing a database lookup to determine the appropriate formatting parameters for the target device. For example the size of the document, resolution, content, or the type of document container, such as .PDF, .PS, .DOC may be modified to match the resources of the mobile device 102/152 and then sent to the mobile device.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The transfer process is complete when the mobile device 102/152 indicates that the transfer is complete (212). If the transfer is unsuccessful the sender device 104 may request alternate connection mechanism from the server 132. In some implementations, the print permission request may also include the electronic document itself, or a reference to the electronic document 101 to be retrieved by the server 132 or mobile device 102/152, which may not be delivered to the device until the print permission request is accepted.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> shows an example message flow for initiating an invitation to a sender device from the mobile device. As with <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the mobile device 102/152 may register with server 132 to provide identification of the current network location (302). When the mobile device 102/152 changes network context, for example by registering on a new network, for example through a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) registration where the device 152 receives a new network address from the network, the registration message may be sent to the server 132 coupled to a network 130 that is accessible by the mobile device 102/152. The user of the device 102/152 can initiate an invitation request to a<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> sender device 104 using a user identifier such as, for example, an e-mail address, contact list, instant/voice/video messaging application, social networking application or other communication application that may be able to be associated with a user or device (304). The invitation request may be processed by a server 132 to determine the associated user or sender device 104, or it may be processed through traditional communications protocols, for example e-mail servers for deliver to the sender device 104 via a mail account or other messaging process. The sender device 104 can then process the request, which may occur locally on the sender device 104, for example within an instant/voice/video messaging client, or may direct the sender device 104 to an interface provided by server 132, or an associated server to process the request, such as, for example, a webpage provided by a web-server for acceptance or denial of the request. The sender device 104 may then download and install a printer driver (306) if not already installed to provide electronic document processing and transfer of the electronic document to the mobile device 102/152. Acceptance of the print request may then be provided (208) to the mobile device 102/152. The printer driver is then associated with the mobile device or user ID.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">At the sending device 104, such as a personal computer, when the user selects to print an electronic document 101 to the mobile device 102/152 may be prompted to select user or device if more than one is associated in the printer driver, the mobile device print driver 109 sends a print request (310) to the server 132. The print request may identify the mobile device 102/152, for example, by a unique identifier, such as a PIN identifier, or by a user account which in some implementations may be associated with more than one mobile device 102/152. The server 132 may perform a look-up to determine the current location of the mobile device 102/152 and provide location information (312) including, for example, a network address and a device interface identifier, associated with the mobile device 102/152, to the sender device 104. Location information may be provided for more than one device if multiple devices are associated with a user account identifier. The server 132 may also identify one or more directories on the mobile device 102/152. A directory may be determined based, for example, upon the sender device 104 credentials, a document type or selection made by the user upon<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> sending the print request. The device identifier used by the server 132 may be associated with one or more mobile devices 102/152, where server 132 may in turn provide location information 306 for more than one mobile device 102/152. Additionally or alternatively the print request may contain the document which is provided to server with the identifier, either in the request or transferred in a separate process.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The sending device 104 can then initiate a transfer to the mobile device 102/152 (314) by initiating a connection request to the mobile device 102/152. Once the connection is established, the electronic document 101, which may be formatted for the device via the printer driver, can be transferred to the mobile device 102/152 to the designated destination directory.

The user may interact with the display to assign a sender device printer permission such as accept the request, deny the request, accept once, or identify a transfer limit, defined by number of transfers or time period. When a print permission request is accepted for a user 410, the acceptance may be sent to the server 132 to register the request and provide confirmation to the user. In a peer-to-peer configuration, the acceptance may be sent directly to the sender device 104. Additional tabs or screens may be provided, for example, to identify previously accepted requests 404, or denied requests 408. In addition, the user of the mobile device 102/152 may be provided with the ability to initiate an invitation 420 to send to a user of a sender device 104.
