Servo System &gt;</heading><p id="p0024" num="0024">First, a configuration of a servo system according to this embodiment is described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a servo system SS of this embodiment includes a servomotor device SM, and a controller CT. The servomotor device SM includes an encoder 100 and a motor M.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The motor M is one example of a power generating source without the encoder 100. The motor M alone is herein referred to as a "servomotor." In this embodiment, a servomotor assembly including the encoder 100 is referred to as "the servomotor device SM." The servomotor device SM is one example of the motor device. The motor M includes an output shaft SH, and the output shaft SH rotates about a rotation axis AX to output a rotating force or torque. The output shaft SH projects from both ends of the motor M (in left-and-right directions in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>), and the generated force is mainly outputted to the left end.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Note that the motor M may be, but not particularly limited to, a motor that is controlled based on data, such as positional data, detected by the encoder 100. Moreover, the motor M is not limited to an electric motor using electricity as its power source, but may be a motor using any other power sources, including a hydraulic motor, a pneumatic motor, and a steam-operated motor. However, for the sake of convenience, a case where the motor M is an electric motor is described below.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the encoder 100 is coupled to the right end of the output shaft SH of the motor M. The encoder 100 detects a rotational position (i.e., a rotational angle) of the output shaft SH to detect a rotational position (i.e., a rotational angle) of the motor M, and outputs positional data indicating the rotational position of the motor M.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The encoder 100 may detect at least one of a speed (also referred to as a "rotational speed" or an "angular speed") and an acceleration (also referred to as a "rotational acceleration" or an "angular acceleration") of the motor M, in addition to or alternative to the rotational position of the motor M. In this case, the speed and the acceleration of the motor M can be detected, for example, by finding a first-order or second-order derivative of the rotational position with respect to time or counting predetermined detection signals (e.g., incremental signals) for a predetermined period of time. For the sake of convenience, it is assumed below that a physical amount detected by the encoder 100 is the rotational position (i.e., the positional data).</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The controller CT acquires the positional data outputted from the encoder 100, and then controls the rotation of the motor M based on the positional data. Therefore, in this<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> embodiment where the electric motor is used as the motor M, the controller CT controls current or voltage applied to the motor M based on the positional data, thereby controlling the rotation of the motor M. Alternatively, the controller CT may also acquire a higher-level control signal from a higher-level controller (not illustrated) and then control the motor M to reach the rotational position indicated by the higher-level control signal. Note that, if the motor M uses other power sources, such as hydraulic, pneumatic, and steam sources, the controller CT can control the rotation of motor M by controlling the supplies from these power sources.</p><heading id="h0008">&lt; 2. Encoder &gt;</heading><p id="p0030" num="0030">Next, the encoder 100 of this embodiment is described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">Figs. 2 to 7</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the encoder 100 of this embodiment is a so-called reflective encoder, and it includes a disc 110, a magnet MG, a magnetic detector 120, an optical module 130, and a positional data generating unit 140.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In this embodiment, for the sake of convenience of describing the structure of the encoder 100, directions are defined as follows. In <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, a direction in which the disc 110 faces the optical module 130, in other words, the positive direction of Z-axis, is defined as "up," and the opposite negative direction of the Z-axis is defined as "down." Note that a spatial relation of the components of the encoder 100 of this embodiment is not particularly limited to the up-and-down orientation as described herein (e.g., a horizontal orientation is also possible). Moreover, for the sake of convenience, the orientation in this embodiment complies with the directions defined here unless it is expressly indicated.</p><heading id="h0009">(2-1. Disc)</heading><p id="p0032" num="0032">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the disc 110 is formed in a circular disc shape, and arranged such that the center O of the disc substantially corresponds to a rotation axis AX. The disc 110 is coupled to the output shaft SH of the motor M, and rotated by the rotation of the motor M (i.e., the rotation of the output shaft SH). In this embodiment, the disc 110 is described as one example of a measurement target for measuring the rotation of the motor M; however, an end<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> face of the output shaft SH may be directly used as the measurement target, or other members coupled to the end face may also be used as the measurement target.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the disc 110 has the magnet MG and is formed with a slit array SA and a slit SL. Although the disc 110 rotates in response to the operation of the motor M as described above, on the other hand, the magnetic detector 120 and the optical module 130 are fixedly arranged opposing to a part of the disc 110. In other words, the magnet MG, the slit array SA, and the slit SL are arranged to be relatively movable with respect to the magnetic detector 120 and the optical module 130 in a rotating direction (circumferential direction) of the disc 110 by the operation of the motor M.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The magnetic detector 120 is arranged above an upper surface of the disc 110 so as to oppose to a part of the magnet MG, and constitutes a magnetic detection mechanism (described later) together with the magnet MG. The optical module 130 is arranged above the upper surface of the disc 110 so as to oppose to parts of the slit array SA and the slit SL, and constitutes an optical detection mechanism (described later) together with the slit array SA and the slit SL. The magnetic detection mechanism and the optical detection mechanism are described below in detail.</p><heading id="h0010">(2-2. Magnetic Detection Mechanism)</heading><p id="p0035" num="0035">The magnetic detection mechanism magnetically detects the rotation of the disc 110, and includes the magnet MG and the magnetic detector 120. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the magnet MG is formed in a ring shape centering on the disc center O. The magnet MG is provided on the upper surface of the disc 110, and rotates together with the disc 110. Note that the magnet MG needs not to be in such a ring shape, but may be, for example, in a disc shape. A direction of a magnetic flux on an upper surface of the magnet MG reverses for every predetermined rotational angle range (substantially 180°) of the disc 110. In addition, the magnet MG is arranged such that rotational positions where the magnetic flux reverses correspond to a home position of the disc 110 which is used in detecting an absolute position of the disc 110.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, the magnetic detector 120 is fixed in parallel to the disc 110<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> so as to oppose to the part of the magnet MG at the home position, and detects the direction of the magnetic flux on the upper surface of the magnet MG. The magnetic detector 120 is implemented on a substrate (not illustrated). The magnetic detector 120 and the optical module 130 may be implemented on the same substrate. As described above, since the direction of the magnetic flux on the upper surface of the magnet MG reverses every time the disc 110 turns by 180°, the magnetic detector 120 detects the direction of the magnetic flux which changes for one cycle as the disc 110 revolves once. This detection signal is outputted to the positional data generating unit 140 where it is used for a detection of a multiple turning amount indicating the number of rotations of the disc 110 from a predetermined reference position. The detection of such a multiple turning amount is particularly effective, for example, when detecting the rotational position of the output shaft at the time of reboot, even if the output shaft is rotated due to some kind of influences after a power shutdown and a backup power is then supplied after the power shutdown.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The magnetic detector 120 is not particularly limited as long as it has a configuration that can detect the direction of the magnetic flux.

Alternatively, the rotation of the disc 110 can also be detected using a magnetic field detecting element, such as a Hall element, to detect intensities of the magnetic field in two axial directions perpendicular to the rotation axis AX, and then calculate a direction of the magnetic field of the magnet MG based on the detection signals.</p><heading id="h0011">(2-3.

That is, when the motor M is at a certain rotational position x, a detection result of each one of the plurality of photoreceiving elements of the photoreceiving array shows either one of "light received" or "no light received," and a combination of the detection results (a bit pattern of ON and OFF based on the detections) uniquely defines an absolute value of that rotational position x (absolute position). Various algorithms can be used as a method of generating the absolute pattern as long as a generated pattern indicates the absolute position of the motor M one-dimensionally with bits corresponding to the number of the photoreceiving elements of the photoreceiving array.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the slit SL is an arc-shaped slit formed centering on the disc center O in the upper surface of the disc 110. Unlike the slit array SA described above where the plurality of reflective slits are arrayed in the circumferential direction, the slit SL is formed to be a single reflective slit which is continuous for the rotational angle range of substantially 180°. The single reflective slit has a groove shape. The angle range centers on the home position. That is, the slit SL is formed such that its both ends are located at symmetrical rotational positions, and each end is offset from the home position of the disc 110 (the rotational positions where the flux of the magnet MG reverses) by substantially 90°.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The disc 110 is made of glass in this embodiment, and the reflective slits of the slit array SA can be formed by applying a light reflecting material on the surface of the glass-made disc 110.

Alternatively, for example, the disc 110 may be made of a highly reflective metal, and a part of the disc 110 other than the reflective slits may be formed as a non-reflective part or a lowered reflectance part by sputtering the part of the disc 110 to roughen or applying a<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> low-reflective material to the part of the disc 110.

Needless to say, the point light source used herein does not necessarily be strictly a "point light" source, and as long as it is a light source where diffusion light can be emitted from a substantial point location in terms of design and operation principles, light may be emitted from a limited surface. By using such a point light source, the light source 131 can emit diffusion light to the parts of the slit array SA and the slit SL that pass through the opposing positions, regardless of influences thereon to some extent, such as a change in light intensity due to a positional deviation of the slit array SA and the slit SL from a light axis of the light source 131 and attenuation of the light due to a difference in optical path length. Thus, the light source 131 can emit light to these parts substantially uniformly.

As a result, since the substrate (not illustrated) onto which the magnetic detector 120 is implemented can be reduced in size, the encoder 100 can also be reduced in size, as well as the servomotor device SM.

In this manner, chattering (repetition of ON and OFF of the pulse) at the rising or falling edge of the A-phase pulse signal PH-A can be prevented. Therefore, it can be prevented that the light source 131 is frequently turned on (and off) to reduce the power consumption. Further, it can be prevented that the comparator 1411 is actuated by a slight voltage difference caused by, for example, noises, becoming unstable. Therefore, an effect of preventing a pulse split of the A-phase pulse signal PH-A generated by the A-phase generator 141 can also be attained.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Further, particularly in this embodiment, the detection of the multiple turning amount and the detection of the absolute position are performed using the irradiation light from the common light source 131.

Therefore, reductions in size and cost can be achieved compared to the case where, for example, the light source and the drive circuit are independently provided for respective detections.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">Further, particularly in this embodiment, the magnet MG is arranged such that the rotational positions where the direction of the magnetic flux reverses correspond to the home position used for the absolute position detection of the disc 110. In this manner, the rising or<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> falling edge of the A-phase pulse signal PH-A generated by the A-phase pulse generator 141 corresponds to the home position. Effects thus attained are described below using a comparative example.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">For example, the following configuration (the comparative example) can be considered as a configuration for detecting a multiple turning amount of the disc 110 based on an A-phase signal obtained by a magnetic detection and a B-phase signal obtained by an optical detection. That is, this configuration is such that an arc-shaped slit SL is formed in the disc 110 for a rotational angle range of substantially 180° so that its ends correspond to the home position, and a magnetic body is provided near the home position for a predetermined rotational angle range. A magnetic detector 120 and a photoreceiving element PD are arranged at the home position of the disc 110. In this case, the rising or falling edge of the B-phase pulse signal PH-B generated by the B-phase pulse generator 142 corresponds to the home position.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073"><figref idrefs="f0008">Figs. 8A and 8B</figref> show example waveforms of the A-phase pulse signal PH-A, the B-phase pulse signal PH-B, and the power source control pulse signal PWC under the backup power supply. <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8A</figref> shows the waveforms in the comparative example, and <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8B</figref> shows the waveforms of this embodiment. Note that <figref idrefs="f0008">Figs. 8A and 8B</figref> both show the waveforms in the case of the normal rotation. Under the normal rotation, when the magnetic detector 120 detects one of ends of the magnetic body, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8A</figref>, the A-phase pulse signal PH-A reaches its rising edge, the light source 131 emits light for the predetermined time period similar to this embodiment, and the level of the B-phase pulse signal PH-B is detected to be "High." Then, when the home position of the disc 110 passes through the position corresponding to the magnetic detector 120 and the photoreceiving element PD, the magnetic detector 120 detects the other end of the magnetic body. Then, the A-phase pulse signal PH-A reaches its falling edge, and the level of the B-phase pulse signal PH-B is detected to be "Low." Thus, the counter 143 adds the count of the multiple turning amount by one (1) when it detects that the level of the B-phase signal is changed from "High" to "Low," because it can be considered that the home position has passed the position corresponding to the magnetic detector 120 and the photoreceiving element PD by the normal rotation of the disc 110. Although the illustration is<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> omitted, a case under the reverse rotation is similar. That is, the counter 143 reduces the count of the multiple turning amount by one (1) when the counter 143 detects that the level of the B-phase signal is changed from "Low" to "High" when both the edges of the A-phase pulse signal PH-A are detected, because it can be considered that the home position has passed the position corresponding to the magnetic detector 120 and the photoreceiving element PD by the reverse rotation of the disc 110. Thus, in this comparative example, the light source 131 is required to emit light twice to detect the passing of the home position in both the cases of the normal rotation and the reverse rotation.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">On the other hand, in this embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8B</figref>, the rising or falling edge of the A-phase pulse signal PH-A corresponds to the home position. Therefore, when the counter 143 detects that the B-phase pulse signal PH-B is at the "High" level and the A-phase pulse signal PH-A is at the rising edge, it adds the count of the multiple turning amount by one (1) because it can be considered that the home position has passed the position corresponding to the magnetic detector 120 and the photoreceiving element PD by the normal rotation of the disc 110. Although the illustration is omitted, a case under the reverse rotation is similar. That is, the counter 143 reduces the count of the multiple turning amount by one (1) when it detects that the level of the B-phase signal PH-B is at the "High" level and the A-phase pulse signal PH-A is at the falling edge, because it can be considered that the home position has passed the position corresponding to the magnetic detector 120 and the photoreceiving element PD by the reverse rotation of the disc 110. Thus, in this embodiment, the detection of the home position passing the position corresponding to the magnetic detector 120 and the photoreceiving element PD is performed by a single time of illumination of light from the light source 131 in both the cases of the normal rotation and the reverse rotation.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">Therefore, in this embodiment, even in a case where the magnetic detector 120 and the photoreceiving element PD move back and forth near the home position of the disc (more than the rotational angle range of the comparative example with the magnetic body), for example, due to fluctuation of the disc 110, the number of illumination of the light source 131 can be reduced down to one half (1/2) of the comparative example. In this manner, the power consumption can<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> be significantly reduced and the life of the backup power source can be extended.</p><heading id="h0015">&lt; 4. Modifications &gt;</heading><p id="p0076" num="0076">One embodiment of the present invention is described above in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, the appended claims are not limited to the embodiment described herein. It is apparent that those skilled in the art can reach that various changes, modifications, and combinations can be made without departing from the scope of invention described in the claims. Therefore, it can be appreciated that techniques or the arts after any of the changes, modifications, and combinations is made also fall under the scope of the invention. Hereinafter, modifications of the above embodiment are described. Note that, in the following description, similar components to the above embodiment are denoted with the same reference numerals and the description thereof is suitably omitted.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">For example, the case where the so-called reflective encoder, in which the photoreceiving array PA and the photoreceiving element PD are arranged on the same side as the light source 131 with respect to the disc 110, is used is described above; however, it is not limited to this. Specifically, a so-called transmissive encoder may also be used, in which the photoreceiving array PA and the photoreceiving element PD are arranged on the opposite side to the light source 131 with respect to the disc 110. In this case, the slit array SA and the slit SL may be formed as transmissive holes in the rotary disc 110, or the part of the rotary disc 110 other than the slit array SA and the slit SL may be made in a roughen surface, for example, by sputtering, or the part may be applied with a low-reflective material. Namely, the term "slit" is defined as a portion provided in a rotary disc to conduct light emitted from a light emitting element to a photoreceiving element. The slit provided in the rotary disc includes a reflective groove, an opening, or other structure to conduct light emitted from the light emitting element to the photoreceiving element.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Note that, if using such a transmissive encoder as the encoder, there arises the following disadvantages compared to the reflective type. First, since the light source 131 and the photoreceiving element PD are arranged on both sides of the disc 110, the dimension in the axial<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> direction increases. Further, for example, an optical lens for producing parallel light, and holders for holding the light source 131 and the photoreceiving element PD which are separately arranged will be required and, thus, the number of components will increase and the structure will be complicated. Moreover, although extremely high positional accuracy is required between the light source 131 and the photoreceiving array PA, the positional accuracy may be degraded by the separated arrangement and this may negatively affect to the performance of the encoder. On the other hand, such problems do not arise with the reflective encoder. Further, with the reflective encoder, since all the components requiring the high positional accuracy, such as the light source 131, the photoreceiving array PA, the photoreceiving element PD, and the magnetic detector 120, can be arranged on the same side of the disc 110, it is possible to implement and assemble all the components on/to the same substrate. In this case, the positional accuracy of the components can easily be secured and, further, other various effects, such as a downsizing, a structural simplification, and an improvement in assembly, can be obtained. Thus, it is preferred to use the reflective encoder as described in the above embodiment.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Moreover, since the point light source for emitting diffusion light can be used when using the reflective encoder as the encoder, it has following advantages compared to the transmissive encoder. With the transmissive encoder, since an irradiation area is limited because it uses parallel light, it may be required to provide light sources at two locations to emit light respectively to the slit array SA used for the absolute position detection and the slit SL used for the multiple turning amount detection. In this case, not only the two light sources are required, but also the number of other components increases, such as connecting components of the light sources with the substrate of the optical module (e.g., flexible connectors), and supporting holders of the light sources. Therefore, the structure becomes complicated and the area of the substrate increases because two light emitting circuits for the two light sources are required. On the other hand, by using the point light source as the above embodiment, since the irradiation area can be increased by diffusion light, light can be emitted substantially uniformly to the respective parts of the slit array SA and the slit SL with a single light source. Therefore,<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> since only one light source is used, the following effects can be attained compared to the transmissive encoder: (1) the number of components can be reduced; (2) the area of the substrate can be reduced; (3) downsizing; (4) a structural simplification; and (5) a cost reduction.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Further, although it is not provided in the above embodiment, a plurality of reflective slits having an incremental pattern in the circumferential direction may be formed in the disc 110. The incremental pattern is a pattern of the slit arrangement where each slit pattern is regularly repeated at a predetermined pitch. The incremental pattern is different from the absolute pattern where detection or non-detection by each of the plurality of photoreceiving elements represents the absolute position x as a bit, and it represents the rotational position of the motor M for every pitch or within one pitch by using a sum of detection signals of at least more than one photoreceiving elements. Therefore, although the incremental pattern does not indicate the absolute position x of the motor M, but it can indicate the position of the motor M with high accuracy compared to the absolute pattern.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982203" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An encoder (100) comprising:
