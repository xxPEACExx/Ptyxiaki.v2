Therefore, in the e-Book authoring mode, the user may link or insert at least one application to or into a page using the language commonly supported by the e-Book authoring tool and the e-Book viewer.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The language that can be commonly supported by the e-Book authoring tool and the e-Book viewer includes the basic marked-up language such as Hypertext Markup Language 5 (HTML5).</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Therefore, the user may use tags of the marked-up language which is a language commonly supported by the e-Book authoring tool and the e-Book viewer, in order to link or insert at least one application to or into his/her desired position in the e-Book, i.e., a page that may be needed for an access to data (e.g., texts, images, etc.) of the page.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In addition, a User Interface (UI) may be provided in which Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) files for video playback may be automatically edited, if media such as videos are inserted into a page of an e-Book using Media Overlays technology when at least one application is linked to or inserted into the page of the e-Book. In other words, a UI may be provided where the terminal may run an application at a specific point of time while playing videos on a page.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Currently, in electronic PUBlication (ePUB) which is an e-Book document file format, files support marked-up language and SMIL.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">When a page is displayed, to or into which an application is linked or inserted, while the controller 110 displays an e-Book on an e-Book viewer in an e-Book viewer mode, the controller 110 may run the application in a predetermined position of the page. When the page is displayed, to or into which the application is linked or inserted, the controller 110 may perform automatic application execution, manual application execution, or no application execution depending on application execution conditions. When the application execution conditions correspond to the manual application execution, the controller 110 may display a UI (e.g., icon or button) indicating<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> existence of a linked or inserted application, and run the application if the application is chosen by the user by inputting or touching the UI.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The application execution conditions may be set in an e-Book by default in the e-Book authoring mode. Therefore, in the e-Book viewer mode, the controller 110 may display the e-Book depending on the application execution conditions that are set by default. However, in the e-Book viewer mode, the user may change the application execution conditions during display of the e-Book.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">If it is determined that there are at least two applications linked to or inserted into a page, while the controller 110 displays the e-Book in the e-Book authoring mode, the controller 110 may display types of the at least two linked or inserted applications in a predetermined position of the page, and run a selected application from among the displayed types of the at least two applications.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">While displaying an e-Book in the e-Book viewer mode, the controller 110 may display and run the application in an execution screen window. The execution screen window may be fixedly located not to overlap the data displayed on a page of the e-Book, or may be movably located overlapping the data of the page. The controller 110 may use the fixed or movable execution screen window depending on the user's choice.
