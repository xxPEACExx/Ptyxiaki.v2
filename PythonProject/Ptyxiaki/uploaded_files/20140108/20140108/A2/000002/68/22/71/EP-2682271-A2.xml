Technical Field</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a recording apparatus which includes a main substrate on which electronic components for controlling a recording mechanical section are mounted.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">For example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP6115217A"><text>JP-A-6-115217</text></patcit> (for example, paragraphs [0031] and [0032], <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 and 2</figref>, and the like) discloses a recording apparatus which includes a mechanism section provided with a recording head and a paper feed mechanism, a main substrate configured to control the mechanism section, and a power source substrate configured to supply power to the mechanism section and the main substrate, and in which the main substrate and the power source substrate are vertically arranged on right and left sides of the mechanism section.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP6115217A"><text>JP-A-6-115217</text></patcit> (for example, paragraphs [0031] and [0032], <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 and 2</figref>, and the like), the substrates are arranged in positions corresponding to the outsides of the mechanism section in the width direction (in the horizontal direction). Therefore, for example, even if the substrates are vertically arranged, there is a problem in that the width of the recording apparatus becomes long, and thus the recording apparatus grows in size. In addition, even when the substrates are arranged in positions corresponding to the outsides of the mechanism section in the back and forth direction (in the paper transport direction), the recording apparatus becomes long in the back and forth direction, and thus the recording apparatus grows in size after all. In addition, if the sizes of the substrates are reduced, the size of the recording apparatus can be easily designed to be reduced in size. However, it is difficult to secure a space for a wiring operation to connect wirings to connectors on the substrates in order to control the recording head and a motor which are included in the mechanism section.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY</u></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">An advantage of some aspects of the invention is to provide a recording apparatus, the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> size and the thickness of which can be reduced and can be thin.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a recording apparatus including: a mechanism section that includes a transport section which transports a medium, and a recording section which performs recording on the medium; and a substrate on which electronic components are mounted in order to control the mechanism section, and the substrate is arranged between a base of a main apparatus body and the mechanism section in a mechanical component arrangement area in which mechanical components included in the mechanism section are arranged in the main apparatus body.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to the configuration, the substrate is arranged between the base of the main apparatus body and the mechanism section in the mechanical component arrangement area in which the mechanical components included in the mechanism section in the main apparatus body are arranged. Therefore, compared to a configuration in which the substrate is arranged on the outside of the mechanical component arrangement area, the size of the recording apparatus may be reduced.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the recording apparatus, it is preferable that the substrate be arranged in either section of both end sections which interpose a transport region of the medium in a width direction which crosses the transport direction in the mechanical component arrangement area.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the configuration, the substrate is arranged in either section of both end sections which interpose the transport region of the medium in the width direction which crosses the transport direction in the mechanical component arrangement area. Therefore, the size of the recording apparatus in the width direction may be reduced.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the recording apparatus, it is preferable that the recording apparatus further include a medium reception section in which the medium supplied from a front side of the main apparatus body to the inside of the main apparatus body is set, and the substrate be arranged in a position which is separated from the medium reception section. According to the configuration, the thickness of the recording apparatus in the longitudinal direction may be thin.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the recording apparatus, it is preferable that the main apparatus body include a power transmission mechanism which configures the transport section, and the substrate be arranged at a bottom of the power transmission mechanism. According to the configuration,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the size of the recording apparatus in the width direction may be reduced.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the recording apparatus, it is preferable that the recording apparatus further include: a liquid ejecting head that ejects liquid toward the medium; and a liquid absorber that absorbs the liquid which is discharged to an outside of an end section of the recording medium from the liquid ejecting head. The liquid absorber may be provided between the medium reception section and the transport section, and the substrate may be arranged at a bottom separated from a region in which the liquid absorber is arranged. According to the configuration, the thickness of the recording apparatus in the longitudinal direction may be thin.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the recording apparatus, it is preferable that the recording apparatus further include a relay substrate that is connected to the substrate through wirings and includes connectors to be electrically connected to the mechanism section.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the configuration, the substrate is arranged between the base of the main apparatus body and the mechanism section. Therefore, it is difficult to secure the wiring operation space on the substrate. However, since connectors are provided on the relay substrates that are connected to the substrate through wirings in order to perform electrical connection with the mechanism section, a wiring operation to electrically connect the substrate to the mechanism section may be performed on the connectors of the relay substrate. Therefore, there is less of a problem in the wiring operation performed between the substrate and the mechanism section, and the size of the recording apparatus may be reduced.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the recording apparatus, it is preferable that a plurality of the relay substrates be provided. According to the configuration, even though small free spaces are dispersed in the mechanical component arrangement area, a size for a single relay substrate is relatively reduced by providing the plurality of relay substrates, and thus the relay substrates are easily set in the free spaces in the mechanical component arrangement area. Therefore, it is possible to arrange the substrate and the relay substrates in the free spaces in the mechanical component arrangement area. For example, compared to a case in which the relay substrates are not set in the mechanical component arrangement area, the size of the recording apparatus may be effectively reduced.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the recording apparatus, it is preferable that the plurality of relay substrates be<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> arranged in the either section in the mechanical component arrangement area in which the substrate is arranged.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the configuration, since the plurality of relay substrates are arranged in the same one end section as the substrate in the mechanical component arrangement area, wirings to connect between the substrate and the plurality of relay substrates are short, and the wirings are handled in a comparatively simple manner.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the recording apparatus, it is preferable that the recording section include a carriage provided to be able to move in a direction which crosses the transport direction of the medium, and the plurality of relay substrates be provided on both sides which interpose a movement area of the carriage in the transport direction.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the configuration, since the plurality of relay substrates are arranged on both sides which interpose a carriage movement area, which occupies a comparatively long area of the main apparatus body in the width direction, in the transport direction, it is easy to secure a space for arranging the relay substrates in the mechanical component arrangement area. For example, if an attempt to arrange the relay substrates in places corresponding to the carriage movement area is made in the transport direction, there is a problem in that the sizes of the relay substrates are reduced, and the number thereof is uselessly increased, or in that a large amount of change in the layout of functional components is forced to secure a space for arranging the relay substrates. However, since the relay substrates are arranged on both sides which interpose the carriage movement area, the sizes of the relay substrates are less reduced and an appropriate number of relay substrates is obtained without a large amount of change in the layout of the functional components.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Further, in the recording apparatus, it is preferable that the substrate be arranged in a free space on a lower side of the mechanism section while a mounting surface for the electronic components faces upwards, and the relay substrates be vertically arranged such that a mounting surface for the connectors faces the outside of the main apparatus body in the width direction.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to the configuration, the substrate is arranged in the free space on the lower side of the mechanism section while the mounting surface of the electronic components faces<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> upwards, and thus it is difficult to secure a wiring operation space on the upper side of the substrate. However, since the relay substrates are vertically arranged such that the mounting surface of the connectors faces the lateral outside of the main apparatus body, it is easy to secure a space for disposing the relay substrates. Further, since the connectors face outward, it is easy to perform the wiring operation on the connectors.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the recording apparatus, it is preferable that the recording apparatus further include: a main body frame that is arranged in the main apparatus body; other substrates that are controlled by the substrate; a second connector that is mounted on the substrate to be connected to a wiring between the substrate and the other substrates; and a lateral plate section that extends from the main body frame to be arranged on an outside of the power transmission mechanism in the width direction in the mechanical component arrangement area.

Therefore, since it is possible to shorten the length of the printer 11 in the width direction X and the transport direction Y, the size of the printer 11 can be reduced.</p><p id="p0114" num="0114">In a planar view seen from the side direction of the printer 11, the main substrate 70 is arranged in the lower section which is separated from a region in which the liquid absorbers 120, 121, and 122 are arranged. Therefore, since it is possible to shorten the height<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> of the printer 11, the printer 11 can be thin.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">In addition, the printer 11 is formed of a single member, includes a base section which separates the feed cassette 16 and the medium transport section 34, and a main body frame which includes a section having an H-shape when viewed from the transport direction Y of the paper P transported by the medium transport section 34. Therefore, since the main body frame which includes an H-shaped section when viewed from the transport direction Y is formed of a single member, the size of the main body frame is suppressed from being large, and it is possible to acquire a high resistance to a twist with the width direction X of the paper P being used as a shaft direction or a bending along the transport direction.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">Meanwhile, the embodiment can be modified to the following forms:</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">At least one relay substrate may be provided.

Further, when there are a plurality of relay substrates, it is not essential that all the relay substrates are arranged in one of the two end sections which interpose the transport region in the mechanical component arrangement area MA in the width direction X. For example, it may be configured such that at least one of the plurality of relay substrates is vertically arranged in an end section opposite to one end section in which the main substrate is arranged in the mechanical component arrangement area MA in the width direction while the component mounting surface thereof faces the outside of the main apparatus body in the width direction. In addition, at least one of the relay substrates may be arranged on the end section on the back surface or front surface sides of the mechanical component arrangement area MA in the mechanical component arrangement area MA. Further, the one end section in the width direction of the mechanical component arrangement area MA in which the main substrate 70 is arranged is not limited to the right-side end section in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>, and the one end section may be the left-side end section.

It is apparent that other substrates may be provided in addition to the relay substrates which are connected to the main substrate. It is apparent that the wirings (FFCs 96 and 97) which are connected to the relay substrate may be wired on a surface (a surface on the outside in the width direction) opposite to the power transmission mechanism with the lateral plate section 54a interposed therebetween.</p><p id="p0120" num="0120">The thermal conduction section is not limited to the extension section 81a which is integrally formed with the first base plate 81, and may be, for example, a separate member which is attached to the first base plate 81. For example, instead of the extension section 81a, a separate member of a metal plate is screwed to the first base plate, the metal plate is tightened together with the extension section of the heat-radiation cover using a screw, and may be fixed to the sink tank section of the power system electronic components in a state which thermal conduction can be performed.</p><p id="p0121" num="0121">Both the main substrate and the power source unit may be arranged in either section of the two end sections of the mechanical component arrangement area MA in the width direction X.</p><p id="p0122" num="0122">The main substrate may be arranged in either section area of a pair of end section areas on the two sides which interpose the transport region of the mechanical component arrangement area in the width direction such that the longitudinal direction thereof crosses the longitudinal direction of the end section area.</p><p id="p0123" num="0123">The main substrate may be vertically arranged in the mechanical component arrangement area MA such that the mounting surface for the electronic components and the<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> connectors (component mounting surface) faces outward in the width direction of the main apparatus body. In addition, a configuration in which the main substrate is arranged with being divided into a plurality of substrates, and the plurality of main substrates obtained through division are connected to each other using wirings may be adopted.</p><p id="p0124" num="0124">The support which supports the power source inlet is not limited to the pillar.

In addition, the printer is not limited to the serial printer and may be a line printer or a page printer. In conclusion, a recording apparatus which includes a mechanism section having a transport section which transports the medium (recording medium) and a recording section may be provided.</p><p id="p0128" num="0128">In the embodiment, the recording apparatus is embodied as the ink jet type printer which is one type of a liquid ejecting apparatus. However, when the recording apparatus is applied to a liquid ejecting apparatus, the recording apparatus is not limited to the printer. For example, it is possible to embody the recording apparatus as a liquid ejecting apparatus which ejects or discharges other liquid in addition to or instead of ink or a liquid type object in which functional material particles are dispersed in or mixed with liquid (which includes a flowing body such as gel). For example, a liquid ejecting apparatus may be provided which ejects a liquid type object in which materials are dispersed or dissolved, such as an electrode material, a color material (pixel material), or the like used to manufacture a liquid crystal display, an ElectroLuminescence (EL) display, and a surface emitting display. In addition,<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> a liquid ejecting apparatus which ejects a bioorganic material used to manufacture a biochip or a liquid ejecting apparatus which ejects liquid functioning as a sample material used as a precise pipette may be provided. In addition, a textile printing apparatus, a micro-dispenser, or the like may be provided.
