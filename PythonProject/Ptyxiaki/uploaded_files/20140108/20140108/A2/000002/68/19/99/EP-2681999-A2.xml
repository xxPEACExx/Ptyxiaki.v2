The invention relates to a method for facilitating the processing of fish after slaughtering, whereby an improved processing is achieved. In particular, the invention is related to the process of removing bones, e.g. pin-bones, nerve bones, radial bones, etc. from fish and fish fillets. In the following the invention will in general be explained with reference to the removal of pin-bones, but it will be understood that the invention may be used in connection with fish bones in general.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The process of removing bones from fish has gained considerable importance in recent years since the quality of the fish product and thereby also the price of the fish product is increased by removing the pin-bones and since there is an increased demand for fish products where bones, e.g. pin-bones have been removed or substantially removed from the product. This is for example the case in connection with salmon and related species, e.g. trout. The bones commonly referred to as pin-bones within this field are relatively thin and fine bones, which are located intramuscularly, with a hard part connected to the dorsal vertebra, sticking approximately horizontally to either side with a softer part terminating near the skin of the fish. Thus, these bones tend to remain in the fish meat after filleting and the problem of removing these pin-bones has gained considerable interest.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Currently, the process of removing pin-bones is performed in the post-rigor state, since the pin bones are firmly bonded in the tissue of the fish after slaughtering. Further, during the rigor process muscle processes, e.g. opposing pull of the muscles leads to a compressing of the spaces between vertebrae in the fish, whereby the pin-bones are firmly bonded and difficult to remove. Therefore, it is commonly accepted that pre-rigor pin-boning as well as pin-boning during rigor mortis of e.g. salmon is not possible, e.g. because the pin-bones tend to break or, if removed, will extract some of the fish meat, thereby reducing the yield and the quality of the fish meat. During rigor mortis the energy in the muscles is gradually relieved, thereby making it easier to remove the pin-bones in the post-rigor state.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Therefore, it is current practice to remove pin-bones in a post-rigor state, i.e. after resolution of rigor. Thus, in accordance with current practice, the fish is either transported from the slaughtering plant as whole fish or fillets or it is stored in tubs the time it takes to go through rigor mortis and the whole fish is then filleted, pinboned, etc.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">An example of such prior art pin-bone removal is disclosed in for example <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO9212641A1"><text>WO 92/12641 A1</text></patcit>, wherein a method and an apparatus is described for removing fish bones from e.g. a salmon fish fillet by using a handheld apparatus comprising a rotatable roller or wheel and a counter-pressure device, which pinches a fish bone and extracts the fish bone by the rotation of the rotatable roller or wheel.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A further example of such a prior art apparatus is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO9952375A1"><text>WO 99/52375 A1</text></patcit>, which relates to an apparatus for removing fish bones, in particular nerve bones from a filleted fish, which is forwarded by a conveyor. The apparatus comprises a bone extracting unit located above the conveyor, which bone extracting unit has a rotatable member that cooperates with a counter-pressure element to extract bones from the fish fillet, when it is passing on the conveyor. The bone extracting unit is movably suspended in order to adapt automatically to the surface contour of the fish.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2008020786A1"><text>WO 2008/020786 Al</text></patcit> also addresses the problem of being able to effectively remove bones, including pin-bones from filleted fish, and the document also mentions the problem that it in most cases will be necessary to wait up to 48 hours before pin-bones can be securely removed, i.e. wait to the post-rigor condition has set in, where the flesh has loosened its grip of the bones sufficiently to allow a rapid and thereby economically rational pin-bone removal processing of the fish. According to this prior art document, the pin-bones are removed by using a power driven rotary drum having bone engagement means along the outer circumference of the drum, whereby the bones are gripped by the engagement means and pulled out from the fish by the rotation of the drum. The rotation of at least selected engagement means are temporarily slowed down when the selected engagement means encounter a bone pull-out force exceeding a predetermined maximum value, e.g. by using a slip-drive connection. The effect of this special arrangement - as disclosed in this prior art document - is that the bones are pulled out without breaking and that furthermore bone removal may be performed not only in the post-rigor condition but also in the pre-rigor condition and even in the actual or full rigor condition of the fish.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP1753295B1"><text>EP 1 753 295 B1</text></patcit> discloses a device and method for the removal of pin-bones prior to or during rigor mortis of the fish. This prior art document addresses the problem that when using conventional methods and devices, it is necessary to wait app. 4 days - according to his document - before the post-rigor condition is arrived at, where pin-bones can be removed with a satisfactory result, and that this has the disadvantage that the fish at this point does not have the desired freshness. According to this prior art document, the pin-bones are detached from the fish and pulled out of it by applying a vacuum, i.e. by using a suction element, which can be a handheld device or which is suggested to be used in an automated arrangement, where a camera unit is used for recording specific data of each fish fillet and where by means of an evaluating unit the exact position of the pin-bones in the fish fillet is determined. Thus, it is apparent that this prior art arrangement is time-consuming and, if automated, requires relatively advanced camera and control equipment.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO0184941A1"><text>WO 01/84941 A1</text></patcit> discloses a method of producing raw fish meat products by substantially removing the pin-bones from the fish before resolution of rigor, including pre-rigor and in-rigor in order to provide raw fish meat products having improved freshness factors relative to conventional raw fish meat products made from stored fish at the post-rigor state, e.g. fish, where the pin-bones are removed in the post-rigor state. However, in order to be able to remove the pin-bones prior to resolution of rigor, it is described that the pin-bones may be removed by methods including cutting the fillet longitudinal, i.e. making separate pieces of meat substantially without pin-bones. Further, it is disclosed that pin-bones may be removed by a V-shaped cut, by cutting out each pin-bone separately, and by "shooting" out pin-bones by pistol, water-jet or air, thus presumably giving rise to a certain amount of waste of fish meat. In one embodiment slices of meat comprising the pin-bones are excised from the fish meat parts in order to obtain boneless raw fish meat product. In another embodiment according to this prior art, pin-bones may be removed by cutting the fish meat close to the pin-bones, resulting in a fillet substantially free from pin-bones and a fillet containing pin-bones. According to the document, when the cut is made in such a manner that the separation process results in one of the fillets exposing the pin-bones in a line close to the rind, the pin-bones can be removed from this fillet by conventional methods, e.g. dragging or pulling the row of pin-bones from the fish meat and thereby only removing a minimum of fish meat with pin-bones. Thus, it is apparent that this prior art teaches that in order to be able to remove pin-bones prior to the post-rigor state of the fish, methods are used whereby the pin-bones are removed together with a certain amount of fish meat, e.g. by cutting or excising pieces comprising the pin-bones or dragging pin-bones from the fish together with a certain, although referred to as minimum, amount of fish meat.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As mentioned in connection with the prior art documents <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="EP1753295B1"><text>EP 1 753 295 B1</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="WO0184941A1"><text>WO 01/84941 A1</text></patcit>, the freshness of the fish meat is an important parameter, when supplying fish fillets and fish meat. The freshness of the fish meat is also mentioned in e.g. <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="JP2004159539A"><text>JP 2004-159539 A</text></patcit>, where the problem of providing fresh cultured fish is addressed, e.g. in order to bring the fish to a wholesale market before the fish<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> stiffens, and where the solution of retarding the beginning of rigor mortis is used, which is achieved by feeding the cultured fish a rigor retarding agent prior to shipping. However, this document is not related to the problem of removing pin-bones.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Thus, as it is apparent from the above cited prior art, the freshness of fish meat, when it is supplied with pin-bones removed, is an important issue, and it is apparent that efforts have been made within the field to provide methods and devices, by means of which the pin-bones can be removed at an earlier stage than at the post-rigor stage, thereby improving freshness of the supplied products. However, this is related with various disadvantages as also mentioned above. Further, as it is apparent from the above cited Japanese patent document, efforts have been made within the fish industry to be capable of delivering fish at a pre-rigor state by retarding the onset of rigor, but the problem of removing pin-bones has not been addressed in this connection and is thus not solved thereby.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Furthermore, the use of electrical stimulation in connection with fish and shellfish is disclosed in the Japanese document <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="JP2023828A"><text>JP 2023828 A</text></patcit>, wherein it is suggested to apply a DC or AC voltage to the fish or shellfish in order to soften the meat. In this document it is mentioned that electrical stimulation in the form of a DC or an AC voltage in the range of 0.10 - 50V can be applied to live fish and shellfish just after landing or after instant killing, in the range of 50 - 600V according to further examples and in the range of 600 - 4000V for fish bodies in the form of fillets. The object of the method described in this document is to soften the texture of the fish meat of fresh fish.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Furthermore, electrical stimulation of muscle tissue is described in <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="EP1406499A"><text>EP 1 406 499</text></patcit> B 1 (corresponding to <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="WO03007721A2"><text>WO 03/007721 A2</text></patcit>), which relates to a method for processing poultry, comprising the steps of supplying live poultry, stunning the live poultry in a stunning device, placing the stunned poultry into product carriers advanced along a conveyor, killing the poultry and removing the feathers from the dead poultry in a plucking device. Downstream of the plucking device, the poultry is exposed to an<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> electrical stimulation, an electrical voltage being applied across the carcass of the poultry. In this document it is described that tenderness is a characteristic of meat products which is substantially determined by the time after the death of an animal at which the meat is removed from the bones and that if the meat is removed shortly after the death of a slaughter bird to be processed, the outcome is a tough product. It is explained that the culmination in a tough end product, when the meat is removed from the bones too soon after death, finds its origin in that as long as a muscle remains connected to the skeleton of the poultry, it is not possible for the muscle to contract unrestricted. A muscle contraction after the death of the slaughtered animal is provoked by the so-called Rigor Mortis (RM). Shortly after the death of an animal, a certain amount of energy is still present (stored) in its muscles. If a muscle is cut away from the skeleton before RM has set in, then the muscle will severely contract under the influence of this residual energy still present in the muscle in question and the muscle will stiffen. The energy supply still present in the muscle is substantially present in the form of glycogen, which, via intermediate products such as glucose, is ultimately converted into lactic acid and hence the pH in the muscles will fall. As a result of this muscle stiffening, a piece of meat, after having been prepared in a normal manner, will have poor tenderness, which is undesirable with a view to preventing unwanted toughness. As described in this document, an electrical stimulation of muscle tissue of the poultry is performed by applying an electric voltage across a slaughtered bird. As a result of this stimulation, the muscles are agitated and incited to perform work. As work is performed by the muscles, the glycolysis process in the muscles of the slaughtered bird is accelerated. The glycogen still present in the muscle is ultimately converted, via intermediate products such as glucose, into lactic acid. The pH in the muscles thereby falls. Through the stimulation of the muscles, the energy supply is therefore more rapidly spent, the stimulated muscle enters sooner into RM and the hanging process will be accelerated. The meat can be cut from the bones sooner after death without consequent lack of tenderness having to be suffered as explained in this document.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Thus, <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="EP1406499B1"><text>EP 1 406 499 B1</text></patcit> is related to the problem of tenderness of meat of poultry in view of the processing of the poultry.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="SU786957B"><text>SU 786 957 B</text></patcit> relates to a device for separating meat and bone raw material into fractions.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">It is an object of the present invention to present a method of processing of fish, which provides improvements in comparison with the above-mentioned prior art methods relating to the processing of fish.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide such a method, by means of which the problems related to the removal of pin-bones are relieved and in particular whereby it is made possible to remove pin-bones at a relatively early stage.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Further, it is an object to provide such a method, by means of which the pin-bones can be satisfactorily removed, thus providing fish products having a desired quality.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Thus, it is also an object of the invention to provide such a method, by means of which the pin-bones can be removed without breaking and by means of which it can be avoided to remove an intolerable amount of meat from the fish together with the pin-bones.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Even further, it is an object to provide such a method, by means of which fish products can be provided to the customers with a desired freshness.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">These and other objects are achieved by the invention as explained in further detail in the following.</p><heading id="h0003">Summary of the invention</heading><p id="p0023" num="0023">The invention relates to a method of processing of fish, said method comprising the steps of

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1</figref> the electrical stimulation 4 may be performed subsequent to the gutting 3 of the fish. In general, the electrical stimulation 4 may be performed while the fish is still in the bleeding process, after the bleeding process and as mentioned after the gutting 3.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">It is noted that in connection with the slaughtering of the fish a stunning of the fish is normally performed prior to the actual slaughtering.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">For example, the fish can be stunned by letting the fish stay in in water with CO2 content, e.g. in a water tank, in about ½ hour. After coming out of the water and killed manually with e.g. a knife and with bleeding initiated, the fish may subsequently be put into water for bleeding in about ½ hour. Subsequent to this, the guts may be taken out by machine. It is a further possibility that dry bleeding can be performed, i.e. when the bleeding takes place not in water.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Instead, the fish can be stunned by electrical stunning, e.g. by stunning the fish one by one just after taking them out of the water.

For example, it is a possibility that the electrical stimulation can take place while the fish after slaughtering is bleeding in water. Further, the electrical stimulation can take place<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> with the fish being moved in a tumbler, which is partially filled with water, an example of which will be described later on.

Further variations will be apparent to a skilled person.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">When the fish has been subjected to the electrical stimulation 4, energy in the muscles of the fish is more or less gradually released, whereby the compression in the muscle tissue is released and the bonding of e.g. pin-bones in the fish is also lessened, corresponding to the process that takes place during the rigor process. Furthermore, it has been shown that the electrical stimulation can initiate a process of breaking down some of the protein chains in the muscles, which also has the effect of lessening the bonding between the bones and the muscle tissue, whereby an overall effect is that a further processing of the fish, e.g. filleting 6 and subsequent pin-bone removal 8 can be performed effectively and with the desired quality relatively quickly after the slaughtering of the fish and that under no circumstances will it be necessary to wait e.g. 48 hours as mentioned in <patcit id="pcit0018" dnum="WO2008020786A1"><text>WO 2008/020786 Al</text></patcit> before the rigor process has advanced sufficiently in order for the pin-boning to be performed satisfactorily.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1</figref> a number of processing steps may be performed as under normal circumstances before and/or after the electrical stimulation 4, for example, but not limited to, gutting 3, which preferably is performed prior to electrical stimulation, grading 5, filleting 6 and trimming 7 of the fillets, whereafter the pin-boning process 8 can expediently be performed. Subsequent to this, packaging 9, transport, etc. of the fish product can be performed. Also, it is mentioned that in connection with the slaughtering and processing of the fish a cooling may preferably be performed, which for example may take place in a tumbler with a spiral to move the fish from one end to the other during the tumbling, which tumbler is filled partly with water, e.g. 50% filled with water.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2</figref> the method may be applied in circumstances where for example a pin-bone process is not necessary, and where the process after slaughtering 2, gutting<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> 3 and electrical stimulation 4 comprises the steps of grading 5, filleting 6, trimming 7 and packaging 9, etc. Also here the method to electrically stimulate the fish directly after slaughtering while the fish is in bleeding process is used in order to get rid of the energy in the muscles, speed up the rigor time and also to break down some protein chains that are holding the bones. Thus, the rigor time is controlled (shortened) in order to make sure fish is not in rigor state when it enters the market and it is made possible to fillet the fish as post-rigor right after slaughtering.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">A further embodiment is illustrated by <figref idrefs="f0003">fig. 3</figref>, which corresponds to the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1</figref>, but wherein an optional x-ray bone detection step 10 is included, whereby the e.g. pin-bones can be detected.

It will be understood that in case bones or bone remnants are detected, the particular fish or fish part may be subjected to a process, where the bones or bone remnants are removed, either manually or by an automated process (not shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">fig. 3</figref>) Other detection methods than x-ray detection may be used as well for detecting bones, e.g. pin-bones, or bone remnants..</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">The method according to the invention can as mentioned be used in connection with salmon, but can be applied to other fish species as well, e.g. trout and char, which are related species to salmon.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Further, the method can be used in connection with wild whitefish species such as cod, haddock, seithe and more, which also comprise pin-bones, which are stuck inside the flesh most of the time even though the fish is through rigor.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Furthermore, the method can be used in connection with farmed whitefish such as tilapia, pangangius, catfish, seabass, seabream, etc.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Also, it is noted that the electrical stimulation may be performed on a part of the fish, e.g. a fish fillet.

This device 16 will generate the needed voltage, waveform, stimulation bursts and relaxation pauses as explained in <figref idrefs="f0006 f0007">figures 8a - 8h</figref>. The device 16 can adapt these parameters by measuring one or more animal or process related parameters (e.g. size, weight, length, volume, pH, speed, stiffness, color, etc.) upstream and/or downstream. The electrodes 12 may preferably be arranged to contact the fish at a tail part and at a head part of the fish and the electrodes may be configured for applying the electricity to the fish by just touching the fish, but it will be understood that the electrodes may be configured for penetrating the skin of the fish. Further, it will be understood that each of the electrodes may touch the fish at a single location only but that the electrodes instead may be in e.g. sliding contact with the fish. Other manners of applying the electricity may be used as well. For example, electrodes that are fixed to the fish or grip the fish, such as for example clamps or the like, may be used. It should also be mentioned that in addition to electrode contact to the head and the tail part other configurations may be used, e.g. on opposite sides of the fish, etc. Further, the electrical stimulation may be performed on gutted as well as fish that have not been<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> gutted, and in instances where gutted fish are subjected to electrical stimulation, one (or more) electrodes may be placed inside the fish, for example near the dorsal vertebra and one or more electrodes may be placed on the side of the fish, e.g. one on each side, which electrodes may be oblong and placed along the fish in the longitudinal direction in order to stimulate in particular the part of the fish, where the pin-bones are placed. Further, other means of establishing an electrical contact may be applied such as for example water jet, etc. Even further, it will be apparent to a skilled person that the electrodes may be applied manually, even though an automated arrangement is preferable.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">In <figref idrefs="f0004">fig. 5</figref> an arrangement for applying electrical stimulation to a plurality of fish 10 is shown in a schematic manner seen from above, where a conveyor 20 is used for transporting the fish 10. Thus, this conveyor 20, e.g. a conveyor belt or the like, may be a conveyor that transports the slaughtered and possibly also gutted fish 10 from one process to another, while the electrical stimulation takes place, whereby the process of performing the electrical stimulation can be integrated in a normally used fish processing plant without extensive modifications. Thus, the conveyor 20 may transport fish from the slaughtering process to the gutting process, the conveyor 20 may transport fish from the gutting process to e.g. the grading process, the filleting process or another process, or another suitable configuration may be used.

This is because the speed of proteins break-down at 4°C is three times faster than at 0°C (i.e. the temperature of ice melting, that is usually selected for chilling fish). After gutting, before bone removing, the fish will be chilled in a way that its skin temperature will drop rather quickly to below 2°C and the core temperature will stay above 4°C until after deboning.

Each fish was filleted and six pin-bones, evenly distributed along the fillet, have been pulled out of each fillet each time a test was performed during the test period, the pull-out force was measured and average values were calculated.

As indicated, the results<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> show a substantive reduction in the necessary pull-out force for the treated fish. When taking into account that it is usually deemed necessary to wait for two to three days after slaughtering/killing before removing pin-bones from untreated salmon in order to achieve a satisfactory result, e.g. with a minimum of broken pin-bones and a minimum of removed meat, it can be understood that pin-bones can be removed from the fish treated according to example 1 and example 2 relatively quickly after slaughtering, e.g. approximately 6 hours after slaughtering, since the average pull-out force here corresponds essentially to the average pull-out force for untreated fish after two to three days, and since the tendency of the pin-bones to break and the tendency that meat is removed with the pin-bones is dependent on the necessary pull-out force.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">Above, the invention has been explained with reference to specific embodiments and with reference to the drawings, but it will be apparent to a person skilled within the art that the method according to the invention can be carried out in an infinite number of ways and within a wide range of variations within the scope of the appended claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982819" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Method of processing of fish, said method comprising the steps of
