The matters defined in the description, such as detailed construction and elements, are provided to assist in a comprehensive understanding of the exemplary embodiments. Thus, it is apparent that the exemplary embodiments can be carried out without those specifically defined matters. Also, functions or elements known in the related art are not described in detail since they could obscure the exemplary embodiments with unnecessary detail.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG 1</figref> is a view illustrating a 3D image providing system according to an exemplary embodiment. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the 3D image providing system includes a display apparatus 100 which displays a 3D image on a screen and 3D glasses 200 through which the 3D image is viewed.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The display apparatus 100 may be realized to display only the 3D image, or to display both a 2D image and the 3D image.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">If the display apparatus 100 displays a 2D image, the display apparatus 100 uses the same method as an existing 2D display apparatus. If the display apparatus 100 displays the 3D image, the display apparatus 100 converts a received 2D image into a 3D image and displays the 3D image on the screen. The display apparatus 100 may receive a 3D image, process the 3D image, and display the processed 3D image on the screen. The 3D image may be received from a photographing apparatus such as a camera or the like, and may receive a 3D image which is captured by a camera. Alternatively, the 3D image may be received from a broadcasting station, where the 3D image is edited and/or processed by a broadcasting station and transmitted from the broadcasting station.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In particular, the display apparatus 100 processes a left eye image and a right eye image, time-divides the processed left eye image and right eye image, and alternately displays the time-divided left and right eye images.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The 3D glasses 200 may be realized as active type shutter glasses. Shutter glasses are a pair of glasses for implementing a shutter glass method. A shutter glass method refers to a displaying method using a binocular parallax, i.e., a method which is to synchronize on-off operations of left and right glasses of 3D glasses with an image provided by a display apparatus so as to recognize a space sense of an image, which is observed at different angles, due to a brain operation of a viewer.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The principle of the shutter glass method is to synchronize left and right image frames played from the display apparatus 100 with a shutter installed at the 3D glasses 200. In other words, left and right glasses of the 3D glasses 200 are selectively opened and/or closed according to left and right image signals of the display apparatus 100 to form a 3D image.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">A plurality of 2D images having binocular parallaxes are used to realize a 2D image as a 3D image (i.e., a stereoscopic image). In the case of an existing captured 2D image, images having a binocular parallax with an original image are generated using the original image. For example, a first image (e.g., a left eye image) and a second image (e.g., a right eye image) having a binocular parallax with each other may be generated using an original image.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">For convenience of understanding and explanation, the present specification describes that first and second images having a binocular parallax with each other are generated from an original image in order to explain a principle in which a human viewer recognizes a target object. However, depending on which realization method is applied, an image having a binocular parallax with an original image may be generated and then may be combined with the original image to generate a 3D image.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">A human viewer views 2D images of a target object through both eyes. A brain of the human viewer synthesizes the 2D images obtained through both eyes to recognize a 3D effect of the target object.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Hereinafter, a method of converting a 2D image into a 3D image will be described.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a structure of a display apparatus 100 according to an exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the display apparatus 100 includes an image receiver 110, an image processor 120, a display unit 130, a controller 140, a storage unit 150, a user interface unit 160, an on-screen-display (OSD) processor 170, and a sync signal processor 180.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The image receiver 110 receives a 2D image signal from a broadcasting station or a satellite by wire or by wireless in real time and demodulates the 2D image signal. The image receiver 110 may also be connected to an external device such as a camera or the like to receive a 2D image from the external device.
