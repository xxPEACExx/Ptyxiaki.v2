Also, an out-connector hole 116 in which the power-out connector 19 is mounted and a signal connector hole 115 in which the signal connector 19 is mounted are defined in the other side surface. The signal connector hole 115 may be defined in any one of one side surface and the other surface of the housing 11.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Also, a cooling passage 111 through which coolant flow is defined in a bottom surface of the housing 11 in a meander line shape. Also, a coolant inflow port 112 into which coolant is introduced and a coolant discharge port 113 through which the coolant is discharged are disposed on a side surface of the housing 11.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> The coolant inflow port 112 and the coolant discharge port 113 may respectively communicate with an inlet and outlet of the cooling passage 111. Thus, the coolant introduced through the coolant inflow port 112 flows along the cooling passage 111 to cool the electronic component set 13 seated on a top surface of the base cover 14. Here, the electronic components generating a relatively large amount of heat are disposed on a position close to the inlet of the cooling passage 111, and the electronic components generating a relatively small amount of heat are disposed on a position close to the outlet of the cooling passage 111 to improve heat exchange efficiency.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Also, the second sealer 16 is seated along an outer line of a top surface of the cooling passage 111, and the base cover 14 is seated on the second sealer 16 to prevent the coolant flowing along the cooling passage 111 from leaking toward the electronic component set 13. The first sealer 15 is seated along an edge of the top surface of the housing 111, and the top cover 12 is seated on the first sealer 15 to prevent water or foreign materials from being introduced into the housing 11 from the outside.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Also, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, the base cover 14 includes a cover body 141 and a plurality of cooling pins 142. The cover body 141 covers the cooling passage 111, and the plurality of cooling pins protrude from a back surface of the cover body 141, particularly, a back surface of a portion corresponding to an inner space of the cooling passage 111. When the base cover 14 is seated, the plurality of cooling pins 142 may be rounded along a profile of the cooling passage 111. The plurality of cooling pins 142 are spaced a predetermined distance from each other to heat-exchange with the coolant flowing along the cooing passage through heat conduction. That is, heat generated from the electronic component set 13 may be transferred into the coolant through the plurality of cooling pins 142.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Also, the electronic component set 13 may include a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> switching device 131 including an insulated gate bipolar mode transistor (IGBT) that switches a DC voltage to output a three-phase current voltage, a DC link cap 133 mounted on a side of the top surface of the base cover 14 to stabilize an input voltage and reduce noises of the switching device 131, and a power PCB 132. In addition, the electronic component set 13 may further include various electronic components that are not described herein.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Each of the housing 11 and the top cover 12 may be formed of a light plastic material through plastic injection molding using a plastic resin. The housing 11 and the top cover 12 are formed of the plastic materials to decrease a weight thereof and improve price competiveness when compared to those formed of an existing iron or aluminum material. However, in the case where the housing 11 and the top cover 12 are formed of the plastic materials, electromagnetic waves generated from the electronic component set 13 may not be effectively shield.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">To solve this limitation, the inner cover 20 may be formed of the same material as the housing 11, that is, an aluminum or iron material to shield the electromagnetic waves. Like this, the base cover 14 may be a metal plate formed of aluminum to shield electromagnetic waves and transfer heat.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Alternatively, a plastic member manufactured by the plastic injection molding may be applied to the inner cover 20, and a plating process using nickel (Ni) or chromium (Cr) may be performed on an inner surface of at least the inner cover 20 to shield the electromagnetic waves. Since the plating process using the Ni or Cr is performed on the inner surface of the inner cover, the electromagnetic waves emitted from the electronic component set 13 may be effectively shielded. The plated layer may have a minimum thickness in a case where copper (Cu) is plated to a thickness of about 15 µm, nickel (Ni) is plated to a thickness of about 10 µm, and<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> chromium (Cr) is to with a thickness of about 0.2 µm. On the other hand, the plated layer may have a maximum thickness in a case where copper (Cu) is plated to a thickness of about 20 µm, nickel (Ni) is plated to a thickness of about 15 µm, and chromium (Cr) is plated to a thickness of about 0.3 µm. The Cu, Ni, and Cr plated layers may be successively formed within a range of the maximum thickness and the minimum thickness.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In addition, in the case of the existing electronic component box, since the cooling passage and the cooling pin protrude from the outer bottom surface of the housing, and an opening of the bottom surface of the cooling path is covered by a separate bottom cover, the electronic component box has no choice but to increase a thickness thereof. Furthermore, the coolant leaks from the cooling passage, and thus other components of the vehicle may corrode with the coolant. However, according to the embodiment, the cooling passage 111 may be defined in the inner bottom surface of the housing, and the top surface of the cooling passage 111 may be covered by the base cover 14. When the electronic component 10 is mounted within the vehicle, the opened top surface of the cooling passage 111 faces an upper side to prevent the coolant from leaking through the top surface of the cooling passage.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Also, in the case of the existing electronic component, since the cooling passage is defined in the outer bottom surface of the housing, and a separate plate on which the electronic component is seated is seated on the inner bottom surface of the housing, cooling efficient may be reduced. However, according to the embodiment, since the base cover 14 is seated on the top surface of the cooling passage, and the electronic component set 13 is seated on the top surface of the cover base 14, the heat-exchange efficiency may increase. That is, if heat discharged from the electronic component set 13 passes through only the base cover 14, since the heat may directly heat-exchange with the coolant, the heat-exchange efficient<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> may significantly increase when compared to a double bottom structure according to the related art.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Also, since the aluminum, the steel plate cold commercial (SPCC), or different kinds of metal plate which shields the electromagnetic waves and has high heat conductivity is applied as the material of the base cover 14, it is not necessary to perform a separate plating process onto the bottom portion of the housing 11 covered by the base cover 14. Thus, the plating processing costs may be reduced.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The above-described the electronic component box according to the embodiments has following effects.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">First, since the portion of the electronic component is formed of the plastic material through using the plastic injection molding, the self-weight of the electronic component box may decrease.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Second, the separate cover of which the surface is coated with nickel (Ni) or chromium (Cr) is used for shielding the electromagnet waves so that the electromagnet shielding function may be maintained or improved.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Third, cooling passage is disposed in the housing of the electronic component box to decrease the thickness of the electronic component box. Thus coolant is not leaked from the electronic component box to prevent the corrosion of the other parts of the electronic component box and the electrical short circuit.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Although embodiments have been described with reference to a number of illustrative embodiments thereof, it should be understood that numerous other modifications and embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art that will fall within the spirit and scope of the principles of this disclosure. More particularly, various variations and modifications are possible in the component<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> parts and/or arrangements of the subject combination arrangement within the scope of the disclosure, the drawings and the appended claims. In addition to variations and modifications in the component parts and/or arrangements, alternative uses will also be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982674" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An electronic component box for a vehicle, the electronic component box comprising:
