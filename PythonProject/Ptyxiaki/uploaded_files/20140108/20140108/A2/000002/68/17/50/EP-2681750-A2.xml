Body 15 may include two or more intertwined helically wound runners - runner 16 and runner 17. Runner 16 and runner 1 7 may be coupled by struts 18. Body 15 includes two ends - end 20 and end 21 - disposed at opposite sides of body 15. Runners 16 and/or 17 may be arranged in the shape of a three-dimensional curve similar to or substantially the same as a helix. A helix may be characterized by the fact that a tangent line at any point along the curve has a constant angle with a (fixed) line called the axis. The pitch of a helix may be the width of one 360 degree helix turn (a.k.a. revolution), e.g. measured parallel to the axis of the helix. Intertwined helically wound runners may share the same axis, be congruent, and/or differ by a translation along the axis, e.g. measuring half the pitch. The two runners shown in FIG. 1 may share the same axis 22, extending horizontally for approximately three complete revolutions. The length of body 15, as measured along axis 22 from end 20 to end 21 , may thus be </p><p id="p0022" num="0022">approximately three times the length of pitch 23. A helical shape may have constant pitch, constant radius (measured in the plane perpendicular to the axis), constant torsion, constant curvature, constant ratio of curvature to torsion, and/or a straight axis. In FIG. 1 , the radius of body 1 5 may be half of diameter 24. It is noted that the shape of body 15 resembles the general shape of DNA. </p><p id="p0023" num="0023"> (16) The shape of the cross-section of a runner may include one or more of a circle, an oval, a square, a triangle, a rectangle, an angular shape, a polygon, and/or other shapes. The width and height of the cross-section of a runner may be limited to a maximum of half the pitch for practical purposes. The shape and/or size of the cross- section of a runner may change along the length of the runner. The relation of the width of a runner to the pitch of the helical shape may define a characteristic 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 measurement/feature of body 1 5. This relation may be constant along the length of body 15, e.g. from end 20 to end 21 . In FIG. 1 , the shape of cross-section of runner 16 and runner 1 7 may be a rectangle that is approximately three times wider than it is tall. Furthermore, the width of runner 16 or runner 17 may be approximately 1/13th of the pitch of said runner of body 1 5. As a result, runner 17 of body 15 resembles a ribbon having an inner surface 25 (facing axis 22 of the helical shape) and an outer surface 26 (facing the opposite way as inner surface 25). Runner 16 of body 15 resembles a ribbon having an inner surface 27 (facing axis 22 of the helical shape) and an outer surface 28 (facing the opposite way as inner surface 27). Note that embodiments of this disclosure are not intended to be limited by any of the given examples. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024"> (17) Struts 18 coupling the runner 1 6 and runner 17 may be substantially straight, curved, the shape of an arc, twisted, and/or other shapes. In FIG. 1 , struts 18 may be substantially straight. Struts 18 may be arranged substantially perpendicular to axis 22, and/or substantially parallel to others of struts 1 8. The shape of a cross-section of a strut may include one or more of a circle, an oval, a square, a triangle, a rectangle, an angular shape, a polygon, and/or other shapes. The shape and/or size of the cross-section of one of struts 18 may change along the length of the strut. In FIG. 1 , the shape of the cross-section of struts 18 may be a circle. In FIG. 1 , all or most struts may have substantially the same length. The number of struts per revolution may not be constant. In FIG. 1 , body 15 includes approximately 10 struts per complete revolution of a runner. As shown in FIG. 1 , the diameter of each strut may be smaller than the width of a runner as measured e.g. at inner surface 25 of runner 17 at the point of engagement 19 with one of struts 18. The diameter of one strut may not be constant. The diameters of multiple adjacent struts may not be the same. </p><p id="p0025" num="0025"> (18) Runner 1 6, runner 17 and/or struts 18 may be manufactured from one or more of plastic, plastic plated with metals including copper, nickel, iron, soft iron, nickel alloys, and/or other metals and alloys, and/or other materials. In some embodiments, runner 16, runner 1 7 and struts 18 are manufactured from non-conductive material. Runner 16, runner 17, and struts 18 may be manufactured from different materials. Runner 16, runner 17, and struts 18 may be manufactured through integral </p><p id="p0026" num="0026">construction or formed separately prior to being assembled.

 (19) FIG. 2 illustrates an isometric view of an exemplary body 15 including two intertwined helically wound runners - runner 16 and runner 17 - coupled by struts 18. Body 15 is shown here with axis 22 of both helically wound runners extending vertically. </p><p id="p0027" num="0027"> (20) FIG. 3 illustrates a top-down view of an exemplary body 35 including two intertwined helically wound runners - runner 36 and runner 37 - sharing the same circular axis 42, both runners coupled by struts 38. The resulting shape of body 35 may be referred to as toroidal. Body 35 may be formed the same as or similar to body 15, though comprising more revolutions, by arranging the body in a planar circular shape and joining both ends - end 20 and end 21 in FIG. 1 - together. The preceding statement is not intended to limit the (process of) manufacture of bodies similar to or substantially the same as body 35 in any way. Note that the shape of the cross- section of both runner 36 and runner 37 in FIG. 3 may be circular, whereas it may be rectangular for body 15 in FIGs. 1 and 2. </p><p id="p0028" num="0028"> (21) Referring to FIG. 3, the diameter 44 of the circular axis of body 35, as well as the number of complete revolutions per runner required to completely extend along the entire circular axis 42 may be characteristic measurements/features of body 35. For example, as shown in FIG. 3, runner 36 and runner 37 of body 35 may require approximately eight complete revolutions around circular axis 42 to completely extend along the entire circular axis 42 of body 35, or some other number of rotations. </p><p id="p0029" num="0029"> (22) Note that one or more struts 38 of body 35 in FIG. 3 include a center-strut element 39, which is lacking from struts 18 of body 15. Center-strut element 39 may be associated with a particular strut of body 35. The shape of the cross section of a center-strut element may include one or more of a circle, an oval, a square, a triangle, a rectangle, an angular shape, a polygon, and/or other shapes. The shape and/or size of the cross-section of one of center-strut elements 39 may change along the length of center-strut element 39. One or more struts 38 of body 35 may include a center-strut element 39, which may have a different shape than a center-strut element 39 of another one of struts 38. In FIG. 3, the shape of the cross-section of center-strut element 39 may be circular, such that center-strut element 39 may have a cylindrical shape, in which the axis of the cylindrical shape of a given center-strut element 39 may coincide with the associated strut 38. In FIG. 3, struts 38 include center-strut element

 39, having substantially the same shape. A center-strut element may enhance structural integrity and/or serve other purposes. </p><p id="p0030" num="0030"> (23) FIG. 4 illustrates an isometric view of an exemplary body 35 including two intertwined helically wound runners - runner 36 and runner 37 - sharing the same circular axis, both runners coupled by struts 38. Note that, as in FIG. 3, the struts of body 35 in FIG. 4 may include a center-strut element 39, which may be lacking from struts 18 of body 15. </p><p id="p0031" num="0031"> (24) FIG. 5 illustrates a top-down view of an exemplary body 55 including two intertwined helically wound runners - runner 57 and runner 58 - sharing the same circular axis 62 and having wire guides 56, both runners coupled by struts 59. Though the shape of the cross-section of runner 57 and runner 58 in FIG. 5 may be circular, a runner may still have an inner surface (the half of the surface of a runner for which normal vectors are directed approximately inward toward body 55) and an outer surface (the half of the surface of a runner for which normal vectors are directed approximately outward, away from body 55). Any part of runner 57 or runner 58 may include wire guides 56. Wire guides 56 may include grooves, notches, protrusions, slots, and/or other structural elements disposed on and/or in runner 57 or runner 58 and configured to guide a wire along at least a part of the surface of runner 57 or runner 58, generally in a direction substantially perpendicular to the direction of runner 57 or runner 58 at the point of engagement between one of wire guides 56 and runner 57 or runner 58. </p><p id="p0032" num="0032"> (25) In FIG. 5, one of wire guides 56 of runner 58 may include a protrusion disposed on the outer surface of runner 58, arranged such that wire guide 56 may guide a wire arranged in a helical shape around runner 58, wherein the helical shape has an axis that coincides with runner 58. Such a wire, as any wire listed in any figure included in this description, may be insulated, uninsulated, or partially insulated and partially uninsulated. As shown in FIG. 5, wire guides 56 may be disposed in an intermittent pattern rather than a continuous pattern, e.g. such that no protrusion is disposed on the surface of runner 57 or runner 58 approximately nearest to (or directly opposite to) one of points of engagement 63 between runner 57 or runner 58 and of one struts 59. The number of wire guides per complete revolution of a runner and/or the number of wire guides between adjacent struts may be characteristic measurements/features of

 body 55. The size, shape, position, and/or pattern of disposition of wire guides 56 may be characteristic measurements/features of body 55. </p><p id="p0033" num="0033"> (26) FIG. 6 illustrates an isometric view of an exemplary body 55 including two intertwined helically wound runners - runner 57 and runner 58 - sharing the same circular axis and having wire guides 56, both runners coupled by struts 59. </p><p id="p0034" num="0034"> (27) FIG. 7 illustrates a top-down view of an exemplary body 75 including two intertwined helically wound runners - runner 76 and runner 77 - sharing the same elliptical axis 78, both runner coupled by struts 79. A body including two (or more) intertwined helically wound runners sharing the same axis may be arranged in any planar shape, including a circle, an oval, a triangle, a square, a rectangle, an angular shape, a polygon, and/or other planar shapes.
