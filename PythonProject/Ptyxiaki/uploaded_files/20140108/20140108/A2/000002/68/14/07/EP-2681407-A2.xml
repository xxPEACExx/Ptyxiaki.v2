id="p0002" num="0002">Field of the invention </p><p id="p0003" num="0003"> This invention relates to a downhole assembly, in particular, but not limited thereto, a transport assembly for use in deploying tools into a well and/or a jarring apparatus to aid passage of tools in a well; especially in non-vertical wells. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Background of the invention </p><p id="p0005" num="0005"> It is often desirable to support and move equipment such as tool strings in a well by using the assistance of some form of transport assembly, such as for example, a roller or wheel assembly. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006"> In the case of a deviated wellbore where a longitudinal axis of the wellbore is non-vertical (and sometimes horizontal), gravity tends to force the string toward a lower wall of the wellbore, leading to high friction between the wall of the wellbore and the string. In such circumstances, it can be a particular challenge to move a string through the wellbore, and roller-based transport assemblies are of particular use. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> Such transport assemblies have a "roller" that contacts the wellbore wall and provides support for the string to keep sections of the string off the wall easing resistance against the string. In addition, the roller may turn on engagement with the wellbore wall. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> On occasion the string may become stuck in the well during transport and a jarring tool used to attempt to free the string. The jarring tool is activated to suddenly jolt the tool and the string to attempt to free it from the obstacle preventing the string from moving. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> Whilst generally satisfactory the inventor of the present invention has noted that the traction assemblies and effectiveness of the jarring mechanisms may be improved.

 Summary of the invention </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an assembly having </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> first and second members having a common longitudinal axis; at least one of the members being rotatable about the longitudinal axis and movable along the longitudinal axis relative to the other member, the rotatable member having at least one engaging member, the engaging member being configured and/or disposed on the rotatable member so that rotation of the rotatable member about the longitudinal axis causes the first and second members to move with respect to each other in opposite directions along the longitudinal axis. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Preferably, the assembly is for transport or movement along and more preferably through another structure which is typically an outer structure and more preferably the said structure is a generally tubular or cylindrical structure and most preferably is a downhole borehole which may be an open borehole or may be lined or cased. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> Additionally, the rotatable member has a second mode of rotation and the or each engaging member can be configured and/or disposed on the respective rotatable member so that in the second mode of rotation, rotation of the rotatable member about the longitudinal axis causes the assembly to advance along the longitudinal axis, e.g. to move along a borehole. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> Preferably, the engaging member is configured to engage an outer structure, such as an inner wall of a borehole, wherein the rotation of the rotatable member about the longitudinal axis causes the engaging member to engage the outer structure. The engagement of the engaging member with the outer structure causes traction between the outer structure and the engaging member whereby the engaging member causes the rotatable member and other member to move with respect to 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 each other in opposite directions along the longitudinal axis or to advance along the longitudinal axis. Preferably, the engagement of the engaging member with the outer structure also causes the entire assembly to rotate as a unit about the longitudinal axis. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> Preferably, each of the first and second members comprises one or more engageable members. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> Preferably, each of the first and second members is rotatable. Preferably, the rotatable members are independently rotatable about the longitudinal axis. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017"> In one arrangement, where both members are rotatable, the relationship between the engaging members and the rotatable members is such that rotation of the rotatable members in the same first direction about the longitudinal axis causes the rotatable members to move towards each other. Preferably, rotation of the rotatable members in the same second direction, i.e. the direction opposite to the first direction, about the longitudinal axis causes the rotatable members to move away from each other. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018"> In another arrangement, the relationship between the or each engaging member and the respective rotatable member is such that relative rotation of the rotatable member and the other member in the first opposite directions (including the modifications where only one member is rotatable and where both members are rotatable) about the longitudinal axis causes the first and second members to move towards each other, whereas, preferably, relative rotation of the rotatable member and the other member in the second opposite directions, i.e. the directions opposite to the first opposite direction, about the longitudinal axis causes the movement of the first and second members away from each other. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019"> Preferably, the arrangement of the or each engaging member defines a rotational pattern having a rotational direction. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 n one arrangement, where each of the first and second members comprises an engageable member, the rotational directions of the rotational patterns of the engaging members of the first and second members are opposite each other. In this variation, in order to move the first and second members toward or away from each other, each of the first and second members is rotatably mounted and rotation of the rotatable members in the same first direction about the longitudinal axis causes the rotatable members to move towards each other. Preferably, rotation of the rotatable members in the same second direction, i.e. the direction opposite to the first direction, about the longitudinal axis causes the rotatable members to move away from each other. Furthermore, in order to move the first and second members along the longitudinal axis, relative rotation of the rotatable member and the other member in the first opposite directions (including modifications where only one member is rotatable, as in this case rotation of the rotatable member in any direction means that the relative rotation of the first and second members will be in opposite directions; and where both members are rotatable) about the longitudinal axis causes the first and second members to move as a unit in a first direction along the longitudinal axis, whereas, preferably, relative rotation of the rotatable member and the other member in the second opposite directions, i.e. the directions opposite to the first opposite direction, about the longitudinal axis causes the movement of the first and second members as a unit in a second opposite direction along the longitudinal axis. </p><p id="p0020" num="0020"> Alternatively, in another variation, where each of the first and second members comprises an engageable member, the rotational directions of the rotational patterns of the engaging members of the first and second members can be the same. In this variation, in order to move the first and second members as a unit along the longitudinal axis, each of the first and second members is rotatably mounted and rotation of the

 rotatable members in the same first direction about the longitudinal axis causes the rotatable members to move as a unit along the longitudinal axis in a first direction. Preferably, rotation of the rotatable members in the same second direction, i.e. the direction opposite to the first direction, about the longitudinal axis causes the rotatable members to move as a unit along the longitudinal axis in a second direction, opposite to the first direction. Furthermore, in order to move the first and second members toward or away from each other along the longitudinal axis, relative rotation of the rotatable member and the other member in the first opposite directions (including a modification where only one member is rotatable, as in this case rotation of the rotatable member in any direction means that the relative rotation of the first and second members will be in opposite directions, and where both members are rotatable) about the longitudinal axis causes the first and second members to move toward each other along the longitudinal axis, whereas, preferably, relative rotation of the rotatable member and the other member in the second opposite directions, i.e. the directions opposite to the first opposite directions, about the longitudinal axis causes the movement of the first and second members away from each other along the longitudinal axis. </p><p id="p0021" num="0021"> Preferably, the assembly is a transport assembly.

Preferably, the or each engaging member rotates around an axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the respective rotatable member. </p><p id="p0034" num="0034"> Alternatively the engaging members may be tracks. </p><p id="p0035" num="0035"> The roller members may be arranged to drive the rotation of the rotatable members, by the roller members contacting an outer structure, such as a side of a borehole, and rotation of the roller members in contact with the structure will cause rotation of the rotatable member. </p><p id="p0036" num="0036"> Preferably the or each roller member on the respective first and second members is independently operable. </p><p id="p0037" num="0037"> Preferably the or each roller member on the first and second rotatable members is independently rotatable. </p><p id="p0038" num="0038"> In one arrangement, the assembly comprises at least one motor to drive the roller members on one of the rotatable members. The roller members on the other rotatable member may be driven by a separate motor provided within the assembly or by power from outwith the transport assembly, such as by wireline from the surface. </p><p id="p0039" num="0039"> For alternative embodiments the engaging members may be powered. </p><p id="p0040" num="0040"> The motor may be powered by a battery, optionally a rechargeable battery.

<!-- EPO <DP n="17"/>-->
 mechanism 10, a second member in the form of a second traction mechanism 20 coupled by a hammer mechanism 30 and tubes 40a, 40b. A head 50 is provided at one end of the tool 100 whilst Figs. 1 b, 1 d, and 2 illustratively show a well casing 90 through which the tool 100 is deployed. The tube 40b forms an attachment member for attachment to other downhole tools (not shown). </p><p id="p0111" num="0111"> Each traction mechanism 10, 20 comprises a set of helically arranged engageable members provided in the form of roller apparatus 60. The direction of each resulting helical shape or 'thread' of each traction mechanism 10, 20 are opposite each other. In this embodiment the set of roller apparatus 60 of the first traction mechanism 10 are arranged in an anti-clockwise direction, whilst the set of helically arranged roller apparatus 60 of the second traction mechanism 20 are in a clockwise direction. </p><p id="p0112" num="0112"> Clockwise and anti-clockwise directions as referred to herein are said directions when viewed from the head 50 end, or lower end in use when no head is present. </p><p id="p0113" num="0113"> The traction mechanisms 10, 20 each comprise four pairs of roller apparatus 60. Each pair are disposed on the side of the tool 100 opposite each other. The neighbouring pairs are spaced around the tool by 22.5 degrees such that the fourth pair are spaced 90 degrees around the tool 100 from the first pair. </p><p id="p0114" num="0114"> As shown in Fig. 6, the traction mechanisms 10, 20 comprise a motor 12, gearbox 14 and clutch 16 in order to allow each to be rotatable independently of the other. </p><p id="p0115" num="0115"> As one function the tool 100 may be used to deploy tools in a well casing 90, especially in a non-vertical deviated well, by attachment to the tool 100 of another well tool (not shown) and deployment in a well casing 90 by known means. The tool 100 is deployed into the well and the traction mechanisms 10, 20 are counter rotated with respect to each other, 
<!-- EPO <DP n="18"/>-->
 the roller apparatus 60 engage with the well and rotating the tool 100 and move the tool downwards in a "corkscrew" type manner. As the helical shapes of the traction mechanisms 10, 20 are opposite one another, they provide traction for the tool 100 to move into the well when the roller apparatus 60 contact the well casing 90, especially when the well is deviated from being vertical. The tools are thus deployed in the well. </p><p id="p0116" num="0116"> The rotation of the traction mechanisms can each be reversed to move the tool 100 in the opposite direction. (The traction mechanisms 10, 20 counter-rotate in the opposite direction). </p><p id="p0117" num="0117"> In certain alternative embodiments each roller apparatus 60 may be powered. </p><p id="p0118" num="0118"> Furthermore, the tool 100 functions as a jarring tool. When deploying well tools with the tool 100 they can become stuck in the well and difficult to move. Jarring or jolting the tool with a jarring tool is, in general, a known procedure. In the present case, the traction </p><p id="p0119" num="0119">mechanisms 10, 20 are rotated in parallel (i.e. in the same rotational direction) in order to draw the respective mechanisms 10, 20 together until they spring apart with a hammer force. The tool 100 thus "jars" the tool 100 and any connected tools, in order to dislodge them, to attempt to move the tool onwards into or out of the well as required. It will however be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to the use for jarring only and in fact is usable in other implements and/or other operations where it is required to move two parts of an implement towards or away from each other. </p><p id="p0120" num="0120"> As well as jarring in a generally axial/longitudinal direction, the jarring mechanism also twists the tube 40b and attached tool string, largely by virtue of the helical arrangement of the roller apparatus 60 engaging with the well casing 90. This occurs without powering the roller apparatus 60, but the twisting can be emphasized by their powered rotation too for certain embodiments. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="19"/>-->
 Thus a particular benefit of embodiments of the present invention is that they can more effectively dislodge a stuck tool because they not only jar the tool in a generally axial direction but also twist it rotationally. </p><p id="p0121" num="0121"> Thus the jar assembly - which can be hydraulic or electrically controlled - produces a hammer like force in either direction by storing potential energy and releasing this energy rapidly. </p><p id="p0122" num="0122"> Moreover if the traction mechanisms 10, 20 are rotated in the opposite direction (still parallel, in the same rotational direction) the tool will jar the opposite end of the tool. An advantage of such a mechanism is that it can be used to direct the jarring movement both in in-hole and up- hole directions and so towards the source of the problem. </p><p id="p0123" num="0123"> The clutch 16 can disengage each roller apparatus 60 from the respective motor so that it is free to rotate should it collide with the well or well casing during movement through a vertical or near-vertical section of the well. </p><p id="p0124" num="0124"> Fig. 8 shows a perspective view of an alternative embodiment of the present invention and like parts will share common reference numerals except be preceded by a 1 . In this embodiment, the assembly 101 comprises roller apparatus 160 a portion of which are spaced away from the traction mechanisms 1 10, 120 by arms 180, 182 for each roller mechanism 160. The arms 180, 182 are pivotally connected to a sleeve 1 1 1 , 121 of the respective traction mechanisms 1 10, 120 and also to each roller apparatus 160. Moreover the sleeves 1 1 1 , 121 are provided as two rings 1 1 1 a, 1 1 1 b and 121 a, 121 b axially moveable with respect to each other. </p><p id="p0125" num="0125"> Thus the roller apparatus 160 can adopt a retracted position, as shown for traction mechanism 1 10, or relatively extended configuration, as shown for traction mechanism 120. The optimum angle of the arms to the rotatable member in the most extended position is 45 degrees although this may be varied.

 (constituting at least one retaining member) located between an inner surface of the roller wheels 304, and an outer surface of a protruding support member 310 of the main body 302. The roller wheel 304 bears against the ball-bearings, which in turn bear against the support member 310. The ball-bearings 308 function to prevent or resist separation of the roller wheels 304 from the main body 302. In this embodiment, the ball bearings are received in a space 312 extending circumferentially around an outer surface of the support member 310, which has generally a cylindrical form. A number of ball bearings 308 are received in the space to spread the loads. The apparatus is provided a first retaining recess 314 formed in the inner surface of the roller wheel 304, and a second retaining recess 316 formed in the outer surface of the support member 310, which are aligned with each other defining the circumferential space 312 for the bearings. </p><p id="p0133" num="0133"> The roller wheels 304 are connected to an outer end of the support member 310 via the ball-bearings in a close fitting relationship such that there is little more than a clearance gap between the inner surface of the roller wheel 304 and the outer surface of the support member 310.

Further, the ball-bearings are of a similar diameter to the circumferential space 312. In this configuration as shown in Fig. 1 1 , the ball bearings 322 will therefore abut the walls of the retaining recesses so that the bearings function to prevent separation and detachment of the wheels by forces applied to the wheels, for example while the apparatus 300 is being run in the wellbore. </p><p id="p0135" num="0135"> In addition to keeping the wheels 304 in position and coupled to the main body 302, the ball bearings 308 act to provide a low resistance coupling between the wheel and the support member 310 and allows for

This aperture can be seen in the embodiment of Fig. 10 at reference numeral 232. </p><p id="p0137" num="0137"> The passageway 330 extends between the aperture 332 through the main body and the support member 310 and the space 312 for receiving the ball-bearings 308. A second outlet aperture 334 at the other end of the passageway 330 is provided in the retaining recess 316. Thus, the passageway 332 is used to insert and/or remove the ball bearings 322 from the space, for example if maintenance is required or to install or change out the roller wheels 304. </p><p id="p0138" num="0138"> Once the balls have been inserted in the space 312 as described, and the apparatus 300 is assembled and ready for use as shown in Figs, 10 and 1 1 , an insert 340 (constituting a closing body) is located in the passageway 330 to fill the outlet aperture such that the ball bearings are not able to escape unwontedly from the space 312 and out through the passageway 330. </p><p id="p0139" num="0139"> Thus an advantage of certain embodiments is that the bidirectional hammer can be reset not just under gravity but also hydraulically (eg controlling hydraulic piston displacement), or electrically or mechanically (eg mechanical springs).
