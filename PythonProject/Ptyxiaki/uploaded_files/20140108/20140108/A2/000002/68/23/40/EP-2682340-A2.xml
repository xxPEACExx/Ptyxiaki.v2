In one design approach, the barrel assembly has a one-piece outer composite skin that avoids the need for splices in the skin which could add weight to the aircraft. One-piece barrel assemblies require that numerous manufacturing build and assembly tasks be performed either serially or in a sequenced manner which may add to production flow time. Production flow times may be reduced by building multiple panel sections of the barrel assembly concurrently and then splicing them together to form a panelized fuselage. However, the use of a relatively large number of panel sections may increase assembly labor and/or material costs. Additionally, the splices required to join a large number of panel sections may substantially increase the weight of the aircraft.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Composite fuselage skins have ply pad-ups in window belts on the sides of the fuselage where windows are located. These skin pads-ups increase the gauge of the skin to reinforce the windows and/or provide a base for mounting window frames. The panel longitudinal splices<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> are traditionally located in thinner areas of the skin, outside of the window belts.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Accordingly, there is a need for a method of fabricating a composite fuselage that improves production flow by allowing sections of the fuselage to be concurrently fabricated. There is also a need for a method of fabricating a composite fuselage that reduces the number of fuselage panels that are required to be spliced together by building a full barrel section using two half barrels. Further, there is a need for a composite fuselage and related fabrication method that reduce the number of splices, and associated weight of the skin.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The disclosed embodiments provide a method of manufacturing a fuselage having a composite skin that improves production flow time by enabling concurrent manufacturing of two half barrel sections and joining them together with two longitudinal splice joints located within the window belts of the fuselage. The need for only two splice joints may reduce assembly time and labor, while avoiding or at least minimizing any increase in aircraft weight due to the splice. Skin pad-ups in the window belts provide the dual function of reinforcing the windows and providing the longitudinal splice joints with sufficient strength and stiffness to carry the required skin loads. In one embodiment, the longitudinal splice joints are formed by bonding edges of adjoining skins together, while in other embodiments, the splice joint is implemented using mechanical fastening techniques.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to one disclosed embodiment, a fuselage comprises a composite skin including upper and lower composite skin sections, a window belt in the composite skin, the window belt including at least one window opening in the composite skin, and a longitudinal splice joint along the window belt joining the upper and lower skins sections together.

DESCRIPTION</b></heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">The disclosed embodiments involve the fabrication of a barrel-type structure, such as an aircraft fuselage having a composite outer skin, in which panelized fuselage sections are joined together by longitudinal splice joints. The embodiments, may however, have application in fields other than the aerospace industry. Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, embodiments of the disclosure may be used in the context of an aircraft manufacturing and service method 20 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> and an aircraft 22 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>. During pre-production, exemplary method 20 may include specification and design 24 of the aircraft 22 and material procurement 26. During production, component and subassembly manufacturing 28 and system integration 30 of the aircraft 22 takes place. Thereafter, the aircraft 22 may go through certification and delivery 32 in order to be placed in service 34. While in service by a customer, the aircraft 22 is scheduled for routine maintenance and service 36, which may also include modification, reconfiguration, refurbishment, and so on.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Each of the processes of method 20 may be performed or carried out by a system integrator, a third party, and/or an operator (e.g., a customer). For the purposes of this description, a system integrator may include without limitation any number of aircraft manufacturers and major-system subcontractors; a third party may include without limitation any number of vendors, subcontractors, and suppliers; and an operator may be an<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> airline, leasing company, military entity, service organization, and so on.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, the aircraft 22 produced by exemplary method 20 may include an airframe 38 with a plurality of systems 40 and an interior 42. Examples of high-level systems 40 include one or more of a propulsion system 60, an electrical system 62, a hydraulic system 64, and an environmental system 66. Any number of other systems may be included. The airframe 38 includes a fuselage 44, wings 46 and horizontal and vertical stabilizers 47. The fuselage 44 may comprise one or more barrel assemblies 45 each of which includes an upper barrel section 48 and a lower barrel section 50. Each of the barrel sections 48, 50 may form a half, or form split upper and lower sections of the barrel assembly 45. Barrel sections 48, 50 respectively include an upper skin section 52 and a lower skin section 54 that are joined together by two longitudinal splice joints 56 to form a composite outer skin 73 of the barrel assembly 45. The splice joints 56 are located within window belts 58 of the fuselage 44 where one or more windows (not shown) may be located. As will be discussed in more detail below, the disclosed splice joints 56 are located within the skin ply pads-ups used to reinforce the windows in the window belts 58, thereby reducing the weight of the aircraft 22 and improving manufacturing efficiency.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Systems and methods embodied herein may be employed during any one or more of the stages of the production and service method 20. For example, components or subassemblies corresponding to production process 28 may be fabricated or manufactured in a manner similar to components or subassemblies produced while the aircraft 22 is in service. Also, one or more apparatus embodiments, method embodiments, or a combination thereof<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> may be utilized during the production stages 28 and 30, for example, by substantially expediting assembly of or reducing the cost of an aircraft 22. Similarly, one or more of apparatus embodiments, method embodiments, or a combination thereof may be utilized while the aircraft 22 is in service, for example and without limitation, to maintenance and service 36.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">4</figref>, the fuselage barrel assembly 45 broadly comprises upper and lower barrel sections 48, 50, respectively, which may also sometimes also be referred herein as upper and lower barrel halves or barrel half sections 48, 50. The upper and lower barrel half sections 48, 50 are joined together by a pair of longitudinally extending splice joints 56 respectively on opposite left and right sides of the barrel assembly 45. Each of the splice joints 56 is located within an area of a window belt 58 where one or more windows 70 may be located, and the outer skin 73 of the fuselage barrel assembly 45 is padded up to an increased thickness.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the illustrated example, the center line 56a of the splice joint 56 passes through approximately the middle of a row of the windows 70. While the fuselage barrel assembly 45 is shown as having a generally circular cross sectional shape, other cross sectional shapes are possible. Also, while the barrel sections 48, 50 are approximately half sections forming a two-piece barrel assembly 45, it should be noted here that the upper and lower barrel halves 48, 50 may each themselves be formed of two or more sections. However, the illustrated barrel assembly 45 employing only two sections or halves 48, 50 may represent an optimum arrangement for applications wherein it is desired to minimize the number of joints between the sections, and/or improve production flow by allowing the barrel<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> sections 48, 50 to be fabricated concurrently. As will be discussed below, each of the splice joints 56 may be any suitable form of joint between the upper and lower barrel half sections 48, 50 along the window belt 58. Thus, as used herein, "splice joint" is intended to include a wide range of joint configurations, including but not limited to tapered lap joints, step lap joints, finger joints and joints employing individual splice elements to join the upper and lower barrel half sections 48, 50 together.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The barrel half sections 48, 50 respectively include upper and lower outer composite skin sections 52, 54 each comprising laminated plies of a fiber reinforced resin, and collectively forming the outer skin 73 of the barrel assembly 45. The thickness or gauge (not shown) of the skin sections 52 is greater in the area of the window belt 58 in order to reinforce the window cutouts 70a. This increased skin thickness in the area of the window belts 58, achieved by ply pad-ups in the upper and lower skin sections 52, 54, also allows the splice joints 56 to carry the required loads, thereby obviating the need for additional pad-ups for the splice joint 56. The skin sections 52, 54, are attached to interior framework comprising longitudinally spaced, circumferential or barrel-shaped frames 74 and longitudinally extending, circumferentially spaced stringers 72 which are attached to the skin sections 52, 54 using fastening, bonding or other techniques. A plurality of transversely extending floor beams 76 are secured to the frames 74 and are partially supported by stanchions 78 connected to the frames 74. Other interior framework configurations are possible.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>, each of the windows 70 includes a window cutout 70a surrounded by a reinforcing window frame 80 attached to the upper and lower skin sections 52, 54 by any suitable means, such as by fasteners. Each of the windows 70 is located between two adjacent stringers 72 and two adjacent frame splice segments 82 that are attached to the frames 74 by frame splices 84. The splice joint 56 between the upper and lower skin sections 52, 54 can be seen to be located within the window belt 58 which extends between the stringers 72. The centerlines of the stringers 72 are indicated at 72a. The splice joint 56 may or may not extend the full height of the window belt 58. In the illustrated example, the centerline 56a of the splice joint 56 substantially coincides with the centerline of the window belt 58, however in other embodiments, these two centerlines may be somewhat offset from each other.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGS. 6 and 6A</figref>, the upper and lower skin sections 52, 54 are each tailored to include ply pad-ups 75 within the window belt 58 extending between adjacent stringers 72, resulting in a skin thickness or gauge "<b>t</b>" that is greater within the window belt 58 than the skin thickness "<b>t<sub>1</sub></b>" above and below the window belt 58. The pad-ups 75 extend essentially the full height of the window belt 58, between the stringers 72. The splice joint 56 lies within the pad-ups 75 used to reinforce the window cutouts 70a, thus taking advantage of the increased skin thickness "<b>t</b>" needed to reinforce the window cutouts 70a, to carry loads between the upper and lower skin sections 52, 54. In other words, the disclosed embodiments take advantage of the presence and location of the pad-ups needed to reinforce the window cutouts 70a within the window belt 58, by locating the splice joint 56 within the window belt 58, thereby<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> obviating the need for a separate pad-up for the splice joint 56. In this example, the splice joint 56 is a bonded tapered lap joint, however, as previously mentioned, other joint configurations are possible.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIGS. 6B and 6C</figref> illustrate additional details of the bonded splice joint 56 shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref>. The bonded splice joint 56 is formed by overlapping edges 52a, 54a of the skin sections 52, 54 respectively. As best seen in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6C</figref>, each of the skin sections 52, 54 comprises a plurality of fiber reinforced resin plies 86, and the tapered edges 52a, 54a comprise a plurality of matching ply steps 88 forming a step lap joint configuration. Each of the ply steps 88 may comprise one or more plies 86 formed by ply drop-offs. The thickness "t" of the skin sections 52, 54 within the area of the splice joint 56 is determined by the thickness and number of skin plies 86 (<figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6C</figref>), and is selected such that the skin 73 and the splice joint 56 can carry all necessary loads in the area of the window belt 58. Each of the ply steps 88 forms a bonding surface 90. The ply drop-off or taper ratio of the edges 52a, 52b may be selected to suit the particular application, and may determine, at least in part, the total amount of bond surface 90 that is available to create a load-carrying bonded joint between the upper and lower skin sections 52, 54 respectively. Generally, a taper ratio may be selected that will result in bond surfaces 90 that are sufficient in area to give the splice joint 56 enough strength within the window belt 58 to both adequately reinforce the window cutouts 70a, and to transfer loads between the skin sections 52, 54.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Attention is now directed to <figref idrefs="f0007">FIGS. 7 and 7A</figref> which illustrate an alternate embodiment of the bonded splice joint 56. In this example, the edges 52a, 54a of the<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> skin sections 52, 54 are oppositely tapered and are bonded to a double tapered splice strap 92 which may comprise multiple plies 94 (<figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7A</figref>) of a suitable fiber reinforced resin, similar to the plies of the skin sections 52, 54. As best seen in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7A</figref>, one or more plies 96 of the outer edges 52a, 54a of skin sections 52, 54 may face and abut each other generally in the area of the centerline 56a of the joint 56, forming a butt joint 97 overlying the splice strap 92. In other embodiments however, the plies 96 may not abut each other, rather there may be a slight gap (not shown) between the plies 96 at the outer edges 52a, 52b. In the case of the embodiments shown in <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">FIG. 5-7A</figref>, mechanical fasteners 87 (<figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>) used to attach the window frames 80 and the frame splices 82 to the upper and lower skins 52, 54 may function to slow or arrest the propagation of any splice separation occurring in the laminate skin sections 52, 54, while also providing a redundant load paths. Other bonded joint configurations employing a bonded splice strap are possible, including but not limited to those in which the splice strap 92 forms step lap joints or finger joints with the upper and lower skin sections 52, 54.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As an alternative to the method described above in which the splice joint 56 between the upper and lower skin sections 52, 54 is formed by bonding, a mechanical fastening method may instead be employed to form the splice joint 56. For example, referring to <figref idrefs="f0008 f0009 f0010 f0011 f0012 f0013">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, longitudinal splice joint 56 located within the window belt 58 uses suitable mechanical fasteners 87 to join the upper and lower skin section 52, 54. As best seen in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>, the centerline 56a of the splice joint 56 passes substantially through the center of the window cutouts 70a, within the window belt 58. The upper and lower skin sections 52, 54 form a joint line 85. A slight gap (not<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> shown) may be present between the skin sections 52, 54 at the joint line 85. As will become apparent below, the laminated skin sections 52, 54 are padded up with additional plies within the window belt 58 in order to reinforce the window cutouts 70a, similar to the embodiments previously described in connection with <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">FIGS. 5-7</figref>.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Referring particularly to <figref idrefs="f0009">FIGS. 9</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0010">9A</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0011">9B</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0012">9C and 9D</figref>, window frames 80 are formed of a suitable rigid material such as a metal or a composite. Each of the window frames 80 includes a frame portion 80a surrounding and reinforcing the window cut-outs 70a, and longitudinal splice plate portions 80b formed integral with the frame portions 80a. The splice plate portions 80b are substantially aligned with the centerline 56a and cover the joint line 85 between the upper and lower skins 52, 54 respectively. In effect, window frames 80 form a series of internal splice plates 93 respectively within the frame bays 65 that form a single shear joint between the upper and lower skin sections 52, 54 along the joint line 85. As best seen in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIGS. 9A</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0011">9B</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0012">9C and 9D</figref>, the upper and lower skin sections 52, 54 are each tailored to include ply pad-ups 75 within the window belt 58 extending between adjacent stringers 72, resulting in a skin thickness or gauge <b>"t"</b> that is greater within the window belt 58 than the skin thickness <b>"t<sub>1</sub>"</b> above and below the window belt 58. The pad-ups 75 extend essentially the full height of the window belt 58, between the stringers 72. The splice joint 56 formed by the window frames 80, including the splice plate portions 80b, lies within the region including with pad-ups 75, thus taking advantage of the increased skin thickness <b>"t"</b> needed to reinforce the windows 70, to carry loads between the upper and lower skin sections 52, 54. As<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, suitable fasteners 87 attach the window frames 80, including the splice plate portions 80b, to both the upper and lower skin sections 52, 54.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Referring particularly to <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, the window frame splice extensions 80b of window frames 80 may be slightly spaced apart to form gaps 105 between adjacent window frames.

An external splice plate 100 is located within the tapered recesses 102, 104 of the upper and lower skin sections 52, 54.
