In this structure, the hydraulic pump is driven by an engine, and motive power of a rotational shaft of the hydraulic motor is speed-varied by a gear apparatus or the like and transmitted to a wheel of the vehicle. In addition, the hydraulic pump is of a variable displacement swash plate type in which an angle of the swash plate is changed to increase an amount of discharge of the hydraulic pump, to enable increase of a rotational velocity of the rotational shaft of a fixed displacement hydraulic motor.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2001071769A"><text>JP 2001-71769 A</text></patcit> discloses a hydraulic continuously variable transmission integrally constructed by a hydraulic pump and a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> hydraulic motor, wherein the capacities of the hydraulic pump and the hydraulic motor can be continuously adjusted. With a servo mechanism provided on a side of each of the hydraulic pump and the hydraulic motor, the swash plate angle of the movable swash plate of each of the hydraulic pump and the hydraulic motor is set to be rotatable. A rotation of a speed-varied operation arm of the servo mechanism is realized by manually operating through a link mechanism, an operation lever, or the like, or using a hydraulic piston.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2006064011A"><text>JP 2006-64011 A</text></patcit> discloses a hydraulic continuously variable transmission including a hydraulic pump and a hydraulic motor, wherein a variable displacement, movable swash plate type structure is employed for one or both of the hydraulic pump and the hydraulic motor. In this apparatus, a load control mechanism is provided which forms a hydraulic servo mechanism which controls the swash plate angle of the movable swash plate, which has an actuator for moving a pin for inclining the movable swash plate to a side of deceleration, and which guides pressure fluid of the main fluid path of a closed circuit which connects the hydraulic pump and the hydraulic motor to the actuator. The hydraulic motor is maintained at a maximum swash plate angle when stopped, and as the vehicle travels, the swashplate angle is reduced. Inaddition, a control is applied to reduce the swash plate angle by the load control mechanism.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">During acceleration of a working vehicle equipped with the above-described hydraulic continuously variable transmission, when an acceleration pedal which is an acceleration operator is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> operated, the inclination angle of the movable swash plate of the hydraulic pump is increased with the operation of the acceleration pedal, and the rotational velocity of the hydraulic motor is increased. Because of this, the rotational velocity of the wheel linked to the rotational shaft of the hydraulic motor via a gear mechanism or the like in a manner to allow transmission of the motive power is increased, and the vehicle is accelerated. On the other hand, during the deceleration of the vehicle, when the acceleration pedal is not being operated, that is, the amount of depression of the accelerator pedal becomes 0 and the acceleration pedal is displaced to the side of low velocity, because the displacement of the hydraulic motor is fixed, the supply of the hydraulic oil from the hydraulic pump to the hydraulic motor is rapidly suspended, and the supply of the hydraulic oil from the hydraulic motor to the hydraulic pump is also rapidly suspended. Because of this, there will be no place for the hydraulic oil of the hydraulic motor to move to, causing a rapid deceleration of the hydraulic motor, and consequently, a rapid deceleration of the working vehicle. Therefore, it is desired to make the change of the velocity during deceleration of the working vehicle gradual, to reduce the change in the behavior of the vehicle, and to lessen a feeling of shock experienced by the driver during deceleration. In the vehicles having the hydraulic continuously variable transmission disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2001071769A"><text>JP 2001-71769 A</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2006064011A"><text>JP 2006-64011 A</text></patcit>, there is still room for improvement from the viewpoint of lessening rapid deceleration of the vehicle when the acceleration operator is displaced on the side of low velocity.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">When the rotational velocity of the wheel linked to the rotational shaft of the hydraulic motor through a gear mechanism or the like in a manner to allow transmission of motive power is increased as described above and the vehicle is accelerated, some users may wish to prevent the feeling of shock due to rapid acceleration regardless of the operation of the acceleration pedal when the vehicle starts to travel. In addition, the user may wish to change the travel starting performance between a work state where a working implement is used and a normal travel state where the working implement is not used. For example, when the working vehicle is a farm tractor, if the vehicle rapidly starts to travel while the working implement such as a tiller is working on the ground, an unfavorable state of the ground, such as a rough field, may result, and the user may wish to prevent such an unfavorable state. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2001071769A"><text>JP 2001-71769 A</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP2006064011A"><text>JP 2006-64011 A</text></patcit> do not disclose a means to facilitate provision of a travel starting performance according to the user's desires. For example, although <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP2006064011A"><text>JP 2006-64011 A</text></patcit> discloses that the hydraulic motor of the HST is maintained at the maximum swash plate angle when

1</figref> is a schematic diagram showing an overall structure of a working vehicle in which a travel control unit of a working vehicle according to the present embodiment is equipped. The working vehicle in which the travel control unit of the present embodiment is equipped may be, for example, a farm tractor for farm work, a lawnmower for mowing work, a wheel loader for public work, or the like.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a working vehicle 10 comprises a vehicle frame (not shown), components supported on the vehicle frame including an engine 12, front wheels (not shown) which are a left wheel and a right wheel, and rear wheels 14 which are a left wheel and a right wheel (in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, only one of the two wheels is shown), and a working implement (not shown) such as a tiller, a lawnmower, or the like. A motive power transmitting apparatus 16 which is a motive power transmitting unit is supported on the vehicle frame, and after rotational power of the engine 12 is converted into hydraulic power, the power is again converted to rotational power and transmitted to the front wheels and the rear wheels 14. On a front side of a driver seat (not shown) provided on the working vehicle 10, an acceleration pedal 18 (<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>), which is an acceleration operator, and a brake pedal 20 (<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>,) which is a brake operator, are provided.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram showing a hydraulic control circuit and a controller of a hydraulic continuously variable transmission controlled by the travel control unit of the present embodiment. In <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, two pedals 18 and two pedals 20 are shown, but this illustration is merely for showing different positions, and in<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> reality, only one pedal 18 and one pedal 20 are provided.

The HST 26 comprises a hydraulic pump 34 and a hydraulic motor 36 which are provided in a casing and which are fluidly connected to each other. A rotational shaft of the hydraulic pump 34 is linked to the rotational shaft of the engine 12, and is driven by the engine 12. The hydraulic pump 34 and the hydraulic motor 36 comprise movable swash plates 38 and 40, respectively, and are of a continuous variable displacement type in which the displacement varies continuously.

Two neutral position maintaining mechanisms 56 are provided respectively corresponding to each of the hydraulic pump 34 and the hydraulic motor 36. A pressurized hydraulic oil is introduced from the auxiliary pump 42 to one of pressure chambers, on both sides of the arm member 54, selected by a solenoid-type directional control valve 58. Because of this, the arm member 54 is driven in one of the directions, and the spool of the servo mechanism 48 is moved.

Therefore, the displacement ratio being 1/2 means that the hydraulic motor 36 has a minimumdisplacement having a displacement of 1/2 the maximum displacement. In <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, a straight line connecting a point A where the swash plate position of the hydraulic pump 34 is 1 and the displacement ratio of the hydraulic motor 36 is 1/2 and a point B where the swash plate position of the hydraulic pump 34 is 0 and the displacement ratio of the hydraulic motor 36 is 1 is assumed to be a reference line a0.

In addition, even when the vehicle velocity is rapidly reduced in an α region of <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> where the velocity is sufficiently reduced, because the absolute value of the vehicle velocity itself is sufficiently small, the feeling of shock is also sufficiently small.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The controller 60 also changes the displacement of the hydraulic motor 36 to the maximum displacement at the same time when the displacement of the hydraulic pump 34 reaches the stand-by displacement when the position of the acceleration pedal 18 represented by the detection signal which is input from the pedal sensor 66 is set at the non-operation state.

Because of this, the<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> degree of deceleration of the vehicle can be increased in the initial stage of deceleration compared to the normal time based on an operation of the driver, to stop the vehicle with a shorter distance.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">K2 and K3 of <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> show cases where the vehicle is decelerated according to the aggressive deceleration modes.

K3 corresponds to a case where the brake pedal 20 is operated at a time where, after the acceleration pedal 18 is set to the non-operation state, the velocity reaches a certain velocity V2. As is clear from comparison of J1, K1, and K2 in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>, in the present embodiment, the feeling of shock during deceleration can be reduced compared to the case of the comparative example where the displacement of the hydraulic motor 36 is maintained at the constant during deceleration, and the vehicle can be stopped in a shorter distance compared to the standard deceleration mode which is the normal time. In this case, the feeling of shock at the initial stage of deceleration is larger than the case following the standard deceleration mode, but the driver's desire to stop rapidly in order to avoid an obstacle or the like can be more quickly satisfied. In this case, the hydraulic braking function of the HST 26 can be effectively used.

When the aggressive deceleration mode is set by the sensitivity adjustment dial 76, the deceleration control may be applied according to the aggressive deceleration mode which is set by the sensitivity adjustment dial 76 not from the time of non-operation of the acceleration pedal 18, but rather from the time of operation of the brake pedal 20. In addition, the deceleration intensity at the initial stage of deceleration can also be adjusted continuously by the sensitivity adjustment dial 76. For example, a mode for an intermediate position in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> not defined by modes b41, b42, ... may be set by interpolation from the defined modes b41, b42, ... on both sides or using a preset relationship equation.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Alternatively, the sensitivity adjustment dial 76 described above may be omitted.

Alternatively, the travel control unit 69 may have a mode selection switch 78 which is a mode selection unit shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, in place of the sensitivity adjustment dial 76. The mode selection switch 78 allows the user to select one of the standard deceleration mode and the aggressive deceleration mode. The "aggressive deceleration mode" is a mode in which the degree of increase of the displacement of the hydraulic motor 36 corresponding to the reduction of the displacement of<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> the hydraulic pump 34 is reduced in the initial stage of deceleration compared to the "standard deceleration mode", and is shown, for example, with b1, b2, ... b6 of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>.

In this case, even when the amount of discharge of the hydraulic pump 34 is increased based on the operation of the acceleration pedal 18, the rate of increase of the rotational velocity of the motor shaft 44 of the hydraulic motor 36 can be kept low, and thus a smooth travel starting performance can be realized even when the operation of the acceleration pedal 18 is rapid.

In the stages other than the initial stage of starting to travel, the controller 60 obtains, that is, calculates, the capacities of the hydraulic pump 34 and the hydraulic motor 36 at the highest efficiency point where the highest efficiency of the engine 12 can be obtained, based on the load value obtained from the signal which is input from the engine rotational number detecting unit<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> or the like (not shown), the vehicle velocity detected by the vehicle velocity sensor 84, and the corresponding efficiency map stored in the storage unit 74. The controller 60 controls the hydraulic pump 34 and the hydraulic motor 36 to realize the capacities thus obtained. For example, the case after the amount of operation, that is, amount of depression, of the acceleration pedal 18 has reached a value greater than or equal to a predetermined amount which is set in advance may be set as "stages other than the initial stage of starting to travel" described above.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">A horizontal axis of <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 12</figref> represents the swash plate position of the hydraulic pump 34, and shows that the hydraulic pump 34 has the maximum displacement at the swash plate position 1, that the displacement is gradually reduced in the order of 3/4, 1/2, and 1/4, and that the stand-by position is reached at the swash plate position 0. The stand-by position represents a state where the movable swash plate 38 is positioned on a plane perpendicular to the rotational shaft of the hydraulic pump 34. In other words, the horizontal axis of <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 12</figref> can be replaced by the displacement of the hydraulic pump 34.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">A vertical axis of <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 12</figref> represents a displacement ratio of the hydraulic motor 36, that is, a proportion of displacement with respect to the maximum displacement, with the case where the hydraulic motor 36 has the maximum displacement being set as 1. Therefore, the displacement ratio of 1/2 means that the hydraulic motor 36 has the minimum displacement having a displacement of 1/2 the maximum displacement. <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 12</figref> shows that a region where the displacement ratio of the hydraulic motor is high is a<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> high-torque region.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">In <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 12</figref>, equi-velocity lines V1, V2, ... are set. The equi-velocity lines V1, V2, ... are set connecting points where the vehicle velocity is equal. A highest efficiency line L is also set connecting the highest efficiency points of the engine 12 under one load condition. The highest efficiency line L shown in <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 12</figref> is merely an example, and the highest efficiency line L is not limited to the one exemplified in <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 12</figref>. The controller 60 obtains the capacities of the hydraulic pump 34 and the hydraulic motor 36 at the highest efficiency point of the engine 12 corresponding to the vehicle velocity obtained by the vehicle velocity sensor 84 on the efficiency map corresponding to the obtained load value, and controls the hydraulic pump 34 and the hydraulic motor 36 to realize the respective capacities. According to this configuration, energy can be saved in the working vehicle 10 equipped with the travel control unit 69. Other structures and operations are similar to those of the third preferred embodiment described above. Alternatively, such a configuration may be employed in combination with the second preferred embodiment described above.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Moreover, in the second and third preferred embodiments described above, a configuration is exemplified in which the acceleration pedal 18 is used as the acceleration operator, but alternatively, a transmission lever may be provided at a peripheral section of the driver'S seat as the acceleration operator. For example, the transmission lever may be set to be able to be reciprocated in the front-and-rear direction, an increase of the<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --> forward movement velocity can be instructed by tilting the transmission lever to the front, and the increase in the backward movement velocity can be instructed by tilting the transmission lever to the rear. In this case, the upright position of the transmission lever is the neutral position and instructs a velocity of 0. Even when such a transmission lever is used, the controller 60 can control the displacement of the hydraulic motor 36 at the initial stage of starting to travel in the forward direction or the backward direction, so that advantages similar to those of the second and third preferred embodiments described above can be obtained.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Alternatively, the inclination sensor 82 may be omitted in the second preferred embodiment, the third preferred embodiment, or the alternative configuration of the third preferred embodiment as described above, to not apply the control according to the inclination angle of the ground on which the vehicle is positioned.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">At least one of the travel control units of a working vehicle of the above-described preferred embodiments has a structure of the first aspect of travel control unit of the working vehicle described above. Because of this, even when the acceleration operator is displaced on the low-velocity side by a non-operation or the like during travel of the vehicle, the displacement of the hydraulic motor is increased as the displacement of the hydraulic pump is reduced. Therefore, a rapid deceleration of the hydraulic motor can be reduced, and the rapid deceleration of the vehicle when the acceleration operator is displaced to the low-velocity side can be reduced.<!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --></p><p id="p0082" num="0082">At least one of the travel control units of a working vehicle of the above-described preferred embodiments has a structure of the second or third aspect of travel control unit of the working vehicle. Because of this, a travel starting performance of the working vehicle corresponding to the desires of the user can be more easily provided. For example, according to the second aspect of travel control unit of the working vehicle, when the travel control unit is equipped on a working vehicle, because the displacement of the hydraulic motor at the initial stage of starting to travel is always set at the maximum displacement regardless of the working state of the working implement or the like, a smooth travel starting performance can be obtained even when the operation of the acceleration operation is rapid. Therefore, when the user desires a constant smooth travel starting performance, a performance according to this desire can be provided. According to the third aspect of travel control unit of the working vehicle, when the working implement is driven, even if the operation of the acceleration operator is rapid, a smooth travel starting performance can be obtained, and when the working implement is not driven, the degree of increase of the vehicle velocity with respect to the operation of the acceleration operator can be increased and a quick travel starting performance can be obtained. Therefore, when the user desires a smooth travel starting performance in the work state and a quick travel starting performance in the non-work state, a performance corresponding to the desire can be provided.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982478" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A travel control unit of a working vehicle, comprising:
