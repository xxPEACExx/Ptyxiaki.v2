The disclosure of each priority application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006"> FIELD OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> [0002] The disclosed subject matter generally relates to plants and plant products and more specifically relates to Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. plants, plant products and methods of making and using extracts of such plants and plant products. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> [0003] Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. (TwHF) (Celastraceae), commonly known as Thunder god vine, is a perennial shrub indigenous to China and Southeast Asia. TwHF contains a number of chemical compounds that are toxic. Parts of the TwHF plant, such as the leaves, the stem, flowers, and the skin and/or bark of the roots are poisonous and may cause death if ingested. TwHF has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat diseases and disorders, but the uses are limited by the significant toxicity risk. Administration of TwHF has also been shown to inhibit interleukin-2-mediated immunosuppression. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Administration of a TwHF extract or its components, {i.e., triptolide and tripdiolide, compounds obtained from TwHF)), has been shown to inhibit interleukin-2 (IL-2). </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Purification of such compounds is costly and time-consuming, but necessary in view of the toxins. Use of less purified materials from the plant presents the risk that the benefits of therapy will be outweighed by the risks of deleterious consequences resulting from </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">administration of toxic substances. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> [0004] The inflammatory response is associated with invasion of a body by a foreign object or injury. On occasion, inflammatory responses, both acute and chronic, develop under circumstances where the body is not under true threat, and the inflammatory response itself becomes a condition or disorder requiring treatment. Analogously and closely aligned, the immune response wards off invasion by foreign objects, but that response also occurs under inappropriate circumstances, such as when there is no foreign object. A variety of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 disorders are characterized by inappropriate immune responses, exemplified by the various auto-immune disorders known to man. A continuing effort is being made to provide more effective and safer treatments for disorders involving inappropriate immune responses and/or inappropriate inflammatory responses. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> [0005] For the foregoing reasons, a need continues to exist in the art for compositions comprising the beneficial biologically active compounds of TwHF with an acceptably reduced presence of TwHF toxins, that are useful in preventing, mitigating, treating or ameliorating a symptom of an inappropriate inflammatory response and/or an inappropriate immune response. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> [0006] Described herein are improved methods for obtaining and processing extracts of the Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. (TwHF) plant that provide beneficial biologically active compounds with an acceptably reduced level of toxic substances that improves the safety profile. The methods yield natural products that provide the benefits of TwHF without undue risk of harming recipients that characterizes use of the native plant. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017"> [0007] In one aspect, described herein is a method of producing freeze-dried root portions from roots of the TwHF plant, wherein the method comprises placing a plurality of frozen TwHF root portions in a container within a freeze-drying chamber, wherein the root portions are sufficiently close in proximity to each other within the container to facilitate heat transfer, and wherein the chamber is at a temperature of -30°C or lower; lowering the air pressure within the chamber; and heating the container in an amount sufficient to sublimate the water in the root portions, thereby producing freeze-dried root portions of the TwHF plant. In one embodiment, the freeze-drying process is continued until the freeze-dried root portions contain no more than 20% (w/w) water. In another embodiment, the freeze-drying process is completed when the container temperature reaches a temperature of about 40°C. A freeze- dried root of a TwHF plant produced by a freeze-drying method described herein is also provided. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018"> [0008] In some embodiments, the roots are harvested from a TwHF plant that has been cultivated for less than 30 months. In some embodiments, the roots are harvested from TwHF var. Shiloh. It is desirable in some embodiments to process the roots of the TwHF plant into root portions of a specific, average, or maximal length. In some of these embodiments, the roots are processed into root portions of a length of 6 inches or less prior to 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 the start of the freeze-drying process. In some embodiments, the roots are processed to separate branched portions of a root into individual root portions, for example, substantially linear root portions of varying lengths. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019"> [0009] In some embodiments, the container is placed upon a heated support within the freeze-drying chamber. The support may be directly heated, but the disclosure also comprehends that the heating of the container comprises incrementally increasing the temperature of the heated support. The container can be of any size, shape and depth. In some embodiments, the container has a depth of no more than 2 inches. In some </p><p id="p0020" num="0020">embodiments, the heating of the container does not result in the heating of the freeze-drying chamber. In some embodiments, the container is a substantially planar shelf, e.g., a planar surface having a raised perimeter lip of 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2 inches (height) or any dimensions within the range of 0.125-2 inches, or a nominal height. </p><p id="p0021" num="0021"> [0010] In some embodiments, the root portions in the container are maintained at a temperature ranging from about 20°C to about 70°C. In one embodiment, the root portions in the container are maintained at a temperature of about 38°C. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022"> [0011] In another aspect, a method of producing freeze-dried debarked root portions (i.e., freeze-dried root cores) of a TwHF plant is also provided. In some embodiments, the method comprises separating the bark from the root core of a freeze-dried root portion, thereby producing a freeze-dried debarked root portion of a TwHF plant. In some embodiments, the separating step comprises applying mechanical force to the freeze-dried root portion in an amount effective to release the bark from the root core. In some embodiments, the method is optionally performed within an apparatus selected from the group consisting of a drum debarking device, a ring debarking device and a flail debarking device. </p><p id="p0023" num="0023"> [0012] The mechanical force may be produced by any means known in the art. In some embodiments, the mechanical force is produced by contacting a freeze-dried root portion with an abrading agent selected from the group consisting of a freeze-dried root portion, a metal object, a glass object, a wooden object, a ceramic object, rope, leather, sand, rock, cement, concrete, garnet, aluminum oxide, silicon oxide, fiber glass, diamond, an internal projection of a debarking drum, an even or uneven internal surface of a debarking drum, an even or uneven internal surface of a ring debarking device, a plurality of strands of a flail, or a plurality of objects attached to a plurality of strands of a flail. In one embodiment, the abrading agent is a magnetized metal object. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 [0013] In one embodiment, the method comprises use of an apparatus that is a drum debarking device and the abrading agent is a loose material present at a weight ratio of freeze-dried root portions to abrading agent of 1 :8. In another embodiment, the abrading agent is a loose material present at a weight ratio of freeze-dried root portions to abrading agent of 1 :2. In some embodiments, the freeze-dried root portions are tumbled with the abrading agent under vacuum for a time sufficient to release the bark from the freeze-dried root portion, wherein the released bark is removed by vacuum (e.g., through a port in the apparatus), thereby separating the bark from the root core. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024">[0014] Another aspect provides a freeze-dried debarked root portion of a TwHF plant produced by a method described herein. Some embodiments provide a freeze-dried root core of a TwHF plant, wherein the root core is substantially free of bark. In some embodiments, the root core contains no more than 5% (w/w) water. In some embodiments, the root core comprises less than 1% of the bark of a comparably dimensioned fresh root portion of a TwHF plant. In some embodiments, the lack of bark is determined by visual inspection, for example, a lack of pink/light red powder on a debarked portion of a TwHF plant is indicative of a lack of bark. </p><p id="p0025" num="0025">[0015] In some embodiments according to this aspect of the disclosure, the root core comprises no more than 10 % of a compound present in the bark of a TwHF plant. Such compounds (e.g., celastrol) can be used as markers to determine whether residual bark is present freeze-dried debarked root portions of T. wilfordii Hook F., or in extract preparations thereof. Thus, also described herein is a method of identifying residual bark in a preparation of a freeze-dried debarked root portion of a TwHF plant, wherein the method comprises determining the amount of a bark marker (e.g., celastrol) in the freeze-dried debarked root portion, wherein lower amounts of the marker (e.g., celastrol) in the freeze-dried debarked root portion preparation identifies the root portion preparation as containing lower amounts of residual bark. Those of skill in the art will recognize that a suitable threshold level for bark contamination of a root extract can vary depending on the nature of the extract and its intended use and, accordingly, the disclosure contemplates freeze-dried debarked root portions having no more than the threshold level of a bark marker such as celastrol, even if that threshold is greater than the measurable or detectable amount of the marker in the root portions. The amount of marker (e.g., celastrol) in the freeze-dried root portion preparation is determined by a method known in the art, such as NMR or HPLC. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 [0016] In some embodiments, a preparation of a freeze-dried debarked root portion comprises less than 10% celastrol compared to the amount of celastrol present in bark of a comparably dimensioned fresh root of a TwHF plant. In some embodiments, the freeze-dried debarked root portion preparation comprises less than 5% celastrol compared to the amount of celastrol present in bark of a comparably dimensioned fresh root of a TwHF plant. In other embodiments, the freeze-dried debarked root portion preparation comprise less than 1% celastrol compared to the amount of celastrol present in bark of comparably dimensioned fresh root of a TwHF plant. In still other embodiments, the freeze-dried debarked root portion preparations comprise less than 0.9%, 0.8%, 0.7%, 0.6%, 0.5%, 0.4%, 0.3%, 0.2% 0.1% or less celastrol compared to the amount of celastrol present in bark of a comparably dimensioned fresh root portion of a TwHF plant. </p><p id="p0026" num="0026"> [0017] Another aspect provided herein is an extract of a TwHF plant, optionally in the form of a freely flowable solid, that comprises no more than 2.5 μg of celastrol per mg of extract. In some embodiments, an extract of a TwHF plant having a ratio of (triptolide + tripdiolide)/celastrol of at least 1.36 is provided. In some embodiments, the ratio of </p><p id="p0027" num="0027">(triptolide + tripdiolide)/celastrol content in the TwHF extract is at least 1.46. </p><p id="p0028" num="0028"> [0018] Other aspects provided herein comprise methods of processing an extract, e.g., an alcoholic extract, of a TwHF plant into a freely flowable solid. One aspect provides a method that comprises obtaining an alcoholic extract of a TwHF plant, exchanging the alcohol in the alcoholic extract for a polar organic solvent such as ethyl acetate to form an extract/ethyl acetate mixture; combining the extract/ethyl acetate mixture with an excipient under vacuum at a temperature of no more than 50°C to produce a concentrated mixture; and drying the concentrated mixture at a temperature of no more than 55°C, thereby producing the alcoholic extract in the form of a freely flowable solid. In some embodiments, the extract is obtained by one or more ethanol extractions from the roots of a TwHF plant. In some embodiments, the root is a freeze-dried debarked root of the TwHF plant. In other embodiments, the root is a fresh debarked root of the TwHF plant. Processing an extract of a TwHF plant by a method described herein can be performed on an extract prepared from any T. wilfordii root or root preparation, including an extract prepared from a debarked T. wilfordii root. Moreover, such roots can be debarked by any means known in the art, and thus need not be debarked by any particular process, such as a process involving a drum debarking device, a ring debarking device or a flail debarking device, as described in some embodiments herein. For example, extracts produced from roots of a TwHF plant that have been debarked through the use of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
 compression rollers, peeling or other means of applying mechanical force are contemplated for practicing the extract processing methods described in the disclosure. In methods of freeze-drying T. wilfordii roots and root portions, in methods of preparing extracts from debarked roots and methods of processing existing T. wilfordii extracts, of course, no debarking process at all is needed or involved. </p><p id="p0029" num="0029"> [0019] In another aspect, the method comprises mixing a native TwHF plant extract with an alcohol to produce an extract/alcohol mixture; combining the extract/alcohol mixture with an excipient under vacuum at a temperature of no more than 50°C to produce a concentrated mixture; and drying the concentrated mixture at a temperature of no more than 55°C, thereby producing the extract in the form of a freely flowable solid. In some embodiments, the alcohol is ethanol. In some embodiments, the drying step is performed at a pressure of no more than 0.2 atmospheres (atm). </p><p id="p0030" num="0030"> [0020] Excipients suitable for use in the methods described herein include an excipient selected from the group consisting of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), maltodextrin, Aerosil<sup>®</sup> (fumed silica), corn starch, and Neusilin (magnesium aluminometasilicate).

 methods known in the art (e.g., alcoholic extractions of a TwHF plant without any further processing steps) are waxy, amorphous compositions (i.e., a form of native extract) with poor flow characteristics that require extraordinary means to manipulate and produce a useable drug product. The freely flowable solids produced by the processing methods described herein contain useful levels of extract compounds (e.g., triptolide and tripdiolide), and these extract compounds can be formulated into a drug product for the treatment of various disorders, including anti-inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. </p><p id="p0103" num="0103">I.

Extract is also used to refer to the drawn out material as it exists upon extraction or following subsequent manipulation, e.g., to produce a solid. Accordingly, the extract may be in the form of a solution, a mixture, a concentrate or an essence. Solid forms of the extracts are substantially free, and typically free, of fluid used in extraction, e.g. , a solvent. An extract is defined herein to include a single extract obtained from one or more extraction steps as well as an extract that is the combined product of a plurality or series of separate extractions, with each individual extraction comprising at least one extraction step. </p><p id="p0105" num="0105">[0076] The term "alcoholic extract of a TwHF plant" as used herein refers to material that is drawn out of a TwHF plant (e.g., a root portion of a TwHF plant) by one or more alcoholic extractions without being subjected to further processing steps including, for example, solvent exchange with a polar organic solvent (e.g., ethyl acetate) and/or isolation of solid particulates in the alcoholic extract. The alcoholic extract may be in the form of a solution, a mixture, a concentrate or an essence. Typically, the alcoholic extract is not a waxy, amorphous solid and does not contain a waxy, amorphous solid, but partial or complete removal of alcohol can produce an extract that is, or contains, a waxy, amorphous solid, referred to herein as one form of a native extract. </p><p id="p0106" num="0106">[0077] The term "native extract of a TwHF plant" as used herein includes an extract of the TwHF plant in the form of the waxy, amorphous solid that is produced by conventional methods known in the art. One form of the native extract, therefore, is an alcohol extract that is, or contains, a waxy, amorphous solid. Other alcoholic extracts of a TwHF plant are not

Methods of Freeze-Drying Roots of the TwHF plant. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="15"/>-->
 [0084] As demonstrated in the Examples provided herein, freeze-drying the roots or root portions of a TwHF plant prior to removing the bark allows for easy, quantitative removal of the bark compared to conventional methods. Freeze-drying is a dehydration process in which water is removed from the root of a TwHF plant without exposing the plant material to protracted periods of exposure to the potentially deleterious effects of liquid water and/or excessive heat. The freeze-drying process can be performed with any method known in the art as well as in any freeze-drying apparatus known in the art. </p><p id="p0114" num="0114"> [0085] One aspect of the disclosure provides a method of producing freeze-dried root portions from the roots of a TwHF plant, wherein the method comprises placing a plurality of frozen root portions in a container within a freeze-drying chamber, wherein the roots are sufficiently close in proximity to each other within the container to facilitate heat transfer; lowering the pressure within the chamber; and heating the container by an amount sufficient to sublimate the water in the root portions, thereby producing freeze-dried root portions of a TwHF plant. </p><p id="p0115" num="0115"> [0086] The first step of the freeze-drying process is the freezing of the root portions. The roots of the TwHF plant can grow to a length of up to 12 meters, which is too large to fit into most commercial freeze-drying chambers. Thus, in some embodiments, it is desirable to process or mill the roots of the TwHF plant prior to beginning the freeze-drying process in order to produce root portions of a more manageable size. The TwHF roots are processed to a desired length or range of lengths before or after freezing, but prior to freeze-drying. For example, in some embodiments, the roots of the TwHF plant are processed to produce root portions of a length of about 24 inches or less. In some embodiments, the roots of the TwHF plant are processed to produce root portions of a length of about 12 inches, about 11 inches, about 10 inches, about 9 inches, about 8 inches, about 7 inches, about 5 inches, about 4 inches, about 3 inches, about 2 inches, about 1 inch, about ½ inch, or less. In some embodiments, the roots of the TwHF plant are processed to produce root portions of a length of about 6 inches. </p><p id="p0116" num="0116"> [0087] In some embodiments, a root of the TwHF plant has a diameter of about ½ inch or less. In some embodiments, a root has a diameter of about 1/3 inch, ¼ inch, 1/8 inch, 1/16 inch or less. In other embodiments, a root of the TwHF plant has a diameter of about 1 inch or more. In one embodiment, the roots of the TwHF plant are processed to produce root portions of a length of about 6 inches and a diameter of about ½ inch. Typically, TwHF roots are not processed to alter the average diameter thereof, but the disclosure contemplates such 
<!-- EPO <DP n="16"/>-->
 processing using any conventional milling technique where reduced diameters and increased surface are desired (or at least not undesired) to more efficiently freeze-dry the preparation. Given that the roots or root portions are subject to extraction, various lengths and diameters of roots and root portions are acceptable, including ground, macerated or pulverized roots and root portions. </p><p id="p0117" num="0117"> [0088] In some embodiments, the roots of the of the TwHF plant are branched. In some embodiments, the branched roots of the TwHF plant are processed to separate the branched sections of the roots to produce substantially linear root portions. </p><p id="p0118" num="0118"> [0089] The root portions to be used in a freeze-drying process described herein are obtained from a TwHF plant of any age and origin. In some embodiments, the root portions are obtained from a Chinese-derived TwHF plant, and in some embodiments, the root portions are obtained from a United States-derived TwHF plant. In some embodiments, the root portions are obtained from TwHF var. Shiloh. The term "Chinese-derived TwHF plant" as used herein refers to a TwHF plant that is obtained from a Chinese source. This definition includes root portions harvested from a plant that is cultivated in China, roots portions harvested in the wild from a plant grown in China, and root portions harvested from a plant that is cultivated in a country other than China, but the plant is of Chinese origin (i.e., grown from a cutting (or a seed) of a Chinese TwHF plant). The term "United States-derived TwHF plant" as used herein refers to a TwHF plant that is obtained from a United States source. This definition includes root portions harvested from a plant that is cultivated in the United States, roots portions harvested in the wild from a plant grown in the United States, and root portions harvested from a plant that is cultivated in a country other than the United States, but the plant is of United States origin (i.e., grown from a cutting (or a seed) of a United States TwHF plant). </p><p id="p0119" num="0119"> [0090] Root portions are obtained from a TwHF plant of any age. In some embodiments, the root portions are obtained from a TwHF plant that is grown for less than about 30 months. In related embodiments, the root portions are obtained from a TwHF plant that is cultivated for about 29 months, 28 months, 27 months, 26 months, 25 months, 24 months, 23 months, 22 months, 21 months, 20 months, 19 months, 18 months, 17 months, 16 months, 15 months, 14 months 13 months, 12 months, 11 months, 10 months, 9 months, 8 months, 6 months or less.

In some embodiments, the freezing process is performed by placing the root portions in a container and placing the container in a dedicated freezing apparatus (i.e., a freezing apparatus that is separate from the freeze-drying chamber) overnight prior to beginning the freeze-drying process. The root portions are placed sufficiently close to each other within the container to facilitate heat transfer during the freeze-drying process. Preferably a root portion is in contact with at least one other root portion and/or with the container to facilitate heat transfer by conduction. The container may be composed of any material or materials, preferably conductive material(s). The container is of any shape or footprint compatible with the freeze-drying chamber. The container is any depth compatible with the internal dimensions of the freeze-drying chamber; in some embodiments, the container has a depth of no more than 2 inches, such as a depth in the range of about 0.125 to about 2 inches, or a nominal height. In some embodiments, a root portion is cooled below its eutectic point to ensure the absence of liquid-phase material, regardless of the pressure. </p><p id="p0121" num="0121">[0092] The use of any commercial freezing apparatus (e.g., freezer) that is capable of reducing the temperature of the root portions to a temperature ranging from -10°C to -70°C is specifically contemplated. In some embodiments, the temperature of the root portions is reduced to a temperature ranging from -20°C to about -70°C. In some embodiments, the temperature of the root portions is reduced to a temperature of about -20°C, -25°C, -30°C, -35°C, -40°C, -45°C, -50°C, -55°C, -60°C, -65°C or about -70°C. In some embodiments, the temperature of the root portions is reduced to a temperature of about -20°C. Once the roots have been frozen at the desired temperature, the container comprising the frozen root portions is placed in a freeze-drying chamber, the temperature of which is maintained at a temperature of about -20°C or lower. </p><p id="p0122" num="0122">[0093] In other embodiments, the freezing process is performed within the freeze-drying chamber without the use of a dedicated, distinct freezing apparatus. In such embodiments, the root portions are placed directly into the freeze-drying chamber and the temperature of the chamber is reduced to about -20°C or lower.

 [0094] Once the freeze-drying chamber has reached the desired temperature and the root portions have been placed in the freeze-drying chamber, the air pressure in the chamber is lowered in order for water within the root portions to sublimate. In some embodiments, heat is applied to the root portions to facilitate removal of water from the root portions. During this process, at least 50% of the water in the root portions is sublimated. In some </p><p id="p0123" num="0123">embodiments, at least about 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96&amp;, 97%, 98%, 99% or more of the water in the root portions is sublimated. In some embodiments, heat is applied to the root portions indirectly by incrementally increasing the temperature of the freeze-drying chamber from about 10°C to about 70°C, resulting radiant heating as well as some conduction heating of the root portions. In some embodiments, the temperature of the chamber is first increased to about 10°C and the temperature is stabilized at about 10°C overnight. The temperature of the chamber is then increased to about 35°C for about 8 hours and then increased to about 50°C for about 8 hours. At the end of the freeze-drying process, the final residual water content in the freeze-dried root portions is, in some embodiments, about 20% or lower. In some embodiments, the freeze-dried root portions contain no more than 15% water. In other embodiments, the freeze-dried root portions contain no more than 10% water. In other embodiments, the freeze-dried root portions contain no more than 5% water or less. In other embodiments, the freeze-dried root portions contain no more than 2% water or less. </p><p id="p0124" num="0124"> [0095] In other embodiments, the heat is applied directly to the root portions by </p><p id="p0125" num="0125">incrementally increasing the temperature of a support within the freeze-drying chamber from about 10°C to about 70°C, resulting in primarily, if not exclusively, conduction heating of the root portions. In some of these embodiments, frozen root portions are placed within a heat- conducting container upon a heated support within the freeze-drying chamber and the temperature of the heated support is increased incrementally. While the temperature of the freeze-drying chamber may increase as a byproduct of the heat supplied to the support within the chamber, the freeze-drying chamber itself is not being directly heated. In some embodiments, the temperature of the heated support is increased to about 10°C overnight and then increased (from about 20°C to about 40°C) again for about 6-12 hours and increased again (from about 30° to about 60°C for another 6-12 hours. The temperature of the root portions within the chamber is maintained at a temperature of about 38°C.

Although the freeze-drying chamber is typically not heated in the embodiments described immediately above, it is contemplated that TwHF root portions may be freeze-dried in a freeze-drying chamber that is heated in addition to heating a support for the container with the root portions. At the end of the freeze drying process, the final residual water content in the freeze-dried root portions is, in some embodiments, about 20% or lower. In some embodiments, the freeze-dried root portions contain no more than 15% water, no more than 10% water, no more than 5% water or less. </p><p id="p0126" num="0126"> [0096] The pressure of the freeze-drying chamber is controlled through the application of a vacuum. The vacuum is employed to facilitate sublimation. In some embodiments, the pressure within the freeze-drying chamber ranges from about 3 to about 10 millibar.

Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is contemplated that a thoroughly dried root portion of a TwHF plant prepared, for example, according to a freeze-drying method described herein, allows for more quantitative removal of bark from the root core. Extracts obtained from such freeze-dried debarked root cores are expected to contain considerably lower levels of toxic compounds (e.g., celastrol) compared to extracts obtained from root cores in which the bark has been removed by conventional methods without first being freeze-dried or obtained from root cores that are freeze-dried, but

Methods of Debarking the Roots of the TwHF Plant </p><p id="p0131" num="0131"> [00100] The aspect of the disclosure drawn to methods of debarking TwHF roots is distinct from such other aspects of the disclosure as methods of freeze-drying TwHF roots, methods of producing TwHF extracts, and methods of processing such extracts into a freely flowable solid. Nonetheless, these aspects of the disclosure are modular and are contemplated in various combinations, such as a method of producing an extract comprising a freeze-drying method, a debarking method, and an extract production method. </p><p id="p0132" num="0132"> [00101] Accordingly, another aspect of the disclosure is a method for removing the bark from the roots of a TwHF plant that is less labor-intensive than peeling the bark from the roots or cutting the bark from the roots with a debarking blade such as a machete, a knife or a vegetable peeler. These known methods are laborious and are not suited for commercial manufacturing. The methods described herein are suitable for translation to a commercial manufacturing environment and comprise separating the bark from the root core of a freeze- dried root portion, thereby producing a freeze-dried debarked root portion of a TwHF plant Although the debarking methods are contemplated as useful in debarking a TwHF plant part (e.g., root), the debarking methods disclosed herein are also contemplated as useful in debarking a plant part (e.g., root or stem) of a variety of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants having a bark that is desirably removed from the plant or plant portion. </p><p id="p0133" num="0133"> [00102] The bark of a freeze-dried root portion is separated from the root core by any means known in the art. For example, in some embodiments, separating the bark from the root core comprises mechanical disruption of the adhesion of the freeze-dried bark to the root core by mechanical force. In some embodiments, , the mechanical force is produced by contacting the freeze-dried root portion with a compression roller or other means of compressing the root portion. The mechanical force is produced, in some embodiments, by contacting the freeze-dried root portion with an abrading agent. Exemplary abrading agents include, but are not limited to, a freeze-dried root portion, a metal object, a glass object, a wooden object, a ceramic object, rope, leather, sand, rock, cement, concrete, garnet, fiber glass, aluminum oxide, silicon oxide, diamond, and any other abrading agent known in the art. In some embodiments, the abrading agent is a metal object such as a bolt, screw, nail or metal fragment. Such metal objects can be obtained from any hardware store. In one 
<!-- EPO <DP n="21"/>-->
 embodiment, the abrading agent is a bolt. In some embodiments, the bolt is at least 3 inches in length. In other embodiments, the bolt is less than 1 inch in length, such as a bolt that is a ½ inch or less in length. In one embodiment, the bolt is a ½ inch in length, with a 3/8 inch head.. </p><p id="p0134" num="0134"> [00103] The method of producing freeze-dried debarked roots can be performed in any suitable apparatus known in the art. In some embodiments, the apparatus is any suitably sized device comprising compression rollers, preferably wherein the amount of pressure applicable to the root portion is adjustable. In other embodiments, the apparatus is a device selected from the group consisting of a drum debarking device, a ring debarking device and a flail debarking device. In certain embodiments, the apparatus is a drum debarking device and the abrading agent is a loose material present at a weight ratio of abrading agent to freeze- dried root portions of 12: 1. In some embodiments, the weight ratio of abrading agent to freeze-dried root portions is 11: 1, 10: 1, 9: 1, 8: 1, 7: 1, 6: 1, 5: 1, 4: 1, 3: 1, 2: 1 or 1: 1. The weight ratio of abrading agent to freeze-dried root portions is dependent upon the size of the root portions and the density of the abrading agent and can be determined by one of skill in the art. In some embodiments, the abrading agent is not a separate agent, but rather an internal projection of a debarking drum, an even or uneven internal surface of a debarking drum, an even or uneven internal surface of a ring debarking device, a plurality of strands of a flail, or a plurality of objects attached to a plurality of strands of a flail. </p><p id="p0135" num="0135"> [00104] In some embodiments, the separating step comprises commingling the freeze- dried root portions with the abrading agent under vacuum for a time sufficient to release the bark from the freeze-dried root portion, wherein the released bark is removed through a port by vacuum, thereby separating the bark from the root core. In some embodiments, the freeze- dried root portions are tumbled with an abrading agent for at least 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 25 minutes, 30 minutes, 35 minutes, 40 minutes, 45 minutes, 50 minutes, 55 minutes, 1 hour, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 hours or more. </p><p id="p0136" num="0136"> [00105] Regardless of the apparatus or device used to remove the bark from the root portion, the debarking process is completed when the absence of bark on the root portions is apparent from visual inspection. Optionally, the duration of the debarking process is determined with an assay for a marker of TwHF root bark, such as celastrol, as described below. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="22"/>-->
 [00106] In some embodiments, the method further comprises separating the abrading agent from the debarked root portions. For separation of the abrading agent from the debarked root portions, it is desirable, in some embodiments, to utilize a magnetizable (e.g., ferromagnetic) metal object as the abrading agent. In such embodiments, once the debarking process is completed, the metal object is magnetically removed utilizing a magnet that is either inside or outside of the apparatus. In some embodiments, once the debarking process is completed, the tumbler is magnetized and the magnetizable metal objects remain in the tumbler while the debarked root portions are removed from the tumbler. </p><p id="p0137" num="0137"> [00107] Also provided herein is a freeze-dried debarked root portion of the TwHF plant, such as a T. wilfordii Hook F. var.

In some embodiments, the freeze-dried debarked root portion of the TwHF plant comprises less than 2% or less than 1% of the bark of a comparably dimensioned fresh root portion of a TwHF plant. The presence of bark can be determined visually or through the use of a bark marker as described below. In some embodiments, the freeze-dried root portion comprises less than 1% of the bark of a comparably dimensioned fresh root portion of a TwHF plant. In some embodiments, the freeze-dried debarked root portion comprises less than 0.9%, 0.8%, 0.7%, 0.6%, 0.5%, 0.4%, 0.3%, 0.2% 0.1% or less of the bark of a comparably dimensioned fresh root portion of a TwHF plant. </p><p id="p0138" num="0138"> [00108] Compounds present in the bark of a TwHF plant can be used as markers to determine whether a measurable amount of bark is present on the freeze-dried debarked root portions. Celastrol is a triterpenoid antioxidant compound that is present in the bark of a TwHF plant. Thus, in some embodiments, a method of identifying residual bark in a preparation of freeze-dried debarked root portions of a TwHF plant comprises determining the amount of a bark marker (e.g., celastrol) in the preparation of freeze-dried debarked root portions, wherein lower amounts of the marker in the preparation of freeze-dried debarked root portions identifies the preparation as containing lower amounts of residual bark. The amount of celastrol in the freeze-dried root portions can be determined by methods known in the art, such as NMR, HPLC or an Annexin V/PT staining assay (celastrol is an NF-κβ inhibitor). </p><p id="p0139" num="0139"> [00109] In some embodiments, the freeze-dried debarked root portions comprise less than 10% celastrol compared to the amount of celastrol present in bark of a comparably dimensioned fresh root portions of a TwHF plant.

Methods of producing an extract of a TwHF plant </p><p id="p0141" num="0141"> [00110] Methods of producing an extract from the roots of a TwHF plant are known in the art. Conventional extraction methods comprise grinding, milling or pulverizing plant material (e.g., debarked roots of a TwHF plant); extracting the plant material in a solution containing a sufficient amount of extractant fluid (e.g., an alcohol); and collecting the fluid to obtain an extract mixture (e.g., an alcoholic extract). The extract mixture may be further processed by removing solid matter from the extract mixture. Solid matter is removed from the extract by any method known in the art including, but not limited to, filtration and centrifugation. In some embodiments, the roots or root portions of the TwHF plant are debarked using the freeze-drying and debarking methods described herein. In other embodiments, the roots or root portions of the TwHF plant are fresh roots or portions that have been debarked using methods known in the art. </p><p id="p0142" num="0142">[00111] Grinding, milling or pulverizing debarked roots of a TwHF plant can be performed by any conventional milling process to increase the surface area of the root cores exposed to an extractant fluid. </p><p id="p0143" num="0143">[00112] In some embodiments, the extractant fluid for use in the extraction method is a solvent. Suitable extractant fluids include, but are not limited to, water, alcohols, aqueous solutions, halocarbons, esters and supercritical fluids. Suitable alcohols include primary alcohols such as ethanol, N-propanol, N-butanol, N-pentanol, N-hexanol, N-octanol, N- nonanol and N-decanol as well as secondary alcohols such as isopropanol, isobutanol, and the secondary alcohol derivatives of, e.g., any of butane through decane. For those lower molecular weight compounds that are gases at room temperature and about one atmosphere (atm), pressurized extractions in which the compounds are in a liquid state are contemplated. In one embodiment, the extractant fluid is ethanol. A benefit of incorporating an ethanolic fluid during the extraction process is that an ethanolic fluid is compatible with an ingestible product, and therefore is suitable for use in preparing an extract for incorporation into a pill, capsule, tablet, and other ingestible forms known in the art.

Concentrating the filtrate at a temperature of about 20°C, 25°C, 30°C, 35°C, 40°C, 45°C, 55°C, 60°C, 65°C, or 70°C is also contemplated. </p><p id="p0149" num="0149"> [00116] In some embodiments, solvent exchange is included in the extraction (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,294,443; 5,500,340; 5,580,562; 5,846,742; 5,916,564, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). In such embodiments, the extracting step comprises combining the concentrated filtrate with an excess (v/v) of a polar organic solvent (e.g., ethyl acetate) relative to original root mass to produce an extract mixture, which also may be concentrated as described above. The polar organic solvent (e.g. , ethyl acetate) is different from the alcohol solvent used to prepare the extract in the extracting step. This process is repeated until the solvent exchange reduces the extractant fluid concentration in the extract mixture to 15% or less by weight.

 [00128] In one aspect, the method comprises combining the native extract with a non- polar organic solvent to produce a mixture thereof; filtering the mixture to isolate or collect a solid precipitate and drying the solid precipitate, thereby producing an extract in the form of a freely flowable solid. Suitable non-polar organic solvents include any of the C4-C10 straight- or branched-chain alkanes and cycloalkanes. In some embodiments, the non-polar organic solvent is a straight-chain alkane such as pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane or decane. In some embodiments, the non-polar organic solvent is heptane. In other embodiments, the non-polar organic solvent is a branched-chain alkane, such as isopentane, isohexane, isoheptane, isooctane, isononane or isodecane. In some embodiments, the non- polar organic solvent is isooctane. </p><p id="p0164" num="0164"> [00129] In some embodiments, the non-polar organic solvent/extract mixture is filtered to isolate or collect solid precipitate material. Filtering the non-polar organic solvent/extract mixture can be performed by conventional methods known in the art. Once collected, the solids are subjected to one or more washes with a non-polar organic solvent. </p><p id="p0165" num="0165"> [00130] In another aspect, the method comprises mixing a native extract of a TwHF plant with a polar organic solvent (e.g., an alcohol) to produce an extract/polar organic solvent mixture; combining the extract/polar organic solvent mixture with an excipient under vacuum at a temperature of no more than 50°C to produce a concentrated mixture; and drying the concentrated mixture at a temperature suitable to remove remaining polar solvent from the mixture, thereby producing the native extract in the form of a freely flowable solid. Suitable polar organic solvents for use in this processing method include, but are not limited to, ethanol, ethyl acetate, isopropanol, n-butanol, n-propanol and methanol. In some </p><p id="p0166" num="0166">embodiments, the polar organic solvent is ethanol. </p><p id="p0167" num="0167"> [00131] In some embodiments, the adding step comprises incorporating an excess amount of an excipient (w/v), such as 0.5- to 20-fold, into the polar solvent/extract mixture and optionally stirring for a time sufficient to mix the excipient into the polar solvent/extract mixture to produce an excipient mixture. Mixing an excipient amount of about 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 11-, 12-, 13-, 14-, 15-, 16-, 17-, 18-, 19-fold excess (w/v) over the polar solvent/extract mixture is also contemplated. Suitable excipients for use in the methods described herein include microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), maltodextrin, Aerosil<sup>®</sup> (fumed silica), corn starch, and Neusilin (magnesium aluminometasilicate). In some embodiments, the excipient is MCC. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="29"/>-->
 [00132] In embodiments where an excipient is added to the organic solvent/extract mixture, no filtration step is performed. </p><p id="p0168" num="0168">[00133] The washed solids, or excipient mixture, are then dried for a time sufficient to remove the organic solvent from the solids, or excipient mixture, respectively. In some embodiments, the drying step is performed for a time period of about 8-24 hours. Drying the washed solids, or excipient mixture, for about 9 hours, 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours, 13 hours, 14 hours, 15 hours, 16 hours, 17 hours, 18 hours, 19 hours, 20 hours, 21 hours, 22 hours, 23 hours, 24 hours or more is specifically contemplated. Drying the washed solids, or excipient mixture, for less than 8 hours is also contemplated. The washed solids, or excipient mixture, can be dried in the air or in any drying apparatus known in the art including, but not limited to, a tray dryer, a vacuum oven or an oven. In some embodiments, the washed solids, or excipient mixture, are dried in a drying apparatus at a temperature of about 20°C, 25°C, 30°C, 35°C, 40°, 45°C or about 50°C. </p><p id="p0169" num="0169">VII.

The reduction in

 toxin content is achieved by preparing T. wilfordii roots and root portions in a manner that facilitates quantitative or near-quantitative bark removal in an efficient manner. More particularly, the TwHF roots and/or root portions are freeze-dried in preparation for debarking. </p><p id="p0186" num="0186"> [00145] A total of 308g of fresh TwHF root material (91g medium roots (3-10mm in length), 15g small (1.00-3.00 mm in length), 29g root hairs (1.00 or less in length), 30g stumps and 143g large roots (10.00 mm or larger in length)) were placed in Pyrex trays and frozen overnight at -20°C. The freeze-drying (Labconco) chamber was adjusted to -50°C and allowed to equalize overnight. The root material was then placed in the freeze-drying chamber and the vacuum was set to a pressure of 3-10 millibar. The chamber temperature was raised to 10°C for four hours, then raised to 25°C for an additional four hours, and then finally raised to 35°C for overnight. The resulting freeze-dried root material was removed from the freeze-drying chamber. </p><p id="p0187" num="0187"> [00146] Freeze-drying the root material caused cracking of the bark from the root core, which was observed upon visual inspection of the freeze-dried root material. To remove the bark, the freeze-dried root material was pressed or rolled with mild pressure on a flat surface or in a compression device (e.g., a pasta roller) to remove the bark from the root core. The process of removing the bark created a fine beige to pink dust/powder, which was attributed to the bark. Seventeen grams of dried debarked root material were obtained. </p><p id="p0188" num="0188"> [00147] The mild pressure did not pulverize the TwHF roots and/or root portions, and these materials were readily separable from any residual dust or powder, ensuring minimal bark toxins would be found in any subsequent root extract.

As with most freeze-drying methodologies, moreover, the length of time that the initially frozen TwHF root portions are exposed to the freeze-drying process may vary, provided that sufficient time is

 allowed to reduce the water content of the root portions to acceptable levels, e.g., less than 2%. </p><p id="p0191" num="0191"> Example 2 - An alternative method of preparing a freeze-dried roots of the TwHF plant. </p><p id="p0192" num="0192"> [00149] Consistent with the foregoing discussion and illustrative thereof, an alternative method of freeze-drying TwHF roots and/or root portions involves the use of a heated shelf upon which the root portions have been located. As those of skill in the freeze-drying art would appreciate, the freeze-drying of materials having dimensions sufficient to have water located a distance from any free surface of the material can benefit from relatively mild heating of the material to be freeze-dried (i.e., TwHF roots and/or root portions), without undermining the ability to effectively freeze-dry the material. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the mild heating promotes migration of the water from the interior of the substance to a surface where sublimation can, and does, take place. </p><p id="p0193" num="0193"> [00150] This Example describes one such alternative method of producing a freeze-dried root of a TwHF plant. Briefly, the temperature of the freeze-drying chamber (Labconco) was set to -20°C and allowed to equalize overnight. -1000 g fresh root material (-30 cm in length and -1-10 mm in diameter) was placed in a container and frozen overnight in a conventional freezer (Frigidaire) until the temperature of the roots was approximately -20°C. The next day, the container comprising the frozen roots was placed in a freeze-drying chamber upon a heated shelf and the pressure of the freeze-drying chamber was set to 3-10 millibars. The temperature of the heated shelf was increased to 10°C overnight, increased to 35°C for 8 hours, and then increased to 50°C for another 8 hours. The freeze-dried root portions were removed from the freeze-drying chamber. The freeze-dried root portions contained less than 20% water, as determined by loss on drying (LOD). </p><p id="p0194" num="0194"> [00151] The data provided in this Example establishes that mild heating of the TwHF root portions during the freeze-drying process is tolerated, resulting in production of freeze-dried TwHF root portions. It is believed that this approach to freeze-drying TwHF root portions provides a quicker, and similarly effective, method for freeze-drying TwHF root portions compared to freeze-drying in the absence of mild heating applied during the freeze-drying process. </p><p id="p0195" num="0195"> Example 3.

<!-- EPO <DP n="34"/>-->
 [00152] TwHF root portions debarked according to the disclosure provide a desirable substrate for extract preparation because the efficient and thorough debarking minimizes, or eliminates, bark toxins that can contaminate TwHF extracts. In addition to addressing the issue of toxins by providing improved debarking procedures, the disclosure provides processes for improving the flow characteristics of extracts prepared from the debarked TwHF root portions. This Example describes a method of producing a freely flowable solid from an extract of a TwHF plant using a non-polar organic fluid (e.g., hexane) as a coprocessing agent. </p><p id="p0196" num="0196"> [00153] Briefly, 10 g of the native extract obtained from debarked roots from Chinese TwHF plants (i.e., TwHF plant grown in China) were combined with 100 mL hexane (Fisher Reagent Grade) in a 250 mL beaker. A stainless steel spatula was used to break up the extract into pieces. The hexane/extract mixture was then sonicated for 30 minutes at room temperature. The hexane/extract mixture was then placed in a Buchner funnel, filtered and washed with 100 mL hexane to produce a filtrate (which was yellow/orange in color) comprising the hexane wash flow-through and a retentate (which was brown/red in color) comprising the solids in the hexane/extract mixture. The hexane/extract mixture was filtered until the retentate was dry. The retentate was then subjected to repeated washings with 100 mL hexane until a colorless filtrate was observed. The retentate was dried overnight in a vacuum oven (100 millibar, 40°C) to remove any residual hexane from the retentate. The dried retentate was in the form a freely flowable solid with a yield of 6.7g. </p><p id="p0197" num="0197"> [00154] To assess the scalability of the method to commercial quantities, the process was also applied to a larger quantity of the native extract. Fifty grams of an ethanol extract obtained from debarked roots of Chinese TwHF plants were combined with 250 mL hexane in a 500 mL beaker. Simple extracts of TwHF, such as the ethanol extract, are viscous, almost tar-like, amorphous masses that are difficult to manipulate. A stainless steel spatula was used to break up the extract into pieces. The hexane/extract mixture was then stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. The hexane/extract mixture was then placed in a Buchner funnel, filtered and washed with 100 mL hexane to produce a filtrate (which was </p><p id="p0198" num="0198">yellow/orange in color) comprising the hexane wash flow-through and a retentate (which was brown/red in color) comprising the solids in the hexane/extract mixture. The hexane/extract mixture was filtered until the retentate was dry. The retentate was then subjected to repeated washings with 100 mL hexane until a colorless filtrate was observed. The retentate was dried overnight in a vacuum oven (CascadeTek; 100 millibar) at room temperature to remove any 
<!-- EPO <DP n="35"/>-->
 residual hexane from the retentate. The dried retentate was in the form of a freely flowable solid with a yield of 35.5 g. The results established that the method would scale to commercially useful quantities. </p><p id="p0199" num="0199"> [0100] These results showed that a TwHF extract processed by exposure to a non-polar organic fluid such as hexane, would result in a TwHF extract that was a freely flowable solid amenable to manipulations to formulate the extract in forms suitable for nutritional supplementation or therapeutic treatment, including but not limited to such forms as capsules, tablets, gels, creams, and the like. It is expected that any C4-C10 straight-chain or branched- chain alkane or alkene will be suitable in processing TwHF extracts to yield freely flowable extract solids. </p><p id="p0200" num="0200"> Example 4.

The heptane/extract mixture was then placed in a Buchner funnel, filtered and washed with 100 mL heptane to produce a filtrate (which was yellow/light orange in color) comprising the heptane wash flow-through and a retentate comprising the solids in the heptane/extract mixture. The heptane/extract mixture was filtered until the retentate was dry. The retentate was then subjected to repeated washings with lOOmL heptane until a colorless filtrate was observed.

 The heptane/extract mixture was then stirred for about 20-30 minutes at room temperature until the extract had dissolved.

Freeze-dried debarked root portions of a TwHF plant were milled and then combined with 8 volumes of ethanol (approximately 4 L) relative to the mass of the root portions (approximately 500 g) and stirred at reflux (78°C) for 6 hours. The ethanol extract was then filtered to produce a first filtrate and moved to a holding tank. The debarked and milled root portions were then combined with an additional 8 volumes of ethanol in a second ethanol extraction and stirred at reflux (78°C) for 6 hours. The second ethanol extract was filtered to produce a second filtrate. The first and second filtrates were combined and then concentrated under vacuum to produce a concentrated filtrate.

The ethyl acetate mixture was then combined with an appropriate amount of an excipient (compared to the total solid content in the ethyl acetate mixture) and mixed thoroughly. The ethyl acetate/excipient mixture was then concentrated under full vacuum at a temperature not to exceed 55°C until a dry solids content of approximately 80% was achieved in the ethyl acetate/excipient mixture.
