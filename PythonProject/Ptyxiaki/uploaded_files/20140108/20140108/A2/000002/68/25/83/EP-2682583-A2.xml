The individual components of secondary systems can operate in a temperature range that is much smaller than the temperature range for other types of systems. Some secondary system components have lower high-temperature limits and/or higher low-temperature limits than other machine systems. As a result, machines with secondary systems sometimes benefit from cooling systems to regulate the temperature of the machine components within the operational temperature range of the components.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Prior machines with secondary systems have used a separate cooling circuit for the secondary system components and the engine. Separate cooling systems for the engine and secondary system can result in increased costs and can use large amounts of space within a machine. Additionally, in some environmental conditions, such as in cold climates, the cooling circuit for the secondary system may not have the ability on its own to warm the secondary systems to their low-temperature limit.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary</u></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The disclosure describes, in one aspect, a machine including an engine cooling system, a secondary system with a low-temperature limit, and a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> secondary cooling system operatively associated with the secondary system.

The machine 100 includes an engine 102, a secondary system 104, an engine cooling system 106, and a secondary cooling system 108. The engine cooling system 106 is operatively associated with the engine 102, that is, the engine cooling system 106 provides coolant to the engine 102 to regulate engine temperature. The illustrated engine cooling system 106 includes an engine system pump 114 that pumps coolant through at least one engine system coolant line 110, through the engine 102, and through an engine system radiator 112. The engine cooling system 106 can have more or fewer components depending on system design.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The engine cooling system 106 further includes a control valve 116. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the control valve 116 is in a closed position. The engine system pump 114 pumps coolant through the engine 102, where heat from the engine 102 is transferred to the coolant. When the control valve 116 is in the closed position, the coolant then passes through the control valve 116, then passes through the engine system radiator 112, where some heat from the coolant dissipates. The coolant then continues through the engine system pump 114 to be pumped into the engine 102 and complete the cycle. This cooling cycle continues at least while the engine 102 is operating and the control valve 116 is in the closed position.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The secondary system 104 is operatively associated with the secondary cooling system 108, which provides coolant to regulate the secondary system component temperature. The secondary system 104 can be any of a variety of systems including hybrid electric systems, other hybrid systems, transmission systems, hydraulic pumps, etc. Similar to the engine cooling system 106, the secondary cooling system 108 has secondary system coolant lines 118 that carry coolant to and/or through the secondary system 104, and to and/or through other components of the secondary cooling system, such as the secondary system radiator 120, and the secondary system pump 122. The secondary cooling system 108 can have more or fewer components, depending on system design.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In accordance with the disclosure, the machine 100 further includes a control valve 116 disposed between the engine cooling system 106, and the secondary cooling system 108. As illustrated in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, when the control valve 116 is in a closed position, each of the engine cooling system 106 and the secondary cooling system 108 operate separately, the respective pumps 114, 122 circulating coolant through the respective lines 110, 118, to/through the components associated with the respective systems 106, 108.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">That is, the engine system pump 114 pumps coolant through the engine 102, where heat from the engine 102 is transferred to the coolant. The coolant then passes through the control valve 116, then passes through the engine system radiator 112, where some heat from the coolant dissipates. The coolant then continues through the engine system pump 114 to be pumped into the engine 102 and complete the cycle. This cooling cycle continues at least while the engine 102 is operating and the control valve 116 is in the closed position.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Similarly, when the control valve 116 is in the closed position, the secondary system pump 122 pumps coolant through control valve 116 and to/through the secondary system 104. If the temperature of the secondary system 104 is higher than the coolant temperature, heat is transferred from the secondary<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> system 104 into the coolant. If the temperature of the coolant is higher than the temperature of the secondary system 104, heat is transferred from the coolant to the secondary system 104. The coolant then passes through the secondary system radiator 120, where heat can dissipate from the coolant.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The direction of coolant flow in both the secondary cooling system 108 and the engine cooling system 106 is indicated by arrows in the figures, but other suitable flow directions and component designs are contemplated. Additionally, the positions of components illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> for both the engine cooling system 106 and the secondary cooling system 108 represent just one example of possible component positioning; however, other component positioning in each system is contemplated herein.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The control valve 116 may alternately be utilized to establish fluid communication between the engine cooling system 106 and the secondary cooling system 108, depending upon identified temperature characteristics. The operative position of the control valve 116 may be established based upon, for example, environmental conditions, standardized timeframes, specified operating temperature ranges of components within the secondary cooling system 108, the temperature of components within the secondary system 104, and/or temperatures of the respective coolants flowing within the engine cooling system 106 and the secondary cooling system 108. Any appropriate arrangement may be provided for measurement of temperatures.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As shown in the embodiment in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, an engine system temperature sensor 126 is operatively associated with the engine cooling system 106 such that the engine system temperature sensor 126 can sense the temperature of the coolant running through the engine cooling system 106. In other embodiments, the engine cooling system 106 can have any number of temperature sensors, including no temperature sensors whatsoever.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The illustrated embodiment further includes a first secondary system temperature sensor 128 and a second secondary system temperature<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> sensor 130, both operatively associated with the secondary cooling system 108. The first secondary system temperature sensor 128 is adapted to sense coolant temperature at a point before the coolant enters the secondary system 104, while the second secondary system temperature sensor 130 is adapted to sense the coolant temperature after the coolant exits the secondary system. Though <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> shows the first and second secondary system temperature sensors 128, 130 operatively connected to the secondary system coolant lines 118 before and after the secondary system 104, any number of sensors can be used and can be in different locations in the secondary cooling system 108. In some embodiments, only one secondary system temperature sensor is used.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the embodiment in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, engine system temperature sensor 126, the first secondary system temperature sensor 128, the second secondary system temperature sensor 130, and the control valve 116 are all operatively connected to a controller 124. The temperature sensors 126, 128, 130 are all adapted to send signals indicative of the coolant temperature at the sensor location to the controller 124. The controller 124 is adapted to receive the signals from the temperature sensors 126, 128, 130 and compare the sensor temperatures to one another and to predetermined high- and low-temperature limits of the secondary system.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In one embodiment, if the controller 124 determines that the temperature of the secondary cooling system 108 from either the first or second secondary system temperature sensors 128, 130 is below the low-temperature limit of the secondary system, the controller commands the control valve 116 to move from the closed position into an open position. The embodiment of the control valve 116 shown in the figures is simply for illustrative purposes, and many variations of control valves are contemplated. When the control valve 116 is in the open position, as is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the engine cooling system 106 and the secondary cooling system 108 are in fluid communication with one another, allowing coolant to pass between the engine cooling system to the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> secondary cooling system through the control valve. In the open configuration shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, hot coolant from the engine cooling system 106 flows into the secondary system 104 and dissipates heat into the secondary system 104. As the heat dissipates, the temperature of the secondary system 104 increases. The coolant then continues through the secondary system radiator 120 and through the secondary system pump 122. The coolant then flows back through the control valve 116 and into the engine cooling system 106, where it passes through the engine system radiator 112, the engine system pump 114, and then back through the engine 102. The coolant absorbs heat from the engine 102 and continues around the entire circuit as long as the control valve 116 remains in an open position. As the temperature of the secondary system 104 increases, less heat dissipates from the coolant into the secondary system 104, which increases the coolant temperature in the secondary cooling system 108 at points after the coolant has passed through the secondary system 104. In such an embodiment, the controller 124 is adapted to command the control valve 116 to move from the open position to the closed position when the controller 124 that an increased secondary coolant temperature is no longer required. For example, the controller 124 may cause the control valve 116 to move to a closed position when it is determined that the temperature of the secondary cooling system 108 sensed by either the first or second secondary system temperature sensor 128, 130 exceeds a predetermined temperature above the low-temperature limit.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In another embodiment, the controller 124 is adapted to command the control valve 116 to move from the closed position to the open position when the controller 116 determines that the temperature of the secondary cooling system 108 as sensed by the first secondary system temperature sensor 128 is lower than a predetermined low-temperature limit. In such an embodiment, the controller 124 is also adapted to move the control valve 116 to the closed position when it determines that the temperature of the secondary cooling system 108 as<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> sensed by the second secondary system temperature sensor 130 exceeds a predetermined temperature above the low-temperature limit.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In yet another embodiment, the controller 124 is adapted to command the control valve 116 to move from an closed position to an open position when the controller determines that the temperature in the secondary cooling system 108 as sensed by the first secondary system temperature sensor 128 is lower than the low-temperature limit of the secondary system 104 and the temperature of the engine cooling system 106 as sensed by the engine system temperature sensor 126 is higher than the low-temperature limit of the secondary system. In this embodiment, the controller 124 may leave the engine cooling system 106 separate from the secondary cooling system 108 if the coolant in the engine cooling system 106 would not cause an increase in the temperature of the secondary system 104 such that it would exceed the low-temperature limit. With the engine cooling system 106 separated from the secondary cooling system 108, the coolant in the engine system 106 can increase in temperature more quickly by absorbing heat from the operating engine 102 than when the coolant flows through both cooling systems 106, 108. When the coolant in the engine cooling system 106 reaches a temperature that exceeds the low-temperature limit of the secondary system 104, the controller 124 causes the control valve 116 to open. This allows the relatively hot coolant from the engine cooling system 106 to flow into the secondary system 104, increasing the temperature of the secondary system 104.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the integrated cooling system 101 that includes a bypass system 200. The bypass system 200 includes a first bypass valve 202, a second bypass valve 204, and bypass coolant lines 206 that carry coolant through the bypass system. The first bypass valve 202 and the second bypass valve 204 are both operatively connected to the controller 124. The controller 124 is adapted to command the first bypass valve 202 to selectively move between an engine system position and a bypass system<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> position. In the bypass system position, the first bypass valve 202 allows fluid communication between the engine cooling system 106 and the bypass system 200. In the engine system position, the first bypass valve 202 does not allow fluid communication between the engine cooling system 106 and the bypass system 200. The controller 124 is also adapted to command the second bypass valve 204 to selectively move between a bypass position and a secondary system position. In the bypass system position, the second bypass valve 204 allows fluid communication between the bypass system 200 and the secondary cooling system 108. In the secondary cooling system position, the second bypass valve 204 does not allow fluid communication between the bypass system 200 and the secondary cooling system 108.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the controller 124 can command the first bypass valve 202 and the second bypass valve 204 to move to their respective bypass system positions when the controller commands the control valve 116 to move from a closed position to an open position. In <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the first and second bypass valves 202, 204 are shown in the bypass system position and the control valve 116 is shown in the open position. In such a configuration, fluid communication is established between the engine cooling system 106, the secondary cooling system 108, and the bypass system 200. The engine system pump 114 pumps coolant through the engine 102, through the control valve 116 into the secondary cooling system 108, through the secondary system 104, through the second bypass valve 204, through the bypass system 200, and back into the engine cooling system 106 through the first bypass valve 202.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">It is contemplated that the secondary system pump 122 can be positioned on the secondary system coolant lines 118 between the control valve 116 and the second bypass valve 204, such that the secondary system pump can pump the coolant through the bypass system 200. Alternatively, it is contemplated that a bypass pump (not shown), or any other pump, could be<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> positioned in the bypass system 200 to pump coolant through the bypass system, the engine cooling system 106, and the secondary cooling system 108. In embodiments such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the coolant can bypass several components in the secondary cooling system 108 and the engine cooling system 106 after transferring heat to the secondary system 104. Depending on the particular system design, the coolant can bypass the secondary system radiator 120, the secondary system pump 122, the engine system radiator 112, and the engine system pump 114. Bypassing these components can increase the speed in which coolant from the engine 102 raises the temperature of the secondary system 104 because the coolant has less distance to travel to re-enter the engine 102 and absorb engine heat for transfer to the secondary system 104.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates one method of implementing the integrated cooling system 101 disclosed herein. In the illustrated method, the first secondary system temperature sensor 128 located upstream from the secondary system 104 senses the temperature of the secondary cooling system 108 and sends a signal to the controller 124 indicative of that temperature. The controller 124 compares the sensed temperature of the secondary cooling system 108 to the low-temperature limit of the secondary system 104. If the temperature of the secondary cooling system 108 is above the temperature of the low-temperature limit of the secondary system 104, the controller 124 makes no adjustment to the control valve 116 and the first secondary system temperature sensor 128 continues to send signals to the controller indicative of the secondary cooling system 108 temperature.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">If the sensed temperature of the secondary cooling system 108 is below the low-temperature limit of the secondary system 104, the controller 124 commands the control valve 116 to move from the closed position to the open position to allow fluid communication between the engine cooling system 106 and the secondary cooling system 108. While the control valve 116 is in the open position, the second secondary system temperature sensor 130 located<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> downstream from the secondary system 104 senses the temperature of the secondary cooling system 108 and sends a signal to the controller 124 indicative of the sensed temperature. The controller 124 compares the sensed temperature of the secondary cooling system 108 to the low-temperature limit of the secondary system 104. If the sensed temperature of the secondary cooling system 108 is below the low-temperature limit of the secondary system 104, the controller 124 does nothing and the control valve 116 remains in the open position. If the controller 124 determines that the sensed temperature of the secondary cooling system 108 exceeds the low-temperature limit of the secondary system 104, then the controller 124 commands the control valve 116 to move from the open position to the closed position, disallowing fluid communication between the engine cooling system 106 and the secondary cooling system 108. In some embodiments, the controller 124 will move the control valve 116 from the open position to the closed position only if the sensed temperature of the secondary cooling system 108 exceeds a predetermined temperature above the low-temperature limit of the secondary system 104.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates another method of implementing the integrated cooling system 101 disclosed herein.

The controller 124 compares the sensed temperature of the secondary cooling system 108 and the sensed temperature of the engine cooling system 106 to the low-temperature limit of the secondary system 104.

With the control valve 116 in the open position, the engine cooling system 106 fluidly communicates with the secondary cooling system 108. When the control valve 116 in the open position, the second secondary system temperature sensor 130 sends a signal to the controller 124 indicative of the temperature of the secondary cooling system 108. The controller 124 compares the sensed temperature of the secondary cooling system 108 to the low-temperature limit of the secondary system 104.
