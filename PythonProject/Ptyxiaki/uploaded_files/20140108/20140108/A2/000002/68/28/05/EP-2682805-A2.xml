Particularly, in recent several years, display devices, such as TVs, which are home appliances mainly used in general home, have been developed at high speed.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As the performances of display devices have been advanced, the kinds of content that are displayed on the display device have also been increased. In particular, stereoscopic 3D display systems which can display even 3D content have recently been developed and spread.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">3D display devices may be implemented by not only 3D TVs used in general home but also diverse types of display devices, such as monitors, mobile phones, PDAs, set-top PCs, tablet PCs, digital photo frames, and kiosk. Further, 3D display technology may be used not only for home use but also in diverse fields that require 3D imaging, such as science, medicine, design, education, advertisement, and computer games.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The 3D display system is briefly classified into a non-glasses type system that is viewable without glasses and a glasses type system that is viewable through wearing of glasses. The glasses type system can provide a satisfactory 3D effect, but a viewer should wear glasses to cause inconvenience. By contrast, the non-glasses type system has the advantage that the viewer can view a 3D image without glasses, and development of such a non-glasses type system has been continuously discussed.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a view illustrating the configuration of a non-glasses type 3D display device in the related art. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the 3D display device in the related art includes a backlight unit 10, an image panel 20, and a parallax portion 30.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The parallax portion may include a slit array of opaque shield that is known as a parallax barrier or a lenticular lens array. In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the parallax portion is implemented by a lenticular lens array.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the image panel 20 includes a plurality of pixels that are grouped into a plurality of columns. An image at a different viewpoint is arranged for each column. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a plurality of images 1, 2, 3, and 4 at different viewpoints are repeatedly arranged in order. That is, the respective pixel columns are arranged as numbered groups 1, 2, 3, and 4. A graphic signal that is applied to the panel is arranged in a manner that pixel column 1 displays a first image, and pixel column 2 displays a second image.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The backlight unit 10 provides light to the image panel 20. By light that is provided from the backlight unit 10, images 1, 2, 3, and 4, which are formed on the image panel 20, are projected onto the parallax portion 30, and the parallax portion 30 distributes the respective projected images 1, 2, 3, and 4 and transfers the distributed images in a direction toward the viewer. That is, the parallax portion 30 generates exit pupils at the viewer's position, that is, at a viewing distance. The thickness and diameter of a lenticular lens in the case where the parallax portion is implemented by the lenticular lens array and the slit spacing in the case where the parallax portion is implemented by the parallax barrier may be designed so that the exit pupils that are generated by the respective columns are separated in an average inter-pupillary distance of less than 65 mm. The separated image lights form respectively viewing areas. That is, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, viewing areas 1, 2, 3, and 4 are formed.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In this state, if the user's left eye 51 is positioned in the viewing area 3 and the right eye 52 is positioned in the viewing area 2, the user can feel the 3D effect even without special glasses.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">However, in the 3D display device in the related art, since a plurality of images are separated by vertical columns to be displayed, the vertical resolution is maintained as it is, but the horizontal resolution is greatly reduced. For example, in the case where an XGA<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> panel having 1024x 768 resolution is applied to a 4-viewpoint 3D display device, the resolution becomes 256x768. As a result, the display has a full panel resolution in the vertical direction, but has 1/4 resolution in the horizontal direction.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In order to solve this problem, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="USP6118584A"><text>USP 6,118,584</text></patcit> discloses that a loss of resolution between vertical and horizontal resolutions is dispersed through changing the pixel arrangement. However, this technology has the problem that an LCD panel in the related art having a general pixel arrangement is unable to be used for such technology.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Another method to solve the above-described problem is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="USP6064424A"><text>USP 6,064,424</text></patcit>. According to this method, however, due to the difference in arrangement between the pixel columns and the lenticular, light emitted from other pixels overlap each other, and crosstalk occurs between the images. "Crosstalk" means a phenomenon that the (N+1)-th or (N-1)-th image is mixed and shown through the user's right or left eye in addition to the N-th image. In this case, the same object is shown in other views, and if the crosstalk occurs, several contours of the object appear with blurring. Accordingly, if the crosstalk is increased, the picture quality is deteriorated.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to the related art as described above, it is unable to effectively solve the above-described problem of the deterioration of the horizontal resolution.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>DISCLOSURE</b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b>TECHNICAL PROBLEM</b></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">The present disclosure has been made to address the above problems.

A multi-viewpoint image display device of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a device that performs a stereoscopic display in a non-glasses method. The multi-viewpoint image display device of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> may be implemented by various types of display devices, such as TVs, monitors, mobile phones, PDAs, set-top PCs, tablet PCs, digital photo frames, and kiosk.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the multi-viewpoint image display device includes a backlight unit 110, a mask portion 120, an image panel 130, and a parallax portion 140.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The backlight unit 110 provides light in the direction of the image panel 130. The backlight unit 110 is divided into a direct type and an edge type depending on where light emitting elements are positioned. According to the direct type, the light emitting elements are uniformly arranged on the rear surface of the image panel 130 to directly emit light to the image panel 130. By contrast, according to the edge type, the light emitting elements are arranged on the edge side of the image panel 130 to reflect light in the direction of the image panel 130 using a light guide plate.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The backlight unit 110 may be a general backlight unit that is typically applied to the LCD panel or a color sequential backlight unit that is applied to an FSC (Field Sequential Color) LCD display. That is, the kind of the backlight unit 110 may differ depending on the kind of the image panel 130.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The image panel 130 includes a plurality of pixels arranged in a plurality of rows and columns. The image panel 130 may be implemented by an LCD panel, and each of the plurality of pixels may be implemented by a liquid crystal cell. If light generated from the backlight unit 110 is incident to the respective pixels of the image panel 130, the image panel 130 adjusts the transmission rate of the light incident to the pixels in accordance with an image signal, and displays an image. Specifically, the image panel 130 includes a liquid crystal layer and two electrodes that are formed on both surfaces of the liquid crystal layer. If<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> a voltage is applied to the two electrodes, an electric field is generated to move molecules of the liquid crystal layer, and thus the transmission rate of the light is adjusted. The image panel 130 divides the respective pixels by columns, and drives the respective pixel columns so that different viewpoint images are displayed for the respective columns.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The image panel 130 may be a general panel having with a color filter, or a panel that operates in an FSC (Field Sequential Color) driving method. The FSC driving method may be differently called a field sequential method or a color sequential driving method. The FSC driving method is a method of temporarily dividing R, G, and B lights and sequentially projecting the divided lights without using the color filter.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The parallax portion 140 is arranged in front of the image panel 130 to disperse the light that is emitted from the image panel 130 to viewing areas. Accordingly, light that corresponds to different viewpoint image by viewing areas is emitted. The parallax portion 140 may be implemented by a parallax barrier or a lenticular lens array. The parallax barrier is implemented by a transparent slit array including a plurality of barrier areas. Accordingly, the parallax barrier operates to emit different viewpoint image lights by viewing areas through blocking of the light through the slits between the barrier areas. The width and pitch of the slit may be differently designed depending on the number of viewpoint images included in the multi-viewpoint image and the viewing distance. The lenticular lens array includes a plurality of lens areas. Each lens area is formed with a size that corresponds to at least one pixel column, and differently disperses the light transmitting the pixels of the respective pixel columns by viewing areas. Each lens area may include a circular lens. The pitch and the curvature radius of the lens may be differently designed depending on the number of viewpoint images and the viewing distance.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> illustrates the parallax portion 140 that is implemented by a lenticular lens array, but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The parallax portion 140 is arranged to coincide with the column direction of the respective pixels provided on the image pixel 130.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The mask portion 120 partially masks the respective pixels of the image panel 130. Specifically, the mask portion 120 is arranged between the backlight unit 110 and the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> image panel 130 to partially block the light incident to the respective pixels. The mask portion 120 is divided into a plurality of mask areas.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The mask portion 120 may be arranged as close as possible to the rear surface of the image panel 130. The mask portion 120 may be formed on the rear surface of the image panel 130 or may be arranged on the rear surface side of the image panel 130 in a state where the mask portion 120 is formed on a separate substrate. The light-transmitting area may be made through etching of a layer of an opaque material, such as metal, laminated on a glass substrate. The mask portion 120 does not serve as a parallax barrier.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The mask portion 120 may be implemented to have various shapes depending on the embodiments.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Through the mask portion 120, the parallax portion 140 may provide selective viewing of the respective pixels. That is, the mask portion 120 makes the light that corresponds to a part of different viewpoint images be emitted to the side of the parallax portion 140 through partially masking the plurality of pixels that belong to the same column on the image panel 130. The parallax portion 140 provides an image which is focused on a position that is apart for a predetermined distance so-called a viewing distance. The position where the image is formed is called a viewing area. In <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, four viewing areas 1, 2, 3, and 4 are illustrated. Accordingly, if the user's left eye 51 is positioned in the viewing area 2 and the right eye 52 is positioned in the viewing area 3, the user can feel the 3D effect. By contrast, the eye that is positioned in the viewing area 3 can view the image displayed at number 2, but is unable to view other images. The eye has similar characteristics in other viewing areas. On the other hand, since the parallax portion 140 is arranged along the column direction, it is unable to exert an influence in the vertical direction, and the viewing area is extended in the horizontal direction. Since the parallax portion 140 is arranged along the pixel columns of the image panel 130, left and right crosstalk does not occur in the display device.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046"><figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006">Figs. 3 to 6</figref> are views illustrating various configuration examples of the mask portion.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0047" num="0047"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> indicates the configuration of the mask portion 120, and corresponding image panel 130 and parallax portion 140. As illustrated, the mask portion 120 includes a plurality of mask areas that are arranged in a plurality of rows H1, H2, H3, and H4 and columns V1 to V6. Each mask area includes a light-transmitting area and a light-blocking area. According to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, each mask area is divided in the vertical direction, and thus is divided into the light-transmitting area and the light-blocking area. Further, the light-blocking area is arranged in zigzag with respect to the pixels arranged in the row direction. Specifically, in the mask area that is positioned at row 1 and column 1, the light-transmitting area 1a is arranged on the left side, and the light-blocking area 1b is arranged on the right side. In the mask area positioned at row 2 and column 1, the light-transmitting area 2a is arranged on the right side, and the light-blocking area 1b is arranged on the left side. In <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the light-blocking area 1b or 2b of the mask portion 120 has a size of one half of the corresponding pixel, and the light-transmitting area 1a or 2a has a size of the other half of the corresponding pixel.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the image panel operates according to the configuration of the mask portion 120. According to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, in the image panel 120, four pixels p1, p2, p3, and p4 that are positioned in 2x2 matrix indicate different viewpoint images. Each pixel corresponds to the size of one mask area. Further, each lens area of the parallax portion 140 that is implemented by the lenticular lens array has a size that corresponds to two pixel columns V1&amp;V2, V3&amp;V4, and the like. As illustrated as <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the image panel 130 displays a multi-viewpoint image through combining the plurality of pixels included in the plurality of continuous rows and columns. According to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, four pixels included in two rows and two columns display images of 1, 2, 3, and 4 viewpoints. In this case, the right half area of the pixels P 1 and P2 of row 1 is masked, and the left half area, and the left half area of the pixels P3 and P4 of row 2 is masked. Accordingly, the light corresponding to the image is emitted through the non-masked areas in the respective pixels. The non-masked areas appear to be arranged in the order of a checker board. That is, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, four pixel light bundles are formed in the viewing area.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0049" num="0049"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> illustrates another configuration example of the mask portion.

Each mask area includes a light-transmitting area and a light-blocking area. According to <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, each mask area of the mask portion 120 is divided in the vertical direction, and thus is divided into light-transmitting areas 1a and 2a and light-blocking areas 1b and 2b. Further, the light-blocking areas are arranged in zigzag with respect to the pixels arranged in the row direction. Further, the positions of the light-blocking areas differ by columns. That is, as illustrated as <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, the direction of the zigzag arrangement of the light-blocking areas may be reversed for the respective columns of the mask areas. Accordingly, in the column V1, the light-blocking areas are arranged in the order of right, left, right, and left, and in the column V2, the light-blocking areas are arranged in the order of left, right, left, and right.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, image panel 120 operates according to the configuration of the mask portion 120 as shown as <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>. According to <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, images of 1, 2, 3, and 4, viewpoints are displayed by four pixels P1, P2, P3, and P4 dispersed and arranged at row 2 and column 2.

In the mask area, the light-transmitting areas 1a, 2a, and 3a are formed in a diagonal direction, and the light-blocking areas 1b, 2b, and 3b are formed in the remaining areas.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, at least two mask areas that are arranged one by one in the row direction among the plurality of mask areas are connected in a diagonal direction. That is, the light-transmitting areas 2a and 3a at row 1 and columns 2 and 3 are connected to each other, and the light-transmitting areas at the next row and the row after next are connected to each other.

As described above, for example, in order to display four views on the image panel 130, the panel is divided in the unit of 2x2 pixels in the vertical direction. Two upper pixels belong to view 1 and view 3, and two lower pixels belong to view 2 and view 4. The mask portion 120 partially masks the respective pixels. As a result, parts of four pixels are dispersed without overlapping. The lenticular lens array disperses the light emitted from the parts of the pixels. As illustrated, the viewing areas are illustrated in the form of four<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> rectangles which are numbered as 1 to 4. As a result, if the original resolution of the panel is 1024x768 (XGA), each of four views may be displayed with the resolution of 512×384. That is, reduction of the resolution is dispersed to the vertical resolution and the horizontal resolution. Further, since the lenticular lenses are arranged along the pixel columns and the illuminated half pixel area does not overlap vertical projection, no interference occurs between the respective views.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">As described above, the parallax portion 140 may be implemented by a parallax barrier. The parallax barrier may have a structure in which the plurality of barrier areas are arranged in the column direction.

Since the operation in the embodiment where the parallax portion 140 is implemented by the parallax barrier is similar to the operation of the display device having the lenticular lens array as described above, the duplicate explanation and illustration will be omitted.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">As described above, the image panel 130 may be a general panel having a color filter, or may be a panel that operates in the FSC (Field Sequential Color) driving method.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061"><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> illustrates the configuration of a display device having the color filter. <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view as seen from the upper side of the display device to the lower side thereof. Although the parallax portion 140 is omitted In <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>, the parallax portion may be formed on the front surface of the image panel 130.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>, the image panel 130 includes a rear polarizer 131, a rear surface 132, a liquid crystal layer 133, a color filter 134, a front substrate 135, and a front polarizer 136.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">If white light, which is emitted from the backlight unit 110 and penetrates the mask portion 120, is incident to the rear polarizer 131, the rear polarizer 131 passes only the light in a predetermined polarization direction. The penetrating light is changed to the light having different attributes depending on the transmission rate of the respective liquid crystals and the color value as the light passes through the rear substrate 132, the liquid crystal layer 133, the color filter 134, and the front substrate 135, and then is emitted through the front<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> polarizer 136. The emitted light is dispersed by the parallax portion and is provided to a plurality of viewing areas.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Further, the mask portion 120 includes a mask substrate 121 and a mask pattern 122. The detailed shape of the mask portion 120 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>, the mask 122 is formed on the surface of the mask substrate 121 in a state where a predetermined area thereof is open. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006">Figs. 3 to 6</figref>, the size, shape, and position of the open area may be differently determined in various embodiments. The respective light-transmitting areas may be filled with a transparent material.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">If the number of light-transmitting areas is counted in the horizontal direction, it may be equal to or larger than the number of pixel columns of the image panel. The horizontal size of the light-transmitting area is smaller than the horizontal size of the pixel of the image panel. For example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>, it may correspond to the size of about a half of the pixel. Further, the images that correspond to four viewpoints may be displayed on the LCD panel so that the images are arranged on a 2x2 pixel group having two rows and two columns as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006">Figs. 3 to 6</figref>. This arrangement is different from the arrangement in the related art on the point of the corresponding pixel arrangement. According to the pixel arrangement for expressing 4-viewpoint images in the related art, the horizontal resolution is reduced to 1/4, and thus the picture quality is deteriorated. However, according to the 2x2 pixel arrangement according to the present disclosure, the vertical and horizontal resolutions are respectively reduced to 1/2, and thus the degree of deterioration of the picture quality can be reduced in comparison to that in the related art. The number of light-transmitting area may be equal to the number of pixels, or may be designed as a value obtained by multiplying the number of pixels by a predetermined natural number.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figs. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">6</figref>, the light-transmitting areas may be aligned along a line in a state where the light-transmitting areas are inclined at a predetermined angle with respect to the respective pixel columns of the image panel. The light-transmitting areas, which are arranged along the same line, may be united into a transparent line. The number of lines may be equal to the number of the respective pixel columns of the image panel 130.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> Further, the number of lines may be determined according to the number of 3D views and the arrangement of the image pixels.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">On the other hand, in order to partially recycle the light, the light emitted from the backlight unit 110 may be reflected to the backlight unit 110 by the opaque area of the mask 121, that is, the light-blocking area, to be recycled.

Thereafter, the rear surface 132, the liquid crystal layer 133, the color filter 134, the front substrate 135, and the front polarizer 136 may be sequentially arranged.

For this, the mask 122 may be made of a material having high reflection rate, or a reflection layer that is made of a material having high reflection rate may be formed on the junction surface between the mask 122 and the mask substrate 121. For example, aluminum may be used.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">The light that is reflected by the mask 122 is dispersed by the backlight unit 110, and forms a secondary light. A part of the secondary light is incident to the light-transmitting area to reduce a light loss due to the mask 122.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Further, in the case where a reflective polarizer (not illustrated) is used for the light-transmitting area of the mask 122, the light loss is reduced. The reflective polarizer can reflect the light having polarization that is not used in the LCD display. The polarization of the reflected light becomes extinct in the backlight by the scattering, and thus the light that is incident again to the mask has an appropriate polarization and quantity of light.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077"><figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 11</figref> shows an example of a method for mapping color data by pixels in the image panel 130 having a color filter. In <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 11</figref>, the parallax portion 140 is implemented by a lenticular lens array.

That is, in the first row, R1, B1, and G1 are respectively displayed on the pixels of the first, third, and fifth pixel columns. R1, B1, and G1 are provided to one of the plurality of viewing areas. For example, in an environment as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, if it is assumed that the pixels that display R1, B1, and G1 are provided to the viewing area 3, the user's right eye 52 that is positioned in the viewing area 3 recognizes one color image by the R1, B1, and G1.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">As described above, the image panel 130 may be implemented in the form that does not have a color filter.

Accordingly, a color image can be realized using a light source included in the backlight unit 110 without the color filter. Accordingly, it is not necessary to provide R, G, and B sub-pixels for each pixel, and as a result, the horizontal resolution can be increased to prevent the deterioration of the resolution due to the multi-viewpoint image display.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">For example, in the case of an FHD (Full High Definition) panel, the horizontal resolution can be increased from 1920 to 5760. In the case of using an image panel 130 of a UD (Ultra Definition, 3840×2160) class, the FHD (Full High Definition) image having resolution of 1920×1080 can be implemented even though 12-view 3D display is performed.
