In particular, in the case of composite structures, accidental impacts produce effects which are not very visible externally, but may cause considerable damage inside the structure (for example, delamination).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">This technique, however, is laborious and imprecise, because it does not reflect in real time the changes and the physical and mechanical conditions of the monitored structure.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A method for predicting the behaviour of a structure subject to loads was developed by the same Applicant and described in the European patent application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP2281224A1"><text>EP 2,281,224 A1</text></patcit>. The method comprises the provision of a mathematical model of the structure, detection of the state (deformation) of the structure in a plurality of primary points and in a plurality of additional points, determination of the loads acting on the structure and associated with the state detected in the primary points on the basis of the aforementioned mathematical<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> model, estimation, using the loads determined, of the state of the structure in the additional points, and comparison between the state of the structure estimated and that detected in the additional points, so that an intact state of the structure is determined if the estimated and detected values of the state parameter match, or a defective state of the structure if these values differ.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The object of the present invention is to provide an improved method for performing structural diagnostics, which is both simple and flexible and allows the physical and mechanical conditions of a structure to be estimated with continuity in a reliable manner.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A further object of the invention is to provide a method for performing diagnostics which can be applied without the need for excessive calculation and in particular without the need to create a physical/mathematical model of the structure and which can therefore be implemented on-board an aircraft also when in service or during a mission.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the present invention these objects are achieved by means of a method of performing diagnostics on a mechanical structure having the characteristic features defined in Claim 1.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Particular embodiments form the subject of the dependent claims, the contents of which are to be understood as forming an integral or complementary part of the present description.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The invention also relates to a system and a computer program for performing the diagnostics of a mechanical structure as claimed.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In short, the present invention is based on the characterization of a mechanical structure being examined which is subject to operating loads able to cause local deformation thereof (or modify another parameter indicative of its state) and on the correlation in real time of real deformation data (or more generally data indicative of the real variation of the prechosen state parameter) and presumed deformation data (or more generally presumed variation of the prechosen state parameter), a comparison thereof being used to deduce the intact or defective condition of the structure.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A defect of the structure may consist of a hole, a filled hole or other modifications to the surface or volume, for example caused by the insertion of a connection member, impact damage, delamination, porosity, or due to a zone of the structure which has a different resin or fibre intensity. A defect may be concentrated in a point with specific coordinates or spread out in a direction or over an area or within a volume of the structure.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In a currently preferred embodiment, the structure being examined is equipped with a limited number of deformation sensors located in relevant points.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">It should be noted that, depending on the prechosen arrangement of relevant points (or detection points) on the structure a possible concentrated defect, located far from them, may not cause any variation in the state of the structure at the relevant points, so that a given load or load vector gives rise to a deformation vector which is unchanged in the presence of a defect. Obviously, the criterion for choosing the detection points must preferably take into account the sensitivity to the structural defect at said points.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A neural network, the degree of complexity of which depends on the morphological complexity of the structure, is trained on the basis of the state conditions detected on the structure at the relevant points by means of association with at least one and preferably a plurality of different load conditions. The neural network is designed to estimate a correlation between the state or the variations in state detected in a subset of relevant points and the state or the variation in state in one or more residual relevant points.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A presumed variation in state of the structure under examination at a relevant point depending on a given operating load is estimated by means of the neural network which has been suitably trained and is compared with the corresponding assumed real value of the state parameter measured by the sensor associated with the relevant point.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Advantageously, by means of the neural network, for each load situation an associative prediction of the state or modification in the state is assigned to a subset of relevant points and preferably to each relevant point of the complete set of relevant points on the basis of<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the state or modifications in the state detected at the other points of the set. Therefore, for each point and any load situation a comparison may be performed between the value of the state parameter predicted by the neural network for that point and the real value of the state parameter detected by the associated sensor, basically performing a comparison between the expected state of the structure and the detected state.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The diagnostic evaluation of the structure is performed by means of identification and signalling of the points where the value assumed by the state parameter detected differs from the expected value by an amount greater than a predetermined tolerance threshold. An intact state of the structure is determined if the expected and detected values of the state parameter match within the predetermined tolerance threshold, or a defective state of the structure is determined if these values differ beyond the predetermined tolerance threshold.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The diagnostic evaluation may be conveniently verified by considering a plurality of different load situations and therefore measurements of the presumed variation of the state parameter, so that the existence of a mismatch condition between values predicted by means of the neural network and values detected by the sensors in a plurality of load situations may be interpreted as a confirmation of the presence of damage or a defect in the structure, while the existence of a mismatch condition between values predicted by means of the neural network and values detected by the sensors in a single load situation or in a small number of load situations together with the existence of a match condition between values predicted by means of the neural network and values detected by the sensors in a multiplicity of different load situations may be interpreted as an occasional signal.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Mapping of the points where the presence of damage or a defect in the structure is estimated may be interpreted as a useful indication of the extent of the damage.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Advantageously, the method according to the invention does not require the construction of a complex model of the diagnostics structure, for example finite-elements model, as described in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP2281224A1"><text>EP 2,281,224 A1</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Further characteristic features and advantages of the invention will be explained more<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> clearly in the following detailed description of a non-limiting example of embodiment thereof, provided with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:
