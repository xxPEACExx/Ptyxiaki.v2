For example, liver fibrosis leads to defunctionalization of the liver, and subsequently progresses to hepatocirrhosis or liver cancer, and pancreas fibrosis is commonly observed in cases of chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. Nevertheless, up to now, there have been no drugs for treating the fibrosis, and tissue grafting is the only effective cure. The reason that there are no drugs for treating the fibrosis is because molecular mechanism of tissue fibrosis has not been identified.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Recently, it has been found that tissue fibrosis is caused by activating stellate cells, which are one type of cell constituting tissues, and thus excessively expressing and accumulating an extracellular matrix such as collagen. It has been reported that the stellate cells become distributed in the pancreas, lungs, kidneys, and intestines, in addition to the liver.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The stellate cells play a key role in controlling retinoid homeostasis in thehole body. Vitamin A (retinol) acquired from diet is bound to retinol-binding protein<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> (RBP) in blood flow, circulated, transferred to the stellate cells through STRA6 as a RBP receptor, and then stored as retinyl ester in cytoplasmic fat droplets. The present inventors disclosed that albumin that is expressed in the stellate cells and has intact fatty acid binding sites is involved in formation of vitamin A-containing fat droplets, inhibits activation of the stellate cells, and returns albumin expressed in the activated stellate cells to its previous state before activation (Non-Patent Document 1:<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text> Kim N, Yoo W, Lee J, Kim H, Lee H, Kim Y, Kim D, Oh J.* (2009) Formation of vitamin A fat droplets in pancreatic stellate cells requires albumin.

Albumin has three domains, each of which consists of two small subdomains: A and B. It is known that albumin plays a role in molecular migration by<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> wrapping around hydrophobic substances including fatty acids, and then carrying the hydrophobic substances including fatty acids in the blood. According to a crystallographic analysis, five principal fatty acid binding sites are asymmetrically distributed within the albumin (one in sub-domain IB, one between IA and IIA, two in IIIA, and one in IIIB).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present inventors hypothesized that albumin expressed in stellate cells may promote formation of intracellular fat droplets by stabilizing storage of retinyl ester. On the other hand, the present inventors noticed that a retinol-RBP complex prepared by combining retinol with a RBP receptor in the stellate cells may be internalized into a cell by endocytosis. In reference to this point, an expression vector encoding a fusion protein including albumin and a retinol-binding protein (RBP) was prepared in order to increase a level of albumin in the stellate cells, and then an effect according to the expression of the fusion protein was tested. As a result, with the wild-type albumin, the expression of recombinant fusion protein induced the formation of fat droplets in the stellate cells, and led to the phenotype reversion of activated stellate cells into quiescent cells. In addition, levels of α-SMA, an activation marker of stellate cells, were decreased. Furthermore, when conditioned medium from of 293 cells transfected with the fusion protein expression vector was added to the activated stellate cells, unlike the wild-type albumin, the fusion protein was found to be successfully incorporated into the stellate cells, induce the formation of fat droplets, and decrease the level of α-SMA. In addition, as the expression of mutated albumin with amino acid substitutions induces the senescence of stellate cells, the expression of mutant form of fusion protein also led to stellate cell senescence.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the present invention, the albumin used for the formation of fusion protein may be derived from any species, but may be preferably derived from<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> humans, in order to avoid a risk of immunogenicity. Albumin may be encoded by a nucleic acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Since a high-affinity fatty acid binding site of albumin is present in an albumin I domain and an albumin III domain, it may be preferable to use the domains as a fusion partner, but the present invention is not limited thereto. Therefore, according to a specific example, the albumin used for the formation of fusion protein may be at least one of an albumin I domain and albumin III domain.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The albumin I domain may be encoded by a nucleic acid sequence (1st to 666th nucleic acids among the nucleic acids encoding albumin) as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In addition, the albumin III domain may have a nucleic acid sequence (1216th to 1827th nucleic acids among the nucleic acids encoding albumin) as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to a specific example, in the case of locating the albumin III at a N-terminal side of the fusion protein, an albumin N-terminal including a secretory sequence may be added before the albumin III domain. The albumin N-terminal may be encoded by a nucleic acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Meanwhile, for the RBP bound to the albumin, the full sequence of the RBP or a part of the full sequence of the RBP may be used, and may be properly selected according to an albumin sequence to be bound or an order of binding with the albumin. The RBP may be encoded by a nucleic acid sequence (1st to 585th nucleic acids among the nucleic acid encoding the RBP) as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 5, a nucleic acid sequence (55th to 585th nucleic acids among the nucleic acid encoding the RBP) as set<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> forth in SEQ ID NO: 6, or a nucleic acid sequence (55th to 603th nucleic acids among the nucleic acid encoding the RBP) as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 7, but the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, since when the RBP is bound to the C-terminal of the albumin, a secretory sequence may not be needed, the RBP peptide encoded by a nucleic acid as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 6 or SEQ ID NO: 7 may be used. In addition, in a case where an albumin domain is again bound to the C-terminal of the RBP, it may be preferable to use a partial peptide of the RBP encoded by a nucleic acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 7 rather than the full sequence of the RBP.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to a preferable specific example, the fusion protein may be albumin I domain-RBP-albumin III, albumin III-RBP-albumin I, RBP-albumin III, albumin III-RBP, an albumin-RBP, or RBP-albumin. The albumin I domain-RBP-albumin III is a type in which the N-terminal of the RBP is bound to the C-terminal of albumin I domain and the albumin III domain is bound to the C-terminal of the RBP. The RBP-albumin III, albumin III-RBP, albumin-RBP, and RBP-albumin are also interpreted in the same way. From the above-mentioned sequence analysis, the present inventors found that the fusion protein of the above-mentioned type does not inhibit a natural steric conformation of the albumin, and thus has no influence on a fatty acid binding site or on RBP binding through a RBP receptor. Therefore, the fusion protein may have any one amino acid sequence among amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO: 8 to SEQ ID NO: 13, but the present invention is not limited thereto. Specifically, the albumin I domain-RBP-albumin III, albumin III-RBP-albumin I, RBP-albumin III, albumin III-RBP, albumin-RBP, and RBP-albumin may have amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, and SEQ ID NO: 13, respectively. Those sequences may include an amino acid in the protein to be fused, an amino acid in the nucleic acid encoding a restriction site, a His tag for<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> purifying, and the like.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to another specific example, wild-type albumin, or the wild-type albumin having partially substituted amino acids, may be used to induce aging of stellate cells by the variation of albumin. According to a specific example, for the albumin or albumin III domain included in the fusion protein, Arg410, Tyr411, and Lys525 may be substituted with Ala, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In addition, the present invention provides a polynucleotide encoding the above-mentioned fusion protein including the albumin and retinol-binding protein (RBP), a recombinant vector including the polynucleotide, and a transformant transformed by the recombinant vector.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the present invention, the polynucleotide may have nucleic acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO: 14 to SEQ ID NO: 19, but the present invention is not limited thereto. Specifically, albumin I domain-RBP-albumin III, albumin III-RBP-albumin I, RBP-albumin III, albumin III-RBP, albumin-RBP, and RBP-albumin may be respectively encoded by nucleic acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18, and SEQ ID NO: 19, but the present invention is not limited thereto. Those sequences may include nucleic acids encoding the proteins to be fused, nucleic acids encoding restriction sites used for fusing proteins, a His tag for purifying, a stop codon, and the like.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to another specific example, wild-type albumin, or the wild-type albumin having a partially substituted amino acid sequence among the amino acid sequences of the domain thereof may be used to induce aging of stellate cells by variation of the albumin. According to a specific example, for the albumin or albumin III domain included in the fusion protein, Arg410, Tyr411, and Lys525 may be substituted by Ala, but the present invention is not limited thereto.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Meanwhile, the recombinant vector including the polynucleotide may be prepared by inserting the polynucleotide into the known expression vector capable of being used for preparing a fusion protein. In the present invention, the term "vector" means a DNA construct including a DNA sequence operably bound to a proper regulatory sequence capable of expressing DNA in a proper host. A vector may be plasmid, phage particles, or simply a potential genome insert. In the case of transforming into a proper host, the vector can be replicated and can function regardless of a host genome, or may be integrated into the genome itself in some cases. Recently, plasmid is a type that is most generally used as a vector, so that in the present specification, "plasmid" and "vector" are used interchangeably. For purposes of the present invention, a plasmid vector is preferably used. A typical plasmid vector capable of being used for these purposes has (a) a replication origin that allows it to be effectively replicated to include hundreds of plasmid vectors per host cell, (b) antibiotic resistance genes allowing the host cell transformed into the plasmid vector to be selected, and (c) a structure including restriction enzyme cleavage sites capable of receiving insertion of an external DNA fragment. Even if there are no proper restriction enzyme cleavage sites, when a synthetic oligonucleotide adaptor or linker according to the general method is used, the vector and external DNA may be easily ligated.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Meanwhile, such a recombinant vector may include an expression vector allowing a His tag to be expressed at the end of a fusion protein in order to effectively isolate and purify a protein.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A host cell may be transformed by using a polynucleotide encoding a fusion protein including albumin and a retinol-binding protein (RBP) and a recombinant vector including the polynucleotide. The host cell used for expressing a fusion protein<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> according to the present invention may include a cancer cell, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In addition, the present invention provides a method of producing a fusion protein in which comprises albumin and a retinol-binding protein (RBP), comprising expressing the fusion protein in which comprises the albumin and the retinol-binding protein (RBP) from the transformant. The expression of the fusion protein from the transformant may be generally induced through culturing the host cell. The fusion protein comprising the albumin and retinol-binding protein (RBP) according to the present invention may be isolated from a culture medium by a known method for purifying a protein because the albumin and RBP themselves have a secretory signal, and thus the fusion protein is secreted out of the cell.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the present invention, content in connection with genetic engineering technologies will be more clear by the content as disclosed in the document by Sambrook, <i>et al.</i> (<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="b"><text>Sambrook, et al.
