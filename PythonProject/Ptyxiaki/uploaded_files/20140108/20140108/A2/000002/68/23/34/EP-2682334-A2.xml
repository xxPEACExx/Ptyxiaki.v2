The brake system disclosed in this document includes a front brake operating lever and a rear brake operating lever. The rear brake operating lever is configured to cause the front and rear brakes to work in an interlocked manner.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">More specifically, the rear brake operating lever is coupled with an equalizer, which is connected with a rear brake cable connected with a rear brake and an interlocking cable connected with the front brake operating lever. The equalizer is configured to divide the force received by the rear brake operating lever among the rear brake cable and the interlocking cable.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The interlocking cable is connected with the front brake operating lever to operate the same.

Thus, if the operating force generated as the rear brake operating lever is operated is smaller than the biasing force of the property setting spring, the operating force is transferred to the rear brake cable via the equalizer. Thus, in this case, only the rear brake is actuated. On the other hand, if the operating force generated as the rear brake operating lever is operated is equal to or larger than the biasing force of the property setting spring, the operating force is transferred to the interlocking cable and then the front brake operating lever via the equalizer. Thus, in this case, not only the rear brake, but also the front brake is actuated.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to provide a straddle type<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> vehicle brake system that allows the front and rear brakes to work in an interlocked manner and also allows the brakes to be actuated independently.<br/>

The front brake 31 includes a brake disc 32 and a caliper 33. The brake disc 32, together with the front wheel 3, is rotatably supported by the lower ends of the front suspension legs 25. Although not shown, the caliper 33 is attached to portions of the front suspension legs 25 and includes, in its interior, brake pads for pressing together the brake disc 32 in a thickness direction of the disc. The brake pads are pressed against the brake disc 32 by a hydraulic pressure transferred by a hydraulic hose 34 (see <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>). This generates a braking force for the front wheel 3.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the hydraulic hose 34 is connected with a master cylinder 52, discussed below, and transfers to the front brake 31 a hydraulic pressure generated by the master cylinder 52 as the brake pedal 70 or right brake lever 50 is operated, as discussed below.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, a right grip 12a is provided on the handlebars 12 and is located forward of and to the right of a rider sitting on the seat, while a left grip 12b is located forward of and to the left of the rider. Further, a right brake lever 50 that serves as the front brake operating device is provided on the handlebars 12 near the right grip 12a, while a left brake lever 60 that serves as the rear brake operating device is provided near the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> left grip 12b.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The right brake lever 50 is rotatably supported on a connection member 51, which is attached to the handlebars 12 adjacent to the right grip 12a (see <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>). Thus, the right brake lever 50 is rotatably supported on the handlebars 12 about a point on one end of the right brake lever 50. The structure of the right brake lever 50 will be detailed below. The left brake lever 60 has a similar structure to that of the right brake lever 50 and thus its description will not be given.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, a brake pedal 70 (interlocking brake operating device) is attached to one of the down frames 22. The brake pedal 70 may be attached to the one of the down frames 22 that is located at the right foot of a rider sitting on the seat, for example. The brake pedal 70 is rotatably supported on a support member 71 that is fixed to that down frame 22. Although not shown, the brake pedal 70 is located to penetrate the foot board 91 of the body cover 5. In other words, the top of the brake pedal 70 is exposed above the foot board 91.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">A front brake wire 74 and a rear brake wire 75 are connected with the brake pedal 70 via a wire coupling member 81 of an equalizer 80, as discussed below (see <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">5</figref>). Thus, the rider can cause the front and rear brakes 31 and 41 to work in an interlocked manner by kicking on the brake pedal 70. The structure of the brake pedal 70 will be detailed below.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the power unit 13 is located between the body frame 11 and rear wheel 4. The power unit 13 includes an engine 13a, driving force transmission 13b and other components. The engine 13a may be a unit-swing engine, for example, where the engine may swing in a top-to-bottom direction together with the rear wheel 4 relative to the body frame 11. The driving force transmission 13b for transmitting to the rear wheel 4 a driving force output from the engine 13a is located rearward of the engine 13a with respect to the vehicle. In other words, in the power unit 13, the engine 13a is located toward the front with respect to the vehicle, while the driving force transmission 13b is located toward the rear with respect to the vehicle. A rear brake 41 is located inward of the driving force transmission 13b as measured in a vehicle width direction, i.e. located inward of a rear portion of the power unit 13 as measured in a vehicle width direction. In the present embodiment, the driving force transmission 13b<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> includes a continuously variable transmission that does not require clutch operations.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Similar to the front brake 31 described above, the rear brake 41 includes a hydraulic disc brake, for example. That is, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the rear brake 41 similarly includes a brake disc 42 and a caliper 43. Together with the rear wheel 4, the brake disc 42 is rotatably supported by a swing arm, not shown. The caliper 43 has a similar structure to that of the caliper 33 of the front brake 31 and thus its description will not be given.</p><heading id="h0009">&lt;Brake System&gt;</heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">Next, the structure of the brake system 6 (straddle type vehicle brake system) provided in the motorcycle 1 including the front and rear wheels 3 and 4 will be described in detail with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">6A and 6B</figref>.
