The wire winding apparatus winds the wire so that turns of the wire formed around an outer circumference of the core are aligned with each other in an axial direction of the core. As the wire winding apparatus described above, there is known a wire winding apparatus for regular winding with pitch feeding. This wire winding apparatus winds the wire while shifting a feed mechanism for feeding the wire in the axial direction of the core by the amount equal to a diameter of the wire for each turn of the wire.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">With the regular winding with pitch feeding, however, the wire is not always wound as initially planned. For example, in some cases, the diameter of the wire to be wound around the core is not constant but is varied. Moreover, even when the diameter of the wire is constant, there is a fear in that the diameter of the wire may be changed as a result of the extension of the wire that is caused by a tension applied during the wire winding. Therefore, even with the pitch feeding of the feeding mechanism based on a preset diameter of the wire,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> there is a fear in that the pitch feeding may not always suit for an actual diameter of the wire.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In order to avoid the problem described above, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2002184640A"><text>2002-184640</text></patcit> proposes a wire winding apparatus using profile winding. The wire winding apparatus includes a pulley and a supporting member. The pulley is a wire feeding member for feeding the wire. The supporting member turnably supports a base end of an arm. The pulley is provided to a distal end of the arm. The pulley is configured to be operable through an intermediation of the arm, and hence the profile winding can be carried out. With the profile winding, the wire is guided by the last formed turn around the core so as to be subsequently wound around the core. By the profile winding, the wire is wound along a side surface of the last formed turn of the wire (along the wire) to achieve regular winding. In this manner, even when the diameter of the wire is undesirably changed, the wire is wound along the last formed turn of the wire.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the conventional wire winding apparatus described above, however, the range of operation of the wire feeding member is limited. Therefore, when the wire is to be wound around, for example, a core having a relatively large length by using the profile winding, there is a fear in that the accumulation of errors in the diameter of the wire to be wound around the core may exceed the range of operation of the wire feeding member even when the wire is wound while the wire feeding<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> mechanism is shifted in the axial direction of the core by the amount equal to the diameter of the wire for each turn. As a result, there is a fear in that a winding finish portion of the wire wound around the core cannot absorb the error in the diameter of the wire, which exceeds the range of operation of the wire feeding member, to generate a gap between the turns of the wire or to disadvantageously wind the wire on the already formed turn of the wire. Consequently, the regular winding for winding the wire so that the turns of the wire are formed so as to be uniformly held in close contact with each other becomes difficult.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In this case, the following method is also conceivable. Specifically, the amount of errors absorbed by the pulley, resulting from the accumulation of the errors in the diameter of the wire, is detected to correct the amount of shift of the pulley. In the conventional wire winding apparatus described above, the pulley is provided to the distal end of the arm, and the amount of turning of the arm is detected by an encoder. Even when the amount of turning of the arm is detected, however, the amount of errors absorbed by the pulley cannot be detected in an extremely small unit. Thus, it is difficult to adjust the amount of shift of the wire feeding member in an extremely small unit.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Moreover, a distance from the core to the pulley provided to the distal end of the arm tends to increase when the arm is turned. When the distance from the core to the pulley increases, the amount of shift of the wire in the axial direction of the core increases until a preset length of the wire fed from the pulley reaches the core. As a result, a distance between the new turn of the wire and the turn adjacent thereto changes. Therefore, there is a fear in that the profile winding becomes<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> difficult. In particular, when the core is thin and relatively long, and is likely to be curved due to its length, the core is pulled by the wire to be curved toward the wire feeding member to result in a larger amount of shift of the preset length of the wire fed from the pulley. Then, the profile winding of the wire around the core becomes further difficult. Therefore, the regular winding of the wire to uniformly wind the wire around the core over the entire length of the core tends to become difficult.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">On the other hand, in recent years, the wire winding apparatus is required to perform both the regular winding and pitch winding. The wire is wound while being held in close contact with the core in the regular winding, whereas the wire is wound at a predetermined pitch without being held in close contact with the core in the pitch winding. As described above, the wire winding apparatus is required to be adaptable to diversified wire winding methods.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention has been made to solve the problems described above, and therefore has an object to provide a wire winding apparatus and a wire winding method capable of winding a wire around an outer circumference of a core with a desired pitch even when the core is thin and relatively long.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to one aspect of this invention, a wire winding apparatus for winding a wire around an outer circumference of a core is provided. The wire winding apparatus includes a wire feeding member provided to a supporting member so as to be operable, for feeding the wire, a lock mechanism capable of inhibiting an operation of the wire feeding member, a winding mechanism for rotating the core about an<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> axis thereof to wind the wire fed from the wire feeding member around the outer circumference of the core, a feed mechanism for moving the supporting member in an axial direction of the core in synchronization with the winding performed by the winding mechanism, a proximity sensor for detecting a movement amount of the wire feeding member with respect to the supporting member, and a control section for controlling an operation of the feed mechanism to adjust a movement amount of the supporting member moved by the feed mechanism based on a detection output from the proximity sensor.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Moreover, according to another aspect of this invention, a wire winding method for moving a wire feeding member for feeding a wire in an axial direction of a core with respect to a supporting member while rotating the core about an axis thereof to wind the wire fed from the wire feeding member around the core is provided. The wire winding method includes a profile-winding step of adjusting a movement amount of the supporting member based on a detection output from a proximity sensor for detecting a movement amount of the wire feeding member with respect to the supporting member to wind the wire fed from the wire feeding member so as to be guided by a last formed turn of the wire around the core, and a wire-winding step of winding, with the wire feeding member being fixed, the wire fed from the wire feeding member around the core while moving the supporting member at a constant speed with respect to the core in a state in which movement of the wire feeding member with respect to the supporting member is inhibited.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a side view of a wire winding apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a front view of the wire winding apparatus illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a plan view of the wire winding apparatus illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the periphery of a nozzle of the wire winding apparatus;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is an enlarged view of the portion V of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a sectional view taken along the line VI-VI of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram corresponding to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, for illustrating a state in which wire winding with the nozzle being fixed is performed after profile winding;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> is a sectional view taken along the line VIII-VIII of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> is a sectional view taken along the line IX-IX of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">Now, a wire winding apparatus 10 and a wire winding method using the wire winding apparatus 10 according to an embodiment of the present invention are described referring to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">First, a configuration of the wire winding apparatus 10 is described.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, the wire winding apparatus<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> 10 winds a wire 11 fed from a wire feeding mechanism 14 around an outer circumference of a core 13 by regular winding. In this embodiment, a relatively thin and long linear material having a circular cross section is used as the core 13. However, the core 13 is not limited to the one having a circular cross section. The core 13 may have, for example, a rectangular cross section.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The wire winding apparatus 10 is hereinafter described using three axes, that is, an X axis, a Y axis, and a Z axis which perpendicularly cross each other. Specifically, a longitudinal direction within a horizontal plane is defined as the X axis, a transverse direction within the horizontal plane is defined as the Y axis, and a vertical direction is defined as the Z axis. The core 13 is provided to extend in the Y-axis direction in a tensioned state.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, the wire winding apparatus 10 includes a winding mechanism 20. The winding mechanism 20 pulls the core 13 having a linear shape in the Y-axis direction and rotates the core 13 about a center axis to wind the wire 11 (see <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) fed through a nozzle 30 described later around the outer circumference of the core 13. In this embodiment, the core 13 is made of stainless steel, and has a cross section with a diameter of 0.2 mm and a relatively large length.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The winding mechanism 20 includes a fixed chuck mechanism 21 and a movable chuck mechanism 22. The fixed chuck mechanism 21 chucks one end of the core 13, whereas the movable chuck mechanism 22 is provided so as to be separated away from the fixed chuck mechanism 21 in the Y-axis direction and chucks another<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> end of the core 13. The same mechanism may be used as the fixed chuck mechanism 21 and the movable chuck mechanism 22. As each of the fixed chuck mechanism 21 and the movable chuck mechanism 22, a drill chuck or a collet chuck, which are mechanical chucks, is used, for example. In this embodiment, the drill chuck is used as each of the fixed chuck mechanism 21 and the movable chuck mechanism 22.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The fixed chuck mechanism 21 is pivotably supported by a fixed bearing 23 provided on a base 10a. The movable chuck mechanism 22 is pivotably supported by a movable bearing 24. A first rail 10b, which extends from the fixed bearing 23 in the Y-axis direction, is provided on the base 10a. Two rails, that is, a second rail 10c and a third rail 10d are also provided on the base 10a at a predetermined distance away from the first rail 10b in the X-axis direction so as to be in parallel thereto (see <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>). A chuck moving mechanism 26 is movably provided on the first rail 10b and the second rail 10c.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the chuck moving mechanism 26 includes a movable base 26c and an air cylinder 26b. The movable base 26c is provided so as to be movable on the first rail 10b and the second rail 10c. The air cylinder 26b is provided on the movable base 26c. A movable base 26a, which is movable in the Y-axis direction in a reciprocating manner, is provided on the air cylinder 26b. The movable bearing 24 is mounted on the movable base 26a.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The movable base 26c moves in the Y-axis direction along the first rail 10b and the second rail 10c so that the core 13 having a different length can be provided in a tensioned state. An operation<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> handle 26d is provided to switch over between a state in which the movement of the movable base 26c is allowed and a state in which the movement is inhibited. The movement of the movable base 26c is inhibited by the operation of the operation handle 26d in a state in which the movable base 26c is separated away from the fixed bearing 23 by a distance corresponding to the length of the core 13. The movable base 26c is used without being allowed to move unless there arises a situation where the length of the core 13 is changed or the like.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The air cylinder 26b can move the movable base 26a in the Y-axis direction in a reciprocating manner by supplying compressed air and stopping the supply of the compressed air. The air cylinder 26b moves the movable bearing 24 together with the movable base 26a to move the movable chuck mechanism 22 away from the fixed chuck mechanism 21 to pull the core 13. In this manner, the core 13 can be provided in a tensioned state between the fixed chuck mechanism 21 and the movable chuck mechanism 22.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Moreover, the winding mechanism 20 includes a core rotating mechanism. The core rotating mechanism rotates the core 13 provided in a tensioned state to wind the wire 11 fed from the wire feeding mechanism 14 (see <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) through the nozzle 30 around the core 13. In this embodiment, the core rotating mechanism is provided as chuck servomotors 27 and 28 which are rotationally driven by a command from a controller (not shown) provided as a control section.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, the chuck servomotor 27 is provided to the fixed bearing 23, whereas the chuck servomotor 28 is provided to the movable bearing 24. A belt 27a is provided between a<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> rotary shaft of the chuck servomotor 27 and the fixed chuck mechanism 21. A belt 28a is provided between a rotary shaft of the chuck servomotor 28 and the movable chuck mechanism 22. When the chuck servomotors 27 and 28 are driven by a command from the controller to rotate the rotary shafts of the chuck servomotors 27 and 28 in the same direction, the chuck mechanisms 21 and 22 rotate in synchronization with each other in the same direction through an intermediation of the belts 27a and 28a.
