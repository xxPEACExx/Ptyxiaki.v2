The operational process is defined by a flow of activities for operating a system to be operated. The designer of the operational process uses components that are programs for performing an operational processing to generate an operational process by setting a flow of the activities.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In case where a system to be operated is managed by executing each of plural operational processes, for which a flow of activities is individually defined as described above, when a common apparatus to be operated is operated by plural operational processes, there is a case where results cannot be obtained as assumed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">An example is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> where an interrupt occurs among the operational processes. An upper operational process includes a flow of activities 101 to 105 so as to boot up a server, activate a service X in the server and further activate a service Y in the server. On the other hand, a lower operational process includes a flow of activities 107 and 109 so as to change a network setting in the same server and reboot the server.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">When operations for the same server are executed inparallel by di f ferent operational processes, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, an operation by one operational process may interrupt an operation by the other operational process. The upper operational process activates the service Y on the premise that the service X is operating. However, when the operation of the activity 109 for rebooting the server in the lower operational process is executed between the operation of the activity 103 for activating the service X and the operation of the activity 105 for activating the service Y, the service Y is activated in a state where the service X is not operating. Accordingly, the service Y does not normally operate.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Moreover, in addition to the aforementioned interaction among plural operational processes, there is also a problem concerning the human judgment at the operation. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example of an operational process including an authorization. This operational process includes definition of a flow including activities 201 to 205 so that an authorization request is issued to a manager, and when the response to the request represents grant, the setting<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> of the network in the server is changed, then the server is rebooted. On the other hand, when the response represents denial, the process is suspended. By setting the operational process so as to obtain the judgment by the manager at any time, the operation is appropriately carried out according to the status.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, when the human judgment is frequently requested in the operation, the effectiveness of the automatic operation is lowered. Therefore, as for the setting of the activity 201 relating to the authorization request, bothof the safety and effectiveness are considered. Presumptively, in the example of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, when the setting change 203 of the network and the reboot 205 of the server impair the safety, it is presumed that the authorization request is omitted. Thus, the execution of the operational process to operate the computer is difficult.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">As one aspect of this invention, an object of this invention is to enable to automatically execute the operational process in the environment where a computer is operated by plural operational processes.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">As one aspect, a process execution method includes: (A) specifying an activity to be executed, based on process definition that includes plural activities, and that includes a sequence of transitions between activities, wherein each activity includes information representing a device that is operated through a network; (B) first determining, based on the sequence of the transitions, whether or not the specified activity is an initial operation for a certain device whose information is included in the specified activity; and (C) obtaining an access right to the certain device, when determining that the specified activity is the initial operation for the certain device.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying Drawings, in which:

The flow from a start terminal S to an end terminal E through the activities 1501 to 1509 represents a transition route. In this figure, for convenience of the explanation, the component attribute of the activity is illustrated instead of the component name. Moreover, in this figure, the notation of "exclusive/shared" means the exclusive mode or shared mode. The exclusive range is a range for which operations are performed to the same operation target. The exclusive range for a certain device starts from the initial operation for that device in the operational process. In this example, the exclusive range for a server A is illustrated. The exclusive range for the server A starts from the activity 1505 and ends at the activity 1509. The process execution server 303 obtains the exclusive access right before the execution of the activity 1505, which is the beginning of the exclusive range, and releases the exclusive<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> access right after the execution of the activity 1509, which is the end of the exclusive range. Moreover, the component attribute of the component, which is executed at the activity within the exclusive range, is an exclusive type or shared type. When the exclusive type is included as the component attribute of the activity within the exclusive range in this example, the exclusion method becomes the exclusive mode. In order to secure the exclusive state for a portion of the operations, the exclusive access right is obtained as a whole with the exclusive mode.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">When only shared type is included as the component attributes of the activities within the exclusive range and no exclusive type is included as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 16</figref>, the shared mode is used as the exclusion method.

For example, during a series of operations to the operation target, the activity having no operation target such as sending mail may be included.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Next, an outline of determining necessity of the authorization will be explained. The process execution server 303 determines whether or not the authorization is necessary at the activity, which is the first activity in the exclusive range. At that time, the process execution server 303 determines whether or not the authorization is necessary, based on the attribute of the device, which is operated in the exclusive range. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 6</figref>, the operation target table 403 holds the necessity of the authorization as the attribute of the device. Because the authorization is required for the server A, the process execution server 303 performs a procedure for the authorization at the beginning of the exclusive range, in which the server A is operated, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 19</figref>. Especially, when the exclusive type is includedas the component attribute of the activity within the exclusive range, the procedure for the authorization is conducted.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">For example, because the authorization is not required for the server B, the process execution server 303 does not perform the procedure for the authorization for the exclusive range, in which the server B is operated, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 20</figref>.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Moreover, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 21</figref>, when the component attributes of the activities within the exclusive range are only shared type, the procedure for the authorization is not carried out.

Specifically, the controller 2211 identifies the activity of the transition destination from the first activity in sequence. When the transition destination is branched off, in other words, when there are plural activities of the transition destinations, the activity of the transition destination, which satisfies the transition condition, is selected as the activity to be executed. For example, in an example of the operational process illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGs. 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">13</figref>, activity 701 whose activity number is A1 is firstly specified as an activity to be executed, and when the execution result of the activity<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> 701 is success, activity 702 whose activity number is A2 is next specified as an activity to be executed, and when the execution result of the activity 701 is failure, the activity 709 whose activity number is A9 is specified as the activity to be executed.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The determination unit 2219 determines whether or not this activity is an end terminal (S2305). When it is determined that this activity is the end terminal, the processing ends. For example, in the model of the operational process illustrated in FTGs. 25 and 26, after the activity whose activity number isA7 is executed, the activityto be executed next is the end terminal E. Therefore, the processing ends, because there is no activity to be executed subsequently.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">When the activity is not the end terminal, the processing shifts to S2307. When S2303 is executed in the first round, there is another activity to be executed, so it is determined at S2305 that the activity is not the end terminal.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Next, the determination unit 2219 determines whether or not any device of the operation target is set for the activity to be executed (S2307). Here, when any device name is set in the column of the operation target, which is included in the record of the activity to be executed, in the process definition 2207, the determination unit 2219 determines that there is a device of the operation target, and when none is set in the column of the operation target, which is included in the record of the activity to be executed, in the process definition 2207, the determination unit 2219 determines that there is no device of the operation target.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Then, when there is no device of the operation target for the activity to be executed, the execution unit 2215 executes the activity (S2309), and stores the execution history in the memory unit 217, and the processing returns to S2303. For example, when activity 1801 in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 18</figref> is the activity to be executed, suchaprocessing is executed. Because there is no need to acquire the authorization for the activity having no operation target, the determination whether or not the authorization is necessary is not carried out. Moreover, obtaining and releasing the exclusive access right are not executed.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">On the other hand, when there is a device of the operation target for the activity to be executed, the determination unit 2219 performs an initial operation determination processing (S2311). The determination unit 2219 determines, in the initial operation determination processing, whether or not an initial operation is performed for the device specified by the activity to be executed, based on the process definition 2207.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062"><figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 27</figref> illustrates a flow example of the initial operation determination processing. The determination unit 2219 identifies activities<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> that have been processed (S2701). In other words, the determination unit 2219 identifies activities before the activity to be executed. The activities that have been processed are obtained from the execution history in the memory unit 2217. For example, when the activity 1505 in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 15</figref> is the activity to be executed, the activities 1501 and 1503 that have been processed are specified. Then, the determination unit 2219 identifies operation targets that have been operated (S2703). Specifically, the determination unit 2219 reads devices of the operation targets, which are included in the records of the activities that have been executed, from the process definition 22 07. In the example of <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 15</figref>, the servers B and C are the operation targets that have been operated.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Then, the determination unit 2219 determines whether or not the device of the operation target for the activity to be executed matches any one of the devices of the operation targets that have been operated (S2705). When it is determined that the device of the operation target for the activity to be executed does not match any one of the devices of the operation targets that have been operated, the determination unit 2219 determines this is an initial operation (S2707). In the example of <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 15</figref>, the server A that is the operation target of the activity 1505 does not match any one of the servers B and C that are the operation targets that have been operated, so it is determined that this is the first operation.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">On the other hand, when the device of the operation target for the activity to be executed matches any one of the devices of the operation targets that have been operated, the determination unit 2219 determines that this is not the initial operation (S2709). When the activity 1507 in the example of <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 15</figref> is the activity to be executed, the server A that is the operation target matches the server A that is the operation target for the activity 1505 that has been executed.

When the determination result is the initial operation, the determination unit 2219 performs a processing for determining an exclusion method (S2315). The determination unit 2219 determines the exclusion method set when obtaining the exclusive access right. For example, when the activity 1505 in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 15</figref> or activity 1601 in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 16</figref> is the activity to be executed, the processing for determining the exclusion method is performed.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Here, an outline of the exclusion method determination willbe explained. <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 28</figref> illustrates an example in which the exclusion method is determined to<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> be the exclusive mode.

The determination is made only for the third and fourth transition routes, which match the situation up to this stage. Then, an exclusion method suitable for each of the third transition route and fourth transition route is determined. This determination result is called a route-based determination result. When any one of the route-based determination results is the exclusive mode, the exclusive mode is set as the exclusion method. In this example, because the route-based determination result of the fourth transition route is the exclusive mode, the exclusive mode is set as the entire exclusion method. In order to prepare a case of shifting to the fourth transition route, the exclusive state is secured.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067"><figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 29</figref> illustrates an example for which the exclusion method is determined to be the shared mode.

Both of the route-based determination results of the third and fourth transition routes are the shared mode. Thus, when the route-based determination results do not include the exclusive mode, and any one of the route-based determination results is the shared mode, the shared mode is selected for the exclusion method. Even when the subsequent transition is considered, the exclusive state does not have to be secure. Thus, unnecessary exclusive states are avoided.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">The processing for determining the exclusion method will be explained according to the aforementioned outline. <figref idrefs="f0016">FIG. 30</figref> illustrates a flow example of the processing for determining the exclusion method. The determination unit 2219 identifies one unprocessed transition route in the transition route table 2209 (S3001).

Specifically, the determination unit 2219 determines the transition route matches the situation when the transition route includes activities that match the activities that have been executed. When it is determined the transition route does not match the situation up to this stage, this transition route is not processed, so the processing shifts to S3011.

For example, when the determination target reaches the end terminal E in <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 33</figref>, the shared mode is determined.
