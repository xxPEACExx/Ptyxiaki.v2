Thus, the size of beverages to be kept in the baskets may be limited due to constraints of the doors.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In some refrigerators, a large-capacity beverage with a gallon size, which is about 4.54 liters in the U.K. and about 3.785 liters in the U.S.A., may not fit in a basket provided on a door. Hence, the large-capacity beverage is placed on a shelf or tray cover mounted in an internal space of the refrigerating room. This placement may make the use of the beverage less convenient.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY</u></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">In one aspect, a tower pantry in a refrigerator includes a guide mechanism mounted on a bottom of an opened space inside a refrigerating room and a basket attached to the guide mechanism and configured to move forward and backward on the guide mechanism. The tower pantry also includes frames that are fastened to corners of the basket and that extend vertically from the basket. The frames have a length that is greater than a height of a gallon<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> size beverage container. The tower pantry further includes a frame cover fastened on the frames and defining a space that accommodates the gallon size beverage container in the basket.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, the guide mechanism may include a rail fixed to the bottom of the opened space inside the refrigerating room, and a slide fastened to the basket and configured to slide along the rail. In this example, holes may be respectively formed at both end portions of the slide, and the basket may attach to the slide based on shafts that pass through corners of the basket and that are fastened into the holes. Further, in this example, the shafts passing through the corners of the basket may be vertically fastened to the frames.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In some implementations, the tower pantry may include a reinforcing member configured to reduce distortion of the frames. In these implementations, the reinforcing member may have a curved surface that is periodically bent, and ribs may connect at least one of bottoms and tops of the curved surface. In addition, in these implementations, the reinforcing member may include a lower reinforcing member fixed between the frames, and an upper reinforcing member that is rotatable by 90 degrees.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In some examples, both end portions of the upper reinforcing member may have a shape of a semi-cylinder having an opened portion that is configured to fasten to or separate from the frames. In these examples, a projection that defines a rotary center may be located on<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> an inner circumference of the semi-cylinder, a stopper may be located on an outer circumference of the semi-cylinder, and a groove may be located beneath the stopper. The frame cover may have a finishing structure in which each corner is hermetically sealed so that the frames do not protrude upward from the frame cover.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In some implementations, the guide mechanism may be a first guide mechanism, the basket may be a first basket, and the tower pantry may include a second guide mechanism mounted on the frame cover and a second basket attached to the second guide mechanism and configured to move forward and backward on the second guide mechanism. In these implementations, the second guide mechanism may include a rail fixed on the frame cover, and a slide fastened to the second basket and configured to slide along the rail. Holes may be respectively formed at both end portions of the slide, and the second basket may attach to the slide based on shafts that pass through corners of the second basket and that are fastened into the holes. Each corner of the second basket may have a finishing structure hermetically sealed so that the shafts do not protrude upward from the second basket.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In another aspect, a refrigerator includes a wall body that laterally divides an opened space inside a refrigerating room into first and second spaces, one or more shelves dividing the first space divided by the wall body into two or more spaces, and a pantry located in the second space divided by the wall body. The pantry includes a guide mechanism mounted on a bottom of the opened space inside the refrigerating room and a basket attached<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> to the guide mechanism and configured to move forward and backward on the guide mechanism. The pantry also includes frames that are fastened to corners of the first basket and that extend vertically from the basket. The frames have a length that is greater than a height of a gallon size beverage container. The pantry further includes a frame cover fastened on the frames and defining a space that accommodates the gallon size beverage container in the basket.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, a plurality of shelf hangers configured to support a side of the one or more shelves may protrude from or may be recessed in a surface of the wall body. The one or more shelves may be assembled so that a width of the shelves is adjustable.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In some implementations, the guide mechanism may include a combination of a rail and a slide In these implementations, holes may be respectively formed at both end portions of the slide, and the basket may attach to the slide based on shafts that pass through corners of the basket and that are fastened into the holes.

The tower pantry can be applied to a multi-door refrigerator, but also other types of refrigerators that have a sufficiently wide refrigerating room.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example refrigerator with an example slide-type tower pantry installed in a refrigerating room. The tower pantry is applied to a multi-door refrigerator 100 in which a refrigerating room 10 is disposed on a freezing room 20.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Left and right doors 30 and 31 respectively opened or closed by left and right rotations thereof are mounted at the refrigerating room 10 disposed at the upper portion of the refrigerator 100. One door opened or closed by being pulled forward or pushed backward is mounted at the freezing room 20.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">A plurality of drawer-type trays 10d, 10e and 10f providing a sealed space are provided inside the refrigerating room 10. Opened space not occupied by the trays may be partitioned by a plurality of shelves 10a and 10b, so that objects can be kept layer upon layer. Since vegetables, fruits or fish may be maintained in a state in which their humidity is high or<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> maintained in a state in which their smell is not spread into other spaces, the vegetables, fruits or fish may be kept in a sealed drawer-type tray.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Because an object is put in or taken out through an opening formed at the top of a drawer-type tray in a state in which the drawer-type tray is opened forward, the drawer-type trays may be positioned at a lower portion of the refrigerating room 10. The trays located at the lower portion of the refrigerating room 10 and the opened space at the upper portion of the refrigerating room 10 can be divided by a tray cover 10c for covering the uppermost tray.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The opened space above the trays in the refrigerating room 10 can be divided by a wall body 40, into a space in which a tower pantry 50 is installed and a space in which the plurality of shelves 10a and 10b are mounted. That is, the opened space can be divided into two spaces in the lateral direction of the refrigerating room 10. In <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the space for the tower pantry 50 is formed at the left side of the opened space, and the space for the shelves is formed at the right side of the opened space.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A plurality of shelf hangers for supporting sides of the plurality of shelves 10a and 10b may be protruded or recessed from a surface of the wall body 40. The other sides of the plurality of shelves 10a and 10b may be supported by a plurality of shelf hangers protruded or recessed from an inner sidewall of the refrigerating room 10.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the wall body 40 is fixed at the center of the refrigerating room 10, but other locations are possible. That is, the position of the wall body 40 can be changed based on<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the width of the tower pantry 50. In addition, the plurality of shelves can be variously assembled so that the width of the shelves can be adjusted according to whether the wall body 40 is mounted in the refrigerating room 10. The wall body 40 can be fixed to two or more of an inner rear surface of the refrigerating room 10, an inner upper surface of the refrigerating room 10 and an upper surface of the tray cover 10c.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The tower pantry slides forward/backward along a rail mounted on the tray cover 10c. In this example, any mechanism for sliding the tower pantry 50 may be used. The mechanism for sliding the tower pantry may not be mounted on the inner sidewall or rear wall of the refrigerating room 10.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">That is, the tower pantry 50 slides along the rail mounted on the tray cover 10c. Thus, accommodating the tower pantry 50 may result in relatively little change in the internal structure of the refrigerating room 10.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Shelf-type baskets 30a, 30b, 31a and 31b each having an opening can be provided inside the left and right doors 30 and 31 in order to keep beverages and the like therein.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Accordingly, a user may keep food, such as a side dish, on the shelf 10a or 10b or the tray cover 10c, and may keep food, such as vegetables or fish, in the drawer-type tray 10d, 10e or 10f, and may keep a general size beverage, etc. in the shelf-type basket 30, 30b, 31a or 31b provided inside the left or right door 30 or 31.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">A large-capacity container containing beverage, etc. with a gallon size can be kept upright in the tower pantry 50 and extracted to the outside of the tower pantry 50 in a sliding manner.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In the refrigerator of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the drawer-type trays are positioned in a lower space inside the refrigerating room 10, and the tower pantry 50 is installed in the space in which the shelves are mounted above the lower space. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto.
