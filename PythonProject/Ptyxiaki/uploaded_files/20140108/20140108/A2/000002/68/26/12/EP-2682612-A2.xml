An active flow control may be used in an attempt to counteract such a stall. The latter uses a pulsed air stream. The pulsed air stream is here generated in a fluidic actuator, for example.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Fluidic actuators represent a highly efficient flow control device, which makes it possible to generate a pulsed air stream for flow control without in the process requiring movable mechanical components in the jet diffuser (fluidic actuator). The actuators are here based on the principle of enhancing the flow mechanics, wherein a large quantity of air is diverted by a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> distinctly smaller quantity of control air. This control air must alternately be supplied to the control terminals of the fluid actuator.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A distinction is here made between externally controlled fluid actuators and self-induced fluid actuators. In eternally controlled actuators, an external control air supply is used, which is typically actively controlled by way of valves, e.g., solenoid valves. In self-induced actuators, control fluid is removed from and returned to the respective output lines via a respective structurally separate return channel. Given a suitable dimensioning, this makes it possible to generate a self-induced vibration, a so-called fluidic oscillation.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As a general rule, a self-induced fluidic actuator of the aforementioned type comprises a supply line, two outputs, an interaction chamber as well as two so-called feedback loops, which are structurally separated from the rest of the interaction chamber, as well as from the supply lines. The compressed air-supplied air stream from the supply line is present at a lateral wall of the supply chamber, so that the air stream exits from the first output. At the same time, a portion of the air stream here penetrates into the input of the allocated first feedback loop (coupling), and after a time delay again exits at the output of the allocated first feedback loop. The output is located near the input of the supply line, and may hence be used to control the air stream. As it exits, the portion of the air stream coupled in the first feedback loop forces the air stream in the direction of the second output. The process then repeats itself in a quasi mirror inverted fashion on the other side. As a consequence, the fluidic actuator alternately provides a pulsed air stream at both outputs. Since there are no mechanical parts, the fluidic actuator is highly efficient in this form.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A self-induced fluidic actuator of the aforementioned type is known from <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US4227550A"><text>US Patent 4,227,550</text></patcit>. This self-induced fluidic actuator comprises feedback loops and outlet lines.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">One major problem relative to self-induced fluidic actuators during active flow control (AFC - active fluid control) has to do with balancing the individual components. In the following, a distinction is here made between flow control by the fluid actuator and the control stage of the fluid actuator. The return line (feedback loop) routes a portion of the fluid flowing through from the output of the actuator back to the interaction zone, and there causes the actuator to switch over. The outlet line (output control fluid) feeds a pulsed fluid stream to a recipient (e.g., a control port of the active fluid control fluid actuator stage), wherein the signal of the outlet lines<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> is phase-shifted by 180° degrees relative to each other. On the one hand, the restricting effect exerted by flow control on the control stage is here of significant importance. If the restricting effect is too high, signal modulation drops until a constant air stream finally exits the outputs, as a result of which the control signal present at the AFC stage is no longer sufficient. On the other hand, the required installation space for the control stage is high, since the latter depends on the length of the return lines (feedback loops) and the feed lines separate from the latter to the control ports of the downstream stage (output control fluid). The required installation space indirectly gives rise to additional problems. One such problem is that the installation space required with only a limited installation space being available, such as in the case of a wing, may only be realized by a highly complex structural design; on the other hand, this also yields an elevated demand for material, which manifests itself in a weight proportion that must not be underestimated.</p><heading id="h0004">Brief Description of the Invention</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">Therefore, one object of the invention is to provide a device for generating fluid pulses that is less critical in terms of dimensioning and/or requires less installation space than conventional devices.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As a solution, the invention proposes a novel device for generating fluid pulses. The device comprises a first channel with a first fluid inlet and a second channel with a second fluid inlet, wherein the first fluid inlet and second fluid inlet are essentially situated opposite each other. The first channel comprises a first control outlet at the height of the first fluid inlet, and the second channel comprises a second control outlet at the height of the second fluid inlet, wherein the respective control outlet is located in front of the respective fluid inlet in relation to the inflowing direction of the fluid inlet. During operation, a fluid flowing in through the first fluid inlet passes through the first channel, and after running through the first channel, at least a portion of the introduced fluid exits the first channel through the first control outlet, thereby causing the inflowing fluid to be diverted toward the second fluid inlet, or a fluid flowing in through the second fluid inlet passes through the second channel, and after running through the second channel, at least a portion of the introduced fluid exits the second channel through the second control outlet, thereby causing the inflowing fluid to be diverted toward the first fluid inlet. The first channel comprises a working outlet or several working outlets, through which a portion of the inflowing fluid is removable. In the fluid direction subsequent to the last working<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> outlet of the first channel, the remaining portion of the introduced fluid exits the first channel through the first control outlet. Depending on how the second channel is configured, i.e., on whether the second channel comprises no working outlet, one working outlet or several working outlets, either the entire introduced fluid, or at least the remaining portion of the introduced fluid in the fluid direction subsequent to the last working channel of the second channel, exits the second channel through the second control outlet.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As a result, the invention provides a device for generating fluid pulses that is less critical in terms of dimensioning and/or requires less installation space than conventional devices. This stems in particular from the fact that just a single line per channel must now be dimensioned, and a working line and feedback line need not be dimensioned, as had been the case in prior art.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In an embodiment of the invention, the cross sectional surface of the first channel is abruptly reduced subsequent to a working outlet. This produces a bottleneck effect.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In a further development of the invention, the first channel again expands subsequent to the abrupt reduction. This counteracts a thickening of the boundary layer at the channel edge, for example ensuring a favorable flow toward a subsequent working outlet.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In another embodiment of the invention, the fluid flows into the first channel or the second channel essentially from a rectangular access channel. Rectangular channels have proven themselves beneficial from the standpoint of flow mechanics.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In yet another embodiment of the invention, at least one working outlet branches away from the first channel at an angle to the primary channel direction or essentially perpendicular to the primary channel direction, wherein the primary channel direction is not necessarily a straight line. This makes it possible to achieve very compact structural designs, since the entire device does not have to lie in one plane.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In another embodiment of the invention, the first channel comprises at least two working outlets, wherein the working outlets comprise different cross sectional surfaces. By providing different cross sectional surfaces, the removed quantity of fluid may be optimally adjusted to the subsequent intended purpose.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In yet another embodiment of the invention, the second channel is structured symmetrically to the first channel. As a result, alternating fluid pulses may be provided to the working outlets of the first and second channel.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In an alternative embodiment to the above, the second channel is structured asymmetrically relative to the first channel. This construction makes it possible to provide "duty cycles", for example. Asymmetrically must here be understood from a variety of standpoints. It may refer to a differently configured length of the channels on the one hand, or additionally or alternatively denote a differing number of working outlets of the respective channels. For example, one channel may comprise a plurality of working outlets, while another channel may comprise just one or even no working outlet.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In another further development of the alternative embodiment of the invention, the cross sectional surface of the second channel differs from the cross sectional surface of the first channel and/or the first channel and second channel comprise a different capacity in terms of flow mechanics. The duration of the fluid stream may also be influenced in the two channels, for example by varying the lengths for the two channels.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In an embodiment of the invention, a device according to the invention is used as a control stage of a fluid actuator, in particular a fluid actuator for influencing a flow along a flow surface.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In another embodiment of the invention, a device according to the invention directly influences a flow along a flow surface, and acts as an independent fluid actuator, for example which provides fluid pulses.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In yet another embodiment of the invention, the device provides a pulsed liquid jet. This is especially advantageous for applications in medical technology, but also in materials processing.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In an embodiment of the invention, the device provides a pulsed fluid stream comprising a fuel or a fuel-air mixture for subsequently burning the pulsed fluid stream. This is especially advantageous for a controlled burning.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In an embodiment of the invention, the device provides a pulsed fluid stream for cooling another arrangement, in particular turbine blades or combustion chamber walls.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><heading id="h0005">Brief Description of the Figures</heading><p id="p0025" num="0025">Several embodiments of the invention will be explained by example below, drawing reference to the figures.

Subsequent to the last working outlet of the first channel C<sub>1</sub>, the remaining portion of the introduced fluid exits the first channel C<sub>1</sub> through the first control outlet CP<sub>1</sub>. In other words, the fluid does not escape, but is rather completely available for control purposes or passage through the second channel.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Without delving into the above any further for now, the second channel C<sub>2</sub> may have the same shape as channel C<sub>1</sub>, or channel C<sub>2</sub> may have a design differing from channel C<sub>1</sub>. For example, channel C<sub>2</sub> may have a differently configured length L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub> and/or cross sections for the channels, and a varying number of working outlets may additionally or alternatively be involved. For example, channel C<sub>1</sub> may comprise a plurality of working outlets, while channel C<sub>2</sub> has only one or even no working outlets.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The sequence will be briefly outlined below, wherein individual locations on <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref> are numbered in chronological sequence, and circled in the drawings for delineation from device features.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">When a fluid flows in during operation, the fluid stream gravitates toward one of the two sides for reasons of no greater interest, and consequently flows into one of the fluid inlets. This is the case at fluid inlet R<sub>1</sub> on <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, and the location is correspondingly marked 1. Subsequent thereto, the fluid stream passes location 2. Situated at location 2 is an exemplary first working outlet WP<sub>1</sub>, from which a certain portion of fluid is now removed. As depicted at locations 3 and 4, one or more additional optional working outlets WP<sub>n+1</sub> and WP<sub>n</sub> may then follow. A respective portion of fluid may be removed at these additional optional working outlets as before. Arranging various working outlets spatially close to each other may ensure that fluid exits the respective working outlet in a nearly synchronous manner, i.e., that only a slight phase shift arises. The still present fluid then continues flowing through the remainder of the channel (location 5) and is routed to the control outlet CP<sub>1</sub>. In other words, the fluid does not escape, but<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> rather is completely available for control purposes or passage through the second channel, depending on the degree of modulation. Given a 100% degree of modulation, i.e., the inflowing fluid is completely diverted into the second fluid inlet R<sub>2</sub>, fluid no longer enters into the first fluid inlet R<sub>1</sub> previously receiving the inflow. By contrast, given less than a 100% degree of modulation, at least a small portion of the inflowing fluid continues to flow into the previous first fluid inlet R<sub>1</sub>. The still present fluid exits channel C<sub>1</sub> at location 6, and now diverts the fluid still flowing toward fluid inlet R<sub>1</sub> to fluid inlet R<sub>2</sub> of channel C<sub>2</sub> (location 7). The fluid then passes through channel C<sub>2</sub>, and at least a portion of the fluid is routed toward the control outlet CP<sub>2</sub>. It also holds true here that all fluid remaining after removal through a possibly present working outlet or several possibly present working outlets of the second channel C<sub>2</sub> is available for control purposes in the same way as described for channel C<sub>1</sub>. At location 8, the still present fluid exits channel C<sub>2</sub>, and now diverts the fluid still flowing toward fluid inlet R<sub>2</sub> back to fluid inlet R<sub>1</sub> of channel C<sub>1</sub> (location 1). This concludes the cycle, which then begins anew. The length of the line between the last working outlet and ensuing control outlet is critically important in determining the switching frequency of the actuator.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The first control outlet CP<sub>1</sub> is preferably arranged in such a way that a fluid flowing out of the first control outlet CP<sub>1</sub> essentially flows into the second fluid inlet R<sub>2</sub> (location 6), and that the second control outlet CP<sub>2</sub> is arranged in such a way that a fluid flowing out of the second control outlet CP<sub>2</sub> essentially flows into the first fluid inlet R<sub>1</sub> (location 8). This increases efficiency, and also enables reliable switching even given a high restrictive effect.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> depicts a schematically represented detail of various embodiments of the invention. This detail corresponds to the frame denoted with dashed lines on <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As depicted, the cross sectional surface of the first channel C<sub>1</sub> is abruptly reduced subsequent to a working outlet WP<sub>n+1</sub>, W<sub>Pn</sub>. For example, the cross section Q<sub>2</sub> is smaller before the working outlet WP<sub>n</sub> than the cross section Q<sub>3</sub> after the working outlet WP<sub>n</sub>. Due to the abrupt reduction, the resultant damming effect in the feed lines to the fluid outputs may make fluid with an overall pressure exceeding the reference pressure of the environment available to a downstream recipient. As further shown on <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the first channel C<sub>1</sub> again expands subsequent to the abrupt reduction. For example, the cross section Q<sub>2</sub> before the working outlet WP<sub>n</sub> is larger than the cross section Q<sub>1</sub> after the working outlet WP<sub>n+1</sub>. The expansion counteracts the thickening of the boundary layers. In addition, this contouring makes it possible to favorably route the fluid to the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> working outlets in terms of flow mechanics, and enables an extremely homogeneous distribution of the fluid to be removed among a plurality of outlet openings.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In an embodiment of the invention, the fluid flows into the first channel or the second channel essentially from a rectangular access channel. Rectangular cross sections and in particular quadratic cross sections have proven themselves beneficial from the standpoint of flow mechanics.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In another embodiment of the invention, at least one working outlet branches away from the first channel at an angle to the primary channel direction or essentially perpendicular to the primary channel direction. For example, the working outlet or the working outlets, as denoted by crosses in the working outlets on <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, may branch off perpendicular to the channel plane, i.e., normal to the drawing plane. This enables a very compact design that economizes on material. It is also possible to provide the channel C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub> itself with a curvature, i.e., the primary channel direction is not necessarily a straight line. This may be targeted at further reducing the installation size, or permit use in systems that were not straight from the very outset, e.g., for cooling turbine blades or combustion chambers.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">A further development of the invention may also provide that the working outlets comprise differing cross sectional surfaces. This makes it possible to optimally adjust the removal of fluid at different working outlets to the respective intended purpose.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">As depicted on <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the second channel C<sub>2</sub> may be structured symmetrically to the first channel C<sub>1</sub>. In other words, channel C<sub>2</sub> essentially has the same configuration as channel C<sub>1</sub>, i.e., the same length L<sub>1</sub> and same number and positioning of working outlets, as well as a similar type of dimensioning for the cross sections.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">As an alternative hereto, the second channel C<sub>2</sub> may also be structured asymmetrically to the first channel C<sub>1</sub>, as depicted on <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>. For example, the cross sectional surface of the second channel C<sub>2</sub> may differ from the cross sectional surface of the first channel C<sub>1</sub>, and/or the first channel C<sub>1</sub> and second channel C<sub>2</sub> comprise a varying capacity in terms of flow mechanics for other reasons. Furthermore, as shown on <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the time it takes to pass through the first channel C<sub>1</sub> may differ from the time it takes to pass through the second channel C<sub>2</sub> given an identical fluid supply. For example, channel C<sub>2</sub> has a distinctly shorter length L<sub>2</sub> than channel C<sub>1</sub> with a length L<sub>1</sub>. As a<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> result, for example, a "duty cycle" may easily be provided. The work duration of the "duty cycle" is here determined by flow mechanics-related characteristics of channel C<sub>1</sub>, while the idle duration of the "duty cycle" is determined by the flow mechanics-related characteristics of channel C<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The characteristics of the device according to the invention make it especially suitable as a control stage of a fluid actuator, in particular a fluid actuator for influencing a flow along a flow surface. Critically important with regard to the latter are the stability even at a higher restrictive effect along with the enablement of small installation sizes and the rise in available weight associated therewith.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Since the device according to the invention may itself provide a pulsed fluid stream, the device is able to directly influence a flow along a flow surface.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">However, the invention is not limited to these areas of application. Fluid pulses, in particular pulsed liquids, are also required in other areas. A first example involves the combustion of hydrocarbons for power or thermal purposes. A fuel or fuel-air mixture is frequently added to a combustion nozzle to ensure a good combustion, and thereby keep harmful gas emission low and efficiency high. The injected fluid is then burned via external or self ignition. Multiple injections are here used in addition to the multiple external ignitions. An adjustable self-induced vibration and/or provision of a duty cycle represent a possible embodiment for these systems as well.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Another example involves the processing of metal materials. For example, the objective may be a roughening of the surface or separation.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Another example has to do with medical technology. For example, pulsed liquid jets may here be used as an alternative to lasers. This is especially advantageous, since as opposed to a laser, a pulsed water jet does not require that tissue be vaporized, but rather allows it to be separated out and transported away by the fluid jet itself. This decreases damage to surrounding tissue.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The devices according to the invention are suitable as independent systems for generating fluid impulses, and by comparison to prior art make it possible to provide a plurality of removal sites for pulsed fluid, essentially without any mutual phase shifting, which then may be released directly to the environment, e.g., via actuator chambers, or be used for flow control purposes.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> Furthermore, the invention enables the provision of different amplitudes at the most varied of removal sites using a single fluidic switch and supply pressure. In addition, the invention permits a "duty cycle" variation, wherein it must be noted that the fluid is not simply uselessly released to the environment in these "duty cycles", but instead remains inside the device and is available in the next "duty cycle".</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The invention further permits a design in which up to and including rotationally symmetrical components may be integrated even along curved surfaces, e.g., turbine blades, combustion chamber diffusers, etc. As opposed to known actuators, the feedback loops are not present as an independent line, but instead the feedback loops are functionally integrated into the respective outlet line. Integrating the feedback loops into the outlet line makes it possible to achieve a distinct reduction in the required installation space. In comparison to previous systems, this reduction measures roughly 50 percent. This yields additional advantages, since the devices according to the invention are tangibly less complex as a result, and a lower weight may also be realized due to the lower demand for material. Furthermore, this invention also makes it possible to achieve outlet signal stability and increased efficiency.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Let it be noted that neither moving nor electrical components are required for this purpose, thus making the invention impervious to electrical or mechanical disruptions.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982514" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A device for generating fluid pulses, comprising:
