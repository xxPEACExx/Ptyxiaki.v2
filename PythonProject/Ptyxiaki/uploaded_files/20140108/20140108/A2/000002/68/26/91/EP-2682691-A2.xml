Home refrigerators also may include a freezing apparatus for freezing water or food. A home refrigerator generally relies on vapor compression using a motor and a compressor installed in a sealed container to provide cooling and freezing, particularly, as a liquid coolant flows from the compressor through an expansion valve to an evaporator such that cooling is performed.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As life styles have changed, refrigerators have grown bigger so that they may retain more food. So-called "side-by-side" type refrigerators having both a refrigerating compartment and a freezing compartment laterally separated from each other have gained popularity for home refrigerators. Further, refrigerators have developed a diversity of functions and designs.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Generally, a refrigerator may have an ice making apparatus for making ice and a dispenser through which cool water or ice may be dispensed to the outside without requiring a user to open the doors of the refrigerator. However, when a user dispenses water out of the dispenser by manipulating the water supply operating unit, for example, by pushing a water supply lever with a cup or pressing a water supply button, the water may continue to drip out of a water outlet of the dispenser even when the water supply lever or water supply button is no longer being manipulated.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005"

The ice cubes stored in the ice bank 52 may be discharged through an ice chute, which is a path, into the dispenser 40 provided at the front surface of the freezing compartment door 12.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> shows a dispenser through which both water and ice may be withdrawn.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The dispenser 40, which is provided at the front surface of the freezing compartment door 12, may include a dispenser case 42 that is depressed inwards from the front surface of the freezing compartment door 12 to form a dispenser room 41 for placing therein a container for receiving water and ice, a water outlet 43 through which water is discharged, a water manipulating lever 44 for turning on or off a switch for generating an operation signal that enables water to be discharged through the water outlet 43, an ice outlet 45 through which ice stored in the ice bank 52 is discharged to the dispenser room 41, an ice chute 46 that is a path for connecting the ice outlet 45<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> with the ice bank 52, an ice manipulating lever 47 for controlling discharge of ice through the ice outlet 45, and a bottom plate 48 configured detachably to receive any remaining water that is dripped from the dispenser 40. A hose, which may be a water supply tube, is connected to the water outlet 43 to supply water.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">At an upper side of the dispenser 40 may be provided a dispenser cover having a display for displaying operation statuses of the refrigerator and manipulating buttons for manipulating the operation of the dispenser 40 or the refrigerator. The dispenser cover may function to cover some of the parts constituting the dispenser 40 so the parts are not viewed from the outside.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">When the water manipulating lever 44 and the ice manipulating lever 47 are manipulated by a user, for example, when pressed, water or ice may start to be dispensed. Supply of water or ice may be continued while the user keeps pressing or until the user re-manipulates the levers 44 and 47.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The water supply system for supplying water to the ice maker 51 and the dispenser 40, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, may include a filter 22 for purifying water supplied from a water supply source 21, for example, a faucet, a water tank 23 for cooling the water purified by the filter 22 and supplying the cooled water to the dispenser 40, a switching valve 24 for switching on/off the supply of water from the water supply source 21, a splitting valve 25 for distributing the water purified by the filter into the water tank 23 or the ice bank 52, hoses 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, and 39 for connecting the water supply source 21, the filter 22, the water tank 23, the switching valve 24, the splitting valve 25, and the ice bank 52 to each other, and connectors 35 and 38 for connecting the hoses to each other.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The filter 22 is mounted at an upper side of the refrigerator, and the water tank 23 is mounted at the freezing compartment door as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. However, the water tank 23 may also be positioned in the refrigerating compartment. The switching valve 24 and the splitting valve 25 are arranged in a mechanical chamber that is positioned at a rear and lower side of the refrigerator.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the hoses 36 and 39 are buried in the freezing compartment door 12, and the hoses 34 and 37 come from the splitting valve 25 through the outside of the main body<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 11 to a lower side of the refrigerator. Accordingly, during production of the refrigerator, when the main body 11 is combined with the freezing compartment door 12, the hoses 34 and 36 and the hoses 37 and 39 are connected using the connectors 35 and 38. The hoses 36 and 39, which are buried in the freezing compartment door 12, penetrate the inside of the hinge 14 and ends thereof are exposed to the outside, when the hoses 36 and 39 are supplied to the production line, and are thus connected to the hoses 34 and 37 through the connectors 35 and 38.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">If a user manipulates the water manipulating lever 44 of the dispenser 40, a control board (not shown) having a microcomputer installed at the rear surface of the refrigerator receives a switching signal that is generated as the water manipulating lever 44 is manipulated and sends a control signal to a solenoid that opens or closes a first valve of the splitting valve 25 connected to the water outlet 43 of the dispenser 43 (connected in the order of the hose 34, connector 35, hose 36, and water tank 23) and/or to a solenoid that opens or closes the switching valve 24, so that the first valve and/or the switching valve 24 are opened or closed.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Likewise, unless the ice bank 52 is filled with ice at a proper level, the ice maker 51 drops the ice formed in the ice tray to the ice bank 52 and generates a signal for requesting that water be supplied to the ice tray and transfers the signal to the control board. Accordingly, a solenoid of a second valve of the splitting valve 25 connected to the water supply unit of the ice maker 51 (connected in the order of the hose 37, the comnector 38, and the hose 39) and/or the solenoid of the switching valve 24 is controlled, so that water is supplied to the ice tray of the ice maker 51, and after a predetermined time passes, for example, sufficient to provide a proper amount of water to the ice tray, the second valve and/or the switching valve 24 is closed.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The first valve of the splitting valve 25 connected to the water outlet 43 of the dispenser 40 is opened, allowing water to be dispensed through the water outlet 43. In this arrangement, if a user manipulates the water manipulating lever 44 to stop water from being withdrawn, the solenoid of the first valve is operated by a control signal from the control board, so that the first valve is closed. However, water can continue to leak through the water outlet 43 for a predetermined time because of the presence of water in the hose and momentum of the water<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> flowing from the first valve to the water outlet 43. This phenomenon may also occur at the second valve of the splitting valve 25, which is connected to the ice maker 51 for forming ice.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The time during which such phenomenon lasts is proportional to the length of a flow path between the start point where the water starts to flow and the end point. That is, as the flow path between the start point and the end point gets shorter, less water can leak due to the water momentum, and as the flow path between the start point and the end point gets longer, more water can leak.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In the refrigerator shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. the switching valve 24 and the splitting valve 25 are arranged in a mechanical chamber that is positioned at a rear and lower side of the refrigerator. This arrangement prevents water, which may leak when the switching valve 24 breaks, the splitting valve 25, breaks or other leaks are formed between the valve and the hose, from entering the inside of the refrigerator.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Further, the switching valve 24 or the splitting valve 25 switches on/off water supply in a solenoid-operated manner. As such, there is a limit on the size of the valve to switch on/off water flow that can be used to provide higher stability without water leakage, and accordingly, there may not be a proper place to arrange the switching valve 24 or the splitting valve 25, so that the switching valve 24 or the splitting valve 25 may be required to be positioned in the mechanical chamber.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Since the splitting valve 25 is positioned at the rear and lower side of the refrigerator, the length of the hose between the splitting valve 25 and the dispenser 40, i.e., flow path, is increased. Further, because the ice maker 51 for forming ice and the dispenser 40 are embedded in the freezing compartment door 12, the hose for connecting the splitting valve 25 with the water outlet 43 of the dispenser 40 cannot penetrate the freezing compartment and, consequently, is detoured by passing through the inside of the door hinge 14, which may be a shaft about which the freezing compartment door 12 is rotated, and then extending to the inside of the freezing compartment door 12. As such, the flow path between the start point of the splitting valve, where water starts to flow, and the end point of the water outlet of the dispenser or ice maker is long, such<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> that it takes longer for the switch-off of the valve to work on the water outlet, thus resulting in more water dripping.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">According to the present invention, the length of the flow path between the splitting valve 25 which is the start point of water flow and the water outlet 43 of the dispenser 40 which is the end point of water flow may be reduced to mitigate water leakage. For this purpose, according to an embodiment of the present invention, the splitting valve, which has been conventionally positioned in the mechanical chamber, is arranged in an empty space of the dispenser that is positioned at the front surface of the freezing compartment door, thus minimizing the length of the flow path between the splitting valve and the water outlet of the dispenser.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> schematically shows a water supply system of a side-by-side type refrigerator having an ice making apparatus and a dispenser embedded in a freezing compartment door according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The water supply system, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, is similar to the water supply system shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. However, the splitting valve 25 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is mounted in the mechanical chamber while the splitting valve 125 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is arranged in the freezing compartment door 12. Similarly, while the water tank 23 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is arranged between the splitting valve 25 and the dispenser 40, the water tank 123 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is arranged between the filter 22 and the splitting valve 25. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the water tank 123 is arranged in the refrigerating compartment. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the water tank 123 may be mounted in the freezing compartment door 12 similar to the water tank 23 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Due to such differences, the connection of hoses and drain tubes are changed. As shown in the exemplary embodiment, a hose 61 connects the filter 22 with the water tank 23. A hose 62, a connector 63, and a hose 64 connect the water tank 123 with the splitting valve 125. Hoses 65 and 66 connect the splitting valve 125 to the water outlet 43 of the dispenser 40 and the ice maker 51. Because the splitting valve 125 is embedded in the freezing compartment door 12, the hose 64 directly connected with the splitting valve 125 is also embedded in the freezing<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> compartment door 12, passes through the inside of the door hinge 14 positioned at a lower side of the freezing compartment door 12, with an end thereof exposed to the outside, and is connected to the hose 62 through the connector 63.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">While the conventional refrigerator shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> has two hoses passing through the inside of the door hinge 14, only one hose passes through the door hinge 14 in an exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>. The door hinge 14 may be a middle shaft that enables the door to be rotated, and whenever the freezing compartment door 12 is rotated, the hose passing through the door hinge 14 may also move, such that the surface of the hose may be worn away due to possible friction between the hose and the door hinge 14.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">To prevent such problems, an internal hole (internal diameter of the hinge) of the door hinge 14 which has been bored to pass the hose therethrough needs to be increased. In such cases, the distance between the internal diameter of the hinge and the external diameter of the hinge is decreased such that the door hinge 14, which is the rotational center of the door, may also be weakened. Thus, the external diameter of the door hinge 14 also needs to be increased. This, in turn, may require the door hinge 14 to be positioned outside the inner wall of the refrigerator so that the drawers in the refrigerating compartment or the freezing compartment may be pulled out. In addition, if the external diameter of the door hinge 14 is increased, the horizontal length of the refrigerator is increased or, when the door is fully opened, the door ends up taking up more outer space.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">However, based on the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, only one hose 64 passes through the inside of the door hinge 14 of the freezing compartment door 12. Thus, even without increasing the external or internal diameter of the door hinge 14, the hinge strength is not deteriorated. Further, since the external diameter of the door hinge 14 is not increased, the horizontal length of the refrigerator is not increased, and the door may occupy less space when it is opened.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">According to the exemplary embodiment, the refrigerator main body 11 and the freezing compartment door 12 are produced separately from each other and are combined with each other during production of the refrigerator. Thus, in the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>,<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> only one connector is needed in contrast to the conventional approach shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> in which two connectors are required, thereby resulting in cost savings.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Moreover, water leakage may easily occur at a portion where a connector is connected with a hose. One connector has two connecting points for allowing hoses to be connected to both sides, respectively, of the connector. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the number of connectors may be reduced as compared with the conventional approach shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, and, as a result, the number of connecting points may also be reduced, resulting in water leakage being ameliorated.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">While the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> indicates that the filter 22 for purifying water supplied from the water supply source 21 is mounted in the refrigerating compartment, the filter 22 may be eliminated from the water supply system because purified water may also be fed from an outside source. Further, since water from the water supply source 2I may be shut on/off only by opening and closing the splitting valve 25, the switching valve 24 may also be omitted from the water supply system.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> shows a structure in which a dispenser and a switching valve are arranged together in a dispenser room according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Because the splitting valve 125 may be installed at the rear surface of the freezing compartment door 12, the splitting valve may become frozen if the valve breaks and water leakage occurs so that water permeates into the inside of the freezing compartment.

As the solenoid valves 125b' and 125c' get closer to the outlet conduits 125b and 125c, the valves are closed, and thus, the water stops flowing, As the solenoid valves 125b' and 125c' get further away from the outlet conduits 125b and 125c, the water resumes flowing.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">In general, when the solenoid valves are arranged side by side, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, in the state where the solenoid valves move in a horizontal direction to thereby open and close the outlet conduits, the arrangement reduces the likelihood of leaks. However, when the solenoid valves are operated to travel in an upper and lower direction, more benefits can be obtained compared to when the valves are operated moving in the horizontal direction. For example, if the solenoid valves are arranged in the state where the valve travels down to be closed, and the outlet conduit is left<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> closed, the valve is forced downwards due to its own weight, thus assisting in maintaining the closed state.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Also in the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, the outlet conduits 125b and 125c of the splitting valve 125 are arranged towards the front surface of the freezing compartment door 12, and the inlet conduit 125a is arranged towards the rear surface of the freezing compartment door 12.
