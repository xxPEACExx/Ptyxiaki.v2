In more detail, the steps of this operation are conducted like an operation of roll mills. Namely, when an edge portion formed on an outer side of a vertical side portion of the frame-shaped blade comes close to the inner wall of a tank, the treatment materials entering the gap between the blade and the inner wall of tank are compressed between the edge portion and the inner wall of tank. Then, the treatment materials between the edge portion and the inner wall of tank are sheared by the shearing stress generated by the turn of the blade. Finally, when the edge portion moves away from the inner wall of tank, the treatment materials are released and expand. Since the dispersion operation with the roll mill is conducted through each of compression, shearing, release and expansion steps, the step caused between the frame-shaped blade and the inner wall of tank is considered the same as the dispersion step by the roll mill.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The frame-shaped blades and the tank are constructed in<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> various fashions depending on the purpose. For example, as a frame member of a frame-shaped blade of a planetary mixer described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2000027464A"><text>JP-A-2000-27464</text></patcit>, the upper portion of a vertical side portion is of a straight form, the lower portion of the vertical side portion curves in an arcuate shape towards a bottom portion, and the curved portion is connected to a bottom side portion of a hemispherical frame member in series. In this frame member, a plate-shaped stirring tool is disposed. Further, the tank has a cylindrical side wall, and its bottom face has no corner of acute angle, and in the entirety, it has a configuration that curves in a substantially bowl-like shape corresponding to the bottom side portion of the frame member. In <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2000027464A"><text>JP-A-2000-27464</text></patcit>, the bottom face of this tank is similar to that of a trough of a twin-barrel type kneader as viewed in its cross section shape. In a case of a kneader, the trough is formed in a substantially box-like shape, the kneader blade extends in a horizontal direction along the bottom face of the trough, the turn of the kneader blade makes the treatment materials flow towards a large arcuate face at the bottom of a tank, and therefore treatment materials with a high viscosity can be efficiently mixed and kneaded by compression, shearing and release of the treatment materials between the curved face of tank and the kneader blade like the case of operation with<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the roll mill. On the other hand, in a case of the frame-shaped blades of the planetary mixer, the blade shaft extends in a substantially perpendicular direction to the bottom face of tank and turns in a circumferential direction of the tank, and therefore the vertical side portion of the frame-shaped blade and the curved portion on the bottom side portion do not make the treatment materials flow towards the bottom face of the tank. Accordingly, the shearing force to be applied from the curved portion to the treatment materials is not sufficiently transmitted, and the shearing force per unit area is not large. Accordingly, in a case of a planetary mixer in which the bottom side portion of the frame-shaped blade and the bottom face of the tank axe formed in a large curved form as described above, it is difficult to apply strong shearing action to treatment materials throughout the entire tank, and this mixer is often used for stirring and blending treatment materials of a low viscosity.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">On the other hand, in a planetary mixer described in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP9267032A"><text>JP-A-9-267032</text></patcit>, a tank has a cylindrical side wall and a flat plate-like bottom plate, and the corners of a bottom face of the tank are formed to have a right angle. A frame-shaped blade has a vertical side portion of a straight form extending along the side wall of the tank, and a bottom side portion of a straight<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> form which extends along the bottom plate of the tank, and is connected to the lower portion of the vertical side portion at a right angle. In this case, when the frame-shaped blade turns, since an edge face formed on an outer side face of the vertical side portion moves in close to an inner wall of the tank, the treatment materials are made to flow between the edge face of the vertical side portion and the inner wall of the tank and applied with shearing stress, and at the same time, between the bottom side portion of the blade and the bottom face of the tank as well, the treatment materials entering the between the bottom side portion of the blade and the bottom face of the tank are applied with shearing stress for dispersion treatment by orbital and rotary movement of the blades, and as the results, it is possible to conduct efficient mixing and kneading of the treatment materials of a high viscosity throughout the tank. In such dispersion action, in a case of batch system, the opportunity to apply the shearing stress to the treatment materials between the frame-shaped blade and the inner wall of the tank or the stirring tank is non-continuous. And, in a mixing and kneading machine of which the frame-shaped blades have a planetary motion track, the opportunity is two times per one rotation of the frame-shaped blade.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As described above, in order to effect the mixing and<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> kneading action adequately throughout a tank between the inner face and the bottom face of the tank, it is preferred that a blade extends to such a position where its straight vertical side portion reaches close to the bottom face of the tank, the intersection of the vertical side portion and the bottom side portion of the blade is formed at a right angle, and reflecting this structure, the corner of the bottom face of the tank is also formed at a right angle as described in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP9267032A"><text>JP-A-9-267032</text></patcit>. However, in such a structure, flowability is poor in the vicinity of the right angle corner on the bottom face of the tank. As the results, shearing rate and shearing stress become uneven and the treatment materials tend to gather around the corners or the like, whereby the powder at the time of charging or the treatment materials at the time of mixing and kneading tend to adhere or fix to the corners. Particularly, a situation where the treatment materials of a high viscosity are subjected to strong kneading will be explained below. As one example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.5A</figref>, materials often adhere to the corner on the bottom face of a tank T or to the inner face of the bottom side portion of a blade B. Accordingly, it is required to stop the mixing and kneading operation and scrape the adhered materials (contamination) C. If the mixing and kneading operation is continued without scraping the adhered materials, partial<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> aggregate of powder such as agglomerate and hard agglomerate tend to be caused in a dilution step after strong kneading, and the agglomerates and hard agglomerates are incorporated during the dilution, thereby causing deterioration of quality.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As mentioned above, when the materials adhere and fix to the corners at both ends of the bottom side portion of the frame-shaped blade and the corners on the bottom face of the tank, it is required to stop the mixing and kneading operation and scrape the adhered materials on the blade or the inner bottom portion of the tank. This scraping operation is accompanied with dangers, particularly in a case of the materials adhered or fixed to the corners on the bottom face of the tank, scraping operation by workers is difficult and cumbersome, whereby agglomerates and/or hard agglomerates are likely incorporated. Further, since such scraping operation is necessarily conducted during the mixing and kneading operation, the mixing and kneading operation cannot be continuously carried out. Furthermore, since an opening portion of the tank is opened during the scraping operation, it becomes impossible to tightly close the tank until completion of the mixing and kneading operation. In a case where a volatile organic solvent is used for the mixing and kneading operation, problems of environmental pollution may sometimes be caused by opening the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> tank.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a planetary mixer in which a frame-shaped or rectangularly shaped blade having a vertical side portion and a bottom side portion, both being of a substantially straight form, is moved in a planetary motion in a tank having corners formed on the entire circumference of a bottom face of the tank, shearing stress is applied to treatment materials between the vertical side portion of the blade and an inner face of the tank and between the bottom side portion of the blade and the bottom face of the tank to carry out a treatment such as blending, mixing and kneading, kneading or dispersion as mentioned above, wherein the corners on the bottom face of the tank and the corners at both ends of the bottom side portion of the blade where the materials tend to adhere thereto, are designed not to allow the materials to adhere or fix thereto. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a planetary mixer by which no scraping during the operation is needed to improve safety, treatment times for mixing and kneading, kneading or the like can be shortened, and productivity can be improved without formation of agglomerate and hard agglomerate.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">As mentioned above, it is an object of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> invention to provide a planetary mixer in which uniform shearing stress can be applied at a constant shearing rate to treatment materials throughout t.he circumference of the corners on the bottom face of the tank. Namely, according to the present invention, in a planetary mixer in which solid/liquid type treatment materials are subjected to dispersion, mixing, mixing and kneading by plural frame-shaped blades which orbit and rotate in a tank of which the bottom face is of a flat plate shape and the inner face is of a cylindrical shape, wherein the frame-shaped blades have a vertical side portion extending straight along the inner face of the tank and a bottom side portion extending straight along the bottom face of the tank. The vertical side portion and the bottom side portion of the blade are connected at a right angle at such a position in the vicinity of corners on the bottom face of the tank. The corners at connecting portions at both ends of the blade are formed to have a small curved face, and the corners on the bottom face of the tank are formed to have a curved face in its entire circumference.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Moreover, according to the present invention, at an outer face of the vertical side portion of the frame-shaped blade, a narrow edge portion is formed, and the width of this edge portion is related to the curved face of the corners on the bottom<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> face of the tank. Namely, the radius of curvature of the curved face at the corners on the bottom face of the tank is formed to be about 2 to 4 times the width of the edge portion, preferably the radius is about 2 mm to 15 mm, more preferably the radius is about 3 mm to 10 mm, by which excellent mixing and kneading results can be obtained.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the above structure of the present invention, when the frame-shaped blade orbits and rotates in the tank, the edge face formed on the outer face of the vertical side portion turns in close to the inner face of the tank. By this operation, the materials flowing between the blade and the inner face of the tank are made to enter the gap between the edge face and the inner face of the tank and at the same time, subjected to mixing, mixing and kneading, or the like by the shearing stress caused by the turn, and when the vertical side portion moves away from the inner face of the tank, the materials expand. On the other hand, the materials entering the gap between the bottom side portion and the bottom face of the tank are substantially similarly subjected to mixing and kneading, or mixing, and such mixing and kneading action is conducted in the tank in its entirety throughout the whole length of the vertical side portion and the bottom side portion. In this instance, the corners on the bottom face of the tank are formed to have<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> a curved face over its entire circumference, the flowability at the corners on the bottom face of the tank is not prevented, uniform shearing stress can be applied at a constant shearing rate to the treatment materials over the entire circumference of the tank, and there is no concern that the materials adhere or fix to the corners or the like on the bottom face of the tank. Accordingly, it is no longer needed to conduct an operation of scraping the adhered materials or fixed materials from the corners on the bottom face of the tank or from the frame-shaped blade during the operation as conventionally practiced, and safety can be secured. Further, it becomes possible to solve such a problem that the adhered materials, etc. fall and are incorporated into paste in the form of agglomerate and/or hard agglomerate, whereby it becomes possible to produce paste with excellent properties in a short period of time without formation of agglomerate and/or hard agglomerate and to realize improvement of operability to a great extent. In addition, since there is no need to conduct a scraping operation in the treatment such as mixing or mixing and kneading, it is possible to conduct the operation continuously in such a state that the tank is tightly closed without stopping the mixing and kneading operation. Even with materials containing a volatile organic substance, problems of environmental pollution are not caused,<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> and therefore the flowability can be improved even at the time of dilution, and homogeneity can be obtained earlier.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Specifically, if the radius of curvature of the curved face at the corners on the bottom face of the tank is formed to be about 2 mm to 15 mm, preferably about 3 mm to 10 mm, efficient mixing and kneading operation can be conducted. Namely, when it is formed to be less than 2 mm, the corner on the bottom face of the tank forms a nearly right angle, and the shearing stress cannot reach the deep part of the corner and the mixing and kneading materials may sometimes be locally adhered or fixed. Further, the length of the arc of the curved face at the corner on the bottom face is, on an assumption that the curved face is a part of an arc, it corresponds to the length of one fourth of the entire circumference of a circle having the same radius as the radius of curvature of the curved face, whereby if the radius of curvature exceeds 15 mm, the curved face to which the corner of the blade comes close is substantially widened. Accordingly, the shearing stress per unit area to be applied to the materials gathered around the corners on the bottom face of the tank via the edge portion formed on the outer face of the blade, becomes insufficient, whereby insufficient mixing and kneading or dispersion is brought about and agglomerate or hard agglomerate may sometimes be<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> incorporated in the treatment materials, such being undesirable in view of quality.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Furthermore, according to experiments, as shown in the above-explained <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.5A</figref>, when no curved face is formed at the corners at both ends of the bottom side portion of the frame-shaped blade B and the corners on the bottom face of the tank T, materials tend to adhere to the corners on the bottom face of the tank, and fixed materials C are likely to form. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.5B</figref>, when a curved face is formed only on the blade B side, adhered materials C are seen at the corner on the bottom face of the tank T. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.5C</figref>, when the curved face is formed only at the side of the corner of the bottom face of the tank T, materials adhered on the frame-shaped blade B and fixed thereon. In these cases, it is considered that adherence and fixing are caused because the opposing distance between the corners at both ends on the bottom side portion of the frame-shaped blade and the corners on the bottom face of the tank is not constant, and uniform shearing stress cannot be applied to the materials at a constant shearing rate. On the contrary, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.4</figref>, when small curved faces are formed at corners at both ends of the bottom side portion of the frame-shaped blade and at corners on the bottom face of the tank, the distance between them becomes constant, and uniform<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> shearing stress can be applied to the materials at a constant shearing rate, and as the results, no adhered materials or fixed materials are seen on the blade and tank, and excellent results were obtained.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1</figref> shows a front view showing a partially cutaway view of a planetary mixer.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.2</figref> shows an explanatory view showing the relation between a frame-shaped blade and a tank.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.3</figref> shows a front view showing an example of a frame-shaped blade of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.4</figref> shows an explanatory view showing a partially enlarged view of a tank and a blade of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.5</figref> shows an explanatory views showing the relation between a corner of a bottom side portion of a blade and a corner on a bottom face of a tank. <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.5A</figref> shows a case where no curved face is formed at a corner of a bottom side portion of a blade and a corner on a bottom face of a tank. <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.5B</figref> shows a case where a curved face is formed only at a corner of a bottom side portion of a blade. <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.5C</figref> shows a case where a curved face is formed only at a corner on a bottom face of a tank.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0006"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">The planetary mixer of the present invention may be used<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> for production steps of various products in the fields of chemistry, medicines, electronics, ceramics, foods, feed, etc. A main body 1 of the planetary mixer has a starring head 3 which moves upward and downward above a tank (vessel or stirring tank) 7 by a lifting cylinder 2, or a tank which moves upward and downward below a stirring head by a lifting cylinder (not shown) while the stirring head is fixed. A stirring shaft 5 is driven by a driving means 4 such as a driving motor disposed above the stirring head, and the stirring shaft 5 performs orbital and rotary movement, by which a frame-shaped or rectangularly shaped blade 6 disposed at the lower end of the stirring shaft 5 performs planetary motion in the tank 7 in its entirety. In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1</figref>, in order to simplify this drawing, the stirring shaft 5 and the blade 6 are indicated one by one. However, these are actually used in plural numbers, for example, two or three. The frame-shaped blade 6 is formed into a substantially rectangular frame shape, having an upper side portion 8 which is connected to the stirring shaft 5, a vertical side portion 9 which is connected to both ends of the upper side portion, and a bottom side portion 10 which is connected to the lower end of the vertical side potion at a right angle. The frame-shaped blade may be a frame-shaped blade as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.2</figref> of which the upper side portion 8 and the bottom side portion 10 are arranged in<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> the same direction, or a frame-shaped twisted blade as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.3</figref> of which the directions of the upper side portion 8 and the bottom side portion 10 are different with a predetermined angle, for example, 45° or 90°, or more angle. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1</figref>, a frame-shaped twisted blade as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.3</figref> is shown.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the tank 7 is formed into a cylindrical shape having a flat plate-like bottom 11 and a cylindrical inner face 12, and as the size thereof, various sizes may be prepared, for example, from a small one with a volume of about 0.2 liter to a large one of about 340 liters.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The vertical side portion 9 of the frame-shaped blade 6 is formed straight along the inner face 12 of the tank 7, whereas the vertical side portion of the frame-shaped twisted blade extends along the inner face of the tank while twisting downward. On the outer face of the vertical side portion, a narrow-width edge portion 13 is formed. The bottom side portion 10 connected to both lower ends of the vertical side portion 9 is formed straight along the bottom face 11 of the tank 7. The width of the edge portion 13 is usually formed to be about 2 mm to 6.5 mm although it depends on the size of tank or necessary power.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.4</figref> by an enlarged view, a small curved face is formed at a corner 14 on the bottom face of the tank 7 and<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> corners 15 at both ends as the front end of the connecting portion at which connection is made between the vertical side portion 9 and the bottom side portion 10 of the frame-shaped blade 6, so that the flowability of the materials can be improved at the corners on the bottom face portion of the tank in its entire circumference and the sufficient shearing force can be applied from the edge portion of the blade to the materials. When the radius of curvature of the curved face was about 2 mm to 15 mm, preferably about 3 mm to 10 mm, uniform shearing stress were applied to the materials and excellent results were obtained. Further, it was also found from experiments that excellent results can be obtained when the radius of curvature is formed in a size in proportion to the size of the width of the edge portion 13 of the blade 6, and the best results can be obtained when the radius of curvature is about 2 to 4 times, preferably about 3 times the edge width. In addition, the radius of curvature of the corners 15 at both ends of the bottom side portion of the blade 6 and the curved face formed at the corner on the bottom face 14 of the tank 7, may be the same. However, the radius of curvatures of the curved face formed on the tank and the curved face formed at both ends of the blade may appropriately be changed depending on the driving force of the blade, for example, the radius of curvature at the tank side<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> may be formed larger than the radius of curvature at the blade side.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The planetary mixer is used for various applications as described above. In usual, the treatment materials are subjected to a so-called "powder mixing" when the materials are supplied, and then a small amount of a liquid component is added to the obtained powder and material to conduct a surface treatment of the powder and material. This step is powder mixing and also a step of deactivating the activated powder and material and crashing aggregates. In the next step, a small amount of a liquid component is further added, strong kneading is conducted by a high shearing operation with a high viscosity, and finally the product is diluted and taken out in the form of paste. Since it has been known that the shearing stress is represented by the product of the material's viscosity and the shearing rate and a high shearing force can be obtained by the strong kneading with a high viscosity, it is preferred to conduct the strong kneading as described above.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The materials are subjected to strong kneading by a planetary mixer. It is preferred to conduct the operation under such conditions that the turning speed is about 0.5 to 1.5 m/sec and the temperature is at most about 60°C, so as not to cause deterioration of properties by heat generation of the paste at<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> the time of mixing and kneading. When the turning speed is 1.5 m/sec or higher, the heat is overly generated, and from the aspect of material properties, it becomes difficult to keep the material temperature at 60°C or lower.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The process from the charge of material powder as described above to the dilution to form a paste was carried out by use of the frame-shaped blades and the tank of the above structure of the present invention, using a triaxial planetary mixer having a tank with a volume of 15 liters, manufactured by INOUE MFG., Inc. Even near the corner on the bottom face of the tank, uniform shearing stress can be applied to the materials at a constant shearing rate and it was possible to obtain paste without forming agglomerate and/or hard agglomerate and to conduct dispersion, mixing, mixing and kneading, kneading efficiently. Further, the materials flew along the curved face corner at both ends of the blade and the curved face corner on the bottom face of the tank without causing backwater. The improvement of flow made it possible to avoid the adherence or fixing of materials to the inner face of the blade and the corner on the bottom face of the tank that have been conventionally seen, and no operation for scraping by workers was needed.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56983138" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A planetary mixer in which solid/liquid type treatment materials are subjected to dispersion, mixing, mixing and kneading by plural frame-shaped blades which orbit and rotate in a tank of which the bottom face is of a flat plate shape and the inner face is of a cylindrical shape, <b>characterized in that</b> the frame-shaped blades have a vertical side portion extending straight along the inner face of the tank and a bottom side portion extending straight along the bottom face of the tank, wherein the vertical side portion and the bottom side portion of the blade are connected at a right angle at such a position in the vicinity of corners on the bottom face of the tank, and corners at connecting portions at both ends of the blade are formed to have a small curved face, and the corners on the bottom face of the tank are formed to have a curved face throughout in its entire circumference.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0002" num="0002"><claim-text>The planetary mixer according to Claim 1, wherein at an outer face of the vertical side portion of the frame-shaped blade, a narrow edge portion is formed, and the curved face at the corner on the bottom face of the tank has a radius of curvature of 2 to 4 time the width of the edge.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0003" num="0003"><claim-text>The planetary mixer according to Claim 1, wherein at an outer face of the vertical side portion of the frame-shaped blade,<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> a narrow edge portion is formed, and the curved face at the corner on the bottom face of the tank has a radius of curvature of 3 times the width of the edge.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0004" num="0004"><claim-text>The planetary mixer according to Claim 1, wherein<br/>
