The movable contact 1 is shaped as an L letter with its shorter arm 6, 4 mm in length, fastened in a base plate 2, whereas contact elements 7 of the movable contact 1 and of the fixed contact 4 are made of material having opposite magnetic poles in a contact place. A layer of electrically conducting material (e.g. gold) is put onto the surface of the movable contact 1, the fixed contact 4, and onto the contact elements 7. The longer arm 3 of the movable contact 1 is 25 mm in length and is parallel to the insulating base plate 2.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The longer arm 3 of the movable contact 1 can have two stable positions thanks to contact elements 7 having attraction-oriented magnetic properties.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the first position, the contact elements 7 are situated in a distance one from another, so the magnetic circuit is open.
