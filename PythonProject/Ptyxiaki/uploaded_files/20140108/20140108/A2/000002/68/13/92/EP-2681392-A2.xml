One end of roller tube 14 is typically supported by roller clutch 18 in a window opening 24 and the other end by an idler 26 that provide rotational support of the ends of roller tube 14. Roller clutch 18 may be supported in window 24 opening by a separate bracket (not shown) or integrated with a bracket or otherwise configured to be supported in window opening 24. Window shade 10 may be positioned directly within window opening 24, adjacent to window opening 24, above window opening 24 or otherwise to block sunlight and/or air flow through window opening 24. </p><p id="p0052" num="0052"> [0047] Normally, fabric 16 of window shade 10 is stationary in one of a fully raised position allowing more light to pass through window opening 24 into a room, a fully lowered position allowing less or none of the light to pass through window opening 24 into the room, or in an intermediate position between the fully raised and lowered positions. To change the position of fabric 16, a user pulls either side of bead chain 20 up or down to roll or unroll fabric 16 from roller tube 14. </p><p id="p0053" num="0053">[0048] Bead chain 20 is the preferred embodiment of a continuous loop actuator that extends between tensioner 22 and roller clutch 18.

If lower end 28 of bead chain 20 is properly fixed, roller clutch 18 transmits the force and/or energy to roller tube 14 to raise or lower fabric 16. </p><p id="p0055" num="0055">[0050] According to the preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, roller clutch 18 is configured to detect when tension is applied to bead chain 20 providing an indication that lower end 28 of bead chain 20 is properly fixed. Tensioner 22

 couples bead chain 20 to window opening 24 or other building structure. After installation, tensioner 22 applies a downward force on bead chain 20, which applies tension to bead chain 20. Preferably, roller clutch 18 detects this tension and allows the force and/or energy applied by a user to bead chain 20 to rotate roller tube 14 to raise or lower fabric 16. </p><p id="p0056" num="0056"> [0051] Referring to FIG. 2, an example window shade mount/roller clutch 1 10 is shown having a support end or bracket 1 12 mounted on a portion of window opening 24, a first engagement portion 1 14 coupled to bead chain 20, a second engagement portion 1 16, and a roller support end 1 18 supporting roller 14.

If lower end 28 of bead chain 20 is not coupled to wall opening 24 or another portion of a building structure, first engagement portion 1 14 blocks the transfer of force and/or energy to second engagement portion 1 16 by disengaging from second engagement portion 1 16 or otherwise preventing the force and/or energy from bead chain 20 to roller 14. </p><p id="p0058" num="0058"> [0053] Referring to FIG. 3A, a roller clutch 210 is shown having first engagement portion 214 spaced apart from second engagement portion 216 so that force transmitted by bed chain 20 is not transmitted to second engagement portion 216 so the force and/or energy provided by bed chain 20 does not raise or lower fabric 16 supported by roller 14. A housing 218 (shown in phantom), supports second engagement portion 216 relative to first engagement portion 214.

To assemble springs 714 on cylinder 734, springs 714 are expanded so they will fit over cylinder 734. When released from this expanded, assembly condition, coils 736 grip the exterior of cylinder 734 to create friction therebetween. This friction resists rotation of springs 714 on cylinder 734. As described below in greater detail, springs 714 interact with drive adapter 728 to either rotate roller 14 or block rotation of roller 14. When springs 714 sufficiently grip

When bead chain 20 and chain wheel 718 rotate clutch spring driver 724, one of drive surfaces 742 contact tangs 738 to slightly expand coils 736. This expansion reduces the grip of coils 736 on cylinder 734 and the friction therebetween to allow springs 714 to rotate on cylinder 734. As discussed above, drive adapter 728 will rotate with springs 714 to rotate roller 14 and raise or lower fabric 16. </p><p id="p0084" num="0084"> [0073] The weight of fabric 16 on roller 14 creates rotational force or torque. As shown in FIGS. 18A-18E, drive adapter 728 includes a pair of inwardly extending lugs 744. Unless a user is pulling on bead chain 20, one of lugs 744 presses on one set of respective tangs 738 of springs 714. This force encourages springs 714 to retract further toward cylinder 734, which increases the grip between springs 714 and cylinder 734 to further block rotation of springs 714 on cylinder 734.

When teeth 746, 748 are positioned near the bottom of housing 712 during their rotation, these respective teeth are radially spaced apart so they do not mesh. </p><p id="p0097" num="0097">[0084] As shown in FIG. 13B, teeth 748 of second gear 726 are narrower than teeth 746 of first gear 720. Similarly, the distance and angle between adjacent teeth 748 of second gear 726 is greater than the distance and angle between adjacent teeth 746 of first gear 720. According to the preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, second gear 726 has fewer teeth 748 than first gear 720 has teeth 746. According to the preferred embodiment, second gear 726 has ten teeth 748 and first gear 720 has eleven teeth 746. As shown in FIG. 12, teeth 748 define an outer diameter that is less than an inner diameter defined by teeth 746. </p><p id="p0098" num="0098">[0085] As also shown in FIG. 13B, teeth 746, 748 of first and second gears 720, 726 are dovetail shaped have undercuts. Teeth 746 have radially outer bases that are narrower than the radially inner ends of teeth 746. Similarly, teeth 748 have radially inner bases that are narrower than the radially outer ends of teeth 748. As a result, portions of teeth 748 are "tucked under" portions of teeth 746 when these respective teeth 746, 748 mesh. Thus, portions of radially outer ends of teeth 748 of second gear 726 are radially positioned between portions of the radially inner ends of teeth 746 of first gear 720 and the remainder of first gear 720.

 [0086] As mentioned above, after initial installation, it is possible that bead chain 20 may lose its proper coupling if tensioner 22 is uncoupled from window opening 24 or otherwise. In response, gear separator 730 will disengage first gear 720 of chain ring 716 from second gear 726 by lifting chain ring 716. According to the preferred embodiment, this disengagement does not require any rotation of chain ring 716 or any other component by bead chain 20. Furthermore, this </p><p id="p0099" num="0099">disengagement is independent of the relative rotational position of chain ring 716 relative to housing 712, wrap springs 714, clutch spring driver 724, second gear 726, drive adapter 728, gear separator 730, springs 732, or roller 14. </p><p id="p0100" num="0100">[0087] Although preferred embodiment clutch 710 uses meshing engagement between first gear 720 of chain ring 716 and second gear 726 to transmit movement of the bed chain 20 to roller 14, other types of engagement may be provided. For example, internal gear teeth 746 of chain ring 716 may be replaced with frictional material, such as rubber or a gritty surface, and external gear teeth 748 of gear 726 may be replaced with a frictional material, such as rubber or a gritty surface. </p><p id="p0101" num="0101"> Movement of the frictional surfaces together under the downward force of properly coupled bead chain 20 causes enough frictional engagement between the frictional materials to transmit force and/or energy from bead chain 20 to roller 14. </p><p id="p0102" num="0102">[0088] According to the preferred embodiment, the movement between chain ring 716 and second gear 726 that provides for engagement and disengagement is vertical. According to other embodiments, the movement may be horizontal, as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B and 7A and 7B, or in any other direction. </p><p id="p0103" num="0103">[0089] A preferred embodiment tensioner 822 is shown in FIGS. 19-22C, tensioner 822 includes a base 824, a shuttle assembly 826, and a spring 828 that biases shuttle assembly 826 relative to base 824. Base 824 includes a fastener- receiving aperture 830 for receiving a fastener (not shown) that couples tensioner 822 to a jamb, wall, or other surface of a window opening. Base 824 further includes a spring-receiving pocket 832, a lug 834, and a pair of aligned, pin-receiving apertures 836. During assembly, spring 828 is positioned in spring-receiving pocket

Base 842 includes a pulley shaft 848, a base-receiving pocket 850, and a pair of pin receiving apertures 852. During assembly, pulley 846 is mounted on pulley shaft 848; a pin 838 is inserted through an upper loop 854 of spring 828 and pin- receiving apertures 852 to secure spring 828 to base 842; a portion of bead chain 20 is positioned under pulley 846; and cover 844 is coupled to base 842 of shuttle assembly 826 over base 824 by snapping ramps 856 of cover 844 in snap-apertures 858 of base 842. As a result of coupling cover 844 to base 842 of shuttle assembly 826, bead chain 20 is trapped within tensioner 822. </p><p id="p0105" num="0105"> [0091] Shuttle assembly 826 telescopically receives base 824 and spring 828 biases the combination toward a retracted length. Base 842 of shuttle assembly includes a slot 860 that receives lug 834 of base 824. During the telescopic movement, lug 834 rides in slot 860 to guide shuttle assembly 826. </p><p id="p0106" num="0106"> [0092] During installation, clutch 710 is mounted in a bracket, as discussed above, or otherwise supported in window opening 24. Next, base 824 of tensioner 822 is pulled downward to create tension in bead chain 20. During this tensioning, tensioner 822 telescopically extends and spring 828 stretches. Horizontal lines 827 on base 824 provide a tensioning range on for how much base 824 should be pulled down from shuttle assembly 826 to provide proper tension. Once tensioner 822 applies the appropriate amount of tension on bead chain 20, on or more fasteners (not shown) are extended through fastener-receiving aperture 830 and into window opening 24 to couple bead chain 20 to window opening 24. </p><p id="p0107" num="0107">[0093] During this tensioning, chain ring 716 is pulled down relative to housing 712 against the bias of gear separator 730. This movement engages first gear 720 with second gear 726 to allow bead chain 20 to rotation roller 14. </p><p id="p0108" num="0108">[0094] Another preferred embodiment roller clutch 810 is shown in FIGS. 24- 26.
