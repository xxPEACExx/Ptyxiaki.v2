Typically the water-soluble portion is comprised of water-soluble bulking agent, such as sucrose, and other water-soluble components, such as flavors, sensates, colors, and high intensity sweeteners. Typically the water-insoluble portion is comprised of chewing gum base, which contains a water-insoluble chewing gum non-filler base and a water-insoluble chewing gum base filler. Whereas the water- soluble portion slowly dissolves during chewing and is swallowed, the water-insoluble portion does not dissolve during chewing and is removed from the mouth when mastication is complete. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> [0004] Traditionally, sucrose was used as the water-soluble bulking agent for chewing gums. Sucrose gives volume to a chewing gum mass and slowly dissolves during chewing, which slowly releases sweetness and enhances flavor delivery of the chewing gum. Sucrose has a pleasant flavor, is very soluble, but sucrose has some health related limitations. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 [0005] In recent years, efforts have been made to improve the healthiness of chewing gum products by making the products non-carriogenic and safe for diabetics by replacing the water-soluble bulking agent with ingredients other than sucrose. Dental caries is an infectious disease which damages the structure of teeth. Tooth decay, or cavities, are the consequences of caries. To not create dental caries is to be non-carriogenic. Non-carriogenicity or "toothfriendliness" of a substance such as a saccharide or a saccharide derivative may be determined by means of intraoral pH telemetry such as used by Toothfriendly International, a non-profit organization. In a standard procedure, plaque pH is measured in at least four persons during and for 30 minutes after consumption of a substance to be tested with a plaque-covered electrode. Products which do not lower plaque pH below 5.7, under the test conditions, are considered to lack carriogenic potential. A preferred chewing gum is non-carriogenic. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> [0006] In sucrose-free chewing gums, sucrose typically is replaced with polyols, such as sorbitol, maltitol, isomalt, mannitol, xylitol, and erythritol, which are non- carriogenic. Sorbitol is used commonly due to availability and cost, while maltitol is used due to similarity to sucrose in sweetness and solubility. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> [0007] A disadvantage of most polyols is causation of gastrointestinal disturbances (such as "laxation") upon consumption. Typically, a material is considered not to cause gasto-intestinal disturbances (e.g., non-laxative), if such material is either substantially absorbed before entering the large intestine or passes though the large intestine substantially unchanged, in the quantities present in chewing gum. The amount of gastrointestinal disturbance or laxation distress experienced by a consumer of a chewing gum typically depends on the sensitivity of the consumer, the specific polyol used in the gum, and the amount of gum chewed. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 Erythritol is a polyol that does not cause gastro-intestinal disturbances, but is too expensive for most commercial gum uses. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> [0008] Further, today consumers desire healthy snacks and food products. One ingredient that has been gaining popularity is dietary fiber, sometimes called roughage. Fiber is the indigestible portion of plant foods having two main components: water-soluble fiber and water-insoluble fiber. Both move through the digestive system, absorbing water and making defecation easier. Water-soluble fiber typically contains polysaccharides of varying size including plant components such as dextrin, inulin, and oligosaccharide. Water-soluble fiber are polysaccharides typically having average molecular weights from about 500 and to about 8000, corresponding to 3 to 60 saccharide units. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> [0009] The term water-insoluble fiber typically refers to polysaccharides of varying size, but which are indigestible and are water-insoluble. Water-insoluble fiber often has average molecular weights greater than 8000, corresponding to greater than 60 saccharide units, though polysaccharides of cellulose can be water-insoluble at lower molecular weights. Both starch and non-starch based polysaccharides of various lengths can be heat, enzyme, or chemically treated to make the resulting polysaccharide more or less water-soluble. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> [0010] The American Dietetic Association recommends consumption of a minimum of 20 to 35 grams per day of dietary fiber for a healthy adult. Regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have given approvals for food products making health claims for fiber, based on recognition of the growing scientific evidence for physiological benefits of increased fiber intake. Both water- soluble and water-insoluble fiber has the added advantage over simple sugars of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 being non-carriogenic as it is not digested by enzymes in the mouth into simple sugars. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> [0011] However, water-soluble fibers typically create a slimy, slippery textured fluid in the mouth when combined with saliva during mastication. Thus, a water- soluble bulking agent useful for a chewing gum composed of water-soluble fiber alone as a replacement for sucrose is not suitable for normal consumer use. Also, water-insoluble fiber can create a "chalky" or gritty texture in the mouth as chewing gum containing them is masticated, as some of the insoluble materials break into smaller pieces and are suspended in saliva. Therefore, a preferable chewing gum containing water-soluble and/or water-insoluble fiber also has an acceptable mouthfeel including a non-slimy and non-chalky sensation during consumption. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">[0012] Water-soluble fiber materials that have been used to replace sucrose in sucrose-free chewing gums include refined polydextrose, indigestible dextrin, inulin, and/or fructooligosaccharide. These dietary fibers are water-soluble and dissolve in saliva as the chewing gum is masticated. A reduction in the tendency for slimy mouthfeel (i.e., texture in mouth) can be accomplished by combining the water- soluble fiber with a crystalline, low water solubility, 4 - 7 carbon sugar or polyols, such as erythritol, isomaltulose, and tagatose. These combined water-soluble fiber and crystalline materials can make a commercially acceptable chewing gum, though cost can be prohibitive for many consumers. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> [0013] Therefore, there is a need for an acceptable water-soluble bulking agent for use in chewing gum that will deliver the properties of sucrose in chewing gum, but be less carriogenic and deliver commercially acceptable mouthfeel, flavor and sweetness. Preferably, the water-soluble bulking agent is less expensive to use than 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 sucrose. Preferably, the alternative water-soluble bulking agent contains water- soluble fiber. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> [0014] Consumers buy chewing gum for the pleasure of the physical act of chewing and for the delivery of sweetness and flavor during that chewing experience. Consumers require a certain amount of mass to remain in the mouth during mastication of chewing gum to realize that pleasure of chewing. The mass must be at least in part elastic, that is, it must deform and reform with resistance during mastication. To have that elastic character, the mass must have the ability to be cohesive, that is to remain in mostly a single mass under the mechanical exertion of mastication. Typically, consumers want at least 0.6 g mass, but not more than 4.0 g mass in their mouth while masticating chewing gum. Less mass, and the consumer will not perceive the elastic character of the chewing gum. Water soluble bulking agent may be added to the chewing gum base to create a starting chewing mass weight, but they dissolve and leave behind the water-insoluble portion of the chewing gum, which is eventually removed from the mouth and thrown away. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017"> [0015] Consumers often masticate chewing gum from 5 to 20 minutes, and up to 2 hours in some markets. Traditionally chewing gum contains chewing gum base that provides the material that will remain in the mouth throughout mastication giving mass duration while still being cohesive and elastic in texture. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018">[0016] Traditional chewing gum base is comprised of several materials, including food-compatible elastomers, resins, fats and oils, waxes, softeners and gum base fillers. Gum base fillers have been used to reduce the amount of food-compatible elastomers, resins, fats and oils, waxes, softeners used in a chewing gum, as gum base filler materials are less expensive. Typical gum base fillers are inorganic materials, such as calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, talc, or declaim 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
 phosphate, that are added to the chewing gum to replace part of the mass of the chewing gum base. These gum base fillers are not elastic, nor create cohesiveness. Too much gum base filler could interfere with the elastomer and reduce chewing gum elasticity and cohesiveness. As the chewing gum is masticated, these gum base fillers are water insoluble and, for the most part, remain trapped with the rest of the water-insoluble chewing gum materials until the remaining mass is removed from the mouth. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019"> [0017] Efforts have been made to improve the healthiness of chewing gum products by replacing at least a portion of the chewing gum base with a material of nutritive value. The challenge has been providing alternative chewing gum base materials that will deliver the required finished chewing gum properties of mass duration, cohesiveness and elasticity during mastication. Proteins, such as gluten, have been added to chewing gum as full or partial replacement for the chewing gum non-filler base materials. Proteins can provide some cohesiveness and elastic texture initially, but proteins breakdown during mastication, mix with saliva, and are swallowed early in the chewing experience and do not create mass duration. These properties can limit the ability of proteins to provide elasticity and cohesion throughout the chewing experience. </p><p id="p0020" num="0020"> [0018] Therefore there is a need for an alternative water-insoluble chewing gum base filler material to be used as a full or partial replacement of traditional chewing gum base ingredients of food-compatible elastomers, resins, fats and oils, waxes, softeners, and inorganic fillers, while delivering chewing gum with commercially acceptable elasticity and cohesion and additionally being more nutritive than traditional chewing gum. Lower cost would be an added benefit.

 SUMMARY OF THE I NVENTION </p><p id="p0021" num="0021">[0019] A chewing gum composition containing at least 25 wt.% water-soluble portion containing a least one simple sugar and at least one water-soluble fiber; and at least 25 wt.% water-insoluble portion containing at least 10 wt.% chewing gum bas filler and at least 10 wt.% chewing gum non-filler base composition. Such a combination of water-soluble and water-insoluble materials produces a healthy amount of fiber, while creating a chewing gum with an acceptable mass duration, elasticity, cohesion, flavor delivery, and sweetness delivery. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022">DETAILED DESCRI PTION OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0023" num="0023">[0020] In embodiments of this invention, certain bulking agents are incorporated into chewing gum such that the final chewing gum product has commercially acceptable mass duration, chewing texture (including cohesiveness and elasticity), and mouthfeel, along with a acceptable flavor and sweetness delivery. In further embodiments of this invention, the bulking agents have the additional benefits of being less carriogenic than sucrose, and/or containing fiber. More specifically, embodiments of this invention relate to improved formulations for chewing gum. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024">[0021 ] As used herein, the term "chewing gum" also includes bubble gum and confectionery products containing chewing gum. Unless otherwise specified, all percentages used herein are weight percents. As used herein, chewing gum base contains a gum non-filler base portion and a gum base filler portion. </p><p id="p0025" num="0025"> [0022] A chewing gum composition typically contains a water-soluble portion and a water-insoluble portion. The water-soluble portion comprises water-soluble bulking agent and other water-soluble materials, such as flavors, colors, sensates and high

 intensity sweeteners. The water-soluble portion dissolves in saliva as the chewing gum is masticated, carrying in the resulting syrup the water-soluble flavor and sweetness during mastication. The water-insoluble portion of chewing gum remains in the mouth during the mastication experience and gives the chewing gum mass duration, cohesiveness, and elasticity without objectionable mouth feel. Traditionally, chewing gum base, including food-compatible elastomers, resins, fats and oils, waxes, softeners and gum base fillers provides these characteristics. </p><p id="p0026" num="0026">[0023] In embodiments of this invention conventional chewing gum water-soluble bulking agent and/or water-insoluble gum base filler are replaced by a combination of water-soluble and/or water-insoluble materials such that the finished chewing gum product is less carriogenic than traditional chewing gum containing sucrose as the only water-soluble agent, and yet has commercially acceptable mass duration, cohesiveness, elasticity, mouthfeel, and flavor and sweetness delivery during the mastication. </p><p id="p0027" num="0027">[0024] Typical chewing gum composition contains at least 5 wt.% of a water- soluble bulking agent. Further, typical chewing gum composition contains up to 95 wt.% of a water-soluble bulking agent . Typical ranges of water-soluble bulking agent in a chewing gum include 15 to 95 wt.%, preferably 65 to 75 wt.%. The traditional function of the water-soluble bulking agent is to provide volume to the gum mass and to act to transport at an acceptable rate water-soluble flavors and sweeteners within a person's mouth throughout the chewing process. Conventional water-soluble bulking agents, such as sucrose, have usually been dissolved and swallowed within the first 3 - 12 minutes of chewing.

 [0025] In an embodiment of the invention, the water-soluble bulking agent may constitute between 15 wt.% to about 99% of the water soluble portion of the chewing gum. Preferably, the water-soluble bulking agent comprises about 90-99% of the water-soluble portion of the chewing gum. </p><p id="p0028" num="0028">[0026] Sucrose is the most commonly used water-soluble bulking agent in chewing gum. Sucrose gives a clean, sweet flavor, is relatively inexpensive, and provides a syrup in the mouth to carry sweetness and flavor during mastication. The water-soluble portion of a chewing gum typically also includes other water-soluble materials, such as high intensity sweeteners, flavors and sensates. Flavoring agents can include flavor intensifying agents, and flavor masking agents. Flavoring agents can be natural or artificial, and can be neat or encapsulated. </p><p id="p0029" num="0029"> [0027] Ingestion of sucrose can cause an increase in blood glucose levels. In the growing interest by consumers in healthy snacks and confections, several alternative materials have been explored as replacements for sucrose that would cause less increase in blood glucose levels. Sucrose can be replaced by fructose as a more healthy water-soluble bulking agent, as fructose causes less increase in blood glucose levels than sucrose making it healthier for diabetics. However, fructose is still carriogenic. </p><p id="p0030" num="0030"> [0028] Polyols have been used to replace sucrose as the water-soluble bulking agent in chewing gum. Polyols are water-soluble, non-carriogenic and safe for diabetics, but most polyols can cause gastro-intestinal disturbances. </p><p id="p0031" num="0031">[0029] In general, a saccharide is a carbohydrate described as a simple sugar, a combination of sugars, or polymerized sugars. Simple sugars typically contain four to seven carbon atoms with a formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>O<sub>n</sub>. Examples of simple sugars include glucose, fructose, lactose, ribose, xylose, mannose, arabinose, and galactose and 
<!-- EPO <DP n="11"/>-->
 typically are characterized as aldehydes or ketones (aldose or ketoses), which exist in linear or cyclic hemi-acetal or ketal configurations. Combinations of monosaccharides or simple sugars form di-saccharides (such as sucrose) and polysaccharides (such as starches and cellulose). Hydrogenated derivatives of mono-saccharides include sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, mannitol, and xylitol. A disaccharide contains two saccharide units and a polysaccharide contains more than two saccharide units. </p><p id="p0032" num="0032"> [0030] A water-soluble bulking agent material useful in embodiments of this invention is one or more water-soluble polysaccharide compositions recognized as water-soluble fiber. These polysaccharides are characterized as typically containing at least three, preferably up to sixty, polysaccharide units. These could be polysaccharides of starch or cellulose that have been heat, chemical, and/or enzyme treated to make them water-soluble. Additionally, water-soluble fiber does not contribute to dental caries (i.e. non-carriogenic) because such dietary fibers are not metabolized by bacteria in the mouth. Further, such dietary fiber does not cause gastrointestinal disturbances in the amounts used in chewing gum. Finally, dietary fiber is low in calories due to its limited digestibility. Non-limiting, but preferred, examples of such dietary fiber useful in embodiments of this invention include inulin, fructooligosaccharide, and indigestible dextrin. </p><p id="p0033" num="0033">[0031] A water-soluble bulking agent component useful in embodiments of this invention is one or more water-soluble food hydrocolloids. A food hydrocolloid is a water-soluble, nonstarch, noncellulose polysaccharide, which have the ability to create gel structures in aqueous environments. A non-limiting list of hydrocolloid materials include pectin, carrageenan gum, locust bean gum, xanthan gum, agar, gum acacia, chitosan, and various combinations thereof. Hydrocolloids, in native or

Physical form and addition of additional materials to the chewing gum, such as calcium or food grade acid, will affect the solubility of the hydrocolloids added to the chewing gum. The less water-soluble the hydrocolloid, the longer it will stay in the mouth and add to the cohesiveness and elasticity of the full chewing gum mass. </p><p id="p0034" num="0034"> [0032] In an embodiment of this invention, a chewing gum composition comprises a water-soluble portion, containing a water-soluble bulking agent; and a water- insoluble portion, containing a water-insoluble chewing gum non-filler base composition and a water-insoluble chewing gum filler base containing water-insoluble fiber, wherein the water-insoluble chewing gum filler base contains polysaccharide and the water-soluble chewing gum non-filler base composition contains food- compatible elastomers, resins, fats and oils, waxes, and softeners.

In a further embodiment of this invention, the water-insoluble bulking agent is sourced from plant materials, such as sugar cane, sugar beet, coconut, fruit, vegetable, grain, or bean. The water-insoluble bulking agent could be from various parts of a plant including fruit, seed, shell, stem, stalk, root, bark, or combinations thereof. </p><p id="p0046" num="0046"> [0044] Plant materials contain various polysaccharides (such as, simple sugars, starch, cellulose, and combinations thereof) in various amounts depending on the plant source (such as sugar cane, sugar beet, coconut, fruit, vegetable, grain, or bean), part of plant (such as fruit, seed, shell, stem, stalk, root, or bark), and amount of processing (such as heating, grinding, extracting, or treating chemicals or enzymes). Many plants, such as sugar cane, sugar beets, coconut, fruit, vegetable, grain, and beans, are processed by manufactures in order to extract sugars, starch, hydrocolloids, or flavors. After processing, the plant matter remains that mostly contains water-insoluble polysaccharide material. As such remaining plant matter is a byproduct of the primary production, these water-insoluble materials are often considered waste, or are used as part of animal feed. These plant materials may also contain residual water-soluble hydrocolloid materials, such as, but not limited to pectin, carrageenan gum, locust bean gum, xanthan gum, agar, gum acacia, chitosan, and combinations thereof.

Preferably, this plant material would replace part of the water-insoluble chewing gum base composition of chewing gum, creating a less expensive final chewing gum product. As the plant material is fiber, it has a greater nutritional value than that of the chewing gum base material it replaces. </p><p id="p0047" num="0047">[0046] Chewing the plant byproduct insoluble material would be similar to chewing the soft base of a blade of grass, straw, sun flower seed shells, pumpkin seed shells, or orange rind. Mastication eventually breaks some of the cellulose and starch based polysaccharide matter into small enough pieces to be mixed with saliva and swallowed, but most of the matter remains in the mouth during chewing. Plant matter would have a range of inherent elasticity depending on its source and related content. Fruit byproduct plant matter could contain some form of gellable pectin or other hydrocolloid, whereas, wheat grain plant matter could contain a form of inflexible bran.

Thus, the amount of breakdown could be adjusted so as to meet commercial acceptance towards mass duration, elasticity, and cohesion during mastication.
