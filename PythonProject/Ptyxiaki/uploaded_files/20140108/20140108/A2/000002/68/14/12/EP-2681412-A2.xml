In such operations, after an oil or gas well has been drilled, it is desirable to determine the flow rates of the various constituents of the well fluid. For example, the well fluid may be a two-phase, three- phase or four-phase fluid including oil, gas, solids and water. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> [0004] Typically, the well fluid stream is flowed from the well through a surface test tree at the wellhead. This fluid stream then passes through a choke manifold including one or more valves which are used to accurately throttle the flow from the well so that the fluid pressure downstream from the choke manifold is reduced. The fluid stream is then flowed into a processing facility including a heater and a separator, both sized to accommodate the appropriate flow. The heater is used to maintain the fluid stream at a temperature suitable to enable the desired fluid mobility. This is particularly important in fluid streams containing heavy oils, such as oils having a specific gravity below 22.3° as classified by the American Petroleum Institute. The separator separates the fluid into its constituents such as gas, oil and water constituents. The separated constituents are flowed out of the separator in individual lines. The flow rate of the constituent in each line is measured, so that the operator will know the relative amounts of each. After these measurements are made, the gas constituent is typically flared, the water constituent is directed to a treatment or disposal location and the oil constituent is pumped to a burner for elimination. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 [0005] It has been found, however, that due to the high viscosity of the oil constituent, particularly in fluid streams having heavy oils, the mobility of the oil constituent may be unacceptably low to enable pumping to the burner. One way to improve the mobility of the oil constituent is to add a lighter hydrocarbon liquid, referred to herein as diesel, to the oil constituent to generate a mixture having a lower viscosity than the original oil constituent such that the thinned oil can be more easily transported to the burner. It has been found, however, that mixing diesel into the oil constituent is wasteful of the diesel as it is burned with the oil constituent without delivering any useful work. In addition, use of diesel for mixing with the oil constituent requires expensive transportation and storage of the diesel which is particularly significant when the exploratory well is drilled at a remote, inaccessible location. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> [0006] Accordingly, a need has arisen for an apparatus and method for determining the flow rates of the constituent fluids in a multiphase well fluid stream from an exploratory well. A need has also arisen for such an apparatus and method that is operable to maintain suitable mobility of the oil constituent even in fluid streams having heavy oils while minimizing or eliminating the requirement of mixing diesel into the oil constituent. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">[0007] The present invention disclosed herein is directed to a surface well testing facility for dispersing separated hydrocarbon gas into separated oil for improved oil mobility.

The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention, and do not delimit the scope of the present invention. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022">[0018] Referring initially to figure 1, therein is depicted a surface well testing facility operable to disperse separated hydrocarbon gas into separated oil from a multiphase well fluid according to an embodiment of the present invention that is schematically illustrated and generally designated 100. Surface well testing facility 100 includes a wellhead 112 positioned above a subterranean well 114. A surface test tree 116 is connected to wellhead 112. Surface test tree 116 includes a plurality of valves for controlling fluid flow into or out of well 114. </p><p id="p0023" num="0023"> [0019] A flow line 118 extends from surface test tree 116 to transport a multiphase well fluid produced from well 114 for processing. In the illustrated embodiment, flow line 118 includes a well monitoring assembly 120 including, for example, access points for gauges, such as pressure sensors, temperature sensors, sand detection sensors, flow rate sensors, flow composition sensors and the like. In addition, flow line 118 includes a choke manifold 122 which includes one or more valves that are used to accurately throttle the flow from the well so that the fluid pressure downstream from choke manifold 122 is reduced to a desired pressure. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024"> [0020] Downstream from choke manifold 122 is a separator 124 in which the various constituents of the well fluid are separated. In the illustrated embodiment, separator 124 is depicted as a system for handling a three-phase fluid; namely, a fluid having a gas 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 constituent, an oil constituent and a water constituent. Separator 124 includes a gas line 126 discharging from the top of separator 124, an oil line 128 discharging from an intermediate portion of separator 124 and a water line 130 discharging near the bottom of separator 124. An orifice-type gas flow meter 132 is disposed in gas line 126, a volumetric oil flow meter 134 is disposed in oil line 128 and a volumetric water flow meter 136 is disposed in water line 130. Preferably, water line 130 is directed to a tank or other facility in which the water may be treated for later disposal. </p><p id="p0025" num="0025"> [0021] In the illustrated embodiment, the oil constituent in oil line 128 is directed to a pumping facility 138 that is depicted as including two centrifugal pumps 140, 142. Pumps 140, 142 may be run in parallel or may be operated independently depending upon the operating configuration of valves 144a-d. Preferably, rotating impellers inside of pumps 140, 142 increase the pressure and flow rate of the oil constituent such that it can be transported in oil discharge line 146 to an oil burner 148 having suitable oil gun nozzles to enable burning of the oil constituent. Preferably, air is mixed with the oil constituent proximate to oil burner 148. The air is provided from an air injection system 150, which may inject the air tangentially to the oil constituent to create a swirling action therebetween and improve the dispersion of the air in the oil constituent. Alternatively or additionally, nozzles or other mechanical mixing elements may be used to further promote air dispersion in the oil constituent to improve the combustion efficiency of the mixture. Preferably, oil burner 148 is positioned at a distal end of a boom. In the illustrated embodiment, discharge line 146 includes flow control components such as a valve 152 and a regulator 154. Alternatively, the oil constituent may be returned to separator 124 via an oil bypass line 156 that includes flow control components such as a valve 158 and a regulator 160. </p><p id="p0026" num="0026"> [0022] In the illustrated embodiment, the gas constituent in gas line 126 may be directed to a flare 162 through which the gas constituent is flared to the atmosphere. Preferably, gas line 126 includes flow control components such as a valve 164 and a regulator 166. Alternatively or additionally, the gas constituent in gas line 126 may be directed to a gas injection line 168 that includes flow control components such as a valve 170 and a regulator 172 and/or a gas injection line 174 that includes flow control components such as a valve 176 and a regulator 178. Specifically, depending upon the configuration of valves 164, 170 and 176, some or all of the gas constituent in gas line 126 may be directed flare 162, pump 140 and/or pump 142. As illustrated, gas injection line 168 injects the gas constituent into the oil constituent at a location upstream of pump 142 and preferably proximate to pump 142 at its inlet header. Likewise, gas injection line 174 injects the gas constituent into the oil 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
 constituent at a location upstream of pump 140 and preferably proximate to pump 140 at its inlet header. During the gas constituent injection process, valves 144a-d are configured to enable the desired mixing of the gas constituent with the oil constituent. For example, depending upon the volumes of the constituents, it may be desirable to close valves 144a, 144b and 176. In this configuration, the rotating impeller inside of pump 142 not only increases the pressure and flow rate of the oil constituent but also mixes the gas constituent with the oil constituent such that the gas constituent is dispersed into the oil constituent. Alternatively, the mixing and dispersing process could take place in pump 140 or, as another alternative, portions of both the gas constituent and the oil constituent could be directed to each of pumps 140 and 142 for mixing and dispersing. </p><p id="p0027" num="0027"> [0023] The dispersing of the gas constituent into the oil constituent forms an oil/gas mixture having a viscosity that is lower than the undesirable viscosity of the oil constituent by creating a generally homogeneous mixture wherein the gas constituent may be entrained in or dissolved in the oil constituent or by creating a generally colloidal relationship between the gas constituent and the oil constituent. Reducing the viscosity of the oil constituent by dispersing the gas constituent therein reduces or eliminates the need to add diesel into the oil constituent to maintain suitable mobility of the oil constituent, particularly in a fluid stream having heavy oils. </p><p id="p0028" num="0028"> [0024] Even though figure 1 has depicted pumping facility 138 as having a particular number of pumps, those skilled in the art will recognize that a pumping facility for increasing the pressure and flow rate of the oil constituent and mixing the gas constituent with the oil constituent could have other numbers of pumps both greater than and less than that which is shown without departing from the principles of the present invention. </p><p id="p0029" num="0029"> [0025] Referring next to figure 2, therein is depicted a surface well testing facility operable to disperse separated hydrocarbon gas into separated oil from a multiphase well fluid according to an embodiment of the present invention that is schematically illustrated and generally designated 200. Surface well testing facility 200 includes a wellhead 212 positioned above a subterranean well 214. A surface test tree 216 is connected to wellhead 212. A flow line 218 extends from surface test tree 216 to transport a multiphase well fluid produced from well 214 for processing. In the illustrated embodiment, flow line 218 includes a well monitoring assembly 220 and a choke manifold 222. </p><p id="p0030" num="0030"> [0026] Downstream from choke manifold 222 is a separator 224 in which the various constituents of the well fluid are separated.

 [0039] In the illustrated embodiment, all or a portion of the gas constituent in gas line 426 is directed to oil burner 448 through which the gas constituent is burned with the oil constituent. Preferably, the gas constituent is injected tangentially into the oil constituent proximate to oil burner 448 such as at a location near the bottom of the boom. By tangentially directing the gas constituent into the oil constituent, improved dispersion of the gas constituent is achieved due to the swirling action therebetween. Alternatively or additionally, one or more nozzles such as venturi nozzles having converging/di verging profiles may be used to inject the gas constituent into the oil constituent to aid in the dispersion of the gas constituent into the oil constituent. Also, vanes or other mechanical mixing elements may be used to aid in the dispersion of the gas constituent into the oil constituent. Adding the gas constituent into the oil constituent not only improves the mobility of the oil constituent by forming an oil/gas mixture having a viscosity that is lower than the undesirable viscosity of the oil constituent but also creates an oil/gas mixture having a BTU content that is higher than the BTU content of the oil constituent enabling a more efficient flame front for complete combustion of the oil/gas mixture. </p><p id="p0043" num="0043"> [0040] For example, all or a portion of the gas constituent from gas line 426 may be directed to gas injection line 464 that includes flow control components such as a valve 466 and a regulator 468. With proper configuration of valves 444a-d, 466, 470 and 472, high pressure gas is directed to gas line 426 downstream of valve 470 and routed to oil burner 448. Alternatively, as described above, all or a portion of the gas constituent may be injected into the oil constituent at a location upstream of pump 442 such that the rotating impeller inside of pump 442 not only increase the pressure and flow rate of the oil constituent but also mixes the gas constituent with the oil constituent such that the gas constituent is dispersed into the oil constituent. Dispersing the gas constituent into the oil constituent forms an oil/gas mixture having a viscosity that is lower than the undesirable viscosity of the oil constituent which reduces or eliminates the need to add diesel into the oil constituent to maintain suitable mobility of the oil constituent, particularly in a fluid stream having heavy oils. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044">[0041] While this invention has been described with reference to illustrative embodiments, this description is not intended to be construed in a limiting sense.
