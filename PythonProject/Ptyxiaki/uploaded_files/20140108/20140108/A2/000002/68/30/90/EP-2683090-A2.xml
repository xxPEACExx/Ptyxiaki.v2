Particularly, when an input signal for operation the NFC control module 170 is received, the controller 160 outputs a control signal for operating a corresponding function to the NFC control module 170. The controller 160 also controls to output various images and videos related to operation of the NFC control module 170. For example, the controller 160 receives a signal<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> corresponding to whether to operate a short range wireless communication function in a manual mode or in an automatic mode from the input unit 120 or preset schedule information and outputs the signal to the NFC control module 170.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The NFC control module 170 controls the switch 180 according to a signal output from the controller 160 to perform signal radiation and signal reception for a short range wireless communication function operation via a specific antenna in the antenna module 200. In more detail, when the NFC control module 170 receives a manual mode setting signal and a signal that instructs a specific antenna from the controller 160, the NFC control module 170 controls the switch 180 to select an antenna corresponding to the signal of the antenna module 200. The NFC control module 170 stands by transmission and reception of a previously defined signal based on the selected antenna. When a corresponding signal is not received for a preset data transmission and reception operation cycle time, the NFC control module 170 outputs a message thereof, for example a communication channel forming failure message to the controller 160.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">When a failure message indicating not being able to operate a short range wireless communication function via a specific antenna is received in a manual mode state from the NFC control module 170, the controller 160 controls the display unit 140 to output the notification. The user recognizes that a short range wireless communication function cannot be operated through a specific antenna designated by the user or preset schedule information from the above notification, and performs an additional operation for selecting another antenna.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">When the NFC control module 170 receives a control signal that instructs to operate an automatic mode-based short range wireless communication module function from the controller 160, the NFC control module 170 operates a communication function according to an automatic mode. This is, the NFC control module 170 selects a specific antenna of the antenna module 200 according to preset schedule information, and transmits and receives a signal necessary for a short range wireless communication function operation based on the selected antenna. In this case, when a normal signal is transmitted and received in an operation process via a corresponding antenna, the NFC control module 170 outputs a notification message thereof to the controller 160.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">When transmission and reception of a signal based on a specific antenna is not normally performed, the NFC control module 170 outputs a failure message. For example, when preset data reception for data transmission defined for communication connection is not performed within a data transmission and reception operation cycle of a short range wireless communication module, the NFC control module 170 outputs a failure message to the controller 160. After a corresponding operation cycle has elapsed, the NFC control module 170 controls the switch 180 to automatically select unselected another antenna in the antenna module 200. The NFC control module 170 transmits and receives a specific data signal through unselected another antenna. Here, when a communication connection attempt through operation of an individual antenna is failed, the NFC control module 170 controls to complexly operate antennas, which is described later in detail with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">When a notification message indicating the establishment of a short range wireless communication is received from the NFC control module 170, the controller 160 outputs the message to the display unit 140 to notify normal operation of a short range wireless communication function. Alternatively, when a specific antenna-based short range wireless communication by the NFC control module 170 is failed, the controller 160 controls to outputs a failure message corresponding thereto and to display a message informing that short range wireless communication channel formation is being attempted using another antenna.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The antenna module 200 includes a first NFC antenna 201 and a second NFC antenna 202 connected to the switch 180.

The first NFC antenna 201 and the second NFC antenna 202 can be formed in respective predetermined patterns and can be mounted and disposed in a form such as a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) or can be directly disposed at a specific position of the terminal 100.

Further, in the touch panel 80 for panel operation, since a predetermined frequency signal is supplied, an interference phenomenon between the touch panel 80 and the first NFC antenna 201 can occur. Accordingly, by partially removing a portion in which the first NFC antenna 201 is disposed in a shape of the touch panel 80, the terminal 100 is designed to prevent that the touch panel 80 and the first NFC antenna 201 are substantially overlapped. The second NFC antenna 202 is disposed at a portion of the inside of the rear case 60 of the display panel 70 and does not occur interference phenomenon with the touch panel 80. In <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the switch 180 and the NFC control module 170 are disposed at separate space, but the switch 180 and the NFC control module 170 can be substantially disposed at a predetermined area of a lower portion of the display panel 70 and the inside of the case 60.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In the terminal 100 designed to have the above-described structure, the first NFC antenna 201 is disposed at, for example, an upper end portion of a front side of the terminal 100, and the second NFC antenna 202 is disposed at, for example, an upper end portion of a rear side of the terminal 100. Here, the second NFC antenna 202 is disposed at one side of the case 60 disposed at a rear surface and can be disposed at various areas on the side intended by a designer, for example at least one portion of a lower end portion of a rear side or a lateral edge of a rear side depending on a position in which the first NFC antenna 201 is disposed as well as an upper end portion of a rear side. Alternatively, the second NFC antenna 202 can be disposed in a central portion of the case 60.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Accordingly, when a user wants to manually operate the second NFC antenna 202 while operating a short range wireless function of the terminal 100, the user can determine a disposition of a corresponding antenna and adaptively operate the second NFC antenna 202 based on the position operation. In a manual mode to select an NFC antenna of the terminal 100, it is necessary to determine a position of the antenna and thus the terminal 100 can provide the information on a screen. This is,<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> when the user selects a specific short range wireless antenna, the terminal 100 of the embodiment can notify through an image or a text that each antenna belonging to the antenna module 200 is disposed at which position of the terminal 100.

Similarly, because the second NFC antenna 202 can be disposed at the center of a rear surface or an upper end direction of a rear surface of the terminal 100, it is preferable that another short range wireless responder is disposed opposite to an upper end portion of the rear surface or opposite to the center of the rear surface.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Therefore, in a state in which the terminal 100 presently operates based on the first NFC antenna 201, when another short range wireless responder is disposed at an upper end portion or at the center of the rear surface of the terminal 100, it can be difficult to form an appropriate communication channel. When the terminal 100 of the embodiment operates in an automatic mode in such a environment, if the terminal 100 attempts and fails a communication connection based on the first NFC antenna 201 for a certain number of cycles of data transmission and reception operation in a short range wireless module, the terminal 100 performs a communication connection by automatically converting a communication connection based on the second NFC antenna 202. Therefore, the user can smoothly use a short range wireless function without a manual antenna manipulation or a search of a failure cause of a communication connection.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">As the terminal 100 provides a holding method or position of the terminal 100 in which the user habitually has in a specific short range wireless function in which the user generally uses through operation of a manual mode, the user can conveniently use a short range wireless function without a manual automatic manipulation.

When wanting to integrate and operate the first NFC antenna 201 and the second NFC antenna 202, the switching module 182 performs a function of electrically connecting two antennas, and the terminal 100 can further include an element for performing impedance matching of antennas. Further, a frequency performance of an antenna is affected by antenna length increase by an electrical connection of two antennas and thus the terminal 100 can further include a filter element for adjusting a frequency performance of an antenna.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Further, when the first NFC antenna 201 and the second NFC antenna 202 are connected using the switching module 182, in order to maintain good communication efficiency, the NFC control module 170 transmits a communication signal with a relatively higher output than that of an embodiment in which either one antenna operates. Therefore, in the terminal 100 of the present exemplary embodiment, by integrating and operating the first NFC antenna 201 and the second NFC antenna 202, damage occurs, but a better signal environment can be provided through, for example, additional power supply and a disposition of additional elements.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">When a short range wireless communication module is an NFC module, a cycle for one data transmission and reception operation can be 333 milliseconds, and thus an operation cycle of the switch 180 or the first switch 181 can be a unit of 333 milliseconds.

In this case, when the number of antennas included in the antenna module 200 increases, the terminal 100 performs signal transmission and standby necessary for determining whether communication connection of more antennas is available according to a corresponding data transmission and reception operation cycle. For example, when four (4) short range wireless antennas are disposed, the terminal 100 can perform a signal processing for determining whether each antenna can perform communication connection in a unit of 333 milliseconds or in a unit of the integer times of 333 milliseconds.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Here, four antennas can be disposed in at least two locations of an upper end portion of the front surface, a lower end portion of a front surface, an upper end portion of a rear surface, and a lower end portion of a rear surface of the terminal 100<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> and can be disposed in at least one of an upper end portion and a lower end portion of a side surface according to a designer's intention. Further, the switching module 182 can be provided in a form that connects at least two of the four antennas and thus the terminal 100 can control to use an integrated antenna of a form in which at least two antennas are connected for short range wireless, as needed. In this case, the terminal 100 can supply requested additional power according to the increased antenna number, and a designer can perform an additional design for frequency matching necessary for forming a short range wireless channel by connecting the more number of antennas.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In the foregoing description, for a short range wireless module operation, a data transmission and reception operation cycle with a unit of 333 milliseconds has been described, however the present disclosure is not limited thereto.

For example, in order to form a channel, when the short range wireless module is designed to transmit and receive a signal in a unit of 200 milliseconds, the data transmission and reception operation cycle can be determined in a unit of 200 milliseconds or the integer times of 200 milliseconds.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In the terminal 100 of the present exemplary embodiment, the same short range wireless module can be set to have different operation cycles according to the number of short range wireless antennas included in the antenna module 200. For example, in the antenna module 200 including 4 short range wireless antennas, the terminal 100 can control a switching time upon the communication failure for 2N times (N is a positive integer) of a data transmission and reception operation cycle defined in a corresponding short range wireless module. In the antenna module 200 including two short range wireless antennas, the terminal 100 can control the switching time by adjusting the number N of data transmission and reception operation cycles. That is, when the terminal 100 includes relatively many short range wireless antennas, the terminal 100 can determine an operation cycle unit switching time in a form that reduces a delay time, and when the terminal 100 includes relatively few short range wireless antennas, for reliability security of communication availability of each antenna, the terminal 100 can determine a switching time in a form of increasing a communication availability determination time of a specific antenna.
