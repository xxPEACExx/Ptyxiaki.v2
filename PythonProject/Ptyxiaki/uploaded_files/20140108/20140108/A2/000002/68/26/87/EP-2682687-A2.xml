However, certain vents cannot be sealed, such as those associated with boilers, where even closing the vent temporarily would cause the boiler to shut down.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a vent protector which overcome, or at least ameliorates, the above-mentioned problems.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">According to the present invention there is provided a vent protector comprising a first section and a second section, both sections being adapted to be secured to a wall of a building, the first section being sealable to the building wall so as to have an open top and a non-return valve in a lower region thereof to allow liquid to escape from within the first section; and the second section being adapted to extend across the open top of the first section.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A lower wall of the first section may be inclined so as to extend outwardly relative to the first section, the non-return valve being provided in the inclined lower wall.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The first section may include an outwardly extending flange for securing the first section to the building wall. A seal may be provided for insertion between the flange and the building wall. The seal may be made of neoprene rubber or a similar material.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The second section may have a greater cross-sectional area than the first section so as to extend beyond the periphery of the first section. The second section may include a sloping top. A flange may extend upwardly from the sloping top to enable the second section to be secured to the building wall. A seal may be provided for insertion between the flange and the building wall.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">For a better understanding of the present invention and to show more clearly how it may be carried into effect reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings in which:</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a perspective view of one embodiment of a vent protector<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> according to the present invention;</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is a front view of the vent protector shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>; and</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> is a side view of the vent protector shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The vent protector shown in the figures comprises a lower section 1 and an upper section 3. The lower section 1 is in the form of a trough which is open at its upper end, while the upper section 3 has a greater cross-sectional area than the lower section 1 so as to extend beyond the periphery of the lower section and to shield the lower section against the ingress of rain or the like.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The lower section 1 has, in use, a generally rectangular cross-section with a wall of a building forming on of the sides of the cross-section. The side walls 5 and an outer wall 7 of the lower section are substantially planar. A lower wall 9 (or base) of the lower section is inclined and extends outwardly to a one-way (non-return) valve 11 which allows water or other liquid to flow out of the base of the lower section 1. An outwardly extending flange 13 is provided around the sides and base of the lower section and in use is secured to the building by way of a seal 15 by suitable fasteners (not shown). The seal 15 may be of neoprene rubber or similar material and serves to prevent entry of water or other liquid into the lower section between the sides or base and the building. The lower section 1 may be made of aluminium (for example having a thickness of about 5 mm) or other suitable material.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The upper section 3 includes a sloping top 17 to allow rain or the like to run away, together with sides 19 and a front panel 21. A flange 23 extends upwardly from the rear of the sloping top to enable the upper section to be secured to the building by means of suitable fasteners, optionally by way of a seal (not shown) if desired. The upper section may be made of aluminium (for example having a thickness of about 5 mm) or other suitable material. As can be seen from the drawings, the upper section 3 is spaced a distance above the lower section 1 to allow the passage of exhaust gases or the like, and the upper section has a greater cross-sectional area than the lower section to prevent the ingress of rain or the like into the lower section.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In use of the vent protector as shown in the drawings, the lower section 1 is secured to the wall of a building so as to cover and extend above a vent provided in the building wall, with the seal 15 preventing the entry of water or the like into the lower section. The upper section 3 is also secured to the wall of the building, in this case at a level above the lower section 1, with the upper section shielding the open upper face of the lower section against the ingress of rain or the like, while at the same time allowing the escape of exhaust gases or the like. This arrangement protects the vent in the building wall against the ingress of water or the like, while at the same time allowing the vent to remain open in order that a boiler or the like can remain in operation.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In times of flood, the vent protector prevents entry of water or the like into a vent provided the flood level does not exceed the height of the top of the lower section 1 of the vent protector.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Water or the like can still accumulate within the lower section 1, for example as a result of hot exhaust air impinging against the relatively cold material of the lower section. Such water or the like flows towards the lowest point of the lower section 1, guided by the inclined lower wall 9, that is to the region of the one-way valve 11 which allows accumulated liquid to flow out of the lower section but does not allow liquid to enter the lower section.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Thus, the vent protector according to the present invention provides a passive mechanism to prevents water ingress into a building, but is self-draining and does not allow the accumulation of liquid within the vent protector.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982233" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A vent protector comprising a first section (1) and a second section (3), both sections being adapted to be secured to a wall of a building, the first section (1) being sealable to the building wall so as to have an open top and a non-return valve (11) in a lower region thereof to allow liquid to escape from within the first section; and the second section (3) being adapted to extend across the open top of the first section (1).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0002" num="0002"><claim-text>A vent protector as claimed in claim 1, wherein a lower wall (9) of the first section (1) is inclined so as to extend outwardly relative to the first section, the non-return valve (11) being provided in the inclined lower wall.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0003" num="0003"><claim-text>A vent protector as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the first section (1) includes an outwardly extending flange (13) for securing the first section to the building wall.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0004" num="0004"><claim-text>A vent protector as claimed in claim 3, wherein a seal (15) is provided for insertion between the flange (13) and the building wall.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0005" num="0005"><claim-text>A vent protector as claimed in claim 4, wherein the seal (15) is made of neoprene rubber.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0006" num="0006"><claim-text>A vent protector as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the second section (3) has a greater cross-sectional area than the first section (1) so as to extend beyond the periphery of the first section.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0007" num="0007"><claim-text>A vent protector as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the second section (3) includes a sloping top (17).</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0008" num="0008"><claim-text>A vent protector as claimed in claim 7, wherein a flange (23) extends upwardly from the sloping top (17) to enable the second section (3) to be secured to the building wall.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0009" num="0009"><claim-text>A vent protector as claimed in claim 8, wherein a seal may be provided for insertion between the flange (23) and the building wall.</claim-text></claim></claims><drawings mxw-id="PDW16670620" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><figure id="f0001" num="1"><img id="if0001" file="imgf0001.tif" wi="151" he="148" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --><figure id="f0002" num="2"><img id="if0002" file="imgf0002.tif" wi="157" he="151" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --><figure id="f0003" num="3"><img id="if0003" file="imgf0003.tif" wi="128" he="148" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><copyright>User acknowledges that Fairview Research LLC and its third party providers retain all right, title and interest in and to this xml under applicable copyright laws.
