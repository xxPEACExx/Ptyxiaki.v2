Field of the Invention. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004"> This invention relates generally to a wellhead assembly for an oil and gas well. The invention may find use in a tubing hanger arrangement used in completion of an offshore oil and gas well and in completion of land oil and gas wells. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005"> 2. Description of the Prior Art. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006"> U.S. Patent 7,604,047 which issued on October 20, 2009 and U.S. Patent 7,419,001 illustrate and describe a universal tubing hanger suspension assembly for an offshore well that includes a tubing hanger housing that is positioned in the wellhead housing independently of knowledge of details of a wellhead housing in which the tubing hanger is to be placed. As shown in Figure 1, the prior tubing hanger suspension assembly 10 includes a tubing hanger housing 12 and a tubing hanger lower assembly 14. After the tubing housing 12 is installed in the wellhead 8 a Christmas tree connector 4 is run and connects to the housing 12, for mounting a Christmas tree on the wellhead 8. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> Production tubing 22 is coupled to the bottom of the tubing hanger 12 by a threaded connection 20, with pin threads 5 cut in the tubing hanger housing 12 body coupled with box threads 6 of the production tubing 22. The tubing hanger housing 12 is supported in place by locking and sealing mechanism 34 between tubing hanger lower assembly 14 and production casing 18 below wellhead 8. The production casing hanger 18a is supported on the casing hanger 25. Both the tubing hanger housing 12 and the production tubing 22 must be made of Corrosion Resistant Alloy (CRA) material, because highly corrosive contaminants such as ¾S in production fluid flowing in the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 production tubing 22 also contacts the interior of the tubing hanger housing 12. Accordingly, the large tubing hanger housing 12 as well as the production tubing 22 must be fabricated of expensive Corrosion Resistant Alloy. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> It has been found that cutting the pin threads 5 of the large tubing hanger housing</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">12 of Corrosion Resistant Alloy material is extremely exacting, subject to error, resulting in a very high expense and risk of failure while fabricating the tubing hanger 12. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> IDENTIFICATION OF OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> A primary object of the invention is to provide an arrangement by which a tubing hanger housing for a well completion system can be coupled to production tubing, yet not be subjected to "wetting" by production fluid, resulting in reduced material and fabrication costs for the tubing hanger housing. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> Another object of the invention is to provide a tubing hanger and production tubing assembly for oil and gas completion arrangements, where the tubing hanger housing and the production tubing are made of two distinctly different materials and components which, after assembly, are deployed as one assembly and landed in an oil and gas well. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> Another object of the invention is to provide an arrangement such that production tubing and a tubing hanger body can be made of two different materials in order to, </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> (1) save expensive material costs for the large tubing hanger body;</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">(2) save costs of weld inlays and material incompatibility for the tubing hanger body and the production tubing; </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> (3) save costs of difficult machining processes by detaching the production tubing from the tubing hanger body during machining prior to assembly;

 (4) allow a tubing hanger and production tubing to be deployed as an assembled unit; and </p><p id="p0017" num="0017"> (5) allow higher tubing hanger load carrying capabilities. Another object of the invention is to provide a subsea tubing string suspension system with production tubing of Corrosion Resistant Alloy (CRA) which is threaded into a tubing hanger housing body of non-CRA material with a seal sub of CRA material with metal-to-metal or elastomeric sealing between the top of the production tubing and the bottom of a subsea tree. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018"> Another object of the invention is to provide a production tubing extension sleeve for connection to the tubing hanger body, where the tubing extension sleeve is fabricated of CRA material and the tubing hanger body is fabricated of non-CRA high yield materials, the connection providing isolation of the tubing hanger body from the corrosive production fluid, and the non-CRA material of the tubing hanger body allowing smaller and stronger load bearing surfaces as compared with CRA materials, resulting in high load carrying during testing and subsequent tubing loads. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019"> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </p><p id="p0020" num="0020"> Figure 1 illustrates a prior art completion assembly with a tubing hanger housing of CRA material with a lower suspension assembly also of CRA material connected to its bottom end and a subsea tree connected to its top end where the tubing hanger housing body is wetted by production fluid flowing from the production tubing. </p><p id="p0021" num="0021"> Figure 2 illustrates an arrangement of the invention with a tubing hanger housing body of non-Corrosion Resistant Alloy material (CRA) secured in the wellhead by a tubing hanger lower assembly with a production tubing extension sleeve for production

The tubing hanger body 120 and production tubing 220 are supported via a tubing hanger lower assembly 140 which is locked, sealed and supported by locking and sealing assembly 340 between the tubing hanger lower assembly 140 and production casing 180.

The extension sleeve 220 is connected to tubing hanger body 120 by threads 200. Tubing hanger body 120 is made of an alloy steel, not of a Corrosion Resistant Alloy, an arrangement possible, because the box threads 201 of the tubing hanger body 120 are in threaded connection with pin threads of the production tubing extension sleeve 220.

Under certain manufacturing machining conditions, the threads 5 could be damaged, a circumstance in the past requiring scrapping of the entire expensive body piece 12. With the inventive concepts described in this specification, the body piece 12 need not be scrapped, but rather the threads 5 of body piece 12, may be over-machined to eliminate thread cutting in the CRA material of body piece 12, thereby creating a machined bore in the body piece 12. A sleeve of CRA material (not illustrated) can be installed to fit within the machined bore of the body piece, with the sleeve having pin threads at its lower end which can be screwed into the box threads 6 of the production tubing 22.
