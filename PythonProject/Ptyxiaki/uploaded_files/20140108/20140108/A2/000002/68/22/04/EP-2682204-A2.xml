Once in the mould, the molten metal solidifies against the water-cooled mould walls to form a solid shell. This shell containing the liquid metal, now called a strand, is withdrawn continuously from the bottom of the mould, The strand is supported by closely spaced, water-cooled roll lines which act to support the walls of the strand against the ferrostatic pressure of the still-solidifying liquid within the strand. To increase the rate of solidification, the strand is sprayed with large amounts of water. Finally, the strand is cut into predetermined lengths. The strand may then continue through additional roll lines and other mechanisms which flatten, roll or extrude the metal produce into its final shape.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The roll lines used in continuous casting plants are exposed to high thermal stresses, since the cast metal strands leave the mould at a temperature of over 900°C, in particular in the case of steel strands. Roll lines are therefore usually provided with internal cooling.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">European patent application no. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1646463A"><text>EP 1 646 463</text></patcit> relates to an internally cooled billet guiding roller for a continuous casting installation. The billet guiding roller comprises a central rotary shaft and at least one cylindrical roller tube (a "roll mantle") which is supported on said shaft in a rotationally fixed manner. Coolant channels located at a constant distance from the outer surface of the cylindrical roller tube, pass through the roller tube. The coolant passages are distributed uniformly in the interior of the cylindrical roller tube at, or near its periphery, and are formed by through bores. Coolant from a coolant line, which is arranged in the central rotary shaft, is supplied to the coolant passages at one end of the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> cylindrical roller tube, and returned from the coolant passages to the coolant line at the other end of the cylindrical roller tube via branch lines that extend radially through the cylindrical roller tube between the coolant passages and the coolant line. A number of blocking elements are inserted into the central coolant line to interrupt the flow of coolant in the continuous central coolant line in such a way that coolant passes into the individual roller tubes.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">An object of the invention is to provide an improved blocking element for a roll mantle of a roll line of a continuous casting apparatus comprising a rotatable shaft having a coolant line, whereby the roll mantle is arranged to be supported on the rotatable shaft in a rotationally fixed manner, and whereby the roll mantle comprises at least one coolant channel arranged to be in fluid communication with the coolant line, which coolant channel has at least one fluid inlet and at least one fluid outlet.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">This object is achieved by a blocking element that is arranged to both supply coolant to the at least one fluid inlet and at the same time to receive coolant from the at least one coolant outlet.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Such a blocking element may be used to supply coolant to an internally cooled roll mantle and to receive coolant from the roll mantle and return it to the coolant line in the rotatable shaft. This means that the roll mantle's fluid inlet(s) and fluid outlet(s) may be positioned close together and the supply and return of coolant therefrom may be controlled by a single component.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Furthermore, roll mantles are subjected to extreme wear due to the high loads, high temperatures, high temperature variations, high humidity, high corrosion and high contamination during use. Using a blocking element according to the present invention allows at least one fluid inlet and/or at least one coolant outlet to be placed anywhere along the coolant line of a shaft. There will therefore be no exposed sealing means at the end regions of the roll mantle which ends regions are subjected to the high loads, high temperatures, high temperature variations, high humidity, high corrosion and high contamination. The fluid inlet(s) and/or coolant outlet(s) and any necessary sealing means will instead be located at a less loaded and relatively cool part of the roll mantle and shaft.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> The lifetime of sealing means around the fluid inlet(s) and/or coolant outlet(s) will therefore be extended and the sealing means will not therefore have to be replaced as frequently.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It should be noted that the expression "a rotatable shaft having a coolant line" is not necessarily intended to mean a rotatable shaft having a single coolant line. A rotatable shaft may be arranged to have any number of coolant lines.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to an embodiment of the invention the at least one fluid inlet and the at least one fluid outlet are arranged at the same distance along the length of the roll mantle. The expression "length of the roll mantle" is intended to mean the length of the outer surface of the roll mantle, which outer surface is arranged to come into contact with cast metal strands during a continuous casting process.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A blocking element may for example be arranged at the centre of a roll mantle, i.e. half way between the ends of the roll mantle, which ends delimit the outer surface thereof, in cases where the roll mantle's fluid inlet(s) and/or coolant outlet(s) are located at the centre of the roll mantle.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Sealing means may be provided between the rotatable shaft of the roll line and the at least one roll mantle. Rubber seals or O-rings may for example be used to seal off the area between the rotatable shaft of the roll line and the at least one roll mantle.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to another embodiment of the invention the blocking element constitutes a single component.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to a further embodiment of the Invention the blocking element comprises at least one coolant line-coolant supplying channel arranged at the perimeter of the blocking element to supply coolant from the coolant line to the at least one fluid inlet. The blocking element also comprises at least one coolant channel-coolant receiving channel at the perimeter of the blocking element to receive coolant from the at least one coolant outlet. According to an embodiment of the invention the blocking element comprises a plurality of coolant line-coolant supplying channels and a plurality of coolant channel-coolant receiving channels arranged alternately around the perimeter of the blocking element.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> According to an embodiment of the invention the blocking element may comprise at least one valve to control the amount of coolant flowing through the blocking element.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to another embodiment of the invention the blocking element comprises locking means to lock it in position in a coolant fine once it has been aligned with the coolant channel of a roll mantle and/or a coolant channel in a shaft.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The present invention also concerns a roll line comprising at least one blocking element according to any of the embodiments of the invention, and continuous casting apparatus comprising at least one blocking element and/or at least one roll line according to any of the embodiments of the invention.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">The present invention will hereinafter be further explained by means of non-limiting examples with reference to the appended schematic figures where;

After undergoing any ladle treatments, such as alloying and degassing, and arriving at the correct temperature, molten metal 10 from the ladle 12 is transferred via a refractory shroud to a tundish 14. Metal is drained from the tundish 14 into the top of an open-base mould 16. The mould 16 is water-cooled to solidify the molten metal directly in<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> contact with it. In the mould 16, a thin shell of metal next to the mould walls solidifies before the middle section, now called a strand, exits the base of the mould 16 into a cooling chamber 18; the bulk of metal within the walls of the strand is still molten. The strand is supported by closely spaced, water cooled roll lines 20 which act to support the walls of the strand against the ferrostatic pressure of the still-solidifying liquid within the strand. To increase the rate of solidification, the strand is sprayed with large amounts of water as it passes through the cooling chamber 18. Final solidification of the strand may take place after the strand has exited the cooling chamber 18.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the illustrated embodiment the strand exits the mould 16 vertically (or on a near vertical curved path) and as it travels through the cooling chamber 18, the roll lines 20 gradually curve the strand towards the horizontal. (In a vertical casting machine, the strand stays vertical as it passes through the cooling chamber 18).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">After exiting the cooling chamber 18, the strand passes through straightening roll lines (if cast on other than a vertical machine) and withdrawal roll lines. Finally, the strand is cut into predetermined lengths by mechanical shears or by travelling oxyacetylene torches 22 and either taken to a stockpile or the next forming process. In many cases the strand may continue through additional roll lines and other mechanisms which might flatten, roll or extrude the metal into its final shape.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref> shows a roll line 20 according to an embodiment of the present invention, namely a common shaft roll line 20.
