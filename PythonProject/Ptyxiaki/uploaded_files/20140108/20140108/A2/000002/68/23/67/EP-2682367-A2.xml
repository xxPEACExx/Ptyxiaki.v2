This was demonstrated through experiments in 2004 when a method of separating graphene from graphite was found. Since then, a great deal of research on this matter has been carried out.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Graphene is made of pure carbons which are relatively light atoms, and, thus, it is very easy to process graphene in a one-dimensional or two-dimensional nano pattern.

Furthermore, if the process is carried out under low pressure or vacuum, hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) may be used as an atmospheric gas, and if the process is carried out along with an increase in temperature, an oxidized surface of a metal catalyst is reduced, so that a high-quality graphene can be synthesized.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In an illustrative embodiment, a material of the substrate on which the graphene is grown may not be particularly limited and may include, for example, one or more metals or alloys selected from the group consisting of silicon, Ni, Co, Fe, Pt, Au, Al, Cr, Cu, Mg, Mn, Mo, Rh, Si, Ta, Ti, W, U, V, Zr, brass, bronze, white brass, stainless steel, and Ge. If the substrate is made of a metal, the substrate itself can act as a catalyst for forming a graphene layer. However, the substrate does not need to be a metal. By way of example, the substrate may be made of silicon, and a silicon substrate may be oxidized to form a further silicon oxide layer on the silicon substrate in order to form a catalytic layer.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In an illustrative embodiment, a catalytic layer may be further formed on the substrate in order for the graphene to be easily grown. The catalytic layer may not be limited in a material, a thickness, and a shape. By way of example, the catalytic layer may include one or more metals or alloys<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> selected from the group consisting of Ni, Co, Fe, Pt, Au, Al, Cr, Cu, Mg, Mn, Mo, Rh, Si, Ta, Ti, W, U, V, Zr, brass, bronze, white brass, stainless steel, and Ge, and may be formed of a material identical to or different from that of the substrate. Further, the catalytic layer is not limited in a thickness and may be a thin film or a thick film.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In an illustrative embodiment, the graphene prepared by the above-described method may have a large area having a horizontal or longitudinal length in a range of from about 1 mm to about 1000 m in a direction. Further, the graphene may include graphene having a uniform structure with few defects. The graphene prepared by the above-described method may include a single-layered graphene or a multi-layered graphene. As a non-limited example, a thickness of the graphene can be adjusted in a range of from 1 layer to 100 layers.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">After the graphene is grown on the substrate by the above-described method, a process for n-doping the grown graphene is carried out. Hereinafter, an n-doping method of graphene will be described in detail with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In an illustrative embodiment, an n-type dopant may be employed without particular limitation from n-type dopants typically used in the art for doping. As a non-limited example, the n-type dopant may include an amine compound or a reducing agent. By way of example, the amine<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> compound may include, but may be not limited to, one selected from the group consisting of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), hydrazine (NH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>), pyridine (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N), pyrrole (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N), acetonitrile (CH<sub>3</sub>CN), triethanolamine, aniline, and combinations thereof. In a structure of the amine compound, nitrogen atoms form a triangular pyramid structure instead of a plane structure and three bonds from a nitrogen atom in the center of the regular tetrahedron head for three vertexes and an electron lone pair is exposed to the outside at the other vertex. The exposed electron lone pair may act as a nucleophile, and the electron lone pair may be shared with the graphene or donated to the graphene so as to be bonded thereto. After all, the graphene that receives the electron may have an n-doping effect.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Further, as the n-type dopant used in an illustrative embodiment may include a reducing agent. The reducing agent is a material that is oxidized and reduces another material, which means that the reducing agent has a strong characteristic of donating its electron to another material. In the present disclosure, an electron of the reducing agent is donated to the graphene so as to n-dope the graphene. As a non-limited example, the reducing agent may include, but may not be limited to, one selected from the group consisting of NaBH<sub>4</sub>, LiAl<sub>4</sub>, hydroquinones, and combinations thereof. As described above, in the present disclosure, the amine compound having the electron lone pair exposed to the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> outside or the reducing agent is used as a dopant and an electron of the dopant is donated to the graphene, so that the graphene has a surplus electron and a Fermi level is heightened. Thus, an n-type graphene can be formed.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of explaining an n-doping method of graphene using a doping solution containing an n-type dopant in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure. To be more specific, the graphene can be doped by dropping the doping solution containing the n-type dopant on the graphene to form a liquid doping layer. In an illustrative embodiment, if the dopant is NaBH<sub>4</sub>, in order to dissolve the dopant NaBH<sub>4</sub>, a solvent such as dimethoxyethylether may be used to prepare a doping solution. The doping solution is dropped in an amount sufficient to cover the graphene by using surface tension with the graphene and the doping time can be adjusted in a range of from several seconds to several minutes depending on a reducing level of the dopant used.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Further, in an illustrative embodiment, it is possible to dope graphene by using an n-type dopant vapor as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. To be more specific, the graphene can be doped by installing the graphene grown on the substrate in a reaction chamber and supplying the vapor containing the n-type dopant in the reaction chamber. As a non-limited example, the method for doping the graphene using the vapor containing the n-type dopant may include<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> dropping about 3 to 5 drops of an n-type dopant for doping onto tissue paper or gauze and putting it into the sealed reaction chamber together with the graphene. The dopant is vaporized and condensed repeatedly in the sealed reaction chamber to be in a dynamic equilibrium state. During this process, a surface of the graphene can be doped. As compared with a wet doping method using a doping solution, the above-mentioned method using the vapor containing a dopant is an indirect doping method in which the dopant is not in direct contact with the surface of the graphene, and, thus, it is possible to reduce damage of the graphene to be doped.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In order to measure a doping level of the graphene, various methods may be used. By way of example, a change in a Dirac point may be measured by manufacturing a Hall bar device so as to check success or failure of doping and a doping level. By using Raman analysis, a doping level can be qualitatively measured based on intensity and a shift direction of a peak. To be specific, in the case of p-type doping, a 2D-band peak shows a blue shift phenomenon and intensity of the 2D-band peak tends to be weakened. Meanwhile, in the case of n-type doping, a 2D-band peak shows a red shift phenomenon and intensity of the 2D-band peak tends to be weakened. Further, adsorbates on a surface of the graphene can be sorted by using XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy), and it is possible to check a<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> doping level based on a shift direction and intensity of a C1s peak.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In the present disclosure, success or failure of doping of graphene is checked by the above-described various methods. In an example, graphene used in a doping experiment was grown by a chemical vapor deposition method. The grown graphene was transfered onto a SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate, and the graphene was doped by a chemical wet method as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. As a dopant, NaBH<sub>4</sub> dissolved in dimethoxyethylether as a solvent and NH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> (hydrazine) were used. The dopant was dropped until the graphene is covered by using surface tension with the graphene and then reacted. The NaBH<sub>4</sub>/dimethoxyethylether dopant was used for doping for 2 minutes and the hydrazine dopant was used for doping for 30 seconds.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042"><figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">Figs. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006 f0007 f0008">4</figref> are graphs of Raman spectra for an n-doped graphene in accordance with an example of the present disclosure. A G peak commonly found from graphite-based materials is shown at about 1580 cm<sup>-1</sup>, and a 2D peak is shown at about 2700 cm<sup>-1</sup> in graphene. A D peak is a peak caused by defects in a crystal and shown around the edge of a graphene specimen, or if there are many defects, the D peak is shown at about 1340 cm<sup>-1</sup>. <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">Fig. 3</figref> shows Raman spectra obtained from a Raman monochromator after doping with NaBH<sub>4</sub>/dimethoxyethylether in accordance with an example of the present disclosure. After doping, an intensity ratio of<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> a G peak: a 2D peak varied from about 1:2 to about 1:7, and a 2D peak after doping was red-shifted to an energy region lower than a 2D peak of graphene before doping and intensity was slightly decreased (see <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 3C</figref>). A G peak became sharp and pointed as intensity was increased after doping. As described above, if doping is carried out with electrons or holes, a line width of a G peak becomes decreased and intensity becomes further increased. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">Fig. 3</figref> in which as a line width of a G peak became decreased, intensity was increased, and as a line width of a 2D peak became decreased, intensity was decreased, it could be seen that graphene was doped. From a fact that the 2D peak was blue-shifted, it could be further confirmed that the graphene was n-doped.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0006 f0007 f0008">Fig. 4</figref> shows Raman spectra obtained from a Raman monochromator after doping with hydrazine in accordance with an example of the present disclosure. A 2D peak was red-shifted to a low energy region and intensity was decreased. A G peak was also red-shifted to a low energy region and intensity was increased. From a fact that a spectrum obtained after doping with hydrazine was similar to the Raman spectrum obtained after doping with the NaBH<sub>4</sub>/dimethoxyethylether, it could be seen that graphene was n-doped with the hydrazine in the same manner as the NaBH<sub>4</sub>/dimethoxyethylether.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As another method for checking success or failure of<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> doping of graphene, a Dirac point shift was measured. A Dirac point is in a graphene band structure where a valence band and a conduction band are in contact with each other, and a Fermi level of a non-doped graphene becomes equal to the Diract point. Since an electron is shifted to graphene during doping, a Diract point is shifted, which makes it possible to analyze success or failure of doping of graphene.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In order to measure a Dirac point, a graphene electrode was manufactured as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 5</figref> in accordance with an example of the present disclosure. To be specific, in a manufacturing process of a graphene electrode in accordance with an example of the present disclosure, a photoresist layer was spin-coated on a graphene, and the photoresist layer was etched by photolithography so as to form an electrode pattern, and then, Cr and Au were deposited in sequence on the etched photoresist layer. Then, after lift-off with acetone, the graphene and the photoresist layer were formed in sequence. Thereafter, the photoresist layer was etched by photolithography, and the graphene at the etched portion was etched by a reactive ion etching method using O<sub>2</sub> plasma. Finally, the remaining photoresist layer was removed.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In an example of the present disclosure, referring to <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 6A</figref>, a Dirac point when the graphene was doped with NaBH<sub>4</sub>/dimethoxyethylether was lowered by about 20 V as compared with a Dirac point before the doping. Referring to<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> the positive slope of the graph, it could be seen that electron mobility was rarely changed, and referring to the negative slope, the slope after the doping was decreased, and, thus, hole mobility was decreased. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 6B</figref>, a Dirac point after the graphene was doped with hydrazine was lowered by about 130 V as compared with a Dirac point before the doping. From a fact that the Dirac point was shifted about 7 times than the Dirac point shift when the graphene was doped with NaBH<sub>4</sub>/dimethoxyethylether and a Fermi level was further heightened, it could be seen that the n-doping was more carried out when the graphene was doped with the hydrazine dopant as compared with the case where the graphene was doped with the NaBH<sub>4</sub>/dimethoxyethylether dopant.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In an example of the present disclosure, as a final method for checking success or failure of doping of graphene, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used.
