In the thus-structured tire balance measuring device, an upper rim should be completely separated from a lower rim when the tire is attached or detached, to prevent the upper rim from becoming detached due to the pressure of air supplied to the tire at the time of measurement of the balance. To achieve this in the tire balance measuring device, a lock shaft to which the upper rim is attached is inserted to a predetermined level into a fitting hole formed in a spindle to which the lower rim is attached, and fixed to the spindle through engagement therewith (refer to, for example, Japan Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP3904319B"><text>3904319</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the devices as described above, a predetermined fitting allowance is provided between the lock shaft and the fitting hole in the spindle to facilitate insertion and withdrawal of the lock shaft into/from the spindle. When the tire is inflated by supplying air into the tire at the time of measurement of the balance, the lock shaft is inclined relative to the fitting<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> hole in the spindle due to the presence of a gap corresponding to the fitting allowance, with the result that the upper rim is accordingly inclined relative to the lower rim. The above-described devices suffer from a problem in that measured values of the balance have an error introduced by an occurrence of the inclination. In addition, because the lock shaft can be inclined in a completely random direction every time the tire is supplied with air, it is difficult to correct for variations in the measured values depending on a direction of the inclination.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">To address the problem, Japan Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP3133465B"><text>3133465</text></patcit> discloses a tire balance measuring device in which three or more contact portions are protrudingly formed on an outer circumferential surface of a fitted shaft (the lock shaft). This Japan Patent further describes that the above-described structure can function to limit the direction in which the fitted shaft is inclined relative to the fitting hole, which makes it possible to make a correction to the measured value.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, even with the structure described in Japan Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP3133465B"><text>3133465</text></patcit>, the upper rim can not be limited sufficiently for preventing irregular inclination that occurs due to the presence of the fitting allowance between the fitted shaft and the fitting hole. It is assumed, for example, that the tire balance measuring device of the above-described structure includes three contact portions on the outer circumferential surface of the fitted shaft. In this case, the direction in which the fitted shaft can be inclined is toward any midpoint position between the adjacent contact portions, which means that there are three possible directions of inclination of the fitted shaft in total. In which of the three directions the fitted shaft<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> will be inclined when the tire is supplied with air remains unknown until air is actually introduced into the tire.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention, which was made in view of the aforesaid present circumstances, therefore aims to provide a tire balance measuring device in which even when the fitted shaft (a lock shaft) could be inclined in a random direction at an angle created by the gap corresponding to the fitting allowance every time the tire is supplied with air, an influence exerted due to the inclination on the measured value can be minimized.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention provides a tire balance measuring device for measuring a balance of a tire. The tire balance measuring device comprises a rim rotation supporting shaft vertically and rotatably supported via a bearing by a housing, a lower rim mounted on the rim rotation supporting shaft, a locking shaft inserted into a fitting hole of the rim rotation supporting shaft, an upper rim mounted on the locking shaft and placed above the lower rim, a locking component that allows the locking shaft to be engaged at a desired height with the rim rotation supporting shaft and fixed thereto, at least two sensors that measure an inclination of the locking shaft, and a correction computing unit that computes an amount of change in an unbalance of the tire based on output values received from the sensors after the tire is supplied with gas, and corrects a result of measuring a balance of the tire using the computed amount of change in the unbalance.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the present invention, even when the locking shaft is inclined in a random direction at an angle created by a gap corresponding to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> a fitting allowance every time the tire is supplied with air, the at least two sensors and the correction computing unit can be used to correct for an influence exerted due to the inclination on a measured value, so that the influence can be minimized. In this way, the balance of the tire can be measured with a higher degree of accuracy than that achieved by a conventional way.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the thus-structured tire balance measuring device, the correction computing unit may compute, from the output values, an amount by which the inclination of the locking shaft is changed from a reference inclination of the locking shaft and an amount by which eccentricity in a position of center of gravity of the locking shaft equipped with the upper rim is changed from that of the locking shaft having the reference inclination, and calculate the amount of change in the unbalance using the computed amounts.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the thus-structured tire balance measuring device, the sensors may consist at least of a first sensor for detecting a radial position of the upper rim and a second sensor arranged above the first sensor to detect the radial position of the upper rim.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the thus-structured tire balance measuring device, the sensors may consist at least of the first sensor for detecting the radial position of the upper rim, a second sensor for detecting an axial position of the upper rim, and a third sensor arranged on a side of the locking shaft opposite to a position of the second sensor to detect the axial position of the upper rim.</p><heading id="h0005"><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a front view of a tire balance measuring device according to a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> first embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a diagram viewed along an arrow A in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a cross sectional view of an upper half portion of the tire balance measuring device shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a front view of the tire balance measuring device according to a second embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is a diagram viewed along an arrow B in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0006"><u>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</u></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">Hereinafter, embodiments for carrying out this invention will be described with reference to the drawings.</p><heading id="h0007">(First Embodiment)</heading><heading id="h0008">(Structure of Tire Balance Measuring Device)</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs. 1 to 3</figref> show a first embodiment of a tire balance measuring device. A tire balance measuring device 1 is designed to hold a tire inserted between an annular lower rim 4 and an annular upper rim 5, and rotate the tire about a vertical axis after air is introduced into the tire to thereby inflate the tire.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The tire balance measuring device 1 includes a spindle 2 having a top end on which the lower rim 4 is mounted, and a lock shaft 3 having a top end on which the upper rim 5 is mounted. The spindle 2 and the lock shaft 3 respectively correspond to a rim rotation supporting shaft and a locking shaft of the present invention. When the lock shaft 3 whose top end is equipped with the upper rim 5 is inserted into a fitting hole 12a of the spindle 2, the tire can be retained between the lower rim 4 and the upper rim<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> 5 in a condition sandwiched therebetween.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">After the insertion of the lock shaft 3 into the fitting hole 12a in the spindle 2, the spindle 2 and the lock shaft 3 are engaged and fixed to each other via a plurality of lock pieces 9, to thereby retain (hold) the tire sandwiched between the lower rim 4 and the upper rim 5. The lock piece 9 corresponds to a locking component of this invention.</p><heading id="h0009">(Spindle)</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">The spindle 2 is composed of a cylindrically-shaped lower spindle shaft 11 and a hollow upper spindle shaft 12, which are concentrically connected and fixed to each other. The lower spindle shaft 11 and the upper spindle shaft 12 are arranged in that order from below.</p><heading id="h0010">&lt;Lower Spindle Shaft&gt;</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">The lower spindle shaft 11 is vertically and rotatably supported via bearings (not illustrated) by a spindle housing 19. The spindle housing 19 corresponds to a housing of the present invention. The lower spindle shaft 11 is rotated by a drive motor (not illustrated). The bearings are installed between the lower spindle shaft 11 and the spindle housing 19. An air duct 11a used for supplying air to the tire is formed in a central region of the lower spindle shaft 11, and an air duct 11b used for supplying air to a pneumatic cylinder 17 is formed in the lower spindle shaft 11 on an outer side of the air duct 11a.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A rotary joint 18 is mounted on a bottom end of the lower spindle shaft 11. Air is introduced and discharged through the rotary joint 18. It should be noted that the introduction and discharge of air is not limited to a manner performed via the rotary joint 18. In addition, a gas other than air<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> may be supplied to the tire, while the pneumatic cylinder 17 may be of a type driven by any gas other than air.</p><heading id="h0011">&lt;Upper Spindle Shaft&gt;</heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">The upper spindle shaft 12 includes, at its center, the fitting hole 12a into which the lock shaft 3 is inserted. The lock pieces 9 are retained in an axial intermediate region of the upper spindle shaft 12.</p><heading id="h0012">(Lock Shaft)</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">The lock shaft 3 is a component engaged via the lock pieces 9 with the upper spindle shaft 12 and fixed thereto. In the lock shaft 3, a locking section 3b including a plurality of grooves is formed on an outer circumferential surface of the lock shaft 3 to allow adjustment of a spacing (the width of a tire) between the lower rim 4 and the upper rim 5. The spacing between the lower rim 4 and the upper rim 5 can be adjusted to a desired distance in increments of the pitch of grooves. Further, an air duct 3a used for supplying air to the tire is formed in a central region of the lock shaft 3.</p><heading id="h0013">(Lock Pieces)</heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">The lock piece 9 is a component for causing the lock shaft 3 to be engaged at a desired height (in increments of the pitch of grooves in the locking section 3b) with the spindle 2 and fixed thereto. The lock piece 9 can be moved forward and backward in a radial direction of the spindle 2, while being fixed to the spindle 2 in both vertical and rotational directions of the spindle 2.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The forward and backward movement of the lock pieces 9 in the radial direction of the spindle 2 is actuated by a lock piece driving means<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> that includes a fluid-pressure cylinder (the pneumatic cylinder 17 in this embodiment), a connector component 16, a lead piece 15, and a coil spring 14.</p><heading id="h0014">(Sensors)</heading><p id="p0024" num="0024">The tire balance measuring device 1 of this embodiment is equipped with first and second sensors 6 and 7 for measuring an inclination of the lock shaft 3 and a computing unit 8 (a correction computing unit) for correcting a result of measuring a balance of a tire. The sensors 6 and 7 may be, for example, laser sensors (the same as sensors in a second embodiment, which will be described below). Note that any measuring instruments for measuring the balance of the tire are not illustrated in the drawings. The following description is provided assuming that the laser sensors are used.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The first sensor 6 is a sensor to detect a radial position (displacement) of the upper rim 5 and installed in the vicinity of the upper rim 5. Here, a vertical position of the upper rim 5 is determined in accordance with the width of the tire. Then, the lock shaft 3 on which the upper rim 5 is mounted is engaged and fixed through the lock pieces 9 to the spindle 2. Then, in the vicinity of the location where the fixed upper rim 5 is positioned, the first sensor 6 is installed, for example.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">It should be noted that a condition where the first sensor 6 is installed in the vicinity of the upper rim 5 means, in particular, that a sensor head (a part that houses a light emitting element and a light receiving element) of the first sensor 6 is placed in the vicinity of the upper rim 5 (this is equally applied to all sections referring to any position of the sensor, any distance between the sensors, and the like in the following description).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Also, the second sensor 7 is a sensor to detect the radial position<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> (displacement) of the upper rim 5. The second sensor 7 is installed above the first sensor 6 and separated by a predetermined distance from the first sensor 6.
