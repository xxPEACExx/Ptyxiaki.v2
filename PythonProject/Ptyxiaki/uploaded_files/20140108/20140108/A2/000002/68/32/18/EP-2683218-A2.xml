The warmth is emanating from the bottom to a ceramic panel, beneath which is located the temperature sensor 2 in the form of an NTC thermistor. This temperature sensor 2 is used to measure the cooktop temperature and to generate a digital or an analog signal in proportion to the measured temperature. A signal generated by the temperature sensor 2 is processed digitally to produce a control signal that is used to control the brightness of the temperature display 4. The temperature sensor 2 is connected, in the electronic resistance measurements system that converts the temperature to a resistance value, to a signal conversion element - microcontroller 3.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The conversion of a signal from the temperature sensor 2 to a signal that controls the display 4 takes place in the microcontroller block 3. First, the value of measured resistance is converted to a temperature value with the use of temperature sensor 2 characteristic. Then, the microcontroller 3 converts a received signal to a width modulated signal PWM that controls the display block. Information in the form of digital data about an actual, desired brightness of a temperature indicator is obtained from the microcontroller unit (MCU) 3 for the display, to<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> which data the corresponding colour and/or brightness of displayed symbols are directly assigned, afterwards indications on the display are being changed in real time, in proportion to provided temperature information. The value of pulse filling is generated in a way that enables to achieve the following brightness values:

It is characteristic that the microcontroller 3 first processes data to temperature values, and then to signals for communication protocol 12C for a particular LCD display controller 4. These data are prepared according to the following indicators:
