However, where the battery pack is attached/detached to/from the charger when a power source is supplied to this terminal supply system, an instant discharge phenomenon occurs due to the different potential difference of terminals disposed in both sides of the battery pack. Therefore, the battery pack has an increasing possibility to start fires as foreign substances are accumulated in the terminals.

<ol><li>1) First, a standby mode step (S01) in which a power signal is transmitted in every cycle via gate signal paths 234 of the gate output signal processor block 213 - the multi-gate driver module 23 - the full-bridge resonant converter 22 the corresponding primary charging cores 13 of respective charger blocks 14 is performed under the control of the central controller 21 in the wireless multi-power transmission device 10 of the wireless multi-charger system (A). As described above, in the standby mode step (S01), a power signal is transmitted via the primary charging core 13 in every cycle, the power signal including a call signal for calling a native ID value of the wireless power transmission device 30, and waiting for the receipt of a response signal for the power signal.</li><li>2) Then, while a call signal for a native ID value is transmitted and the receipt of a response signal for the call signal is waited for in the standby mode step (S01), an object detection step (S02) of receiving a detection signal according to the load modulation is performed in the primary charging core 13 of one of the charger blocks 14. When any object is detected as described above, the portable wireless power transmission devices 30, such as mobile phones, PDA, PMP, DMB terminals, MP3 or notebook computers, that may be charged in a wireless manner; and conventional electronic equipments that may not be charged in a wireless manner may be put on the charger blocks 14. Therefore, the wireless multi-power transmission device 10 receives a signal according to the load<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> modulation as a detection signal, the load modulation being generated by any of the objects as listed above, and simultaneously determines the presence of the object by determining whether the objects are put on the top of the charger block 14.</li></ol></p><p id="p0041" num="0041">When particular problems do not occur by the use of the non-metal materials and the load modulation caused by the movement of the objects, the wireless multi-power transmission device 10 may be converted into the standby mode step (S01). However, the heat generation and erroneous operations of equipment may occur due to the charging operation in the case of the electronic equipment that may not be charged in a wireless manner, not in the case of the wireless power transmission device 30 that may be charged in a wireless manner,</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Therefore, the object detection step (S02) includes: detecting these foreign substances (parasitic metal detection (PMD)) (S021). That is to say, the foreign substance detection step (S021) includes: determining whether a detection signal is not a normal signal, the detection signal being detected through the corresponding primary charging core 13 and the reception signal processor module 24 according to the load modulation generated by objects in a plurality of the charger blocks 14. The signal transmitted under the control of the central controller 21 is determined whether it is an abnormal signal whose signal determination is impossible by comparing the reception signal according to the load modulation. Therefore, the corresponding charger block 14 is converted into a foreign substance detection mode when the corresponding charger block 14 detects a foreign substance, and displays a foreign substance error in the LCD panel 153 or the charging LED 154 when the detected foreign substances is a metal or electronic equipment, and operates to stop a charging operation of the corresponding charger block 14 (parasitic metal detection (PMD) error).
<ul><li>3) However, a native ID determination step (S03) of analyzing and determining the detected signal according to the load modulation when the detected reception signal is determined to be data for native ID of the wireless power transmission device 30 that may be charged in a wireless manner. In the standby mode step (S01), a signal for searching the wireless power transmission device 30 is transmitted together with a request signal for requesting a data value of the native ID of the wireless power transmission device 30. Therefore, an induced electric current generated by the secondary charging core 32 is rectified through the rectifier block 33 in the wireless power transmission device 30, and then filtered through the smoothing Filter block 34. During this process,<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> information on the received native ID request is transmitted to the device controller 390 of the power receiver controller 39, and therefore a native ID data value of the corresponding wireless power transmission device 30, which is stored in the device memory unit 391, is transmitted to the wireless multi-power transmission device 10 via the signal processor block 392. Therefore, in the case of the native ID determination step (S03), the receive reception signal according to the load modulation is processed in the reception signal processor module 24 coupled to the primary charging core 13 of the wireless multi-power transmission device 10, and then transmitted to the main controller 210 of the central controller 21 via the received signal processor block 214. Then, the main controller 210 determines whether the received data is a normal native ID data of the wireless power transmission device 30, and then determines whether the wireless power transmission device 30 is a normal device that can be charged in a wireless manner by determining whether the received data is a native ID data transmitted from the normal wireless power transmission device 30.</li><li>4) Subsequently, when the received data is proven to be a native ID transmitted from the wireless power transmission device 30, a fully charged power transmission step (S04) of transmitting a fully charged transmission power from the primary charging core 13 of the corresponding charger block 14 is performed in the multi-gate driver module 23.</li></ul></p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Referring to the fully charged power transmission step (S04) in the wireless multi-power transmission device 10, when the main controller 210 of the central controller 21 determines that the normal wireless power transmission device 30 is put on the charger block 14 of the main controller 210, the main controller 210 transmits a control signal with the transmission of the power signal via the gate output signal processor block 213 and the gate signal path 234.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Since the control signal is transmitted to the multi-gate driver module 23, and then transmitted with the transmission of the power signal, a power signal is transmitted to the primary charging core 13 of the corresponding charger block 14 via the corresponding full-bridge resonant converter 22, and then the power signal is transmitted to the wireless power transmission device 30 due to the generation of an induced magnetic field.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">During a series of these processes, configurations of the gate signal path 234 and the multi-gate driver module 23 will be described in more detail, as follows.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">First, the gate signal path 234 may be composed of a plurality of signal paths corresponding respectively to the respective charger blocks 14.

In this case, the multi-gate driver module 23 may include a gate signal converter unit 232 for processing a gate signal; an output driver 233 for transmitting the processed signal to the corresponding full-bridge resonant converter 22; and a gate controller 231.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Therefore, the gate signal path 234 is composed of a plurality of signal paths corresponding to the respective charger blocks 14.

In this case, the control signal is transmitted together with a code signal for the corresponding charger block 14 prior to transmission of a conversion signal, and the gate controller 231 of the multi-gate driver module 23 receiving the control signal determines a signal for which charger block 14 the control signal transmitted from the main controller 210 is, and the converted power signal may be transmitted to the full-bridge resonant converter 22 as a code signal for the corresponding charger block 14.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Therefore, it is possible to simplify the configuration of the main controller 210 and the multi-gate driver module 23, and this configuration may be suitable to manufacture the wireless multi-power transmission device 10 and the wireless power transmission device 30 in a large scale.
<ul><li>5) Then, a charging control step (S05) is performed by requesting information on a charging state to the wireless power transmission device 30 and controlling a charging level according to the received charging information of the wireless power transmission device 30.</li></ul></p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Then, the wireless power transmission device 30 controls the charger IC block 36 and the protection circuit module block 37 to charge a power source into the battery cell 35, the power source being transmitted via the rectifier block 33 and the smoothing filter block 34 under the control of the device controller 390 after the fully charged power transmission step (S04).</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">For this charging operation, the device controller 390 receives information on a charging state of the battery cell 35 through the charger IC block 36 and the protection circuit module block 37, and temporally stores the information on a charging state in the device memory unit 391. Then, when the battery cell 35 is in a fully charged state, the charging operation is stopped by controlling the charger IC block 36. Also, information on the fully charged state is generated in the secondary charging core 32 through the signal processor block 392. Also, when a voltage of the charged battery cell 35 is less than a predetermined reference voltage, the battery cell 35 is converted again into a charging state to perform another charging operation. However, the battery cell 35 is proven to be in a fully charged state, the charging of the battery cell 35 is stopped (No Operation).</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Therefore, the main controller 210 of the wireless multi-power transmission device 10 requests information on the charging levels in every step of the wireless power transmission device 30 in the charging control step (S05).

The reception signal processor module 24 includes a plurality of reception signal input units 243 for receiving signals<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> detected in the respective charger blocks 14 through the load modulation; a reception signal processor unit 242 for converting a detection signal according to the load modulation of each of the charger blocks 14; and a reception signal controller 241 for controlling an operation of the reception signal processor module 24.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Therefore, the transmission information of the wireless power transmission device 30 received through the load modulation is converted into signals in the reception signal processor module 24, depending on the respective charger blocks 14, and the converted signals are transmitted to the main controller 210 through the received signal processor blocks 214.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The reception signal processor module 24 may generally have a plurality of amplifiers, LPF, OR logic circuits and the like, all of which are mounted thereinside. In particular, in the case of the configuration of the reception signal processor unit 242 and the reception signal path 244 of the reception signal processor module 24, the reception signal processor unit 242 and the reception signal path 244 may be configured as a single member or as a plurality of members so as to generate a native code each of the corresponding charger blocks 14, as described above in the exemplary embodiment of the multi-gate driver module 23.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">That is to say, when signals according to the load modulation are transmitted to each of the charger block 14s, a plurality of the reception signal processor units 242 according to this exemplary embodiment process their own signals, and transmit the processes signals to the main controller 210 via the respective reception signal paths 244. Therefore, signals generated in the corresponding charger blocks 14 are accurately transmitted to the main controller 210 through the separate signal processing and via the paths, and processed in the main controller 210, and therefore it is possible to operate a system stably. Also, this system may suitably apply to small devices as in the above-mentioned multi-gate driver module 23.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In addition, for the exemplary embodiment in which each of the reception signal processor unit 242 and the reception signal paths 244 is configured as a single member, the reception signal processor unit 242 of the multi-gate driver module 23 determines a reception signal for which charger block 14 the received signal according to the load modulation is under the control of the reception signal controller 241, and the processed reception signal is divided into categories together with the code signal for the corresponding charger blocks 14 when the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> processed reception signal is transmitted via the received signal processor block 214. Then, the main controller 210 receives the reception signals for the respective charger blocks 14, divides respective signals into categories and processes the signals by category. Therefore, the configuration of single members may be used as the simplified configuration of the entire members.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Accordingly, the wireless mufti-power transmission device 10 requests data information on a charging level to the wireless power transmission device 30 that is charged in the corresponding charger block 14 through the multi-gate driver module 23 and the primary charging core 13, depending on the corresponding charger block 14.

Then, the LCD panel 153 displays a charging state along with the number of the corresponding charger block 14. Also, the LCD panel 153 displays that each of the respective charger blocks 14 turns on the charging LED 154. For example, the charging operation of the battery cell 35 is stopped when a lamp of the charging LED 154 is turned off, the battery cell 35 is on charge when the lamp is flickered, a green light is turned on the battery cell 35 is fully charged, and a red light is turned on when errors such as a foreign substance error, a native ID error are caused.
