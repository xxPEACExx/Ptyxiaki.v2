A phase shifter is needed in order to bring any system for detecting phase differences to the optimal operating point. To detect the phase difference of two signals either passive diode mixers, active phase detectors on the basis of Gilbert cells, analogue multipliers, a XOR logic gate, and similar are used. Low-frequency processing of the output signal of the phase detector can be constructed with two analogue multipliers built of or replaced with a splitter of square connected resistors with a selector switch. Existing solutions for the phase comparison (detection) of the signal have drawbacks, such as the amplitude-phase dependence, narrow bandwidth, low frequency range of operation, noise, and a DC voltage offset. All known systems for the phase shift have one disadvantage in common, that is, temperature dependency.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The object of the present invention is to create a phase shifter by means of which the system for detecting the phase difference is brought to the optimal operating point and at the same time to remedy the deficiencies of known solutions used for the phase shift of the signal.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The object as set above is solved according to the invention by the features given in the characterising part of the claim 1.
