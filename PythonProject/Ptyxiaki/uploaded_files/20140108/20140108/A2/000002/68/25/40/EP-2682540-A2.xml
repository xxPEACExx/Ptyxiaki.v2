More specifically, embodiments of the current invention relate to a pool cover automatic locking and unlocking system and method.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Among benefits of covering pools, the aspect of safety-by preventing drowning and keeping family and friends safe-is foremost. A pool cover additionally acts to prevent access by pets and uninvited visitors from entering a filled or substantially-filled pool. Additionally, a pool cover keeps dirt, leaves, and debris out of the pool when it is not in use. Another significant advantage in covering a pool is savings on operating costs, such as heating; chemicals; cleaning; water evaporation; and extended pool equipment life.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Among the manufacturers of pool covers in the world are:

La Croix Rouge, 35530 Brécé, France</li></ul></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Most manufacturers produce pool covers employing flexible sheets of vinyl/Dacron material and/or cloth-like pool covers; whereas some offer semi-rigid covers constructed of interlocking profile pieces, as known in the art. Reference is currently made to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, which are pictorial schematic views of a pool having a prior art pool cover 5. In <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG 1</figref>, pool cover 5 is shown deployed: partially (a); and nearly completely (b). Pool cover 5 is typically stowed (i.e. retracted) and deployed in a manual; motorized; and /or semiautomatic fashion, as known in the art. Although not emphasized in the figures, the pool is filled with water.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Pool cover 5 has a leading edge 6, as seen in the detail view of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG 2</figref>. Leading edge 6 typically has the shape of a rigid profile piece (i.e. "slat") as known in the art. Pool cover 5 and leading edge 6 are typically supported after deployment in a floating configuration on /near a pool water surface 9-as shown schematically in the referenced figures. Whereas the pool cover shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref> is semi-rigid and is formed of individual interlocking slats, the discussion which follows hereinbelow-specifically related to securing the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> pool cover once deployed-is applicable to other cover materials and configurations.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the specification and claims, which follow hereinbelow, the terms "secure", "lock", "fasten", and "attach" are used interchangeably with regard to maintaining a pool cover, once deployed and substantially covering a pool, in a configuration where the cover cannot be readily retracted (i.e. uncovering the pool). Following complete deployment (not shown in the figures) pool cover 5 is typically secured at a pool edge 8, where usually leading edge 6 is attached to the pool edge to enable the cover to fulfill a primary objective of safety, inter alia. Traditionally, straps or other fastening mechanisms (not shown in the figure) are used to manually secure leading edge 6 of deployed pool cover 5 to pool edge 8.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In many locales and countries, there are standards which define how the pool cover is secured. An exemplary standard for pool coverings and securing/locking provisions is French Standard NFP 90 308, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">An example of prior art dealing with pool covers and specifically to securing a pool cover, once deployed, is <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5282282A"><text>US Patent no. 5,282,282 to Shehan et al.</text></patcit>, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. Shehan et al. describe an improved swimming pool construction and cover, which include a swimming pool cover laid on the water of the pool and having a marginal edge provided with one component of the two-component elongated locking member. The second component of the locking member is disposed in the pool<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> coping or deck edge accessible at the pool interior for engagement by the locking member component on the pool cover. The locking component associated with the pool is provided in a retrofit configuration by securing a locking component to a vinyl liner bead lock secured in the vinyl liner bead channel in a pool coping. In a new vinyl-lined pool construction, a coping is provided with a secondary channel with one component of the cover locking member secured therein. In a gunnite pool, a channel is formed in the deck edge and a component of the releasable cover locking member is secured in the channel for securement of the pool cover thereto.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Champion et al., in French Patent no, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="FR2936829"><text>FR2936829</text></patcit>, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, describe a floating cover, locking device for swimming pool basin, having an elastic tongue with free end to close inlet orifice in rest position, and operated to release passage across orifice, where device is in form of monoblock assembly. The device has a hollow shell fixed on a vertical wall of a basin of a swimming pool, where the device is in form of a monoblock assembly. The shell comprises an inlet orifice sized for permitting passage of shafts and a housing delimited by a partition having an opening and receiving the shafts. An elastic tongue has a free end for closing, in rest position, the inlet orifice, and is operated to release the passage across the inlet orifice.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Among various shortcomings of prior art cover systems and fastening/securing mechanisms and locking systems are:<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> -->

Preferably, leading edge is displaceable floatingly on the water surface and communication by the autolock control unit with the at least one float locker subassembly and the pool cover deployment system is by at least one means chosen from list including: wireless and wired means. Most preferably, the at least one float locker subassembly further comprises: an autolock unit, maintainable above the water surface and having a locking pin adapted to lock and unlock the leading edge slot piece with the float locker subassembly; and an autolock floater unit mechanically attached beneath the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> autolock unit and separated by the space, the autolock floater unit adapted to be floatingly maintained with regard to the water surface and to present the space to the leading edge slot piece.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Typically, the autolock unit comprises a pin driver motor adapted to retract the locking pin to an unlocked status; a sensor adapted to sense a locked and unlocked status of the locking pin; command and telemetry electronics adapted to receive commands from the autolock control unit to command the pin drive motor and to provide telemetry to the autolock control unit related to the locking pin status; and a power source adapted to provide on board power for the pin drive motor, the sensor, and the command and telemetry electronics. Most typically, the locking pin is adapted to be biased by a spring to have a locked status when the leading edge slot piece is inserted into the space and the rectangular slot is positionable in the space beneath the locking pin. Preferably, the at least one float locker subassembly is slidingly attachable to a vertical guide piece, the vertical guide piece being oriented substantially perpendicularly to the water surface and extending partially below and above the water surface. Most preferably, the vertical guide piece is adapted to be mechanically attached to an edge mounting bracket, the edge mounting bracket adapted to be mechanically attached to the pool edge. Typically, the vertical guide piece has a plurality of protruding ribs, the plurality of protruding ribs oriented substantially perpendicular to the water surface and having a rib spacing dimension substantially equal to that of the space beneath the locking pin and wherein the float locker subassembly is formable to move slidingly<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> with regard to the protruding ribs. Most typically, the at least one leading edge slot piece is substantially constrained in directions parallel and perpendicular to the water surface when the at least one leading edge slot piece is locked in the at least one float locker subassembly.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to the teachings of the present invention there is further provided a method of using an automatic system for locking and unlocking a pool cover having a leading edge at an edge of a pool, the pool having a water surface, the pool cover deployable by a pool cover deployment system, the method comprising the steps of: configuring at least one leading edge slot piece having a rectangular slot therein and integrating the leading edge slot piece into the leading edge; constraining at least one float locker subassembly at the edge of the pool and configuring the at least one float locker assembly to float on the water surface, with the float locker subassembly having a space defined therein in which the at least one leading edge slot piece is received, locked, and unlocked; and taking an autolock control unit to communicate with the at least one float locker subassembly and the pool cover deployment system, whereby the control unit further commands and verifies locking and unlocking of the at least one leading edge clip with the at least one float locker subassembly. Preferably, the leading edge is displaced floatingly on the water surface and whereby communication by the autolock control unit with the at least one float locker subassembly and the pool cover deployment system is by at least one means chosen from list including: wireless and wired means. Most preferably, locking a deployed pool cover further comprises the steps of: commanding the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> pool cover deployment system to advance the leading edge towards the edge of the pool substantially at the water surface; configuring an autoock unit of the at least one float locker subassembly to receive the leading edge and to lock and sense the locking of the leading edge; configuring an autolock control unit receive telemetry from each of the at least one autolock unit indicative of the locking of the leading edge and communicating with the pool cover deployment system to command the pool cover deployment system to stop advancing the leading edge; and determining that each of the at least one autolock unit has locked the leading edge and taking corrective action if at least one autoock unit has not locked the leading edge. Typically, unlocking a locked pool cover further comprises the steps of: commanding the pool cover deployment system to unlock the locked pool cover and commanding an autolock unit of the at least one float locker subassembly to unlock the leading edge and to sense the unlocking of the leading edge; configuring an autolock control system to receive telemetry from each of the at least one autolock unit related to the unlocking of the leading edge; determining that each of the at least one autolock unit has unlocked the leading edge and taking corrective action if at least one autoock unit has not unlocked the leading edge; and communicating with the pool cover deployment system and commanding the pool cover deployment system to start retracting the leading edge once a positive determination is made that each of the at least one autolock unit has unlocked the leading edge.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><heading id="h0003">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">The invention is herein described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:
