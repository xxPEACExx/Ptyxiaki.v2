LEDs have the potential to exhibit very high efficiencies relative to conventional incandescent or fluorescent lights. However, significant challenges remain in providing LED lamps that simultaneously achieve high efficiencies, high luminous flux, good color reproduction and acceptable color stability. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005"> [0003] LEDs generally include a series of semiconductor layers that may be epitaxially grown on a substrate such as, for example, a sapphire, silicon, silicon carbide, gallium nitride or gallium arsenide substrate. One or more semiconductor p-n junctions are formed in these epitaxial layers. When a sufficient voltage is applied across the p-n junction, electrons in the n-type semiconductor layers and holes in the p-type semiconductor layers flow toward the p-n junction. As the electrons and holes flow toward each other, some of the electrons will "collide" with corresponding holes and recombine. Each time this occurs, a photon of light is emitted, which is how LEDs generate light. The wavelength distribution of the light generated by an LED generally depends on the semiconductor materials used and the structure of the thin epitaxial layers that make up the "active region" of the device (i.e., the area where the light is generated). </p><p id="p0006" num="0006"> [0004] Most LEDs are nearly monochromatic light sources that appear to emit light having a single color. Thus, the spectral power distribution of the light emitted by most LEDs is tightly centered about a "peak" wavelength, which is the single wavelength where the spectral power distribution or "emission spectrum" of the LED reaches its maximum as 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 detected by a photo-detector. The "width" of the spectral power distribution of most LEDs is between about 10 nm and 30 nm, where the width is measured at half the maximum illumination on each side of the emission spectrum (this width is referred to as the full-width- half-maximum or "FWHM" width). LEDs are often identified by their "peak" wavelength or, alternatively, by their "dominant" wavelength. The dominant wavelength of an LED is the wavelength of monochromatic light that has the same apparent color as the light emitted by the LED as perceived by the human eye. Because the human eye does not perceive all wavelengths equally (it perceives yellow and green better than red and blue), and because the light emitted by most LEDs is actually a range of wavelengths, the color perceived (i.e., the dominant wavelength) may differ from the peak wavelength. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> [0005] In order to use LEDs to generate white light, LED lamps have been provided that include several LEDs that each emit a light of a different color. The different colors combine to produce a desired intensity and/or color of white light. For example, by simultaneously energizing red, green and blue LEDs, the resulting combined light may appear white, or nearly white, depending on, for example, the relative intensities, peak wavelengths and spectral power distributions of the source red, green and blue LEDs. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> [0006] White light may also be produced by partially or fully surrounding a blue, purple or ultraviolet LED with one or more luminescent materials such as phosphors that convert some of the light emitted by the LED to light of one or more other colors. The combination of the light emitted by the LED that is not converted by the luminescent material(s) and the light of other colors that are emitted by the luminescent material(s) may produce a white or near-white light. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> [0007] As one example, a white LED lamp may be formed by coating a gallium nitride-based blue LED with a yellow luminescent material such as a cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet phosphor (which has the chemical formula Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>0i<sub>2</sub>:Ce, and is commonly referred to as YAG:Ce). The blue LED produces an emission with a peak wavelength of, for example, about 460 nm. Some of blue light emitted by the LED passes between and/or through the YAG:Ce phosphor particles without being down-converted, while other of the blue light emitted by the LED is absorbed by the YAG:Ce phosphor, which becomes excited and emits yellow fluorescence with a peak wavelength of about 550 nm (i.e., the blue light is down-converted to yellow light). A viewer will perceive the combination of blue light and yellow light that is emitted by the coated LED as white light. This light typically perceived as being cool white in color, as it primarily includes light on the lower half (shorter wavelength side) of the visible emission spectrum. To make the emitted white light appear 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 more "warm" and/or exhibit better color rendering properties, red-light emitting luminescent materials such as CaAlSiN<sub>3</sub> based phosphor particles may be added to the coating. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Alternatively, the cool white emissions from the combination of the blue LED and the YAG:Ce phosphor may be supplemented with a red LED (e.g., comprising AlInGaP, having a dominant wavelength of approximately 619 nm) to provide warmer light. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> [0008] Phosphors are the luminescent materials that are most widely used to convert a single-color (typically blue or violet) LED into a white LED. Herein, the term "phosphor" may refer to any material that absorbs light at one wavelength and re-emits light at a different wavelength in the visible spectrum, regardless of the delay between absorption and re-emission and regardless of the wavelengths involved. Thus, the term "phosphor" encompasses materials that are sometimes called fluorescent and/or phosphorescent. In general, phosphors may absorb light having first wavelengths and re-emit light having second wavelengths that are different from the first wavelengths. For example, "down-conversion" phosphors may absorb light having shorter wavelengths and re-emit light having longer wavelengths. In addition to phosphors, other luminescent materials include scintillators, day glow tapes, nanophosphors, quantum dots, and inks that glow in the visible spectrum upon illumination with (e.g., ultraviolet) light. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> [0009] A medium that includes one or more luminescent materials that is positioned to receive light that is emitted by an LED or other semiconductor light emitting device is referred to herein as a "recipient luminophoric medium." Exemplary recipient luminophoric mediums include layers having luminescent materials that are coated or sprayed directly onto, for example, a semiconductor light emitting device or on surfaces of a lens or other elements of the packaging thereof, and clear encapsulents (e.g., epoxy-based or silicone-based curable resin) that include luminescent materials that are arranged to partially or fully cover a semiconductor light emitting device. A recipient luminophoric medium may include one medium layer or the like in which one or more luminescent materials are mixed, multiple stacked layers or mediums, each of which may include one or more of the same or different luminescent materials, and/or multiple spaced apart layers or mediums, each of which may include the same or different luminescent materials. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">SUMMARY </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> [0010] Pursuant to some embodiments of the present invention, light emitting devices are provided which include first, second and third strings of at least one LED each, and a drive circuit that is configured to set the relative drive currents provided to the first and

At least some of the light emitting devices in the multiple strings have associated recipient luminophoric mediums that include one or more luminescent materials. At least two of the strings may be independently controllable, which may allow the packaged semiconductor light emitting device to be adjusted to emit light having a desired color.

The design and fabrication of semiconductor light emitting devices are well known to those skilled in the art, and hence further description thereof will be omitted. </p><p id="p0048" num="0048"> [0041] Visible light may include light having many different wavelengths. The apparent color of visible light to humans can be illustrated with reference to a two- dimensional chromaticity diagram, such as the 1931 CIE Chromaticity Diagram illustrated in FIG. 1. Chromaticity diagrams provide a useful reference for defining colors as weighted sums of colors. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="13"/>-->
 [0042] As shown in FIG. 1, colors on a 1931 CIE Chromaticity Diagram are defined by x and y coordinates (i.e., chromaticity coordinates, or color points) that fall within a generally U-shaped area that includes all of the hues perceived by the human eye. Colors on or near the outside of the area are saturated colors composed of light having a single wavelength, or a very small wavelength distribution. Colors on the interior of the area are unsaturated colors that are composed of a mixture of different wavelengths. White light, which can be a mixture of many different wavelengths, is generally found near the middle of the diagram, in the region labeled 2 in FIG. 1. There are many different hues of light that may be considered "white," as evidenced by the size of the region 2. For example, some "white" light, such as light generated by tungsten filament incandescent lighting devices, may appear yellowish in color, while other "white" light, such as light generated by some fluorescent lighting devices, may appear more bluish in color. </p><p id="p0049" num="0049"> [0043] Each point in the diagram of FIG. 1 is referred to as the "color point" of a light source that emits a light having that color. As shown in FIG. 1 a locus of color points that is referred to as the "black-body" locus 4 exists which corresponds to the location of color points of light emitted by a black-body radiator that is heated to various temperatures. The black-body locus 4 is also referred to as the "planckian" locus because the chromaticity coordinates (i.e., color points) that lie along the black-body locus obey Planck's equation: Ε(λ)=Α V<sup>5</sup>/(e<sup>B T</sup>-l), where E is the emission intensity, λ is the emission wavelength, T is the color temperature of the black-body and A and B are constants. Color coordinates that lie on or near the black-body locus 4 yield pleasing white light to a human observer. </p><p id="p0050" num="0050"> [0044] As a heated object becomes incandescent, it first glows reddish, then yellowish, and finally bluish with increasing temperature. This occurs because the wavelength associated with the peak radiation of the black-body radiator becomes progressively shorter with increased temperature, consistent with the Wien Displacement Law. Illuminants that produce light which is on or near the black-body locus 4 can thus be described in terms of their correlated color temperature (CCT). The 1931 CIE Diagram of FIG. 1 includes temperature listings along the black-body locus that show the color path of a black-body radiator that is caused to increase to such temperatures. As used herein, the term "white light" refers to light that is perceived as white, is within 7 MacAdam ellipses of the black-body locus on a 1931 CIE chromaticity diagram, and has a CCT ranging from 2000K to 10,000K. White light with a CCT of 3000K may appear yellowish in color, while white light with a CCT of 8000K or more may appear more bluish in color, and may be referred to as "cool" white light. "Warm" white light may be used to describe white light with a CCT of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="14"/>-->
 between about 2500K and 4500K, which is more reddish or yellowish in color. Warm white light is generally a pleasing color to a human observer. Warm white light with a CCT of 2500K to 3300K may be preferred for certain applications. </p><p id="p0051" num="0051"> [0045] The ability of a light source to accurately reproduce color in illuminated objects is typically characterized using the color rendering index ("CRI Ra"). The CRI Ra of a light source is a modified average of the relative measurements of how the color rendition of an illumination system compares to that of a reference black-body radiator when illuminating eight reference colors. Thus, the CRI Ra is a relative measure of the shift in surface color of an object when lit by a particular lamp. The CRI Ra equals 100 if the color coordinates of a set of test colors being illuminated by the illumination system are the same as the coordinates of the same test colors being irradiated by the black-body radiator. </p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Daylight generally has a CRI Ra of nearly 100, incandescent bulbs have a CRI Ra of about 95, fluorescent lighting typically has a CRI Ra of about 70 to 85, while monochromatic light sources have a CRI Ra of essentially zero. Light sources for general illumination </p><p id="p0053" num="0053">applications with a CRI Ra of less than 50 are generally considered very poor and are typically only used in applications where economic issues preclude other alternatives. Light sources with a CRI Ra value between 70 and 80 have application for general illumination where the colors of objects are not important. For some general interior illumination, a CRI Ra value of greater than 80 is acceptable. A light source with color coordinates within 4 MacAdam step ellipses of the black-body locus 4 and a CRI Ra value that exceeds 85 is more suitable for general illumination purposes. Light sources with CRI Ra values of more than 90 provide good color quality. </p><p id="p0054" num="0054"> [0046] For backlight, general illumination and various other applications, it is often desirable to provide a lighting source that generates white light having a relatively high CRI Ra, so that objects illuminated by the lighting source may appear to have more natural coloring to the human eye. Accordingly, such lighting sources may typically include an array of semiconductor lighting devices including red, green and blue light emitting devices. When red, green and blue light emitting devices are energized simultaneously, the resulting combined light may appear white, or nearly white, depending on the relative intensities of the red, green and blue sources. However, even light that is a combination of red, green and blue emitters may have a low CRI Ra, particularly if the emitters generate saturated light, because such light may lack contributions from many visible wavelengths. </p><p id="p0055" num="0055"> [0047] Pursuant to embodiments of the present invention, semiconductor light emitting devices are provided that may be designed to emit warm white light and to have high

A "BSY LED" refers to a blue LED and an associated recipient luminophoric medium that together emit light having a color point that falls within a trapezoidal "BSY region" on the 1931 CIE Chromaticity Diagram defined by the following x, y chromaticity coordinates: (0.32, 0.40), (0.36, 0.48), (0.43 0.45), (0.36, 0.38), (0.32, 0.40), which is generally within the yellow color range. A "BSG LED" refers to a blue LED and an associated recipient luminophoric medium that together emit light having a color point that falls within a trapezoidal "BSG region" on the 1931 CIE Chromaticity Diagram defined by the following x, y chromaticity coordinates: (0.35, 0.48), (0.26, 0.50), (0.13 0.26), (0.15, 0.20), (0.26, 0.28), (0,35, 0.48), which is generally within the green color range. A "BSR LED" refers to a blue LED that includes a recipient luminophoric medium that emits light having a dominant wavelength between 600 and 720 nm. Typically, the red LEDs and/or BSR LEDs will have a dominant wavelength between 600 and 660 nm, and in most cases between 600 and 640 nm.

When a string includes multiple LEDs, the LEDs in the string 11, 12, 13 are typically arranged in series, although other configurations are possible. </p><p id="p0062" num="0062"> [0053] As further shown in FIG. 3, the semiconductor light emitting device 10 also includes first, second and third current control circuits 14, 15, 16.

The drive current levels may be selected so that the device 10 will emit combined radiation that has a color point at or near a desired color point. While the device 10 of FIG. 3 includes three current control circuits 14, 15, 16, it will be appreciated in light of the discussion below that

 other configurations are possible. For example, in other embodiments, one of the current control circuit 14, 15, 16 may be replaced with a non-adjustable drive circuit that provides a fixed drive current to its respective LED string. </p><p id="p0063" num="0063"> [0054] Typically, a packaged semiconductor light emitting device such as the device 10 of FIG. 3 will be designed to emit light having a specific color point. This target color point is often on the black-body locus 4 of FIG. 1 and, in such cases, the target color point may be expressed as a particular color temperature along the black-body locus 4. For example, a warm white downlight for residential applications (such downlights are used as replacements for 65 Watt incandescent "can" lights that are routinely mounted in the ceilings of homes) may have a specified color temperature of 3100K, which corresponds to the point labeled "A" on the 1931 CIE Chromaticity Diagram of FIG. 1. Producing light that has this color temperature may be achieved, for example, by selecting some combination of LEDs and recipient luminophoric mediums that together produce light that combines to have the specified color point. </p><p id="p0064" num="0064"> [0055] Unfortunately, a number of factors may make it difficult to produce semiconductor light emitting devices that emit light at or near a desired color point. As one example, the plurality of LEDs that are produced by singulating an LED wafer will rarely exhibit identical characteristics. Instead, the output power, peak wavelength, FWHM width and other characteristics of singulated LEDs from a given wafer will exhibit some degree of variation. Likewise, the thickness of a recipient luminophoric medium that is coated on an LED wafer or on a singulated LED may also vary, as may the concentration and size distribution of the luminescent materials therein. Such variations will result in variations in the spectral power output of the light emitted by the luminescent materials. </p><p id="p0065" num="0065"> [0056] The above-discussed variations (and others) can complicate a </p><p id="p0066" num="0066">manufacturers efforts to produce semiconductor light emitting devices having a pre-selected color point. By way of example, if a particular semiconductor light emitting device is designed to use blue LEDs having a peak wavelength of 460 nm in order to achieve a specified color temperature along the black-body locus 4 of FIG. 1, then an LED wafer that is grown to provide 460 nm LED chips may only produce a relatively small quantity of 460 nm LED chips, with the remainder of the wafer producing LEDs having peak wavelengths at a distribution around 460 nm (e.g., 454 to 464 nm). If a manufacturer wants to remain very close to the desired color point, it may decide to only use LED chips that have a peak wavelength of 460 nm or only use LEDs having peak wavelengths that are very close to 460 nm (e.g., 459 to 461 nm). If such a decision is made, then the manufacturer will need to grow 
<!-- EPO <DP n="18"/>-->
 or purchase a larger number of LED wafers to obtain the necessary number of LEDs that have peak wavelengths within the acceptable range, and will also need to find markets for the LEDs that have peak wavelengths outside the acceptable range. </p><p id="p0067" num="0067"> [0057] In order to reduce the number of LED wafers that must be grown or purchased, an LED manufacturer can, for example, increase the size of the acceptable range of peak wavelengths by selecting LEDs on opposite sides of the specified peak wavelength. By way of example, if a particular design requires LEDs having a peak wavelength of 460 nm, then use of LEDs having peak wavelengths of 457 nm and 463 nm may together produce light that is relatively close to the light emitted by an LED from the same wafer that has a peak wavelength of 460 nm. Thus, a manufacturer can "blend" multiple LEDs together to produce the equivalent of the desired LED. A manufacturer may use similar "blending" techniques with respect o variations in the output power of LEDs, FWHM width and various other parameters. As the number of parameters is increased, the task of determining combinations of multiple LEDs (and luminescent materials) that will have a combined color point that is close to a desired color point can be a complex undertaking. </p><p id="p0068" num="0068"> [0058] Pursuant to embodiments of the present invention, methods of tuning a semiconductor light emitting device are provided that can be used to adjust the light output thereof such that the emitted light is at or near a desired color point.

However, due to manufacturing variations, blending and various other factors, the manufactured device may not achieve the designed color point, as is shown graphically in FIG. 4 where the point 28 that represents the color point of the manufactured device is offset by some distance from the black-body locus 4, and is near the point on the black-body locus corresponding to a correlated color temperature of 3800K as opposed to the desired color temperature of 3200K. Pursuant to embodiments of the present invention, the device 10 may be tuned to emit light that is closer to the desired color point 27 by adjusting the relative drive currents provided to the strings 11, 12, 13. </p><p id="p0072" num="0072"> [0062] For example, pursuant to some embodiments, the color point of the light emitted by the combination of the first string of BSY LEDs 11 and the second string of BSG LEDs 12 may be moved along line 30 of FIG. 4 by adjusting the drive currents provided to one or both of BSY LED string 11 and BSG LED string 12. In particular, if the drive current provided to BSY LED string 11 is increased relative to the drive current supplied to BSG LED string 12, then the color point will move to the right from point 24 along line 30. If, alternatively, the drive current provided to BSY LED string 11 is decreased relative to the drive current supplied to BSG LED string 12, then the color point will move from point 24 to the left along line 30. In order to tune the device 10 to emit light having a color temperature of 3200K, the drive current provided to BSY LED string 11 is thus increased relative to the drive current supplied to BSG LED string 12 in an amount that moves the color point of the

Thus, the above example illustrates how the drive current to the LED strings 11, 12, 13 can be tuned so that the device 10 outputs light at or near a desired color point. Such a tuning process may be used to reduce or eliminate deviations from a desired color point that result from, for example manufacturing variations in the output power, peak wavelength, phosphor thicknesses, phosphor conversion ratios and the like. </p><p id="p0074" num="0074"> [0064] It will be appreciated in light of the discussion above that if a </p><p id="p0075" num="0075">semiconductor light emitting device that includes independently controllable light sources that emit light at three different color points, then it may be theoretically possible to tune the device to any color point that falls within the triangle defined by the color points of the three light sources.

As discussed above, the drive currents may be separately adjusted to tune the combined light output of the packaged device 40 to more closely approximate a target color point, even when the individual LEDs 48 may deviate to some degree from output light color coordinates and/or lumen intensities that are specified in the design of device 40.

The conductive layer 92 may be in at least partial vertical alignment with the LEDs 48. In one embodiment, the conductive layer is not in electrical communication with elements (e.g., LEDs) disposed on top surface of the submount 42.

The conductive layer 92 can aid heat dissipation by allowing this heat to spread from concentrated areas proximate the LEDs into the larger area of the layer 92 to promote dissipation and/or conductive transfer to an external heat sink (not shown). The conductive layer 92 may include holes 94 providing access to the submount 42, to relieve strain between the submount 42 and the metal layer 92 during fabrication and/or during operation. In certain embodiments, thermally conductive vias or plugs that pass at least partially through the submount 42 and are in thermal contact with the conductive layer 92 may be provided.

Then, a drive current that is provided to the third string of at least one LED is set so that the color point on the 1931 CIE Chromaticity Diagram of the combined output of the packaged multi- emitter semiconductor light emitting device is approximately at the desired color point (block 105). </p><p id="p0112" num="0112"> [0096] In some embodiments, the first string of LEDs may include at least one BSY LED, and the second string of LEDs may include at least one BSG LED. The third string of at least one LED may include at least one red LED and/or at least one BSR LED. The color point on the 1931 CIE Chromaticity Diagram of the combined output of the multi- emitter semiconductor light emitting device may be within three MacAdam ellipses from a selected color point on the black-body locus. </p><p id="p0113" num="0113"> [0097] In some embodiments of the present invention, the drive currents supplied to the strings may be set in the fashion described above at the factory in order to tune the device to a particular color point. In some cases, adjustable resistors or resistor networks, digital to analog converters with flash memory, and/or fuse link diodes may then be set to fixed values so that the packaged semiconductor light emitting device will be set to emit light at or near the desired color point. However, according to further embodiments of the present invention, semiconductor light emitting devices may be provided which allow an end user to set the color point of the device. </p><p id="p0114" num="0114"> [0098] For example, in some embodiments, semiconductor light emitting devices may be provided that include at least two different color temperature settings. By way of example, a device might have a first setting at which the drive currents to various strings of light emitting devices that are included in the device are set to provide a first light output having a color temperature of between 4000K and 5000K, which end users may prefer in the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="31"/>-->
 daytime, and a second light output having a color temperature of between 2500K and 3500K, which users may prefer at night. </p><p id="p0115" num="0115"> [0099] FIG. 11 illustrates a packaged semiconductor light emitting device 200 according to certain embodiments of the present invention that is configured so that an end user to adjust the color point of the light output by the device 200. The particular device 200 depicted in FIG. 11 takes advantage of the fact that BSY LEDs and BSG LEDs may be selected such that a first color point that represents the output of a BSY LED string and a second color point that represents the output of a BSG LED string may define a line that runs generally parallel to the black-body locus 4, as is apparent from FIG. 2. As such, by adjusting the relative drive currents supplied to a BSY LED string and a BSG LED string, it may be possible for an end user to adjust the color point of the device 200 to move more or less along a selected portion of the black-body locus 4. Moreover, it has been discovered that at warmer color temperatures, the emissions from a string of BSY LEDs and red LEDs may generate light having both high CRI Ra values and good luminous efficiency. Likewise, at cooler color temperatures, the emissions from a string of BSG LEDs and red LEDs may generate light having both high CRI Ra values and good luminous efficiency. </p><p id="p0116" num="0116"> [00100] Turning to FIG. 11, it can be seen that the device 200 includes a first string of BSY LEDs 11, a second string of BSG LEDs 12, and a third string of red-light emitting LEDs 13. The device 200 also includes first, second and third current control circuits 14, 15, 16, which were described above with respect to FIG. 3. The device 200 further includes a user input device 200 which could comprise, for example, a knob, slider bar or the like that are commonly used as dimming elements on conventional dimmer switches for incandescent lights. When an end user adjusts the position of this input device, a control signal is generated that is provided to a control system 17. In response to this control signal, the control system 17 sends control signals to one . or both of the first and second current control circuits 14, 15 which cause one or both of those circuits to adjust their output drive currents in a fashion that changes the relative levels of the drive currents supplied to BSY LED string 11 and BSG LED string 12. By adjusting these relative drive current levels, the combined output of the strings 11 and 12 moves along a line defined by the color point of string 11 and the color point of string 12. As noted above, the device 200 may be designed so that this line runs generally parallel to the black-body locus 4. So long as the drive current supplied by the third control circuit 16 is factory set to place the color point of the combined output of the device 200 at or near the black body locus, the end user may use the user input device 18 to change the color temperature of the device 200 over a fairly broad range (e.g., . 
<!-- EPO <DP n="32"/>-->
 2800 K to 6500 K) while still keeping the color point of the device 200 on or near the black body locus 4. </p><p id="p0117" num="0117"> [00101] A wide variety of changes may be made to the device 200 of FIG. 11. For example, in other embodiments, an end user could be provided input devices that allow control of the relative drive currents of (1) string 11 to string 12 and (2) the combination of strings 11 and 12 to string 13. In such embodiments, the end user can control the device 200 to emit light over a much wider range of color points. In a further embodiment, the end user could be provided independent control of the drive current to each of strings 11, 12 and 13. In still other embodiments, the user input device 18 could be a multi-position switch (e.g., 2 to 6 positions), where each position corresponds to drive current for each string 11, 12, 13 that provides light having a pre-set color point (e.g., pre-set color points 500K or 1000K apart along the black-body locus 4). </p><p id="p0118" num="0118"> [00102] According to still further embodiments of the present invention, tunable multi-emitter semiconductor light emitting devices are provided which automatically adjust the drive currents provided to one or more of multiple strings of light emitting devices included therein. By way of example, it is known that when LEDs constructed using different semiconductor material systems (e.g., both GaN-based LEDs and InAlGaP-based LEDs) are used in the same light emitting device, the characteristics of the LEDs may vary differently with operating temperature, over time, etc. As such, the color point of the light produced by such devices is not necessarily stable. Pursuant to further embodiments of the present invention, tunable packaged multi-emitter semiconductor light emitting devices are provided with automatically adjusting drive currents that compensate for such variable changes. The automatic adjustment may, for example, be pre-programmed or responsive to sensors. </p><p id="p0119" num="0119"> [00103] FIG. 12 is a schematic block diagram of a tunable multi-emitter semiconductor light emitting device 300 that is configured to automatically adjust the drive currents provided to the LED strings included therein. As shown in FIG. 12, the device 300 includes one a first string of LEDs 311, a second string of LEDs 312, and a third string of LEDs 313. In some embodiments, the first string 311 may comprise one or more BSY LEDs, the second string 312 may comprise one or more BSG LEDs, and the third string 313 may comprise one or more red LEDs and/or one or more BSR LEDs. </p><p id="p0120" num="0120"> [00104] The device 300 also includes first, second and third current control circuits 314, 315, 316. The first, second and third current control circuits 314, 315, 316 are configured to provide respective drive currents to the first, second and third strings of LEDs 
<!-- EPO <DP n="33"/>-->
 311, 312, 313, and may be used to set the drive currents that are provided to the respective first through third strings of LEDs 311, 312, 313 at levels that are set so the device 300 will emit combined radiation at or near a desired color point. </p><p id="p0121" num="0121"> [00105] The device 300 further includes a control system 317 and a sensor 320. The sensor 320 may sense various characteristics such as, for example, the temperature of the device 300. Data regarding the sensed characteristics is provided from the sensor 320 to the control system 317. In response to this data, the control system 317 may automatically cause one or more of the first, second and third current control circuits 314, 315, 316 to adjust the drive currents that are provided to the respective first, second and third strings of LEDs 311,</p><p id="p0122" num="0122">312, 313. The control system 317 may be programmed to adjust the drive currents that are provided to the respective first, second and third strings of LEDs 311, 312, 313 in a manner that tends to maintain the color point of the light emitted by the device 300 despite changes in various characteristics such as the temperature of the device 300. </p><p id="p0123" num="0123"> [00106] In some embodiments, the control system 317 may also be preprogrammed to make adjustments to the drive currents that is not responsive to data from sensor 320. For example, if the emissions of, for example, the LEDs in the third string of LEDs 313 degrades over time more quickly than the emissions of the first and second strings of LEDs 311, 312, then the control system 317 may be pre-programmed to, for example, cause the third current control circuit 316 to slowly increase the drive current that is provided to the third string of LEDs 313 over time (e.g., in discrete steps at certain time points) in order to better maintain the color point of the light emitted by the device 300 over time. </p><p id="p0124" num="0124"> [00107] Various embodiments of the present invention that are discussed above adjust the drive current supplied to one or more of multiple strings of light emitting devices that have separate color points in order to adjust a color point of the overall light output of the device.

For instance, in some of the embodiments discussed above, identical LEDs may be used in each of the multiple strings, while each of the strings use different recipient luminophoric mediums in order to provide multiple strings having different color points. In other embodiments, some strings may use the same underlying LEDs and different recipient luminophoric mediums, while other strings use different LEDs (e.g., a saturated red LED) in order to provide the multiple strings having different color points.
