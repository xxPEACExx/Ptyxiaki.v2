In ophthalmology, for example, applications include the use of a laser for photocoagulation, i.e., the irradiation of light causing tissue damage. Photocoagulation is used to treat retinal disorder diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic maculopathy (DMP), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), a central serous retinopathy (CSR). In addition, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5549596A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,549,596</text></patcit> describes the use of selective laser targeting as a method of damaging pigmented intraocular cells while sparing adjacent nonpigmented cells.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">The invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that if a tissue is irradiated with a sublethal dose of radiation, e.g., from a laser, that pigmented cells in the tissue are selectively stimulated (i.e., photostimulated) to proliferate and to produce higher levels of certain mitogenic factors and growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Thus, the sublethal radiation, when properly applied, can cause a cellular biochemical response, which induces proliferation and growth, and thereby results in a healing effect on atrophied or diseased tissue, while avoiding cell damage and cell death.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In particular, the various parameters of a pulsed radiation, such as power, pulse duration (which is also referred to herein as "pulse width"), total radiation energy (which is also referred to herein as "fluence"), wavelength, and if multiple pulses are used, the pulse rate and total number of pulses, are carefully selected and controlled to minimize<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> killing the irradiated pigmented cells. For example, the duration of the sublethal laser pulse, or pulses, should be less than the thermal relaxation time of individual cells in the tissue, and the wavelength used should be close to the absorbance maximum of the cells to be targeted, or of a pigment within those cells.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The methods described herein involve selectively photostimulating pigmented cells, such as intraocular cells, e.g., trabecular meshwork (TM) cells, retinal pigmented epithelial cells, uveal pigmented cells, melanoma cells, or conjunctival pigmented cells. The pigmented cells may contain endogenously synthesized pigment, or may be cells, e.g., phagocytic cells, into which exogenous pigment is introduced by contacting the phagocytic cells with exogenous pigment before irradiating the area of tissue containing the cells. Alternatively, pigments can be introduced to non-phagocytic cells by genetic engineering techniques or by passing the pigments through the cell membrane.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As used herein, endogenous pigment refers to pigment synthesized and retained within a cell, and exogenous pigment refers to pigment within a cell that was not synthesized within the same cell.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In some embodiments, the phagocytic cell is a trabecular meshwork cell and exogenous pigment is introduced into the aqueous humor by laser irradiation of the iris.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The new methods involve irradiating tissue with a "sublethal" fluence or total dose of radiation administered in one treatment session that involves the administration of one or a short series of pulses administered so as to photostimulate the pigmented cells in the tissue, while keeping a significant percentage (over 90%) of the total cells within the irradiated tissue alive, as measured by a live/dead viability/cytotoxicity assay.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The sublethal fluence varies for different powers, wavelengths, pulse durations, and repetition rates, as well as for different laser and cell types and levels of pigmentation in the cells. For example, for a single pulse irradiation of RPE cells with pulse durations between 250 ns and 3 µs, the sublethal fluence can be in the range of from about 5 to 8 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> to about 250 to 285 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, e.g., about 10 to 220, 25 to 200, and 55 to 110 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. For example, a fluence of less than 120 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> for a treatment session of one 1 µs pulse at 590 nm is a sublethal fluence using a pulsed dye laser on RPE cells. As a further example, for a single pulse irradiation of RPE cells with pulse durations below 250 ns, e.g., pulse durations of 10-20 ns, the sublethal fluence can be in the range of from<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> about 0.1 to 1 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> to about 20 to 30 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, e.g., about 0.5 to 20, 1 to 15, and 5 to 10 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup><sub>.</sub></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As used herein, selective photostimulation of cells is an effect induced by a laser that is operated at a wavelength preferentially absorbed by a specific pigment in pigmented cells compared to unpigmented (also referred to herein as nonpigmented) cells. The effect is to cause the irradiated pigmented cells to have a biochemical response that increases production of certain mitogenic and/or growth factors such as, for example, one or more of Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFβ), Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF), Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor (PEDF), and heat stock proteins, and/or to cause the irradiated cells to increase their level of proliferation compared to non-irradiated and unpigmented cells.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As used herein, an unpigmented or nonpigmented cell is a cell that has a level of a specific pigment that is less than half of the level found in a given pigmented cell.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In general, in one aspect, the invention features methods of selectively photostimulating pigmented cells in a tissue in a patient that include selecting a region of tissue containing a pigmented target cell and a nonpigmented cell, wherein the pigment is either endogenously synthesized or exogenous pigment, and irradiating the tissue with one or more radiation pulses, e.g., from a laser, wherein each pulse comprises (i) a wavelength that is absorbed more in the pigmented cell than in the nonpigmented cell, and (ii) a pulse duration that is shorter than a thermal relaxation time of the pigmented cell, and wherein the total radiation energy applied provides a sublethal fluence to the pigmented target cells, thereby selectively photostimulating pigmented cells in the tissue.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Embodiments of the methods can include one or more of the following features and/or features of other aspects described herein.

The radiation can have a wavelength in the visible spectrum (e.g., in a range from about 400 nm to about 800 nm).</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In other embodiments, the sublethal laser fluence of the total laser radiation can be below 200 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> and the pulse duration can be about 10 nanoseconds and the radiation can have a wavelength in the infrared spectrum (e.g., in the range from 1000 nm to 1500 nm).</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The methods can include a subsequent irradiation step or steps after a regeneration period.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In some embodiments, the one or more laser radiation pulses can impinge upon the tissue in a target spot having a diameter of between about 0.05 and about 1.5 mm or about 0.1 and about 1.0 mm.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In various embodiments, the tissue can include a melanoma or intraocular tissue, e.g., a trabecular meshwork cell, a retinal pigmented epithelial cell, a uveal pigmented cell, and/or a melanoma cell.

During studies that will be described below, ARPE-19 cells were irradiated at various radiant exposures (mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) using the experimental set-up shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. A Helium-Neon laser with an output of 15 mW, coupled into the optical path, was used for the alignment of the laser beam. The pulsed dye laser was coupled to a 1 mm core diameter fiber (Thorlabs, Inc.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> Newton, N.J., USA, NA = 0.22) and the length of the fiber was 50 m to minimize spatial intensity modulation due to speckle formation at the distal fiber tip.

In some experiments described herein, the following parameters were used: a laser fluence of 5 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>- 2500 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, a laser pulse duration of 1 µs, and 200 spots per 3.5-cm-diameter tissue. Laser treatment spots were separated by, for example, a distance of 2 mm. The laser profile was determined to be about 1.2 mm in diameter. Thus, the laser irradiation was calculated as the pulse energy (measured by the power meter) divided by the spot area.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In some embodiments, laser irradiation can be delivered through a slit-lamp delivery system such that an appropriate radiant exposure is achieved at the focal point of the slit-lamp optics.

First, one selects a tissue area that one would like to stimulate (step <b>30).</b> The tissue area contains either cells showing sufficient pigment concentration or pigment can be introduced before or after the selection (step <b>30).</b> The selected area may be diagnosed as being atrophic or the selected area may be related to a damaged area of tissue. In the first case, the goal is to reinstate a healthy or healthier tissue by photostimulated proliferation. In the second case, the goal is to increase the migration rate of healthy cells into the damaged region of tissue.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Next, a first photostimulation treatment session I (step <b>35)</b> is performed. During the photostimulation session I, a single or a sequence of laser pulses are irradiated onto the tissue (step <b>37).</b> The single laser pulse or the sequence of laser pulses provide a sublethal fluence to the selected area. The irradiation can be performed, for example, in non-moving mode, a continuous-scan mode, or in a pattern mode. If the laser treatment can be executed in multiple modes, a select irradiation step (step <b>39)</b> may be part of the photostimulation session I (step <b>35)</b> and precede the single or a sequence of laser pulses.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">During a so-called "healing" phase (step <b>40),</b> the irradiated tissue develops an increased proliferation and tissue repair activity. This phase is the cells' biochemical response to photostimulation. The healing phase may be temporally limited, such that the selective photostimulated treatment includes a second photostimulation session II (step <b>45)</b> or a sequence of photostimulation sessions interrupted by healing phases. The number of photostimulation sessions can be determined in advance or can be adjusted during the treatment by observing the success of the treatment. Additionally, the parameter of the photostimulation sessions can vary or can be adopted during the treatment.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The methods described herein involve selectively photostimulating pigmented cells. When an area of tissue containing pigmented cells is irradiated with a laser, such as a q-switched Nd:YAG laser, the cells in the irradiated tissue are induced to proliferate and cause repair and/or regeneration of the tissue. The biological effects are selectively limited to the illuminated region as well as to the cells that express the chromophore that absorbs the laser light. The cells to be targeted may express an endogenous chromophore (e.g., retinal epithelium), or the chromophore can be introduced artificially or by expression of the chromophore within the cells can be induced using a variety of techniques, such as by gene therapy.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In some modes of practicing the invention, a short-pulsed, Nd:YAG q-switched laser is used. Generally, Nd:YAG lasers emit at 1064 nm, and when frequency doubled yield 532 nm output. Both of these wavelengths are useful within the eye, because they are transmitted by ocular media and structures including the cornea, aqueous humor, lens, vitreous, and sclera. In other embodiments, a pulsed dye laser (e.g., a Palomar 3010; 590<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> nm, 1 µs, 1 mm diameter) can be used, as well as diode pumped solid state lasers, pulsed diode laser systems, or even incoherent pulsed light sources.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In general, the pigment in the cells makes the pigmented target cells optically denser than the nonpigmented surrounding cells, and thus more susceptible to laser-induced photostimulation at selected laser wavelengths and fluences. At sublethal fluences, light, impinging on the target tissue areas for short time durations, selectively stimulates the pigmented target cells with minimal damage to both the target cell and the surrounding cells. The selectivity of tissue stimulation is of great clinical benefit in treating pathological conditions restricted to pigmented cells. For these conditions, the proliferation of the stimulated cells can be increased.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The new methods require the use of laser irradiation that provides a sublethal fluence, or total radiation exposure, for a given treatment session of a specific type of cell with a known or estimated level of endogenous or exogenous pigmentation. At a pulse duration of about 1-5 µs, using a pulsed dye laser or a diode pumped solid state laser, fluences of below 130 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, for example, of about 5, 8, 10, 15, 25, 35, 50, 75, 100, 110, or 120 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, are sublethal fluences, and are thus effective at photostimulating pigmented RPE cells (with endogenous melanin as the pigment) without causing significant killing of the pigmented cells, and without causing photocoagulation of the tissue. Because of the selective targeting of the new methods, unpigmented cells are also spared, and thus do not mount a cellular response.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">At pulse durations of several nanoseconds to several 100 nanoseconds, the sublethal fluence shifts to lower values and can be in the range of from about several µJ/cm<sup>2</sup> to about several mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, e.g., about 10 µJ/cm<sup>2</sup> to 30 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, 0.1 to 10, and 1 to 5 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. For example, a fluence of less than 10 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> for a treatment session of a 10 nanosecond pulse at 532 nm can be a sublethal fluence using a Q-switched Nd-YAG laser. At shorter pulse durations, lower fluences can be effective at photostimulating pigmented RPE cells without causing significant killing of the pigmented cells, and without causing photocoagulation of the tissue. Because of the selective targeting of the new methods, unpigmented cells are also spared for these shorter pulse durations.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The desired radiant exposure can be achieved by modifying the power, target spot size, the beam symmetry, the delivered Joules/pulse, and/or the total number of<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> pulses included in one treatment session. In general, the target spot size is large compared to those utilized in many previous applications of laser therapy to the eye; in some embodiments, the target spot size is from about 0.1 to about 1 mm in diameter. The use of a large target spot size is possible, because the new methods provide selective cell stimulation based on cell pigmentation. A large target area is advantageous: treatment time is minimized when the laser apparatus needs to be redirected fewer times.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Pulse durations of between about 1.0 nanoseconds and about 2.0 µsec, e.g., 50, 100, 250, 500, or 750 nanoseconds, or 1.0 or 1.5 µsec can be utilized. The desired pulse duration is related to the type and size of pigment particle within the target cells to be photostimulated. Because the thermal relaxation of a particle is related to the particle size of the pigment material, smaller intracellular particles require a shorter pulse duration to ensure confinement of energy to the target cells. More specifically, heat is confined within a spherical target for a thermal relaxation time, T<sub>r</sub>, which is related to the target diameter, d<sub>2</sub>, and the thermal diffusivity constant, D, by T<sub>r</sub> = d<sub>2</sub> / 4D. During a lengthy laser exposure, greater than T<sub>r</sub>, heat within the target diffuses to surrounding cells or structures. On the other hand, if heat is generated within the target more rapidly than heat can diffuse away, target temperatures become much higher than their surrounding tissues and thermal diffusion to surrounding structures is minimized. Thus, by choosing a pulse duration shorter than the thermal relaxation time of the target pigment (e.g., melanin), selective target stimulation can be achieved. Assuming spherical targets of about 0.5 µm to 5 µm, estimates of thermal relaxation times for biological targets range from 10<sup>-8</sup> s to 10<sup>-6</sup> s.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The emission wavelength of the laser can be within either the visible or infrared spectra (excluding the absorption lines of water for, e.g., ophthalmologic applications). Additional selectivity for target cells is provided by use of an appropriate laser wavelength. For example, when applying the new methods to retinal tissue, incidental absorption by hemoglobin in the retinal vessels may be avoided by selecting a wavelength of 1064 nm for ablating melanin-containing target cells; this wavelength is absorbed by melanin, but not by hemoglobin.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Within the eye, there are several types of pigmented cells, that can be advantageously stimulated when clinically indicated. These cells acquire pigment by<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> either synthesizing melanin endogenously or by phagocytosing exogenous pigment. Cell types that synthesize and retain melanin include the pigmented epithelial cells of the retina, ciliary body, and iris, as well as ocular melanomas.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Although trabecular meshwork (TM) cells are incapable of synthesizing melanin, these cells typically acquire pigment by phagocytosis from the aqueous humor, which normally contains particles of pigmented cellular debris. In addition, in some embodiments, the pigmentation of TM cells can be augmented by adding pigment to the aqueous humor, e.g., by injecting a suspension of pigmented particles into the anterior chamber of the eye with a fine needle. As the aqueous humor with suspended pigment particles flows from the eye through the TM, the TM cells take up pigment, increasing their optical density relative to surrounding nonpigmented tissue, and improving the cell selectivity of the laser stimulation of the cells. In some embodiments, melanin is introduced into the aqueous humor by laser iridotomy of the iris, which releases melanin particles from iris cells into the aqueous humor. Other pigments, such as India ink or any other nontoxic, insoluble particulate dye, can be introduced to phagocytic target cells prior to laser irradiation to stimulate the pigmented cells. In general, the higher the level of pigmentation, the lower the fluence required to achieve photostimulation.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Within the eye, the pigmented target cells may be on the surface of the cornea or conjunctiva, within the cornea or conjunctiva, or may constitute or be attached to any of the intraocular regions of the eye, such as the inner cornea, iris, ciliary body, lens, vitreous, choroid, retina, optic nerve, ocular blood vessels, or sclera. Specifically, diseases and conditions that can be treated by photostimulation include age-related macular degeneration and any other retinal disorders involving the degeneration or death of retinal epithelial cells.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The examples described herein explain the use of photostimulation when regenerating the retinal epithelium in the eye, however, the same approach can be used to promote repair and regeneration of other tissue, such as skin, muscle, or blood vessel walls, or any tissue in which the cells are, and/or can be, selectively pigmented. Thus, the methods described herein are useful for treating any disease or disorder where proliferation and/or migration of pigmented cells is beneficial.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In general, the term treatment is meant to include any photostimulation therapy applied to tissue, e.g., mammalian tissue, without causing photocoagulation and without causing significant damage to, or cell death in, the treated tissue. Patients who can be treated by the new methods described herein include humans, as well as nonhuman primates, sheep, horses, cattle, goats, pigs, dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, gerbils, rats, and mice.</p><heading id="h0008"><b>Methods of Treating Macular Degeneration</b></heading><p id="p0058" num="0058"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates steps in the new methods of selective photostimulation, e.g., as applied to treat diseases of the eye, e.g., for macular degeneration, specifically, age-related macular degeneration. The selection of the tissue area to be irradiated is based on the condition of the degenerated retinal pigment epithelium of the macular, which can be evaluated at the beginning of the treatment session using a conventional slit lamp. Then, the selected tissue area is either manually or automatically irradiated with light of the appropriate parameters, e.g., laser light of a wavelength of 590 nm, a pulse duration of about 1-5 µs, and laser fluence of less than 130 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The temporal separation between successive pulses in a sequence of pulses can affect the sublethal fluence. For example, a short temporal separation may cause an accumulative effect in the interaction of the pulses with the cells, thereby reduce the sublethal fluence. In some embodiments, pulse sequences include, for example, 10 - 100 pulses at a repetition rates of about 500 Hz (e.g., pulse separations from below 1 ms to several hundred ms). The healing phase, for example, between treatment sessions, can extend over one or more hours, one day, a few days, or a few weeks.</p><heading id="h0009"><b>Methods of Wound Healing</b></heading><p id="p0060" num="0060">Selective photostimulation therapy can be also applied to heal wounds of various tissues. Specifically, if tissue containing (or treated to contain) a particular pigment or chromophore is damaged, increased tissue repair can be induced by sublethal photostimulation. Wounds can be caused, for example, by mechanical interaction with the tissue during a surgery or by some trauma, e.g., an accident. Then, the selection of the tissue area can be based on the extent of the damaged tissue. The selected tissue area<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> is either manually or automatically irradiated with laser light of the appropriate parameters.</p><heading id="h0010"><b>Methods of Combined Photocoagulation Followed by Photostimulation</b></heading><p id="p0061" num="0061">A specific example of laser induced damage of tissue in the eye is laser surgery, for example, laser coagulation of the eye. As a side effect of laser surgery, areas of, for example, the retina, can be damaged. To promote healing and to increase the migration of healthy tissue from neighboring areas, selective photostimulation can be applied in connection with the laser surgery. For example, either immediately after photocoagulation, or in a later session, e.g., a few hours or one or more days or a week, after the laser surgery, the coagulated tissue and the areas of tissue adjoining the coagulated tissue are irradiated in a separate treatment session with sublethal fluence to increase the proliferation and migration of the epithelium and speed healing after the surgery.</p><heading id="h0011"><b>EXAMPLES</b></heading><p id="p0062" num="0062">The invention is further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims.</p><heading id="h0012"><b>Materials and Experimental Methods</b></heading><p id="p0063" num="0063">In the following experiments, laser irradiation parameters (using a Palomar Medical Inc. pulsed dye laser emitting at 590 nm with a 1 mm diameter) included: 5.0 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> - 2550 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> of laser radiant exposure, 1 µs duration, and 200 spots per 3.5-cm-diameter dish.

In vitro wound healing and cell regeneration models were used to study the subsequent photo/thermal stimulation effects of laser irradiation. The expressions of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and its receptor by the adult ARPE-19 cells in response to laser irradiation were evaluated by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">In general, the following phenomena were observed: (1) selective targeting of pigmented RPE cells produced no thermal damages to adjacent non-pigmented cells even at laser radiant exposure of 2550 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>; (2) exposure to laser irradiation (&lt; 120 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) enhanced RPE cell proliferation and migration; and (3) the selective photostimulation increased the expressions of PDGF, TGFβ1, bFGF, EGF, IGF, and their receptors, VEGF, PEDF, and heat stock proteins after laser irradiation.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Thus, these experiments demonstrate the selective treatment of pigmented RPE cells in vitro, as well as photo/thermal stimulation of RPE proliferation and related biological mechanisms.

Growth factors regulate many of the processes crucial for normal wound healing. For example, TGF-β is a chemoattractant for inflammatory cells and promotes matrix deposition. PDGF, EGF, and FGF promote RPE cell proliferation. IGF-1 is a potent cell survival factor as well as being strongly implicated in the pathobiology of preretinal neovascularization. It seems likely that these growth factors work in harmony to elicit wound repair. The presented experiments show<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> a temporal variation in growth factor expression in the RPE following selective photostimulation which infers that RPE wound healing after selective photo stimulation is regulated by growth factors in an autocrine/paracrine manner.
