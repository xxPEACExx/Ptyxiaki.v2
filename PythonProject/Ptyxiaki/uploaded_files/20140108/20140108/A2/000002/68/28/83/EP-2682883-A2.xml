<ul><li>a process in which a virtual space is defined so that the virtual space has a pair of parallelly-opposed wall<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> surfaces;</li><li>a process in which a plurality of modified polymer models are defined in the virtual space, wherein each of the modified polymer models includes a polymer model of the polymer, comprising at least one particle, and a modifying agent model of the modifying agent, comprising at least one particle representing a modifying group of the modifying agent;</li><li>a process in which,<br/>

an interactive potential is defined which<br/>
exerts an attractive force or a repulsive force between the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> filler model and particle concerned when the distance therebetween is less than a predetermined threshold, and exerts no force between the filler model and particle concerned when the distance therebetween becomes more than the predetermined threshold, wherein<br/>
the threshold for the interactive potential defined between the filler model and the particle of the modifying agent model is more than the threshold for the interactive potential defined between the filler model and the particle of the polymer model, and<br/>
the intensity of the interactive potential defined between the filler model and the particle of the modifying agent model is higher than the intensity of the interactive potential defined between the filler model and the particle of the polymer model,</li><li>a simulation process in which the filler models and the modified polymer models in the virtual space are relaxed by making molecular dynamics calculations, and</li><li>an evaluation process in which, by the use of results obtained in the simulation process, the affinity of the particle of the modifying agent model to the filler model is evaluated, wherein</li><li>the simulation process includes a process in which the number of the particles of the modifying agent models staying in a nearby-filler area is counted at constant time steps to acquire time-series counted numbers, wherein the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> nearby-filler area is a part of the virtual space extending from each of the filler models by a predetermined distance L1 perpendicularly thereto, and</li><li>the evaluation process includes a process in which, using the time-series counted numbers, every two or more successive counted numbers are averaged and are output.</li></ul></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Preferably, the number of the successive counted numbers to be averaged in each time, is at least 5 and at most 1,000,000.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the modified polymer model, the polymer model comprises a plurality of the particles, and<br/>
between the particles of the polymer model, and between the particles of the polymer model and the particle or particles of the modifying agent model, a joining chain is defined by a coupling potential, wherein the coupling potential is defined between the particles concerned so that, when the distance therebetween becomes increased over a distance which is determined by the intensity of the repulsive potential and the intensity of the coupling potential, the coupling potential dominantly exerts an attractive force whose magnitude is larger than the magnitude of the repulsive force resulting from the repulsive potential defined between the particles concerned, and further<br/>
the coupling potential is defined so as to exerts an attractive force whose magnitude is larger than the magnitude of an<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> attractive force resulting from the interactive potential defined between the particle concerned and any of the filler models.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In this invention, therefore, the filler models are fixed to the virtual space. Under such condition, to be calculated is the dispersion or motions of the modified polymer models only. Accordingly, the relaxation calculation can be completed in a short period of time.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Further, the direction of the interactive potential field caused by the filler model is one direction perpendicular to the wall surface, in contrast to a spherical filler model resulting in radial directions or all directions.
