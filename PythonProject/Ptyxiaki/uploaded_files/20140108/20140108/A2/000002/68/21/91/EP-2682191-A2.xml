One of the most important aspects of the qualitative efficiency is precise separation of metallic and non-metallic fraction, which allows for effective recycling of the individual scrap fractions.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Existing processes of waste electric and electronic equipment recycling concern mainly basic separation of elements, but do not guarantee precise separation of small elements. For example, American patent no. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4940187A"><text>US4940187</text></patcit> describes a recycling method, whereby batch material is cut into pieces, from which plastics are separated, and magnetic separator separates iron material from non-iron metals and plastics.

Sorted scrap is transported to ring shredder 101, where it is fragmented into pieces. Scrap pieces are submitted to a separation system for magnetic fraction 102, that is vibrating gutter and magnetic separator located above the gutter. This way magnetic elements are transported from the stream of fragmented material to the belt conveyor for magnetic fraction 103. Deironed scrap is immediately directed to rotary wind separator 104, where the material is separated into two heavy fractions and one light fraction. Heavy fraction is a mixture consisting mostly of non-iron metal pieces, together with heavy metals, but the first fraction contains larger elements than the second fraction, and the size segregation of fraction elements depends on the size of sieves mounted in the rotary separator 104. Heavy fractions are taken by belt conveyors 105 and 106 and transported to eddy current separators 107, 108, where non-metallic elements, such as plastic, rubber, wood, glass, stones and earth are separated from heavy fraction. Non-metallic<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> fractions are transported by belt conveyor 109, 110 to knife shredder 114. Purified metallic fractions constitute final product, which is stored in containers 111,112. Light fraction retrieved from the rotary separator 104 by belt conveyor 113 is mainly composed of isolated wires, for example aluminium foil, light plastics, rubber, wood and earth. Fractions from the conveyors 109, 110, 113 are transported to the knife shredder 114. The knife shredder 114 is equipped with exchangeable sieve with round mesh of a diameter selected for the type of processed scrap in the scope of 10 mm to 15 mm. The batch material is supplied from a buffer tank to the hopper of the shredder, in which rotary rack-type knives together with stationary knives shred the material, which leaves the shredder 114 through the sieve. The shredded material is supplied to the separation system for magnetic fraction 115, that is vibrating gutter and magnetic separator located above the gutter, which removes the remaining magnetic elements released from the processed material, after which the magnetic fraction is directed to the container 116, and non-magnetic fraction - to the container 117. Magnetic fraction constitutes final product, which is stored in the container 116. Non-magnetic fraction from the container 117 is further directed to a sifter 118, on which potential too large pieces are separated, and return through the feeder 119 to the knife shredder 114. The small elements are transported onto the liquid separator table 120, on which precise final separation is conducted.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">On the liquid separator table 120 usable metals, including precious metals, are separated from other elements. The intermediate, not entirely separated elements are directed back to the shredder 114. Metallic fraction is supplied to the container 123 and constitutes final product. Light fraction is supplied with water to the container 122. where, after dehydration, it constitutes final product as well. For successful separation of metals from other elements, a water-glycerine solution of lipase enzyme is applied o the liquid separator table. This solution is obtained by mixing 0.005% to 0.025% of powdered lipase enzyme in 5% glycerine water solution (i.e. 5% of glycerine in water by weight). During the process, part of the wash solution, approx. 10% per hour, is removed together with the output material, so in order to compensate for this loss, water is refilled continuously together with systematic, e.g. every hour, dose of lipase enzyme to maintain the concentration of the enzyme to at least minimum level. Note however that an alternative solution<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> for glycerine solution is any other solution of higher alcohol with water, which reduces the surface tension of the solution and limits its frothing.</p><heading id="h0001">Example</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to prepare the initial batch of a solution washing up to 3,000 I of 5% water glycerine solution, 500 g of lipase enzyme was added in the form of preparation ABS Lipidase 10,000 by American Biosystems (with its headquarters in Roanoke, USA), obtaining the concentration of 0.017%. The shortage of the solution is 10%, so every hour, with systematic refilling the solution with water, the concentration of the enzyme falls to approx. 0.015%. 50 g of enzyme was batched every hour, increasing the concentration of enzyme in the solution to approx. 0.017%.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The application of lipase enzyme allowed to effectively clean the washed material from pollutants, such as fat, grease and oil, which, thanks to this enzyme, underwent hydrolysis to make compounds soluble in water, i.e. alcohols and fatty acids, which made them easily washable on the separation table 120.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56983126" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A method for utilization of waste electric and electronic equipment, whereby the waste material is separated into a magnetic fraction, a fraction of other metals and a non-metallic fraction, <b>characterized by</b> comprising the steps of:
