Repulsive resilience against the deforming stress is force restoring the shape of the mounting device in original from the bending deformation such as the whip, warp and twist.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The following is description of an open-face helmet (hereinafter, "helmet") A which provides a mounting device 1 of the first embodiment in the present invention referring to the drawings, <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs 1-4</figref>. It should be noted that each embodiment set forth<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> below does not limit the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The helmet A provides an impact absorbing liner (not shown) molded with a foamed polystyrene material or a material having equivalent deformation function to the foamed polystyrene materials on the inner surface of the head B1 of a helmet shell B molded to the shape of an open-face helmet with a reinforced fiber material, a head pad (not shown) formed with such as an urethane material disposed inside the impact absorbing liner, cheek pads CL, CR (refer to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>) equipped to be removable on the inner surface of the right and left side parts BL, BR corresponding to the cheeks of the helmet shell B respectively, and a mounting device 1 supported about an axis at the left part BL.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the mounting device 1, a mounting part 2 mounting the MIC body M1 of a microphone (herein after "MIC") M around the mouth D1 of the wearer D of the helmet A, a supporting part 3 supported about an axis by the left side part BL of the helmet shell B and an arm part 4 connecting the mounting part 2 with the supporting part 3 are integrally formed with a foamed synthetic resin material having deformation function for the wearer D and generating repulsive resilience against deforming stress to act on the mounting device 1 as well.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The mounting device 1, which supports a supporting part 3 about an axis at a base plate 5 supported to be slidable back and forth respect to the left side part BL of helmet shell B, is equipped to the helmet A by attaching the base plate 5 at the left side part BL of the helmet shell B. The mounting device 1 is formed in a shape to wrap around the supporting part 3 to the mounting part 2 via the arm part 4 so as to site MIC body M1 around the mouth D1 of the wearer D in state of the mounting device 1 equipped to the helmet A.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the mounting part 2, a mounting hole 20 embedding and mounting the MIC body M1 of MIC M at the side of the wearer D and a mounting groove 21 embedding and mounting a line M2 connected to the MIC body M1 are formed.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The mounting hole 20 is formed in a shape embedding and fitting to the MIC body M1 not to be misaligned. The mounting groove 21 is consecutively formed adjacent to the mounting hole 20 in a shape embedding and fitting to the line M2 not to be misaligned. The mounting groove 21 is formed from the mounting part 2 to the bottom 30 of the supporting part 3 via the arm part 4 to take the embedded line M2 out of the mounting device 1 through the back end 30.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">MIC M comprises the line M2, the MIC body M1 connected to the one end of the line M2 and a terminal M3 connected to the other end of the line M2, so that the terminal M3 is connected to a communication device.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Since an axis supporting part 6 is formed passing through in the depth direction in the supporting part 3, the mounting device 1 is supported about an axis to be rotatable about the supporting axis 7 respect to the base plate 5 by a supporting axis 7 passed through the axis supporting part 6 and attached at the base plate 5 piled on the supporting part 3 in the depth direction.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The arm part 4 extends from the mounting part 2 located around the mouth D1 of the wearer D to be formed in a bowed shape from the supporting part 3 supported at the left side part BL via the base plate 5 to the mounting part 2 located around the mouth D1 of the wearer D.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The base plate 5 is a plate-like body forming two, up and down, long holes 50, 51 opened in the depth direction and an axis supporting hole 52 opened about the same axis as of the axis supporting part 6, and steps 54, 55 are formed at the top and bottom edges of the base plate 5 to prevent the arm part 4 from rotating.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The steps 54, 55 are arranged in anterior area of the base plate 5 such that their back edges are located anterior to the supporting axis 7, and they prevent the arm part 4 from rotating during driving by maintaining the arm part 4 in state that the mounting part 2 is located around the mouth D1 of the wearer D (refer to the <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1</figref>) so as to sandwich the arm part 4 at its top and bottom as shown in the <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The axis of the supporting axis 7 is oriented in the right and left direction of the helmet shell B by piling such the base plate 5 on the left side part BL in the depth direction and arranging the long holes 50, 51 to longitudinally extend back and forth. Thus, the mounting part 2 may move between around the mouth D1 of the wearer D and the head B1 of the helmet shell B by the supporting part 3 rotating about the supporting axis 7 oriented in such axial direction.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The supporting part 3 supporting about an axis respect to the base plate 5 may prevent from rotating or shaking caused by wind or shake during driving, and moreover rotational resistance may be generated as much as the supporting part 3 rotates at ease.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The mounting part 2 may move toward the head B1 of the helmet shell B by rotating the supporting part 3 during bending and deforming the arm part 4 by hand such that the mounting part 2 moves outside the helmet shell B (in the direction apart from the helmet shell) while the supporting part 3 passes over the step 54 of the base plate 5 and further the mounting part 2 passes over the front edge B2 of the helmet shell B.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Also, repulsive resilience acts on the bent and deformed arm part 4 to return to the original shape when the hand releases it at the point that the mounting part 2 reaches at the head B1 of the helmet shell B, and the mounting part 2 is pressed against the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> helmet shell B by the repulsive resilience force. Thereby, it may prevent the mounting device 1 with the mounting part 2 located at the head B1 of the helmet shell B from rotating and shaking caused by wind and shake during driving.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The base plate 5 is supported about an axis by the left side part BL to screw a screw-like guide axes 53 to the left side part BL passing though the long holes 50, 51, and is slidable back and forth by loosening the guide axes 53. The mounting part 2 may move from around the mouth D1 of the wearer D toward apart from around the mouth D1 by sliding. Further, the base plate 5 may be taken out of the left side part BL for each mounting device 1 by taking the guide axes 53 out of the left side part BL.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The helmet A which provides such the mounting device 1 may prevent the MIC M from misalignment and drop caused by wind and shake during driving because the base plate 5 supported about an axis at the left side part BL supports the mounting device 1 mounting the MIC M about an axis.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Moreover, since the mounting device 1 is formed with a foamed synthetic resin material generating repulsive resilience against deforming stress acting to the mounting device 1, even if force acts to move the mounting part 2 apart from the mouth by wind or shake during driving or by careless touch on the mounting device 1 with a hand or a shoulder, the force may be released by bending and deforming the mounting device 1. Thus, the mounting device 1 may be prevented from such as breakage, misalignment and drop, and even if the mounting part 2 moves away from the mouth for a moment to bend and deform the mounting device 1, the repulsive resilience generated by bending and deforming moves the mounting part 1 back to the original place.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Therefore, the mounting device 1 may be prevented from such as breakage, misalignment and drop by bending and deforming resulted from careless touch on the mounting device 1 with a hand or a shoulder, and the repulsive resilience by bending and deforming may move the mounting part 2 back to around the mouth D1 so as to properly take voice input during driving.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Further, since the base plate 5 supporting the mounting device 1 about an axis is supported about an axis to be slidable back and forth respect to the left side part BL, the position of the MIC body is adjustable around the mouth D1 of the wearer D within the area defined by where the guide axes 53 is supported about an axis and by the length and width of the long holes 50, 51.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Further, since the mounting device 1 is supported about an axis to be rotatable respect to the base plate 5, it allows the mounting device 1 to move to the point where the mounting device 1 does not interrupt, e.g. the point where the mounting part 2 faces to the helmet shell B, by rotating the mounting device 1 when the helmet A is put on or<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> taken off.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Further, when moving the MIC body M1 back to around the mouth D1 of the wearer D, by moving the mounting device 1 back to the point between the steps 54, 55 on the base plate 5 to rotate the mounting device 1 at the same time to move it toward the outside of the helmet shell B (apart from the helmet shell), it allows the mounting device 1 to maintain its position adjusted around the mouth D1 of the wearer all the time.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Further, since the mounting device 1 is formed with a foamed synthetic resin material having deformation function for the wearer D, even if the mounting device 1 contacts with the wearer D to heavily bend and deform, the contact does not affect the wearer because of the deformation function. Moreover, since the foamed synthetic resin material is relatively light-weight and inexpensive for its property, it allows the mounting device 1 to reduce its weight and cost for materials. And more, since the mounting device 1 is light-weight, it allows the helmet A to suppress increase in weight, and therefore, the wearer D may comfortably wear the helmet A.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> is a configuring diagram of a mounting device 1' in the second embodiment.
