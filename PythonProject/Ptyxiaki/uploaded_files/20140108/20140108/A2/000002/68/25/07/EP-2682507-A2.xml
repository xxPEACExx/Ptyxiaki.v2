Such techniques include material variation, surface treatment, shape variation, and the use of liquid lubrication. In particular, the use of liquid lubrication is effective and relatively inexpensive. However, the passing yarn may be smeared with lubricating oil, and the use of oil leads to frequent maintenance. Thus, liquid lubrication is used for only limited applications such as spinning of woolen yarns.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP8027633A"><text>8-27633</text></patcit> describes a ring-traveler system having a longer durability and higher productivity. The ring that comes into contact with the traveler includes a polycrystalline ceramic surface. The ceramic surface of the ring has a surface structure including spherical grains.

The ring-traveler system includes a ring and a traveler that travels along the ring. One of the ring and the traveler includes 400 or more recesses per centimeter in a surface portion on which the other one of the ring and the traveler slides when the traveler travels.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The ring spinning machine includes a ring spinning frame and a ring twisting frame that wind a yarn through a traveler that travels (slides) along a ring, which is supported by a ring rail and lifted and lowered.

The ring 11 includes a flange 11a having a T-shaped cross-section. The traveler 12 has a C-shaped cross-section. The ring 11 is made of a bearing steel. A hard chromium plating layer 13 is applied to the flange 11a as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1B and 1C</figref>. The hard chromium plating layer 13 has a thickness of about 10 to 20 µm.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The plating layer 13 includes a surface portion on which the traveler 12 slides when the traveler 12 travels. The surface portion defines a friction reduction portion 14. In the present embodiment, the friction reduction portion 14 is formed<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> in the inner circumference surface of the flange 11a as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1C</figref>.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, the friction reduction portion 14 includes 400 or more grooves 15 per centimeter. The grooves 15 are also referred to as recesses. The grooves 15 are microcracks formed in a surface of the hard chromium plating layer 13. According to Japan Industrial Standard H8615 "Electroplated Coatings of Chromium for Engineering Purposes," microcracks are cracks that are formed with a density of 250 or more cracks per centimeter. Specifically, the microcracks of the present embodiment include not only the microcracks that are originally present when the hard chromium plating layer 13 is formed, but also additional microcracks formed through a surface treatment (electrolytic etching in this embodiment). The microcracks have different lengths and extend in random directions. The number of microcracks is obtained by drawing a straight line on a micrograph of the surface of the hard chromium plating layer 13 and counting the number of cracks intersecting a centimeter-long portion of the straight line. The cracks include cracks that are shaped like dimples and do not elongate like grooves. Since the microcracks vary in length and orientation, the straight line can be drawn at any position in the micrograph.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A method for increasing the number of microcracks formed in the surface of the hard chromium plating layer 13 will now be described. The present embodiment uses electrolytic etching as a surface treatment.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A known electrolytic etching process may be performed. The number of microcracks increases in accordance with the electrolytic etching time. The microcracks are not clearly visible on the surface of the hard chromium plating layer 13 before performing electrolytic etching. After electrolytic etching, many microcracks become visible.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The operation of the ring-traveler system will now be described. A yarn Y, which is fed from a draft part (not shown), passes through the traveler 12 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1C</figref> and is wound around a bobbin (not shown) that rotates at a high speed. The maximum rotation speed of the ring spinning frame during normal spinning operation is about 25,000 rpm. The yarn Y applied tension, when being wound, to the traveler 12 so that the traveler 12 travels along the flange 11a. Although the orientation of the running traveler 12 slightly varies depending on the rotation speed, the traveler 12 travels in contact with the inner lower portion of the flange 11a.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">When metal objects are in sliding engagement with each other without lubrication in such a manner, severe wear would generally occur. Under such friction conditions of the ring-traveler system, seizing or severe wear may be expected to occur in the ring and traveler after several minutes or hours. However, the actual ring-traveler system has significantly low wear. In a cotton spinning machine, for example, the traveler 12 is usually replaced after one or two weeks. Thus, in terms of tribology, the ring-traveler system is considered as being in an interface lubrication condition and not in a non-lubrication condition. An analysis has shown that a cellulose film serving as lubrication is formed on the surface portion of the ring 11 on which the traveler 12 slides. The cellulose film is formed by fibers that are separated from a yarn Y passing through the traveler 12 during spinning and caught between the ring 11 and the traveler 12.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the ring-traveler system of the present embodiment, the ring 11 includes the friction reduction portion 14 in the surface portion on which the traveler 12 slides when the traveler 12 travels. The friction reduction portion 14 includes 400 or more grooves 15 per centimeter. The grooves 15 are microcracks formed in the surface of the hard chromium plating layer 13. The abundance of microcracks facilitates the formation of the film, which is formed by cellulose fibers that are separated from the yarn Y and adhere to the grooves 15. The fiber film produces a friction reduction effect without using liquid lubrication. As a result, the ring-traveler system improves the friction reduction effect as compared to a conventional system, and the friction reduction effect continues for a long time.</p><heading id="h0006">Example 1</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">To evaluate the effectiveness of the friction reduction portion 14, a ring 11 was prepared that includes a friction reduction portion 14 having 700 microcracks per centimeter. In addition, a ring 11 was prepared that includes a friction reduction portion 14 having 1,000 microcracks per centimeter. A conventional ring was used as a comparative example. A spinning test was conducted to determine the relationship between traveling resistance and traveling distance without performing any preconditioning operation. The spinning was performed at the rotation speed of 20,000 rpm. The traveling resistance was obtained by rotatably supporting the ring and measuring the drag force applied to the ring by the traveler. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> shows the test results.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, the rings 11 having 400 or more microcracks (grooves 15) per centimeter in the friction reduction portions 14 each had a lower traveling resistance than the conventional ring after a traveling distance of 800 km. This verified the effectiveness of the friction reduction portion 14. To determine the stability of friction reduction effect of the friction reduction portion 14, the ring 11 having 700 microcracks per centimeter and the ring 11 having 1,000 microcracks per centimeter were operated until the traveling distance reached 54,000 km. The test showed that the each ring 11 at a traveling distance of 54,000 had a traveling resistance that was generally the same as that at a traveling distance of 2,000 km. Thus, each ring of the present embodiment was confirmed to have a significantly high, continuous friction reduction effect compared to the conventional ring. The traveling resistance of the conventional ring increased at a short traveling distance. This is assumed to be resulted from a cellulose layer that was formed unevenly and increased the resistance.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Further, a ring 11 having 400 microcracks per centimeter in the friction reduction portion 14 was tested to determine the relationship between traveling distance and traveling resistance and confirmed to have a lower traveling resistance than the conventional ring.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In addition, the travelers 12 were checked for abrasion. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4B</figref>, the traveler 12 used with the conventional ring had an abrasion 20 in the surface portion that was in contact with the ring. However, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4A</figref>, the traveler 12 that was used with the ring 11 having the friction reduction portion 14 had an abrasion 20' that was smaller than the abrasion 20.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The advantages of the present embodiment will now be described.
<ol><li>(1) The ring-traveler system of the ring spinning machine (ring spinning<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> frame) includes the ring 11 having 400 or more grooves 15 per centimeter in the surface portion on which the traveler 12 slides when the traveler 12 travels. The grooves 15 serve as recesses. Entry of the fiber film into the recesses increases the adhesive force of the fiber film to the ring 11 and suppresses separation of the fiber film. The fiber film serves as lubrication and produces a friction reduction effect that maintains the traveling resistance of the traveler 12 at a low level. The fiber film, which is formed by fibers separated from a yarn and adhere to a sliding surface of the ring-traveler system, serves as lubrication. This improves the friction reduction effect and prolongs durability (life).</li><li>(2) The recesses are microcracks formed in the surface of the hard chromium plating layer. Thus, a greater portion of the fiber film is received in the recesses compared to when the recesses are dimples. This increases the friction reduction effect resulted from lubrication of the fiber film. In general, the surface of a normal hard chromium plating layer includes about 300 microcracks per centimeter. The number of the microcracks can be increased relatively easily to 400 or more by performing etching to the hard chromium plating layer.</li><li>(3) Electrolytic etching is performed to the hard chromium plating layer of the ring 11 to form 400 or more microcracks in the surface of the hard chromium plating layer. The surface of the hard chromium plating layer originally includes about 300 microcracks per centimeter before performing etching.

In the present embodiment, the solid lubrication coating layer 18 is applied to the surface of each groove 15 of the friction reduction portion 14 in addition to the flat portion 19. The grooves 15 are microcracks. In <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 7</figref>, the groove 15 is schematically illustrated to have a V-shaped cross-section.

The fiber film is formed by cellulose fibers that are separated from the yarn Y during spinning and adhere to the grooves 15. However, the friction reduction effect is low until the fiber film is stably formed after the ring-traveler system begins to operate. However, in the present embodiment, the friction reduction portion 14 of the hard chromium plating layer 13 includes the solid lubrication coating layer 18 on the surface.

After a traveling distance of 1,500 km, the traveling resistance of the ring 11 with microcracks and lubrication remained at the same level as the ring 11 with microcracks.
