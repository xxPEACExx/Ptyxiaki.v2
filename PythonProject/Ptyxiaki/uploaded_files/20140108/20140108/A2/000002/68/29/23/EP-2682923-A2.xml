Hot works refer to welding, cutting, brazing, roofing, works with high-speed tools, and other types of work that involves heating or sparking. Sealing on roofs is also a hot work when materials are heated. A problem associated with the performance of hot work is that there is a risk that fire occurs both during work and after the work is completed. There are often local regulations that specify how long the work has to be monitored after the hot work has ceased. Sometimes it has to be monitored for many hours. Today, humans are used for monitoring the workplace during hot work, both when the work is done and after the work has been carried out. However, using human fire guards are expensive. When working in hazardous and/or closed production areas, for example where emergency maintenance work has been carried out in order to make the production run again, it may not be possible to use a human fire watch after the hot work is done.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Thus, there is a need for monitoring equipment as complementary to the human fire watch during hot work. That makes it possible, at least for a period, to monitor hot work without any human fire watch in place. Those works are performed in environments where the design of the premises are very different, such as ceiling heights, area of the premises, number of adjacent spaces etc. The work is often performed at a temporary workplace, which means that the space is not designed and suited for this kind of work. Since the working environment is different for each workplace there are high demands on the equipment in terms of adaptability to different working environments. This means that a requirement for the monitoring equipment is that it must be flexible, easy to move between workplaces, easy to put up and set in place, and that it should withstand dirty and hot environments.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20080036595A1"><text>US2008/0036595A1</text></patcit> shows a portable security system for remotely monitoring a site. The system is primarily intended to monitor a room from intruders, such as thieves. The system may also include a smoke detector and can be used for detecting a fire. The system includes a portable monitoring device in the form of a suitcase comprising a housing and a server unit adapted to communicate with the monitoring device and to send alarms to the server unit. Inside the housing of the suitcase there are one or more sensors for detecting movement, heat, smoke, or electrical field, alarm equipment triggered by the sensors, a communication unit configured for wireless communication with the server unit and a battery to power the monitor. The front of the casing contains a user interface designed to show alarms, allow<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> configurations of the sensor and acknowledgment of alarms. In order to monitor a place, the suitcase is placed in an appropriate place, and if an intruder is detected, an alarm is sent to the server which in turn forwards the alert to a monitoring center or to a portable key unit carried by a user. Such monitoring is not always suitable for use in hot work, often carried out in difficult environments where it is difficult to access and monitor certain aspects of the workplace and it is hot and smoky, which may damage the suitcase and its contents. Sometimes the place to be monitored is large, and there is not enough with one suitcase to monitor the entire scene. In such cases, it becomes expensive to use several suitcases.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="GB2471784A"><text>GB2471784</text></patcit> shows a monitoring system that includes a plurality of transportable towers positioned at the site to be monitored, and a monitoring station located at another location away from the monitored site. Each of the towers contains a retractable mast and a security camera positioned in the top of the mast. The mast also has a motion detector that sends an alert that a motion has been detected. A safety sensor is provided on the ground, away from the mast, which for example can detect smoke, gas, fire or water. Each of the towers contains a transportable base station which can communicate with the monitoring station and sends an alarm when a security event is detected. The system is configured from the monitoring station and does not allow making settings and acknowledging alarms at site.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6380860B"><text>US6380860</text></patcit> discloses a portable wireless fire alarm system completely contained in a portable suitcase.

The detector unit comprises a sensor arranged to detect a security event, such as the risk of fire. The suitcase incudes space for storing the detector unit, and an electronic unit in communication with the detector unit. According to the invention, the detector unit includes a rechargeable battery and the suitcase is designed so that the battery can be recharged automatically when the detector unit is stored in the space in the suitcase.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The invention enables easy recharged of the detector unit/units when they are stored in the suitcase. There is no need for a separate charging device to charge the detector units. Further, the detector units are protected from smoke, dust and dirt in the suitcase while being charged.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to an embodiment of the invention, the suitcase comprises a battery charger arranged in connection to the space so that the detector unit is automatically recharged when the battery of the detector unit is stored in said space.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to an embodiment of the invention, the battery charger is adapted to wirelessly charge the battery of the detector unit. Thus, it is detector unit does not need to be physically connected to the charger, and the charging of the battery begins upon positioning the detector unit in the space.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to an embodiment of the invention, the suitcase includes a contact device connected to the charger and adapted for connection to an external power source, and the battery is charged automatically when said contact device is connected to the power source.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Preferably, the contact device is positioned outside the housing to enable charging of the detector unit when the suitcase is closed. The detector units are therefore protected from smoke, dust and dirt while being charged.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to an embodiment of the invention, the electronic unit comprises a rechargeable battery connected to the contact device, wherein both batteries can be charged simultaneously. It is advantageous to be able to charge both batteries simultaneously, for example when the suitcase is not in use during transportation in vehicles 12V as well as fixed storage areas 230V.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to an embodiment of the invention, a communication unit configured to wirelessly communicate with an external server unit and to send alarms to the server unit when a security event is detected. The electronic unit includes a user interface designed to carry out settings of the sensor, display alarms and allow acknowledgment of alarms, and a communication device configured to wireless communication with the external server unit and receive alarms from server unit.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to an embodiment of the invention, the detector unit comprises a communication unit configured to wirelessly communicate with an external server unit and to send alarms to the server unit, and the electronic unit comprises a communication device configured to wirelessly communicate with the external server unit and to receive alarms from the server unit.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The suitcase is provided with one or more removable detector units that communicate directly with an external server unit and has its own power supply. The suitcase is designed for storage of the detector units when they are not in use and during transport. Because the detector unit is removable from the suitcase, it is possible to place the sensor near the site to be monitored, where there is a risk that fires may occur, and to place the suitcase, which contains the electronic unit and the user interface, at a distance from the site to be monitored. The suitcase is, for example, placed in an adjacent room. In this way, hazardous and/or closed production areas can be monitored and alarms can be acknowledged without the need of a human remaining on the site. If the suitcase contains a number of detector units, it is possible to place these in different places and thus supervises a larger area.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The electronic unit and the detector units communicate with each other via the server unit, which provides a great flexibility in the system. That means there is no need for extra equipment for communication between them. Thus, the communication range between the electronic unit and detector units becomes unlimited, which means that there is no restriction on the distance between the electronic unit and detector units. It is also possible to have a number of detector units in one group and to link two or more groups of detector units with each other via the server.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The suitcase is easy to move between different workplaces and includes a user interface that can be used for configuring the sensor and acknowledging alarms. It is important that the alarm is acknowledged by a person who is at site and can decide what to be done to take care of the fire.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The invention contributes to considerably prolong the time for monitoring a place after a hot work has been ended, and thereby to enhance the security in connection with hot works. The invention provides opportunities to facilitate and increase the efficiency of existing fire protection, which saves significant expenses due to unnecessary downtime and costly production stops.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to an embodiment of the invention, the casing is arranged to enclose the electronic unit and the space for storage of the detector unit when the suitcase is closed, and the user interface is positioned so that it is only accessible when the suitcase is open. The user interface may comprise a push button for acknowledging alarms, and the button is placed inside the suitcase so that it is only accessible when the suitcase is open. Thus, when the suitcase is closed the electronic unit and the user interface are protected from smoke, dust and dirt that often appear on the kind of workplace where hot work is performed.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to an embodiment of the invention, the suitcase contains at least one removable and foldable stand to support the detector unit, and a space for storing the stand. The suitcase is designed for storage of one or more stands to support detector units. The stands can be kept in the suitcase when not in use and during transport. Due to the stand, the detector units can be placed so that it monitors the site in a better way.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to an embodiment of the invention, the suitcase comprises two halves and a partition provided between the two halves, one half containing the electronic unit, the space for the storage of the detector unit, and means designed to protect the detector unit and the electronic unit from mechanical impact, and the other half containing the space for storing the stand. One half of the suitcase is configured to protect sensitive equipment, such as the detector unit and the electronic unit, and the other half is designed to retain robust equipment such as stands. A partition separates the two halves and protects the sensitive area. This embodiment makes it possible to keep the stands, detector units and electronic unit in the same suitcase.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to an embodiment of the invention, the sensor is intended for detecting fire and comprises one of a smoke detector, a heat detector, a camera, a motion detector, an infrared camera, or a combination of these.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to another aspect of the invention, the object is achieved by a monitoring system comprising a portable monitoring device according to the invention and a server unit arranged for communication with the detector unit and the electronic unit.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The monitoring system may comprise a mobile handheld communication device and the server unit is adapted to transmit alarms from the detector unit to the mobile handheld communication device.

Each of the detector units 10 contains a rechargeable battery 27 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 5</figref>). A battery charger 19 is provided in the vicinity of the space 11 to recharge the batteries of the detector units. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the battery charger 19 is a wireless battery charger, such as a charger plate, adapted to wirelessly charge the battery 27 of the detector unit. For example, one or more wireless charger plates can be located below the space 11.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Moreover, the first half 7 also comprises an electronic unit 13 arranged to control operation of the portable monitoring device 1, which includes a user interface 14 in the form of a monitor 14A and a keypad 14B for enabling communication with monitoring device 1 and an external server. Preferably, the screen and keypad can be replaced with a touch screen. The electronic unit 13 is preferably a computer. Additionally, an acknowledge button 15 is connected to the electronic unit to acknowledge an alarm triggered by the portable monitoring device 1. Further, a rechargeable battery 20 for the electronic unit 13 is provided. All these components are embedded in the means 17 for protect against mechanical impact so that the suitcase 1 can be exposed to a relatively rough treatment without the portable monitoring device 1 being damaged in such way that the operation of the monitoring device is disturbed. The acknowledge button can also be used to confirm local presence on the workplace. It's allowed to make improvements of the monitoring via the external network connection, but deteriorations are not allowed, as these always have to be confirmed by the acknowledgment button in the suitcase.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The user interface 14 is configured to allow settings of the sensor 24 of the detector unit 10, to display alarms and to make it possible to allow acknowledgment of alarms by using the acknowledge button 15.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The suitcase 1 and all connections to it should have at least an IP54 rating as well as being shock resistant and have a low center of gravity to stand firmly on a flat surface. Due to such robustness, the components inside the suitcase 1 are protected, which increases reliability and life time of the components.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The charger 19 to the detector unit 10 and the rechargeable battery 20 is in electrical contact with the contact device 4 and thereby may be connected to a power source for recharging. The charger 19 includes a transformer that converts AC power to an appropriate voltage for charging the batteries. The charger 19 controls the loading of all batteries 20, 27 of the units when connected via the external contact device 4 on the suitcase. Inside the suitcase 1 there<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> are also wires (not shown) arranged to establish electrical contact between the various components as described herein.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">It is advantageous if the detector unit 10 and the battery 20 can be charged simultaneously. In some applications, it may also be advantageous to arrange the electronic unit 13 in electrical contact with the contact device 4 so that it may be driven by an external power source when the battery 20 is not used. The external power source can for example be a wall socket in a building or a cigarette lighter outlet in a car. However, other power sources may also be used. Thus, the portable monitoring device 1 is adapted to be loaded with power sources in the range of 9-24V, as is common in cigarette lighter outlets in a car, as well as voltage sources that provide 230V as provided by an socket in a building. Other voltage levels may be used if appropriate in a given application. It is advantageous to be able to use a voltage source available at the place where the invention is used.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In connection to the electronic unit 13 is provided a communication device 16 (not shown) that enables wireless communication between the electronic unit 13 and an external server unit 30, which in turn communicates with the detector unit 10 as well as a mobile handheld communication device 31 and possibly any other entities.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">However, in a preferred embodiment, the electronic unit 13 is arranged to use the rechargeable battery 20 as the power source so that the portable monitoring device 1 can be used independent of whether there is access to external power or not.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Although the invention can be used with only one detector unit 10, it is advantageous in many applications to use a plurality of detector units 10A, 10B, 10C, 10D which are placed at a distance from each other, so that security events can be detected over a larger area.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The electronic unit 13 can advantageously be an industrial PC or tablet based on Windows, iOS, Android or Linux, and if so, should be fanless and have low power consumption, with a built-in Watch dog adapted to restart the computer if the system hangs. Parameters in the form of sensor settings and an emergency number to contact if a security incident occurs can advantageously be saved in a configuration file that is used if the electronic unit 13 is restarted. The communication device 16 connected to the electronic unit 13 may advantageously comprise a GSM/GPRS/3G-modem with connection to an external antenna that allows communication even in areas where network coverage is weak.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In a particularly preferred embodiment, the portable monitoring device 1 is provided with a GPS function used for determine the coordinates of the suitcase 1 and thereby facilitate an alarm to a fire department and also making the unit 1 more theft proof, since its position can be determined, even after the suitcase has been stolen.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 3</figref> shows the second half 8 of the suitcase 1, with space for storing at least one removable stand 21 with a telescopic pole 22 that can be mounted together with the detector unit 10 so that the detector unit 10 is held at a suitable distance from the floor or ground where it is used. Other types of stand can be used and the suitcase 1 can be adapted to contain one or more stands depending on the application and the number of detector units.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">A partition 9 is provided between first half 7 and the second half 8 of the suitcase 1 to separate the halves 7, 8 and to damp impacts on the suitcase 1. The partition 9 is made of a suitable material, preferably a plastic material.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref> shows one of the removable detector units 10, which comprises a sensor 24 arranged to detect a security event, such as a fire. The sensor 24 comprises a smoke sensor, a heat sensor, a camera, a motion sensor or an infrared camera. The sensor 24 may comprise only one of these but preferably more than one. The detector unit 10 further includes a processor unit such as a CPU, a rechargeable battery 27, and a second communication unit arranged to communicate wirelessly with the external server. The detector unit has a housing 25 with a grill cover that encloses the sensor, battery and other devices.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 5</figref> shows the insides of a detector unit 10 in the form of a wiring diagram with a processor unit/CPU 28, the sensor 24, a memory unit 29, a rechargeable battery 27 to the sensor and a communication unit 26. The communication unit 26 advantageously comprises a GSM/GPRS/3G-modem with connection to an internal antenna or external antenna that allows communication even in areas where network coverage is weak.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The communication unit 26 is arranged to communicate wirelessly with the external server 30, as explained in more detail below. The space 11 is designed so that the rechargeable battery 27 is automatically connected to the charger 19 when the detector unit 10 is placed in the space 11. This enables automatic recharging of the batteries in the detector units when stored in the suitcase. Alternatively, cables with connectors can be supplied together with the suitcase, which can be manually connected to each detector unit.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 6</figref> shows an example of a monitoring system of the invention with an external server 30 which is arranged to wirelessly communicate with a number of detector units 10A, 10B, 10C, 10D each having a communication device, two mobile handheld communication devices 31A, 31B, e.g. in the form of mobile phones, and two electronic units 13A, 13B each having a communication device 16A, 16B.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 7</figref> shows the use of the portable monitoring device 1 according to the preferred embodiment, where a user with a mobile hand-held communication device 31 wirelessly communicates with the external server, and a first detection unit 10A is mounted in a removable and collapsible first telescopic stand 21A of a first telescopic pole 22A, and a second<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> and third detector unit 10B. 10C are mounted on a second telescope stand 21B with a second telescopic pole 22B. Between the two stands there are obstacles mounted in the form of blocks and because several detector units 10A, 10B, 10C are used, security events can be detected over a larger area and on different sides of these obstacles.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The use of a portable monitoring device of the invention will now be explained in more detail with reference to the figures.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The portable monitoring device is preferably used at a workplace where hot work has been carried out and it therefore has been judged that there exist an imminent danger for the occurrence of a security event in the form of a fire some time after the work has been carried out.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">A first, the workplace and its vicinity is cleaned and, if necessary, watered. Once this is achieved a first assessment is made on how many detector units 10 are required to cover the risk area and where they should be placed. Thereafter, the desired number of detector units 10 is positioned in the area, preferably the detector units 10 are mounted on a stand 21 at a suitable height above the floor. Thereafter, detector units 10 are also positioned in neighboring accommodations, if they present a risk situation (in some cases it is difficult to fully guarantee sealed connections so that fire may not occur in neighboring accommodations). When the detector units 10, are deployed and activated, they can communicate wirelessly via a second communications device 26 of the server unit 30, which communicates with the communication device 16 of the electronic unit 13 in the suitcase 1.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">By using the user interface 14, i.e. a keypad 14B and screen 14A, a user may select appropriate settings for the portable monitoring device 1 so that the required monitoring of the area is obtained. The display is preferably a touch screen, and in that case the keypad 14B can be excluded. The suitcase 1 is preferably connected to an external power source during operation, so that the risk of downtime due to a discharged battery can be avoided. To ensure that the monitoring device 1 can be used even during a power failure, it is appropriate that the rechargeable battery 20 can serve as backup.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">It is advantageous if the screen 14A has a touchscreen display that works even when the user is wearing gloves and that it is resistant to electrical shocks and mechanical impact and is visible in darkness and in full sunlight.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">After positioning of the detector units 10, tests are run on the portable monitoring device 1 by a user to verify that all the sensors 24 to be used is working as expected and have contact with the server unit 30. Thereafter the user enters a phone number using the keypad 14B and the number is test called by the monitoring device 1 to verify that it is correct. Preferably a number<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> is selected that goes to a pre-designated fire watch and when he confirms the call, the monitoring device 1 is started and the monitoring of the area is enabled.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The phone number entered can alternatively specify an alarm box included in the equipment and go to the designated fire watch in the local area, such as security personnel or other personnel within the area of the device. The monitoring is activated by a test call to the designated fire watch, who is informed that the hot work is completed and that the repairman leaves the work area. Alternatively, the repairman provides the fire watch assignment itself on occasions when there is no qualified staff available for this task.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In a particularly preferred embodiment, the portable monitoring device 1 is also equipped with a sprinkler system which is easily mounted in the same stand as the detector unit and arranged to wirelessly communicate with the monitoring device 1. This is suitably activated by the sensors 24 to mobile device 31, which in turn opens a remote-controlled valve which should be time-controlled. This is because it should just put out the fire and thus avoid water damage. The alarm is turned on so that a individual will come and control the work area. The valve opens again automatically if the sensors are affected.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">It is advantageous to be able to provide several different emergency numbers with different priorities, and it should also be possible to establish contact with an alarm center so that the fire department may be called to the place in case of a fire that can not be quickly extinguished or brought under control. To allow such communication, the electronic unit 13 and the communication device 16 are arranged to communicate with a remote server via GPRS/SMS or 3G. Due to such a connection, the monitoring device 1 can connect to TCP/IP networks, and thereby remotely connect to a control center or directly connect to a alarm center, and also enable contact for service or assistance online.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">If a sensor 24 of a detector unit 10 detects smoke, abnormal heat, or some other factor that indicates the occurrence of a fire, i.e. a security event, this is communicated by means of a signal to the electronic unit 13 via the server unit 30, and the indicator lamp 5 of the suitcase 1 will flash in red. If desired, also the detector unit 10 may provide an alert by a sound or visual unit (sirens and/or blender/lamp) connected to or integrated with the detector unit and can be activated when a security event is detected.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The detector units 10 can then be placed near the location where the work is in progress or has occurred, and where there is a risk that fires may occur, while the suitcase, containing the sensitive electronic unit 13, can be placed at a distance from that location.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">When electronic unit 13 has received a signal indicating that a security event has occurred, an alarm is also sent to the emergency number that was entered in the user interface 14, corresponding to a mobile handheld communication device 31, such as a cell phone, and an<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> operator is called to the location. The operator acknowledge the alarm by pressing the acknowledge button 15 and thereby indicates that the alarm is received and that the inspection of the workplace has occurred. Thus, the operator has to move to the suitcase and acknowledge the alarm. If the sensor still detects something after a certain time has elapsed, the alarm starts again. It is advantageous that the set-off button 15 and the user interface 14 can only be used when the suitcase 1 is open, and they are therefore protected by the housing 2 when the suitcase 1 is closed. This greatly reduces the risk of damages, even in dirty or hot environments where the electronic components would be subjected to considerable wear.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Power supply to the sensors 24 can be achieved by charging a rechargeable battery 27 to the sensor when the detector unit 10 is positioned in the suitcase 1. Alternatively, the ordinary primary battery can be used in the detector unit 10 and replaced if necessary. In order to operate the portable monitoring device 1 as energy-efficiently as possible, the electronic unit 13 can be maintained in a standby mode and only be activated when an alarm occurs, and possibly also to regularly send a status message indicating that the system is operating normally. Preferably, the rechargeable batteries are nickel-metal hydride batteries (NiMH) or lithium ion batteries (Li-ion), but other types of batteries are also possible.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The present invention is not limited to the embodiments described but can be varied and modified within the scope of the appended claims. For example, the number of detector units and stand vary from one up to ten or even more depending on the size of the suitcase and the need for detector units. The suitcase may be designed in many different ways but have the same basic functions.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982009" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A portable monitoring device (1) in the form of a suitcase comprising:
