present invention relates to a battery pack with high structural reliability and, more particularly, to a battery pack including a battery module array having battery modules arranged in two or more rows, each of the battery modules having a structure in which battery cells or unit modules, each having two or more battery cells mounted therein, are stacked in a state in which the battery cells or

diesel is the creation of air pollution. Technology of using a secondary battery, which can be charged and discharged, as a power source for vehicles has attracted considerable attention as one method of solving such a problem. As a result, electric vehicles (EV), which are operated using only a battery, and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), which jointly use a battery and a conventional engine, have been developed and some are commercially available. A nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) secondary battery has mainly been used as a power source for electric vehicles (EV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). A lithium-ion battery has also been used recently.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">High power and large capacity are needed for such a secondary battery to be used as a power source for electric vehicles (EV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). To this end, small-scale secondary batteries (unit cells) are connected in series to form a battery module and a battery pack. Where appropriate, small-scale secondary batteries (unit cells) are connected in series and in parallel to form a battery module and a battery pack.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Generally, such a battery pack has a structure to protect battery modules, each of which includes secondary batteries mounted therein. The structure of the battery module may be varied based on the kind of vehicles or the installation position of the battery pack in vehicles.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In one structure to effectively fix large-capacity battery modules, a battery pack<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> is constructed such that battery modules are fixed to a rigid lower plate. In this structure, each individual battery module is fixed to the lower plate such that reliability of the battery pack such as durability and vibration resistance is secured through structural rigidity of the lower plate. However, this structure has a problem in that there is a need to secure sufficient rigidity of the lower plate.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is an exemplary perspective view of a conventional battery pack including a single battery module as an example of a battery pack having the above structure.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a battery pack 100 includes unit modules 10, each of which has secondary batteries mounted therein, a lower plate 20, a pair of side support members 30, and a pair of top support members 40.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The unit modules 10 are stacked at the top of the lower plate 20 in a state in which the unit modules 10 are vertically erected. The side support members 30 are disposed in close contact with the outer sides of the outermost unit modules 10 in a state in which the lower end of each of the side support members 30 is fixed to the lower plate 20.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The top support members 40 are connected between the upper parts of the side support members 30 to interconnect and support the side support members 30.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However, the battery pack with the above construction has a small capacity<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> since the battery pack includes only a single battery module. Thus, it is difficult to apply the battery pack with the above construction to external devices such as vehicles that require high power and large capacity.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Therefore, there is a great need to provide a battery pack that includes battery modules arranged in two or more rows to achieve high power and large capacity and has a specific structure in which durability of the battery pack can be secured against vibration and impact and the battery pack can be compactly constructed.</p><heading id="h0003">[DISCLOSURE]</heading><heading id="h0004">[TECHNICAL PROBLEM]</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">Therefore, the present invention has been made to solve the above and other technical problems that have yet to be resolved.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Specifically, it is an object of the present invention to provide a battery pack wherein each of first upper mounting members, a second upper mounting member and a rear mounting member has the shape of an angular pipe that is angular in vertical section, such that it is possible to minimize deformation due to vertical vibration and impact.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">It is another object of the present invention to provide a battery pack wherein battery modules are assembled upwardly to the first upper mounting members and the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> second upper mounting member which are each formed of an angular pipe structure, such that the mass of the battery pack is supported by the angular pipe structure and the battery pack is compactly constructed.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is another object of the present invention to provide a battery pack wherein a portion of the battery pack is formed using a part of the structure of a vehicle, such that it is possible to stably install the battery pack in the vehicle while minimizing the volume of the battery pack in the vehicle.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>[TECHNICAL SOLUTION]</b></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">In accordance with the present invention, the above and other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a battery pack including (a) a battery module array having battery modules arranged in two or more rows, each of the battery modules having a structure in which battery cells or unit modules, each having two or more battery cells mounted therein, are stacked in a state in which the battery cells or the unit modules are erected in an upside-down fashion, (b) a pair of side support members (a front support member and a rear support member) that support the front and rear of the battery module array, respectively, in a state in which the pair of side support members are in close contact with outermost unit modules in the battery modules in the battery module array, (c) lower end support members coupled to lower ends of the side support members to support a lower end of the battery module array, (d) two or<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> more first upper mounting members coupled to upper ends of the side support members and lower ends of the battery modules erected in an upside-down fashion, each of the first upper mounting members being fastened at one end thereof to an external device and having the shape of an angular pipe that is angular in vertical section, (e) a second upper mounting member coupled to upper ends of the first upper mounting members such that the second upper mounting member intersects the first upper mounting members at right angles, the second upper mounting member being fastened at opposite ends thereof to the external device and having the shape of an angular pipe that is angular in vertical section, and (f) a rear mounting member disposed at the rear of the battery module array, the rear mounting member being fastened at opposite ends thereof to the external device and having the shape of an angular pipe that is angular in vertical section.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the battery pack according to the present invention, each of the first upper mounting members and the second upper mounting member has the shape of an angular pipe that is angular in vertical section. Therefore, deformation of the battery pack due to vibration and impact is minimized by the angular pipe having a high moment of inertia.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In addition, the pair of side support members support the front and rear of the battery module array, respectively. Therefore, it is possible to securely increase bending rigidity of the lower end support member coupled to the lower ends of the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> side support members and to sufficiently secure overall structural reliability of the battery pack against vertical vibration.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Further, the opposite ends of each of the rear mounting member and the second upper mounting member and the one ends of the first upper mounting members are fastened to the external device. Therefore, it is possible to easily and stably mount the battery pack to the external device even when the battery pack is located below the fastening position at which the battery pack is fastened to the external device.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In addition, since the battery modules, each of which has a structure in which unit modules are stacked in a state in which the unit modules are erected in an upside-down fashion, are arranged in two or more rows, it is possible to secure structural stability of the battery pack and to provide high power and large capacity as compared to the structure of the conventional battery pack which includes a single battery module.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">For reference, the side support members will also be referred to as a "front support member" and a "rear support member" that support the front and rear of the battery module array, respectively, as needed in this specification. Directions mentioned in this specification will be expressed as front, rear, left, right, top and bottom in a state in which the battery module array is viewed from the front support<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> member that is in close contact with the battery module array.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the present invention, each of the unit modules may be a secondary battery or a small-scale module having two or more secondary batteries mounted therein.

In these patent applications, the unit module is structured such that outer sides of two secondary batteries are covered with a pair of high-strength cell covers in a state in which the secondary batteries are in close contact with each other such that the secondary batteries face each other.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The disclosures of the above patent applications are incorporated herein by reference. Of course, however, the structure of each of the unit modules of each battery module according to the present invention is not limited to the above examples of the unit modules described in the above patent applications.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Preferably, each of the battery cells is a plate-shaped battery cell, which provides a high stack rate in a limited space. For example, each of the battery cells may be structured such that an electrode assembly is mounted in a battery case formed of a laminate sheet.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Specifically, each of the battery cells is a pouch-shaped secondary battery in which an electrode assembly having a cathode/separator/anode structure is sealed, together with an electrolyte, within a battery case. For example, each of the battery cells is a plate-shaped secondary battery with an approximately rectangular parallelepiped structure having a small thickness to width ratio. Generally, the pouch-shaped secondary battery includes a pouch-shaped battery case. The battery case has a laminate sheet structure in which an outer coating layer formed of a polymer resin exhibiting high durability, a barrier layer formed of a metallic material blocking moisture or air, and an inner sealant layer formed of a thermally-weldable polymer resin are sequentially stacked.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The angular pipe may have the shape of a hollow quadrangular bar or a closed quadrangular bar. Preferably, the angular pipe has the shape of a hollow quadrangular bar. Such shapes have a high moment of inertia, increasing shock resistance against vibration of the battery pack, as compared to a conventional frame that is I-shaped or is formed of a plate bent in a specific shape. The above term "quadrangular bar shape" may be construed as including not only a quadrangular<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> shape but also a shape having sharp corners, a shape having rounded corners, a shape having one or two linear sides, or a shape having one or two gently-curved sides.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Each of the side support members preferably includes a main body that is in contact with outermost unit modules in the battery modules in the battery module array, an upper end wall and a lower end wall, each being shaped to protrude outwardly from the perimeter of the main body, and a pair of side walls to disperse pressure (or bending load) applied by the battery modules and the lower end support member. Here, the term "outwardly" refers to a direction opposite to the direction of the pressure, i.e., a direction opposite to the direction from the main body of the side support member to the battery modules and the lower end support member.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the battery pack according to the present invention, the battery modules erected in an upside-down fashion are brought into close contact with each other by the side support members, in a state in which the lower ends of the battery modules are coupled to the first upper mounting members, and the side support members are fixed by the lower end support member. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the unit modules of each of the battery modules from swelling and moving in the thickness direction thereof, thereby improving safety of the battery modules and effectively preventing deterioration in performance of the battery modules.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In a preferred example of the above structure, the upper end walls of the side<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> support members may be coupled to the first upper mounting members by welding or bolting.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Meanwhile, the shape of each of the side support members is not particularly limited so long as the side support members can easily support the front and rear of the battery module array. For example, each of the side support members may have a rectangular shape in plan view.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">A lower plate, opposite ends of which are coupled to the side support members, may be further mounted to lower parts of the lower end support members to prevent downward movement of the battery module array in cooperation with the lower end support member when external force is applied to the battery pack.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In a preferred example, when the battery modules are arranged in two rows to constitute a battery module array, the lower end support members may include four members to support the lower ends of the opposite sides of each of the battery modules.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The structure of each of the first upper mounting members is not particularly limited so long as the lower ends of the battery modules erected in an upside-down fashion can be easily mounted to the first upper mounting members. For example, the first upper mounting members may include two opposite end members coupled to upper parts of opposite sides of the battery module array and a middle member<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> coupled to the middle of the battery module array. Therefore, the first upper mounting members can uniformly support the mass of the battery module array.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The end of each of the first upper mounting members fastened to the external device is preferably bent upward by the height of the second upper mounting member coupled to the upper ends of the first upper mounting members, such that the ends of the first upper mounting members and the top of the second upper mounting member are positioned at the same level.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Where appropriate, the battery pack may further include an upper plate mounted between the battery module array and the first upper mounting members to reinforce the top of the battery module array.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In an example of the above structure, the battery module array may be coupled to the upper plate fixed to the lower ends of the first upper mounting members such that the first upper mounting members support the mass of the battery module array.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In another example, portions of the upper plate corresponding to the first upper mounting members may be recessed to lower the overall height of the battery pack.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Meanwhile, the battery pack generally includes an electrically wired structure. Thus, the lower plate may extend to the rear of the rear mounting member<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> to secure a space through which a wire, such as an electric wire, extends.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Where appropriate, the other ends of the first upper mounting members may be coupled to the upper end of the rear mounting member to increase coupling force between the first upper mounting members and the rear mounting member.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In another example, the battery pack may further include a reinforcing bracket coupled to the upper ends of the first upper mounting members, the reinforcing bracket being mounted parallel to the second upper mounting member, to further reinforce the coupling structure between the first upper mounting members and the second upper mounting member.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The battery pack may further include a U-shaped bracket mounted to the upper end of at least one of the first upper mounting members to fix a safety plug.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In an example, the structure of the rear mounting member is not particularly limited so long as the rear mounting member can easily cover opposite sides and the bottom of a cooling fan mounted to the rear of the battery module array. Preferably, the rear mounting member has a U-shaped frame structure.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In another example, the opposite ends of the rear mounting member may be bent parallel to the second upper mounting member and fastening holes may be formed at the bent portions of the rear mounting member to achieve easy coupling to the external device.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The present invention also provides an electric vehicle, a hybrid electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that uses the above battery pack as a power source, has a limited installation space, and is exposed to frequent vibration and strong impact.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Of course, the battery pack used as a power source of the vehicle may be manufactured by combining battery modules based on desired power and capacity.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In this case, the vehicle may be an electric vehicle, a hybrid electric vehicle, or a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle wherein the battery pack is installed in the lower part of a trunk of the vehicle or between a rear seat and the trunk of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The battery pack according to the present invention is structured such that the size of the top of the battery pack is greater than that of the bottom.
