The automatic transmission lever then should be installed in another position, in which case the automatic transmission lever may be installed on the steering column behind the steering wheel. A vehicle in which the automatic transmission lever is installed on the steering column is what is called a column shift vehicle, and such a method as described above is employed for a small number of vehicles including Hyundai Trajet or Chevrolet Avalanche among the existing automatic vehicles.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In the vehicle employing the combo stick of the present invention, the combo stick is installed on the driver's right hand side that is empty in the case of the column shift vehicle, thereby enhancing the convenience of driving.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The combo stick includes a handle 1 and a lever 3, and a button 2 that can lock the lever 3 at a brake position when the lever 3 is pushed forward is installed in the handle 1. A lever cover 4 through which an opening necessary for forward and rearward movements of the lever 3 is formed is substantially identical with an automatic transmission lever cover in existing automatic vehicles, and is located on an interface between the inside and the outside of the vehicle. Meanwhile, characters on the left side of the lever 3 is changed from "RPND2L" such as in existing automatic vehicles to "B ← I → A" in the vehicle including the combo stick therein, in which "B" implies a brake position, "I" implies an idle position, and "A" implies an acceleration position.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In the vehicle driving apparatus of the present invention, the brake is applied when the combo stick is pushed forward, and the accelerator operates so that the vehicle travels when the combo stick is pulled rearward. A driver need not use his right leg for the sake of driving the vehicle, and a right hand is substituted for the right leg, which makes it possible to greatly reduce driver fatigue. However, existing brake and acceleration pedals remain as they are such that the driver may continuously drive the vehicle even in a situation that the driver cannot manipulate the combo stick with his right hand.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In regard to an operation direction of the combo stick, although it seems natural at first that an accelerator operates when the combo stick is pushed<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> forward and a brake is applied when the combo stick is pulled rearward, this has a functional problem. The reason of that is because it is not easy for a driver to pull the combo stick rearward when leaning forward during braking. On the other hand, it is more sensible to design the combo stick such that a brake is applied when the combo stick is pushed forward, since a driver can apply a force, which allows his body to lean forward, to his right hand to push the combo stick. Accordingly, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the brake is applied when the combo stick is pushed forward, and the accelerator operates when the combo stick is pulled rearward.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The vehicle employing such a combo stick includes two brakes and two accelerators. The existing brake is referred to as a foot brake, the brake of the combo stick is referred to as a hand brake, the existing accelerator is referred to as a foot accelerator, and the accelerator of the combo stick is referred to as a hand accelerator.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The vehicle driving apparatus of the present invention includes the lever 3 which moves to an acceleration position, a neutral position or a brake position while rotating forward and rearward at a predetermined angle about a shaft that is fixed to the vehicle body, a hand acceleration means that opens the throttle of the engine to allow the vehicle to be accelerated when the lever 3 moves to the acceleration position, a hand brake means that pushes a booster rod of a brake booster 29 such that the brake operates to stop the vehicle, when the lever 3 moves to the brake position, guide means that are installed on the left and right sides of the lever to prevent the lever from being shaken leftward and rightward, a hand brake locking means that allows the hand brake to be kept applied, and<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> a cruise control means that allows the lever to stay at the acceleration position although a driver takes his hand off the lever when the lever is in the acceleration position.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the driving apparatus in a state where the foot brake and the foot accelerator are not stepped on, and the combo stick is in an idle position.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The lever 3 rotates about a shaft 5 that is fixed to the vehicle body, and a throttle pulling part 6 that is attached to a rear side of the lever 3 pulls the hand acceleration cable 10, when the handle 1 of the combo stick is pulled rearward causing the throttle 71 that is installed in the engine 73 to open since the hand acceleration cable 10 and a throttle cable 70 are connected with each other, thus accelerating the vehicle.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">When the combo stick is pushed forward, the hand brake push rod 17 that is attached to the front side of the lever 3 pushes the fan-shaped saw tooth pin 20, the fan-shaped saw tooth rod 21A moves forward while rotating about the shaft 22 that is fixed to the vehicle body, and the fan-shaped saw tooth 21B moves rearward. The transverse bar saw tooth 23A that is engaged with the fan-shaped saw tooth 21B pushes forward the linear saw tooth 24A that is engaged with an upper surface of the left transverse bar saw tooth 23B, while an upper surface of the transverse bar saw tooth 23A rotates forward. The hand brake pipe 24 that is integrated with the linear saw tooth 24A pushes the booster rod 27 of the brake booster 29, and then the brake is applied so that the vehicle is stopped. A portion of a foot brake lever 30, through which the hand brake pipe 24 passes, forks to left and right sides, so the foot brake may operate the brake booster independently of the hand<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> brake.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Guide plates 40 are installed on the left and right sides of the lever 3 to prevent the lever from being shaken leftward and rightward. The rear side of the guide plates 40, that is, a location where the accelerator operates is formed to be slightly narrow in order to firmly grasp the lever, so that the throttle is kept open even if a driver takes his hand off the combo stick, whereby the vehicle travels at a predetermined speed without continuous manipulation of the driver. The screw handle 50 which can adjust an interval between the left and right guide plates is installed on the lever cover 4 such that the intensity of a force for grasping the lever at the left and right sides may be adjusted.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The acceleration pair ring 57 is installed such that the foot accelerator and the hand accelerator may pull the throttle cable 70 independently of each other, and moves forward and rearward in the interior of the pair ring housing 56.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">When the driver steps on the foot brake with his right foot to stop the vehicle while driving the vehicle in a state where the lever 3 of the combo stick is in an acceleration position, the engine rotates at a terrific speed since the throttle has been opened by the hand accelerator, but loads applied to the engine are reduced. A cross brake override system (58 to 68) is installed to prevent this. Even if the combo stick is in the acceleration position, the cross brake override system operates to return the throttle to the idle position when the brake is stepped on. On the other hand, even when the driver pushes the hand brake to stop the vehicle while driving the vehicle by stepping on the foot accelerator, the cross brake override system identically operates.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref> are perspective views illustrating a<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> hand acceleration means of a vehicle driving apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention.

At this time, the hand acceleration cable 10 attached to the front side of the hand acceleration ring 9 comes out of the hand acceleration cable tube 8 so that the throttle of the engine is opened and a vehicle is accelerated. The hand acceleration ring 9 performs the circumferential motion about the rotary shaft 5 of the combo stick in the interior of the hand acceleration<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> ring housing 7 fixed to the vehicle body. Accordingly, the hand acceleration cable 10 is deflected downward and causes friction with a wall surface of a cable hole 7A formed at the front side of the hand acceleration ring housing 7, as the hand acceleration ring 9 moves rearward. A hand acceleration roller 11 is installed to prevent this.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The hand acceleration ring 9 has an approximately long rectangular parallelepiped shape, and is slightly curved for the circumferential motion. The throttle pulling part 6 is inserted into a hollow internal space of the hand acceleration ring 9. Since the rear surface of the throttle pulling part 6 is close to the rear wall 9B of the hand acceleration ring 9 when the combo stick lever 3 is in an idle position, the vehicle can be accelerated if the lever 3 is pulled slightly rearward. Meanwhile, since the throttle pulling part 6 just goes through the interior of the hand acceleration ring 9, and exerts no influence on a position of the hand acceleration ring 9 when the lever 3 is pushed forward from the idle position so that a hand brake is operated, a brake function and an accelerator function may be performed independently of each other through the single lever 3. A length of the hand acceleration ring 9 is determined such that a front surface 6A of the throttle pulling part 6 does not contact the front wall 9F of the hand acceleration ring when the lever 3 is maximally pushed forward so that the brake is completely applied. The hand acceleration roller 11 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> rotates about a hand acceleration roller pin 12 fixed to a right wall surface of the hand acceleration ring housing 7 to prevent the cable hole 7A from being mutually worn down due to the friction with the hand acceleration cable 10.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Meanwhile, the hand brake means of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> invention includes brake push rods 13, 15 and 17 that are attached to the front side of the lever 3; the fan-shaped saw tooth rod 21A which is installed on the front side of the brake push rods 13, 15 and 17, and includes the fan-shaped saw tooth 21B formed on the upper end thereof, and rotates about a shaft fixed to the vehicle body; a transverse bar saw tooth 23 that rotates while being engaged with the fan-shaped saw tooth; the linear saw tooth 24A which is engaged with the upper surface of the transverse bar saw tooth; and the hand brake pipe 24 which is connected with the booster rod of the brake booster 29 while being integrated with the linear saw tooth 24A.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">A series of components are required in order to transfer the force of the combo stick being pushed forward to the brake booster which is far away from the combo stick. The hand brake push rod has a structure in which the brake push rods 13, 15 and 17 are connected with each other by two joints 14 and 16. A push rod attaching part 13 is fixed to the combo stick lever 3, and the first push rod joint 14 performs a circumferential motion about the rotary shaft 5 of the combo stick. A tail of the short hand brake push rod 15 moves upward and downward with respect to the second push rod joint 16 when the lever 3 moves forward and rearward. Since the long hand brake push rod 17 bears a force applied at an angle slightly inclined upward and downward from a center line passing through the center thereof, abrasions may occur due to friction between the long hand brake push rod 17 and an inner wall of a rear push rod ring 18 among two push rod rings 18 and 19 fixed to the vehicle body. A bearing structure is provided on the inner wall of the rear push rod ring 18 to prevent this (not illustrated).</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The front end 17A of the long hand brake push rod<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> barely contacts the fan-shaped saw tooth pin 20 when the combo stick is in the idle position (<figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5A</figref>), and comes out of a recess of the fan-shaped saw tooth rod 21A to exert no influence on the brake booster when the lever 3 is pulled to the acceleration position (<figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5B</figref>).

The fan-shaped saw tooth 21 rotates the transverse bar saw tooth 23 in a counterclockwise direction while moving rearward, and the hand brake pipe 24 moves forward together with the linear saw tooth 24A integrated therewith, when the hand brake is pushed. At this time, a front end 24F of the hand brake pipe 24 pushes the left and right booster rod side branches 27A of the booster rod 27 so that the brake booster 29 is operated.

Since the compression spring 47 pushes outward on the left and right guide structure bearing plates 44 and 45, the bearing plates are attached to left and right lattices 43A of the guide structure bearing housing 43 as long as an external force is not applied, whereby a maximum width between the left and right bearings is determined.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">The left guide plate 40 and the right guide plate 41 have a roundly curved eyebrow shape when viewed from a side such that the left and right guide plates fit the position of the guide structure bearing housing 43 performing a circumferential motion.

Since the interval between the left and right guide plates 40 and 41 becomes slightly wider so that a driver, as if the lever 3 is loose when the lever 3 is in an idle position (a structure illustrated in a dotted line in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>), may identify the idle position only by feeling the lever 3 without having to look down. However, when the lever 3 is in an acceleration position, an interval between the left guide plate 40 and the moving guide plate 42 becomes slightly narrower than the maximum width between the left and right bearings so that the left and right guide structure bearing plates 44 and 45 is slightly pushed into an interior of the guide structure bearing housing 43, and the compression spring<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> 47 is compressed. At this time, friction is caused between the guide plates 40 and 42 and surfaces of the bearings 46 by an outward pushing force applied to the compression spring 47.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">When the lever 3 is pulled to an acceleration position so that the throttle of the engine is opened, the throttle cable is pulled forward by a torsion spring of the throttle, and the hand acceleration ring 9 which is connected to the rearmost side of the throttle cable is also pulled forward and pulls forward the throttle pulling part 6, whereby the lever 3 to which the throttle pulling part is attached bears a forward pulling force. Accordingly, the lever 3 moves to the idle position on its own as soon as a driver takes his hand off the lever 3. However, when the sufficiently strong compression spring 47 is installed such that the friction force between the guide plates 40 and 42 and the surfaces of the bearings 46 is larger than a force of the throttle torsion spring, the lever 3 stays in a position where a driver has set, even if the driver takes his hand off the lever 3. This helps an existing cruise control function be realized, since the throttle is constantly opened even if the driver takes his right hand off the lever, so that the vehicle travels at a constant speed.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">However, the guide plates and the bearing structure which provide enough friction at first may be loose due to abrasion when the vehicle is used for a long period of time, so a rear portion of the right guide plate, that is, a portion at which the bearing and the guide plate contact each other when the lever is in the acceleration position is formed with a movable structure. The moving guide plate 42 is structurally separated from a front portion 41 fixed to the vehicle body to move leftward and rightward, and a driver may<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> arbitrarily adjust a position of the moving guide plate 42 through an apparatus illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>, three sorts of structures, namely, a tension spring ring 42A, a cylinder 42B, and a wedge wall 42C are integrated with the moving guide plate 42, on the right side surface of the moving guide plate 42. A fixed wall 48 fixed to the vehicle body is installed to position the moving guide plate 42, and a tension spring ring 48A and a fixed wall cylinder 48B are integrated with the fixed wall 48, on a left side surface of the fixed wall 48. Since the moving guide plate cylinder 42B is inserted into the fixed wall cylinder 48B, the moving guide plate cylinder 42B may move only leftward and rightward, and may not move forward, rearward, upward and downward, thereby securing position stability of the moving guide plate 42. A tension spring 49 is inserted into the two cylinders to pull the moving guide plate 42 toward the fixed wall 48. However, the reason why the moving guide plate cylinder 42 cannot enter the fixed wall cylinder 48 B to the end is because a moving guide plate adjusting wedge 50 blocks the wedge wall 42C. The moving guide plate adjusting wedge 50 is integrated with the screw handle 50A and a wedge rod 50B, and a lower end portion 50C of the moving guide plate adjusting wedge 50 at which an external thread is formed passes through an internal thread at a lower portion of the fixed wall. A set of the wedge structures is installed on the front side and rear side of the moving guide plate 42.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">The wedge handle 50A has only to be rotated in a clockwise direction when the combo stick lever 3 is not fixed to the acceleration position and is loose due to abrasion after a vehicle is used for a long period of time. Then, the moving guide plate adjusting wedge 50 pushes leftward the wedge wall 42C while moving downward<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> so that an interval between the moving guide plate 42 and the left guide plate 40 becomes narrow, which can restore looseness caused by the abrasion.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11</figref>, the acceleration independent driving means has a form in which two left and right long rings are coupled in parallel.

At this time, the pair ring rod 57A integrated with the pair ring 57 pulls the throttle cable 70 while entering the acceleration pair ring housing 56 through the hole formed on the front surface of the acceleration pair ring housing 56, whereby the throttle of the engine is opened. On the other hand, when the hand accelerator is not pulled and the foot accelerator 53 is stepped on, the pair ring 57 is pulled by the foot acceleration cable 55, and the throttle of the engine is opened in the same manner. Since the two accelerators have no influence on a position of the counterpart and are not influenced by the position of the counterpart in the process, independence of the two accelerators is secured.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">In the present invention, a cross brake override means is further installed to prevent the engine from rotating at a terrific speed when a driver steps on the brake pedal to stop the vehicle while driving the vehicle with the lever left in an acceleration position.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">When a driver steps on the foot brake with his right foot to stop the vehicle while driving with the combo stick lever 3 left in an acceleration position, although the throttle is opened by the hand accelerator, a load applied to the engine reduces so that the engine rotates at a terrific speed.

The rake rod 60A is integrated with a brake override rake 60B, a sub-rake 60C, and a rake position stabilizing rod 60D so that the whole rake structure moves rightward. At this time, since the rake 60B allows the acceleration rods 63, 65 and 67, which are formed to be folded and unfolded like a watchband, to be unfolded<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> from a folded state, the third acceleration rod 67 returns to an idle position so that the throttle of the engine is closed, although the acceleration pair ring 57 is still in the acceleration position</p><p id="p0084" num="0084"><figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a more specific structure of the cross brake override system.

The uppermost and lowermost portions of a shaft of the second acceleration rod joint 64 among them protrudes further than the upper and lower surfaces of the first acceleration rod 63, and the rake 60B pulls the protruding portion.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Since the brake override rake 60B is located right behind the protrusion of the second acceleration joint 64, the brake override rake 60B does not touch the protrusion even if the brake is stepped on when the hand accelerator is in the idle position. However, when the hand accelerator moves any more closer to an accelerator position, the protrusion enters the brake override rake 60B and is pulled by the brake override rake 60B. The<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> precision of the machine will determine how close to the protrusion of the second acceleration joint 64 the brake override rake 60B can be installed. A width of the rake in a front-rear direction covers a distance from a right rear side of the protrusion of the second acceleration joint 64 to a location of a protrusion 64B of the second acceleration joint 64 at a time of maximum acceleration, which is illustrated by a dotted line in <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref>.
