and more specifically, to the method, the server and the computer-readable recording medium for allowing a vendor to provide an advertisement which meets the collection tendency of users and allowing a system operator to easily acquire recognition reference information required for recognizing an object by recognizing the object corresponding to basic recognition information by comparing the basic recognition information included in collection information collected from user terminals with the basic recognition information received from a vendor's server, providing the vendor's server with calculated statistical information on collection with reference to information on users of user terminals which transmit the basic recognition information and information recognized for the user terminals of a specific user group if the vendor inputs selection information on the particular object and specific user group with reference to the statistical information.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background Technology</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Recently, due to the widespread use of the Internet, it has become common to provide information converted in a digital form which was once offered in print form such as books. As the information converted into digital data may be shared and delivered in real time by many users thanks to the spread of the Internet and a 3G network or other high-speed communications systems, it is widely used compared to printed materials, which have a relative shortcoming from the perspective of sharing and information delivery.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In particular, a technology of providing detailed information on an object existing in reality by using an image of the object taken in real time by a user terminal or other recognition information of the object acquired thereby has been recently introduced.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">When a variety of services, e.g., services of providing detailed information relating to numerous objects existing in reality as shown above, are provided, it is difficult to effectively store an image taken or other recognition information inputted by the user terminal. Even if a user wants to store only the information on an object with relatively high interest (or high importance) differentially, it is complicated and vexatious to systematically record and store<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the information. Therefore, it is true that it has certain limits to leading to more active participation of those in demand.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">To provide information on an object a user wants and support the information to be systematically recorded and stored, a process for recognizing what the object is must be preceded by referring to recognition information such as an image, a barcode, a quick response (QR) code, a RFID tag, etc. of the object. But as for a service provider who has limited resources, since it is impossible in reality to acquire and manage the recognition information of all objects users want, i.e., all existing objects in the world, and it is particularly difficult to acquire recognition reference information on objects stored on an external database secretly managed by a particular vendor, there may be a problem in which such a service provider cannot provide a service for recognizing the object users want to get information on. Reversely, as for the vendor who sells an object, it is important to get more accurate and more useful information on which user is interested in which object in order to effectively perform marketing, inventory management, etc. However, in general, such information is retained by the service providers, who provide information on objects users want to get, and support such information to be systematically recorded and stored. Accordingly, needs for a technology for allowing the service providers and the vendors to enter into close cooperation with each other to create a leverage effect has emerged.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Detailed Description of the Invention</b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b>Technical Tasks</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to solve all the problems mentioned above.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is another object of the present invention to allow a vendor to provide an advertisement which meets the collection tendency of users and allowing a system operator to easily acquire recognition reference information required for recognizing an object by recognizing the object corresponding to basic recognition information by comparing the basic recognition information included in collection information collected from user terminals with the basic recognition information received from a vendor's server, providing the vendor's server with calculated statistical information on collection with reference to information on users of user terminals which transmit the basic recognition information and information recognized for the user terminals of a specific user group if the vendor inputs selection information on the particular object and specific user group with reference to the statistical information.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>Means for Solving Tasks</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">To achieve the above objectives, the representative configuration of the present invention is described below:<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for providing advertisements by using collection information comprising of (a) a step in which recognition reference on an object sold or to be sold in relation to a vendor is received from a vendor server, (b) a step in which collection information, including digital data created by taking basic recognition information of the object with a user terminal or by acquiring the basic recognition information through a short distance communication is collected from the user terminal, (c) a step in which the object corresponding to the basic recognition information is recognized by comparing between the basic recognition information included in the digital data in the collection information acquired from the user terminal and the recognition reference information received from the vendor server by referring to the information on the recognized object and a user of the user terminal who remits the basic recognition information, and (d) a step in which the statistical collection information is provided to the vendor server, and advertising information on a particular object is provided for a user terminal included in the selected specific group if the vendor inputs information on selecting the particular object and the specific user group by referring to the statistical collection information.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a server for providing advertisements by using collection information comprising of a recognition reference information collecting part that receives recognition reference information on an object sold or to be sold in relation to a vendor from the vendor server;

For example, an act of a user taking an image of the cover of a book by using the user's terminal and transmitting the taken image to the server to allow information on the book to be collected may fall under the collection with respect to the book.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Furthermore, the "collection" also may indicate not only the above-described process of transmitting the acquired basic recognition information to the server by using the user terminal but also processes of recognizing the object from the basic recognition information and creating and storing a page (so-called the collection page) by combining digital images, including information on an identity of the recognized object (such as a type, a characteristic, etc. thereof), a time when, and a place where, the basic recognition information thereof is acquired, a comment thereof, an image corresponding thereto, etc.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In addition, the "basic recognition information" with respect to the object in the specification means recognition information which becomes a clue for recognizing the object and more particularly, the recognition information actually acquirable by a terminal of a user who intends to collect the object. For instance, an image of an object taken by the user terminal, a name thereof, other recognition codes, a barcode, a quick response (QR) code, information on a radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag and information on a near field communication (NFC) tag acquired by a short distance communication module (non-illustrated) included in the user terminal, information on a location of the object acquired by a location recognition module include in the user terminal and the like may correspond to the basic recognition information.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In addition, the "recognition reference information" with respect to the object in the specification means information to be compared with the basic recognition information in order to recognize what the object corresponding to the basic recognition information acquired by the user terminal is and particularly recognition information created or managed by a vendor who produces or sells the object. For example, an image of the object itself, etc. managed by the vendor, a name thereof, other recognition codes, a barcode, a QR code, an RFID tag, an NFC tag, information on a location where the vendor places the object, etc. may correspond to the recognition reference information.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Furthermore, "short distance communications" in the specification means all available wireless communication technologies for acquiring the basic recognition information having been granted to the object and must be understood as a concept of the broadest meaning which includes radio-frequency identification technology, short distance wireless communication technology, etc.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><heading id="h0011"><u>Configuration of Entire System</u></heading><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a drawing schematically representing a configuration of an entire system to provide an advertisement by using collection information in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the entire system in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention may comprise of a user terminal (100), an advertisement providing server (200), a vendor server (300), a general web server (400), and a communication network (500).
