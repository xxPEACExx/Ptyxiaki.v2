More particularly, the present invention relates to composite carbon fibers in which multiwalled carbon nanotubes are homogeneously dispersed between graphitized carbon nanofibers and near the surface of the graphitized carbon nanofibers, the composite carbon fibers being excellent in the effect of easily being dispersed in a matrix such as a resin without leaving aggregates, and also imparting low electric resistance.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The method for producing multiwalled carbon nanotubes include chemical vapor deposition methods in which hydrocarbon and the like is thermally decomposed on catalyst metal to form multiwalled carbon nanotubes, and physical vapor deposition methods in which graphite is allowed to undergo sublimation by arc or laser to form multiwalled carbon nanotubes by the cooling process. The chemical vapor deposition methods are a method suited for large-scale synthesis since it is comparatively easy to scale-up a reactor.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The chemical vapor deposition methods can be roughly classified into two methods. One is a method in which a solution, prepared by dissolving metal compounds serving as a catalyst or a co-catalyst such as sulfur in a hydrocarbon such as benzene, is supplied to reaction field heated at 1,000°C or higher using<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> hydrogen as carrier gas, and formation of catalysts and growth of multiwalled carbon nanotubes are performed in the field (floating catalyst method). The other one is a method in which a supported catalyst in which catalyst metals or precursors are supported on carrier prepared in advance is placed in the reaction field heated at 500 to 700°C, and mixed gas of hydrocarbon such as ethylene with hydrogen or nitrogen is supplied and then reacted (supported catalyst method).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Since the reaction is performed in high temperature range of 1,000°C or higher in the floating catalyst method, not only decomposition of the hydrocarbon on the catalyst metals but also an autolysis reaction of hydrocarbon proceeds. Pyrolytic carbon is deposited on the multiwalled carbon nanotube grown from the catalyst metal as the starting point, and the nanotube also grows in the thickness direction of the fiber. The multiwalled carbon nanotube obtained by this method (hereinafter, multiwalled carbon nanotubes having a fiber diameter of 50 nm or more synthesized by floating catalyst method is referred to as a carbon nanofiber) has comparatively low conductivity since it is coated with pyrolytic carbon having low crystallinity. Therefore, the multiwalled carbon nanotubes are synthesized by the floating catalyst method, and then graphitized by heat treatment in an inert gas atmosphere at a temperature of 2,600°C or higher. The heat treatment enables proceeding of crystal rearrangement and graphite crystal growth, leading to an improvement in conductivity of the fiber. The heat treatment also enables vaporization of the catalyst metal to give carbon nanofibers with less impurity.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">On the other hand, since the reaction is performed at 500 to 800°C in the supported catalyst method, the autolysis reaction of the hydrocarbon is suppressed. It is possible to obtain thin multiwalled carbon nanotubes as a result of growing from the catalyst metals as the starting point. The obtained multiwalled carbon nanotubes have comparatively high crystallinity and comparatively high conductivity. Therefore, it is not necessary to perform the heat treatment for crystallization which is applied to the multiwalled carbon nanotubes obtained by the floating catalyst method. Since the multiwalled carbon nanotubes synthesized by the supported catalyst method is not subjected to the heat treatment at high temperature for crystallization, the catalyst metals remains in a percentage order in the multiwalled carbon nanotubes.</p><heading id="h0003">Prior art list</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literatures</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP4835881B"><text>JP 4835881 B</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">PROBLEMS TO BE RESOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The carbon nanofibers have such a comparatively large fiber diameter as 50 nm to 300 nm and has a fiber length of about 10 µm (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>). Because of weak entanglement between these carbon nanofibers, it is easy to disperse each fibrous carbon by adding to a matrix, followed by kneading. However, it may be difficult to sufficiently construct a conductive network by connecting fibrous carbons to each other.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">On the other hand, the multiwalled carbon<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> nanotubes synthesized by the supported catalyst method have such a small fiber diameter as 5 nm to 30 nm and also have a fiber length of 3 µm to 10 µm, thus it has an aspect ratio of about 1,000 (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>). These multiwalled carbon nanotubes are entangled with each other to form a several hundred microns thick aggregate (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>). Even if a fibrous carbon having such firmly entangled aggregation structure is added to a matrix, followed by kneading, the aggregate merely becomes thinner and the aggregation structure is maintained. Therefore, it is difficult to make a state where each fibrous carbon is dispersed. As a result, conductivity-imparting effect as expected may not be exerted.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Patent Document 1 discloses an electrode for a lithium ion battery, including a fibrous carbon having a diameter of less than 100 nm, and a fibrous carbon and/or a non-fibrous conductive carbon each having a diameter of 100 nm or more, as conductive materials.

The floating catalyst method is a method in which a raw material solution prepared by dissolving ferrocene as catalyst source and sulfur compound in benzene as carbon source, or gasses prepared by gasification of the raw material liquid are introduced into a flow reaction furnace heated at 1,000°C or higher using carrier gas such as hydrogen to obtain carbon nanofibers. Commonly, a hollow tube is formed from a catalyst metal as the starting point at an initial stage of a reaction and an approximate length of the carbon nanofibers is decided. Thereafter, pyrolytic carbon is accumulated on the surface of the hollow tube and growth in the diameter direction proceeds to form a growth ring-shaped carbon structure. Therefore, it is possible to adjust the fiber diameter by the amount of pyrolytic carbon accumulated on the carbon nanofiber during the reaction, that is,<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the reaction time, the concentration of the raw material in the atmosphere, and the reaction temperature. The carbon nanofibers obtained by this reaction may have low conductivity since it is coated with pyrolytic carbon having low crystallinity. Thus, in order to enhance crystallinity of the carbon nanofibers, heat treatment is carried out in the atmosphere of an inert gas such as argon at 800 to 1,500°C, followed by graphitization treatment at 2,000 to 3,000°C. The graphitization treatment enables removal of the catalyst metal through vaporization simultaneously, leading to high purity of the carbon nanofibers.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">With regard to the graphitized carbon nanofibers obtained by the heat treatment, it is possible to adjust the length of the fiber or to break a branch of a branched carbon nanofibers by a pulverizer.

A current of 0.1 A was allowed to flow to the sample and, at the time of the bulk density of 0.8 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, a voltage at a distance of 2.0 cm between two terminals 1 for measurement of a voltage inserted from the bottom of a vessel was read, and then resistivity R was calculated by the following equation: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">R</mi><mo>=</mo><mfenced separators=""><mi mathvariant="normal">E</mi><mo>/</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">0.1</mn></mfenced><mo>×</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">D</mi><mo>/</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="44" he="4" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
where R denotes a resistivity [Ωcm], D denotes a cross-sectional area in the current direction of a powder (depth × width) = 10 d [cm<sup>2</sup>], and E denotes a voltage across terminal [V].<br/>
The resistivity varies depending on the pressurized conditions and high resistivity is exhibited under low pressure, and the resistivity decreases as the pressure increases. The resistivity becomes nearly a given value under certain pressure or higher. In the present Example, resistivity when compressed to the bulk density of 0.8 g/cm<sup>3</sup> was adopted as a compressed specific resistance.<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --></p><p id="p0059" num="0059">At the time of measurement of the compressed specific resistance, data of the compressed density ρ under the load of 2,000 N was read and a ratio (ρ/ρ<sub>0</sub>) of the compressed density ρ to the compressed density ρ<sub>0</sub> under the same load of carbon nanofibers alone composing the carbon fiber was calculated.</p><heading id="h0021">(Specific Surface Area)</heading><p id="p0060" num="0060">Using NOVA 1000 manufactured by Yuasa Ionics Co., Ltd., the amount of nitrogen gas adsorbed at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) was calculated by BET method.</p><heading id="h0022">(Measurement of C<sub>0</sub>)</heading><p id="p0061" num="0061">Using Multipurpose X-ray diffraction system (Ultima IV manufactured by Rigaku Corporation) for horizontal sample mounting, the measurement was carried out by using silicone powder as an internal standard in accordance with Gakushin-ho method ("Latest Experimental Technique for Carbon Materials (Analysis Part)", Edited by Carbon Society of Japan).</p><heading id="h0023">(Thermal Analysis)</heading><p id="p0062" num="0062">In thermal analysis, EXSTAR6000 TG/DTA manufactured by SII NanoTechnology Inc. was used.
