Bone modeling initiates from birth and then continues until adolescence/manhood at which time the skeleton matures to an end of growth of an individual, thus achieving the peak bone mass from between his/her twenties to early-thirties. Since then, a bone remodeling process involving removal and replacement of bone is repeated for about 3 years, during which bone formation and bone resorption are coupled to maintain the balance therebetween. After this period of time, bone formation cannot sufficiently keep up with bone<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> loss occurring due to bone resorption, which eventually results in an about 0.3 to 0.5% annual decrease in bone mass. In particular, women will undergo a significant bone loss of 2 to 3% yearly at the early stage of menopause.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Bone contains four types of cells such as osteoblasts osteoclasts, lining cells, and osteocytes. Here, osteoblasts, which are derived from bone marrow stromal cells, are differentiated cells of synthesizing a bone matrix and play a leading part in bone formation, whereas osteoclasts, which are derived from hematopoietic stem cells, play a leading part in bone resorption.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Osteoporosis is a condition in which the compact bone becomes thinner as the calcified bone tissue density decreases and thus the bone-marrow cavity becomes larger. Accordingly as the condition develops, the bones become fragile and are thus prone to fracture even with a small impact. Bone mass is affected by various factors such as genetics, nutrition, changes in hormone levels, differences in exercise and lifestyle, etc., and it is known that the main causes of osteoporosis are aging, insufficient exercise, being underweight, smoking, low-calcium dietary intake, menopause, ovariectomy, etc. Meanwhile, although there are individual differences, the bone resorption level of black people is lower than that of white people, and thus their bone mass is higher than that of white people. For most<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> people, bone mass peaks at ages of 14 to 18 and decreases about 1% per year at old ages. Particularly, in the case of women, bone loss occurs continuously after the age of 30 and develops rapidly due to a change in hormone balance during menopause. That is, when a woman reaches menopause, the estrogen level decreases rapidly. At this time, large numbers of B-lymphocytes are formed as if it happened by interleukin=7 (IL-7), and pre-B cells are accumulated in bone marrow, which consequently leads to an increase in the level of IL-6, thus resulting in an increased activity of osteoclasts and finally a decreased level of bone mass.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As such, although there are differences in the degree of osteoporosis, it is an inevitable condition for old people, particularly for women after menopause. Thus, in the developed countries, the interest in osteoporosis and its therapeutic agents is increasing as the population is aging. Moreover, it is known that a market of about 130 billion dollars is formed worldwide in the treatment of bone diseases and is expected to further increase. Thus, global research institutes and pharmaceutical companies have invested heavily in the development of therapeutic agents for bone diseases. Also, the prevalence rate of osteoporosis in recently Korea increases rapidly as the average life expectancy approaches 80 years. According to research recently conducted for local residents, when the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> research results are normalized in terms of total national population, it has been reported that 4.5% of males have osteoporosis and 19.8% of females suffer from the same disease. This suggests that osteoporosis is a more common disease than diabetes or cardiovascular diseases and is a very important public health issue in view of the pain of patients due to fracture or the cost incurred for the treatment.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Until now, various substances have been developed as therapeutic agents for osteoporosis. Among those therapeutic substances, estrogen, which is most commonly used as an therapeutic agents for osteoporosis but whose practical efficacy has not yet been demonstrated, disadvantageously requires life-time administration, and long-term administration thereof may result in adverse side effects such as increased risk of breast cancer or uterine cancer. Alendronate also has problems associated with indefinite understanding of medicinal efficacy, sluggish gastrointestinal absorption, and pathogenesis of inflammation on gastrointestinal and esophageal mucosa. The calcium preparation is known to have fewer side effects and excellent efficacy, but it is a preventive agent rather than a therapeutic agent. Moreover, vitamin D preparations such as calcitonin are known, but their efficacy and side effects have not yet been sufficiently studied. Thus, there is a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> need for the development of a novel therapeutic agent for metabolic bone diseases, which has fewer side effects and excellent efficacy.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Meanwhile, there by recently been studies reporting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by oxidative stress are involved in bone metabolism (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Darden, A. G., et al., J. Bone Miner, Res., 11:671-675, 1996</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Yang, S., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 276:5452-5458, 2001</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Fraser, J. H., et al., Bone 19:223-226, 1996</text></nplcit>; and <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Yang, S., et al., Calcif. Tissue Int., 63:346-350, 1998</text></nplcit>). Moreover, it is known that bone remodeling is carried out through the relative action between bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts (OC). Multinuclear osteoclasts differentiate from the monocyte/macrophage lineage of hematopoietic progenitor cells through a multi-stage process of cell adhesion, proliferation, motility, cell-cell contact, and terminal fusion for the formation of multinucleated giant cells. This process is initiated by binding of a receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB (hereinafter referred to as "RANK") to a receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (hereinafter referred to as "RANKL") and is then transmitted through the activation of several signaling cascades. The activated signaling pathway includes NF-KB, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (hereinafter referred to as "ERK"), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (hereinafter referred to as "JNK"),<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase through tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (hereinafter referred to as "TRAF6"). These signaling events have a direct effect on the modulation of differentiation and action of osteoclasts (<nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>Boyle, N. J., et al., Nature, 423:337-342, 2003</text></nplcit>). Once osteoclasts are differentiated, the resorption of bone is accelerated by ROS generated due to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. An NADPH oxidase inhibitor leads to a reduction of ROS and bone resorption (<nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>Yang, S., et al., Calcif. Tissue Int., 63:346-350, 1998</text></nplcit>). These results are consistent with the theory suggesting that the generation of ROS in osteoclasts is dependent on the activity of NADPH oxidase and is directly associated with the function of osteoclasts.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Therefore, the inventors of the present invention have conducted extensive studies based on the fact that a therapeutic agent for osteoporosis can be developed using a molecular mechanism which inhibits the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and found that pyrazole derivatives of the present invention exhibit excellent inhibitory activity on the generation of ROS and these compounds can be used for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis, thereby completing the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><heading id="h0003">[Disclosure]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Technical Problem]</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide a novel pyrazole derivative having excellent inhibitory activity on the generation of reactive oxygen species, a preparation method thereof, and a composition comprising the same for the treatment of osteoporosis.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for preventing or treating osteoporosis, the method comprising administering a novel pyrazole derivative of the present invention to a subject in need thereof, and a use of the novel pyrazole derivative of the present invention for preparing a pharmaceutical preparation for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis.</p><heading id="h0005">[Technical Solution]</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention provides a compound represented by the following formula 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:
