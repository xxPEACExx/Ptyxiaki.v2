In the above-mentioned method, it is desirable that a button for performing zoom is provided that is due to software or hardware, and furthermore, it is desirable that the center of the zoom is fixed or preliminarily set. In addition, a method has existed that performs zoom with a certain scaling factor every time a button is pressed down once, or a method has existed where display is updated with an enlargement factor being changed with a certain rate while a button is pressed. In addition, a method has existed where the position of the center point of zoom is fixed to the center of a screen, or a method has existed that performs preliminary setting such as utilizing a point at which a screen has been most recently touched.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In addition, as another method for changing a display content, a method has existed that utilizes, for example, a zoom slider. A user moves a slider realized owing to software or hardware, and hence, a zoom factor is changed. In addition, when the zoom slider is used on the software, it is desirable that the display area of the slider is provided on a screen, and it takes an installation cost to provide the zoom slider on the hardware. In addition, in the case of the slider, for example, there is a problem that it takes labor to separately provide the center of zoom.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In addition, a method has existed where a touch panel capable of performing multi-touch detection is used and zoom or the like is performed owing to a pinching operation. In addition, the pinching operation is a method widely adopted in portable communication terminals such as smartphones of recent years. In addition, in the past, a circular-gesture zoom function has also existed where, by drawing a circle on a touch panel, the position thereof is zoomed.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Furthermore, in the past, a method has existed where zoom is started owing to the stay of a pointing input or a strong pressing force or a near region and a far region are set with a zoom starting point as a reference and zoom-in or zoom-out is performed using the individual regions. In addition, in the past, a method has existed where enlargement is performed by applying short press on a screen once and reduction is performed by applying short press on the screen twice. In addition, in the past, a method has existed where a certain amount of enlargement or reduction is performed by applying long press or a double tap on a screen (for example, refer to PATENT LITERATURES 1 to 3).</p><heading id="h0003">CITATION LIST</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006"><ul><li>[PATENT LITERATURE 1] Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2011028635A"><text>2011-28635</text></patcit></li><li>[PATENT LITERATURE 2] Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2005234199A"><text>2005-234199</text></patcit></li><li>[PATENT LITERATURE 3] Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2011022851A"><text>2011-22851</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h0005">TECHNICAL PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, in a pinching method, since an operation is performed using a plurality of fingers, it is significantly difficult to perform an operation using a single hand, and it is desirable that usually a communication terminal is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> supported form a back side using one hand and an operation is performed using the other hand. In addition, in a gesture zoom function, it is also difficult to draw a circle at a predetermined position on a screen using one hand (in particular, a thumb), and it is desirable that an operation is performed using two hands in the same way as a pinching operation. In addition, operations in the above-mentioned methods of the related art, such as a tap (selection) and a double tap (predetermined scaling factor zoom) on a screen and drag (scrolling), are also used in another operation such as the selection or decision of a menu. Therefore, in the methods of the related art, if the above-mentioned operations are used at the time of a zoom operation, the same operations are mixed. Therefore, it is difficult to adequately perform the intended change of screen display.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In addition, in the past, while, as described above, a method has also existed where zoom or the like is performed owing to the staying time of a finger on a screen, it is difficult to perform another operation during the staying, and a latency time due to the staying is taken.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Furthermore, when enlargement is performed owing to a double tap, zoom is performed with a preliminarily set value while it is difficult to arbitrarily specify a zoom factor. Accordingly, in the methods of the related art, it has been difficult to change the display content of a screen to an adequate arbitrary scaling factor using a simple operation, for example, a single-handed operation or the like.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In view of such a problem, an object of the disclosed technology is to adequately change the display content of a screen using a simple operation.</p><heading id="h0006">SOLUTION TO PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to an aspect of the invention, a display method executed by a computer, includes: receiving a first input relating to a first operation performed on a display content displayed in a display unit; receiving a second input relating to a second operation performed on the display content; and when<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the second input received after the first input is a drag operation, changing a display scaling factor of the display content on the basis of a movement direction of the drag operation and a distance between a reference position relating to at least one of the first input and the second input, and a current position of the drag operation.</p><heading id="h0007">ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to the disclosed technology, it may be possible to adequately change the display content of a screen using a simple operation.</p><heading id="h0008">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a functional configuration of an information processing device in the present embodiment;</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a hardware configuration of an information processing device;</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 3B</figref> are flowcharts illustrating an example of display processing in the present embodiment;</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example of display processing at the time of a scroll mode;</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example of display processing at the time of a zoom mode;</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example of display processing at the time of a rotation mode;</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 7A, FIG. 7B, FIG. 7C, and FIG. 7D</figref> are diagrams illustrating a first specific example of a display content corresponding to a user operation;</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram for explaining a relationship between a movement amount due to drag and a zoom factor;</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 9A, FIG. 9B, and FIG. 9C</figref> are diagrams illustrating a second specific example of a display content corresponding to a user operation;<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 10A and FIG. 10B</figref> are diagrams illustrating a third specific example of a display content corresponding to a user operation;</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 11A, FIG. 11B, FIG. 11C, and FIG. 11D</figref> are diagrams illustrating a fourth specific example of a display content corresponding to a user operation; and</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 12A, FIG. 12B, FIG. 12C, and FIG. 12D</figref> are diagrams illustrating a fifth specific example of a display content corresponding to a user operation.</p><heading id="h0009">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0025" num="0025">Hereinafter, embodiments will be described in detail with reference to accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h0010">&lt;Example of Functional Configuration of Information Processing Device in Present Embodiment&gt;</heading><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of the functional configuration of an information processing device in the present embodiment. An information processing device 10 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> includes a position input unit 11, an input-frequency measurement unit 12, an input-position holding unit 13, a time measurement unit 14, a distance calculation unit 15, a state reset unit 16, a drag determining unit 17, a mode controller 18, a reference position calculation unit 19, a change amount calculation unit 20, a display content setting unit 21, and a display unit 22.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The position input unit 11 receives, for example, the input of an arbitrary position (pointing position) on a display screen in the display unit 22. In addition, for example, in a case where the display unit 22 is a touch panel, when a user depresses the screen of the display unit 22 using a finger, an electronic pen, or the like, the position input unit 11 detects a depressed position owing to the pressure or temperature thereof, and hence, receives the input of position information. In addition, in the position input unit 11, a position input due to drag may also be available. Here, the drag indicates a state where, for<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> example, the finger or the like of the user is caused to move in a state of being in contact with the screen of the display unit 22. Accordingly, the position information input to the position input unit 11 owing to the drag turns out to continue changing every certain time period.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In addition, the position input unit 11 may not receive a position input due to the touch panel, and receives a position input utilizing an arbitrary pointing device such as, for example, a mouse, a trackball, or object tracking due to the real-time analysis of a camera image. For example, when the mouse, the trackball, or the like is used, the position input unit 11 receives a position obtained with a certain operation as a trigger, the examples of the certain operation including depressing a key, a drag operation, and moving a certain object in a certain direction. In addition, while the position input unit 11 may receive, as coordinate information, an indicating position from the user, the position input unit 11 is not limited to this.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The input-frequency measurement unit 12 measures, for example, the number of times position inputs have been received from the position input unit 11. Specifically, for example, when the display unit 22 is a touch panel, the input-frequency measurement unit 12 measures the number of times the display unit 22 has been switched from a non-depressed state to a depressed state, using a finger, an electronic pen, or the like. Accordingly, the frequency of inputs turns out to be, for example, the number of times position inputs from the position input unit 11 have switched from turn-off (OFF) to turn-on (ON) (for example, the number of times a tap has been performed), or the like.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The input-position holding unit 13 holds the starting point of a position input, the ending point of the position input, or both thereof from a time point when the frequency of position inputs the input-frequency measurement unit 12 holds has increased from "0". For example, when the display unit 22 is a touch panel, the coordinates of a point at which the finger or the like of the user has depressed the touch panel correspond to the starting point of a position input, and the coordinates of a point at which the finger or the like of the user<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> has left the touch panel correspond to the ending point of a position input. In addition, the input-position holding unit 13 holds not only an input position input last but also, for example, a plurality of previous input positions, as an array. In addition, as for how many input positions are held, the number of input positions is set on the basis of, for example, a calculation content or the like in the distance calculation unit 15 or the reference position calculation unit 19. In addition, the input-position holding unit 13 may also hold input positions whose number is preliminarily set.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The time measurement unit 14 measures a time having elapsed from a time point when the frequency of position inputs the input-frequency measurement unit 12 holds has increased from "0". In addition, the time measurement unit 14 may also measure the elapsed time owing to, for example, counting up due to a counter or the like preliminarily provided, and may also measure the elapsed time on the basis of an internal clock such as a real time clock (RTC).</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The distance calculation unit 15 calculates the value of a distance between the position of the starting point and a current input position with respect to input position information the input-position holding unit 13 holds. In addition, when the frequency of position inputs is not "0", the distance calculation unit 15 calculates, for example, a distance between the position of the above-mentioned starting point and an input position at present during a drag operation with certain timing or in real time.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Here, the distance obtained in the distance calculation unit 15 is used for determining whether or not the positions of individual taps are sufficiently close to one another in a plurality of successive taps in a zoom operation in the present embodiment. In this case, for example, with respect to a plurality of individual input positions held in the input-position holding unit 13, the distance calculation unit 15 obtains a maximum value in distances between an initial point held therein and the remaining points. In addition, on the basis of the maximum value in the distances, it is determined whether the positions of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> individual taps are sufficiently close to one another. However, the distance calculation unit 15 is not limited to this.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">When a measured time obtained from the time measurement unit 14 has exceeded a preliminarily set threshold value or the value of a distance obtained from the distance calculation unit 15 has exceeded a preliminarily set threshold value, the state reset unit 16 resets the states of the frequency of inputs and the like the input-frequency measurement unit 12 holds. In addition, while indicating, for example, zeroing the frequency of inputs, the resetting is not limited to this.

For example, it is assumed that the size of the reference mark 52 has the same size of a circle whose radius is the given number C in the above-mentioned expression and the center of the position thereof is the reference position.

In addition, as for the scrolling performed in a direction opposite to the drag direction, scrolling turns out to be performed in, for example, a direction in which the reference position is moved away from a current input position.
