id="h0001"><u>Description of the Prior Art</u></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Single-phase induction motors are widely used due to their sim-plicity, robustness and high performance. Their application is found in household appliances in general, refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners, hermetic compressors, washing machines, motor pumps, fans and some industrial applications.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Known induction motors generally consist of a cage rotor and a wound stator comprised of two windings, one of them a running winding and the other a starting winding. During normal operation of the compressor, the running winding is fed by alternating current, and the starting winding is fed temporarily, at the beginning of the starting operation, creating a rotating magnetic field in the stator air gap, a condition necessary to accelerate the rotor and bring about its start.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The rotating magnetic field can be obtained by supplying the starting winding with a current lagging in time relative to the circulating current through the primary winding, preferably at an angle close to 90 degrees. This discrepancy between the current flowing in both windings is achieved by<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> constructive characteristics of the windings or by installing external impedance in series with one of the windings, although typically in series with the starting winding. The value of the circulating current through the starting winding during the starting process of the motor is normally high, making it necessary to use some type of switch that would interrupt this current after the time required to bring about the motor's acceleration has passed.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">For motors in which very high efficiency is required, the starting winding is not fully switched off after the expiration of the starting period, as a capacitor called the operating capacitor remains in series with this winding, providing sufficient current to increase the maximum torque of the motor and its efficiency.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">For motors with this configuration using a permanent impedance in series with the starting winding during normal motor operation, several PTC-type starting devices are known, electromechanical relay, timed, as well as combinations in which a PTC connected in series with a device which interrupts the flow of current after a determined period of time (RSP) as cited in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5053908A"><text>U.S. patent documents 5,053,908</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5051681A"><text>U.S. 5,051,681</text></patcit>, and in the copending international patent application <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO0209624A1"><text>WO 02/09624 A1</text></patcit>, from the same applicant.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">One of the components widely used in starting "split-phase" single-phase motors, where an operating capacitor is not used, is the electromechanical relay type. Its extensive use is related to its low manufacturing cost and its technological simplicity. On the other hand, the electromechanical relay presents a number of limitations chief among which are the need for the design of a specific component for each size of electric motor, the impossibility of its use in high efficiency engines where an operating capacitor is used, the generation of electromagnetic noise and sounds during its operation and the wearing of components caused by electric arcing and mechanical friction.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">An alternative to the electromechanical relay is the PTC-type ("Positive Temperature Coefficient") device. This component is widely used in high efficiency engines where its application is associated with an operating capacitor. As it involves the use of a ceramic chip with no moving parts,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> its principle resolves many of the limitations of the electromechanical relay. As its operation is based on the heating of a ceramic chip, resulting in its increased resistance and the consequent limitation of circulating current, dissipation of residual power occurs over the entire period of its operation.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Another limitation of this component is related to the time interval required between consecutive starts. One of its major advantages is the possibility of using a single component to operate the start of a set of motors of a specified voltage (115V or 220V), but becomes a limitation when the feature under consideration is optimization of the energization time of the secondary winding. Its conduction time is directly proportional to the volume of the ceramic chip and inversely proportional to the circulating current, resulting in a reduced starting time when applied to larger motors and too long a period of time when applied to smaller motors. These two facts result in a deficient starting of larger motors and higher energy consumption during the starting period in smaller motors.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">While timed starting components eliminate the major drawback of residual consumption of the PTC, they, however, do not allow one to adapt the starting time required for motors of different sizes. Its concept does not allow for the sizing of a circuit which provides the optimal starting time for different motor sizes, and it becomes necessary to have several models, each of them set to a given operating time and to suit a particular family of electric motors, resulting in de-standardization, increased changes in manufacturing lines and higher inventory. Such devices do not take into account the operating conditions at the moment of start-up and are therefore sized for the worst condition, thus increasing starting time.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In view of the above, the present invention offers a new method of starting single-phase motors capable of optimizing the starting time of a wide range of motors, especially in terms of their operating power. Furthermore, a device and a starting system are also provided in order to achieve the objects of the present invention.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Objects of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is a first object of the present invention to provide a cost-effective<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> starting device with a simple and robust topology, which allows for:

Most preferably, the starting device 28 includes only one electronic signal-processing device 30 such as a micro-processor or micro-controller, however, two or more may be used without affecting the functioning and operation of this starter 28.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Some conventional components that are now well-known, such as micro-controllers from the Microchip family, ICPs or old micro-controllers from the INTEL family such as the 8051 and 8052, among others, can be<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> easily used to build the electronic signal-processing device 30 in the present invention. Otherwise, this device 30 can also be made by a dedicated electronic circuit and designed from electronic components in general use.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Additionally, <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows that the starting device 28 further comprises at least one voltage zero-crossing sensor SV electrically linked to the electronic signal-processing device 30 and to the start switch S1, and at least one voltage zero-crossing sensor RS electrically linked to the electronic signal-processing device 30 and to the start switch S1.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The starting device 28, in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, is configured to promote the starting and/or shutdown of the single-phase induction motor via the start switch S1.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In more detail, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the starting device 28 connects through its start switch S1, the starting winding B2 to an alternate voltage source F. After motor start-up, the start switch S1 is brought into an open position by device 28.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">An innovative feature of the present invention relates to the methodology, or method, of driving and control of motor start-up. Such a motor comprises a rotor and a stator M having a running winding B1 and a starting winding B2, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. From <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> it can also be noted that the starting winding B2 is electrically linked to the aforementioned starting device 28, so that the running winding B1 is electrically linked to a source of alternate voltage supply F, or simply an alternate voltage source F.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">More broadly, the present method is described below based on its main steps, namely:
<ul><li>a-) firstly measuring via starting device 28, one or more source time periods Tfon in which an alternate voltage signal supplied by the alternate voltage source F crosses zero;</li><li>b-) creating an internal timebase Tref in the starting device 28, with the said base Tref synchronized with a phase of the voltage signal of the alternate voltage source F, over the periods of time measured in Step a;</li><li>c-) closing the start switch S1 in a second supply period or instance T2 of the single-phase motor, initiating the supply of current to the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> starting winding B2 of the motor;</li><li>d-) measuring one or more starting time periods Tpar of the voltage of the starting winding B2 where the latter crosses zero;</li><li>e-) comparing the times where the current flowing through the starting winding B2 crosses zero with the internal timebase Tref;</li><li>f-) calculating, via the starting device 28, the phase difference Df between the current flowing through the starting winding B2 and the internal timebase Tref based on the comparison made in Step e;</li><li>i-) opening the start switch S1 based on the calculation in Step g when the starting device 28 detects a phase difference Df between the current flowing through the starting winding B2 and the internal timebase Tref of a value in excess of a predetermined start phase boundary Lfap.</li></ul></p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> shows the voltage waveform present in the starting device 28, allowing for the identification of the critical moments of the start-up of the single-phase induction motor, according to the teachings of the present invention.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">It is worth to note that in this case, the predetermined phase boundary Lfap depicts an operating state in which the motor is accelerated with a rotational speed close to its nominal operating speed. It is a fact that Step "d" above corresponds to the point at which the motor is initiating its start-up.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">On the other hand, the phase boundary Lfap, as described, corresponds to the point at which the motor reaches substantially higher rotational speeds as compared to the beginning of the machine's start-up. When the electric motor is at a low speed or stopped, for example, the phase difference Df between the current flowing in the starting winding B2 and the calculated internal timebase calculated is considerably small in the present invention.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Operationally, to recap, we see that opening the start switch S1 is effected through a command sent by the electronic signal- processing device 30, which is incorporated in the starting device 28, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, at the moment when the motor is accelerated with a rotational speed close to<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> its nominal value.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Alternatively, the present method further comprises a step of opening the start switch S1 when the phase difference Df between the current flowing through the starting winding B2 and the internal timebase Tref is larger than a predetermined phase value Fpred, which is configured to represent a state in which the motor is accelerated to a speed close to its nominal speed, after the expiry of a preset starting time starting Tppre.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Expressed in another way, the operational methodology of the object claimed herein also provides a step of opening the start switch S1 when the phase difference Df between the current flowing through the starting winding B2 and the internal timebase Tref presents null variation, this condition being set to represent a state of operation where the motor has completed its acceleration.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Thus, the electronic signal-processing device 30 via the control terminal 26 issues a command to the start switch S1 to open and remain in this state, terminating the supply of current to the starting winding B2, and therefore the motor start.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In the present invention there is further provided a step (j) to keep the start switch S1 open until the alternate voltage source signal F, or the power supplied is stopped over a stoppage period Tpara sufficient to characterize the stoppage of the motor.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Furthermore, the present method also comprises the step after motor start-up, to analyze time periods, or instances, in which the zero-crossing occurs at a voltage Vpar on the start switch S1. Thus, the start switch S1 is held closed during the start of the motor and open over the entire time that the motor is operating, so that the electronic signal-processing device 30 records voltage zero-crossing instances on said start switch S1 through a source terminal 25 and a voltage zero-crossing sensor SV capable of detecting the motor's operating state and recognizing its deceleration or shut-down through the interruption of power supplied by alternate voltage supply source F.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The method proposed herein also provides the steps for storing<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the internal timebase Tref, and synchronizing it with the voltage zero-crossing of starting winding B2. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> shows a graph where it is possible to display the setting of the timebase carried by the electronic signal-processing device 30, in accordance with the object of the present invention.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In relation to the aforementioned, it is noteworthy that with each new motor start-up a new timebase, or reference point, is created and stored by the electronic device 30 so that the circuit automatically adapts to new system load conditions, in particular supply voltage (overvoltage or undervoltage) and temperature conditions of the running winding B1 and the starting winding B2 of the stator.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Due to the record created for each new start cycle, the circuit does not require any prior calibration to operate with a given type of motor, as currently occurs in other prior art solutions, thus facilitating its use in a wide range of motors.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In the event of an unsuccessful attempt at start-up or ignition in which the rotor remains locked and there is no change in phase difference Df, the electronic signal-processing device 30 instructs the opening of start switch S1, when the time from the closing of start switch S1 exceeds a predetermined maximum time value for completion of motor start-up. In this condition, the time interval E1 shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> will extend unduly, reaching a maximum allowable time and the opening of the start switch S1 will protect the start switch itself.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Therefore, based on the above, the present method provides a step capable of determining the opening of start-switch S1, through the starting device 28, when a time counted from the closing of start switch S1, exceeds a preset maximum time-value Tmax for completion of motor start-up.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In this case, the circuit will delay for a period appropriate for the cooling of the motor and/or required to adjust the load condition to the torque supplied by the motor, before allowing a new start cycle. In order to complete this last operation, the proposed method provides a step relating to the delay for the cooling of the motor Tres, and/or minimum load time Tmin, required establishing the load condition to the torque provided by the motor before<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> allowing a new start cycle.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Finally, the instant invention provides a system for starting a single-phase induction motor, this motor being having a rotor and a stator M. The stator comprises a running winding B1 and a starting winding B2 as mentioned above.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In greater detail, and as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, it is noted that this system comprises a start switch S1 linked electrically through its contact terminals to an alternate voltage source F. Said start switch S1 is configured to electrically connect a first terminal of the starting winding B2 to alternate voltage source F.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In the same <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> one can observe in the system herein proposed the presence of a direct current source 29 supplied from the contact terminals of the start switch S1.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In this system there is also provision, as mentioned earlier, for at least one electronic signal processor 30, fed by direct current source 29, and operably linked to the start switch S1.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Additionally, a voltage zero-crossing sensor RS of the starting winding B2 is provided in the current starting system, configured to detect periods of time or instances in which the current in the starting winding B2 crosses zero. A voltage zero-crossing sensor SV connected to the terminals of the start switch S1 is also provided in this system, this sensor being configured to detect periods of time or moments in which the voltage between the terminals of the start switch S1 crosses zero.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In a very efficient and functional manner, the starting system, the object of the present invention, is configured to close the start switch S1 in order to start the supply of current to the starting winding B2 of the motor when starting the engine. In a very innovative manner with regards to the solutions available today, the aforementioned system is further configured to open the start switch S1 from a detected phase difference Df between the current circulating in the starting winding B2 and the internal time base Tref.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The opening of the starter S1 is established when the phase difference Df calculated above is greater than a predetermined phase limit<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> Lfase.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">From the configuration for the starting system of the present invention, it can be stated that the start switch S1, direct current source 29, electronic signal-processing device 30 and the voltage zero-crossing sensor RS and the voltage zero-crossing sensor SV form, in combination, a starting device 28.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> also shows that a first terminal of AC voltage supply source F is electrically linked to a first gear terminal 45 of the running winding B1 and a first switch terminal S1' of the start switch S1. The first source terminal 1 is also associated to a first direct source terminal 27 of the direct current source 29.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Still in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, one can see that a second direct current source terminal 25 is electrically linked to a second terminal switch S1" of the start switch S1.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Regarding the control of said start switch S1, it is noted that this is operably linked to the electronic signal-processing device 30 via a control terminal 26 of the start switch S1.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In its operational form, the present system employs, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, the electronic signal-processing device 30 so as to create an internal time base Tref by the so-called starting device 28, with this timebase Tref being synchronized with a signal voltage phase of the alternate voltage source F.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">In this regard, the electronic signal-processing device 30 determines the moments of opening and closing of the start switch S1 based on a calculated phase difference Df between the phase of current flowing through the starting winding B2 and the internal timebase Tref.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Furthermore, the electronic signal-processing device 30 is configured to keep the start switch S1 open until the power supplied by alternating current source F is interrupted for a period of time which features the motor stoppage.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> further illustrates that the present system provides for<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> the use of an operation capacitor CR positioned parallel to the terminals of the running winding B1 and starting winding B2 of the stator M in such a way as to provide a phase difference between the currents that pass through the running winding B1 and the starting winding B2.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Finally, the present invention achieves its objects in that it provides a starting mechanism, comprising a system, method and device for starting a single-phase motor, that is substantially more efficient and simplified compared to solutions known as the state of the art, as well as being capable of offering a more optimized start for a wide power range of motors of that type.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Having described an example of its preferred embodiment, it must be understood that the scope of the present invention includes other possible variations, being limited only by the content of the claims, which include therein possible equivalents.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982371" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A method for starting a single-phase induction motor, the motor comprising a rotor and a stator (M) with a running winding (B1) and a starting winding (B2), the starting winding (B2) being electrically linked with the starting device (28), the starting device (28) and the running winding (B1) being electrically linked to an alternate voltage power supply (F), the starting method being <b>characterized by</b> comprising the steps of:
