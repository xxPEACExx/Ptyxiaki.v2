If a seamless belt is used this is typically made of a stiff material with a variation inn printing due to stretching thereof being typically less than 20 µm.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In systems where the image is collected on a collecting device such as a drum or seamless belt, the more image-producing stations present, the bigger this collecting device has to be. This affects the cost as well as the risks involved in both the production and use of such collecting device.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Furthermore, as a result of the inability of typical developer stations to be able to transfer its image to the photoconductive carrier an any angular position because of the chance of leakage, the geometry of a big collecting device becomes more challenging the bigger it becomes, certainly if the image-forming stations are uncoupled from the collecting device when they are not being used.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the invention</b></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">An objective of the present invention is to realise a print engine configuration (printer) capable of printing images comprising a large number of coloured toner sub-images (more than with the traditional four coloured toners) in registration within 50 µm (preferably within 20 µm and particularly preferably within 10 µm) at high process speeds e.g. above 60 mm/s and preferably up to 3m/s.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">One solution to this problem would be to have multiple collecting devices, each with 1 or more print stations. These collecting devices can then each transfer the resulting image of its print stations to the receptor material, e.g. the paper. Using techniques to ensure registration between the images of the various collecting devices, the result can be a full colour image. However, if the final receptor material is a more flexible, e.g. on a web, the registration of the images of the multiple collecting devices thereon proves to be very difficult. Any variation in web tension results in variation in speed and length of the material. The fact that the different colours transferred from different intermediates are not transferred at the same place to the passing web means that any difference in web speed directly results in inter-colour registration defects. This has an effect on the colour printed because of the incorrect placing of the basic colours in the screening.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A model has been developed to simulate the observed dependence of registration upon print engine configuration. Xeikon's current commercial print engine configuration, e.g. that of the Xeikon 8000, with the traditional four colours ameliorates variability in registration by printing without a collecting device directly on the receptor material, but registration problems occur between the first and last colour printed in the case of very flexible substrates. Very flexible receptor materials (print media) with unstable tension conditions exhibit bad registration quality. This was shown experimentally. These<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> experimental results could be simulated using this model in which the tension condition varied over time at the transfer point.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">This problem can be solved by using a collecting device, but such collecting devices (intermediate members) need to be of limited length to avoid the high production costs of such collecting devices and mechanical problems in their use. Moreover, where there is a need to print a large number of colours (more than the traditional four colours), a collecting device of limited length being too small to accommodate the large number of colours. Therefore, this problem cannot be solved by all image-producing stations depositing partial images on the same collecting device, and the resulting image being transferred in a single transfer to the receptor material. This means that for collecting multiple toner images, particularly in the case of collecting more than four toner images, multiple collecting devices have to be contemplated. The above-mentioned model has been used to establish the way in which alternative multiple collecting device options influence colour registration where there is a need to print a large number of colours.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">It has been surprisingly discovered, despite the registration problems inherent in using more than one collecting device, that this problem can be solved by not all image-producing stations depositing partial images on the same collecting device, and the resulting image being still transferred in a single transfer to the receptor material. Having two or more collecting devices, each with one or more image-producing stations results in a multiplicity of smaller collecting devices. Adding a transfer zone where the partly formed image on a first collecting device is transferred to the next collecting device results in an image that can contain the images of all image-producing stations on all collecting devices. At the last collecting device the full image is present and can then be transferred to the receptor material.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">This means that the registration between the different coloured toner sub-images is already fixed as soon as the last colour is added to the last collecting device. In the final transfer step towards the receptor material variations in speed tension condition in the receptor material etc. have no effect on the final registration i.e. cannot change the registration quality.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Therefore, the present invention, has the considerable advantage of combining insensitivity to the properties of the receptor material (i.e. does not require complicated sensors, actuators etc.) with a toner image-collecting device for electrostatographic printers with more than four different toners, which is not prohibitively large and not too expensive to produce.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Of course the choice of collecting device still plays an important role, but these can be selected and tuned by the engine manufacturer, and are preferably of stiff material such that the registration variations during printing do not exceed 20 µm.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The above objective is accomplished by an electrostatographic printer and method of forming a multi-colour image on a receptor material according to the present invention.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to a first aspect of the present invention a method of forming a multi-colour image on a web-fed receptor material (13) is provided with a system comprising an array of at least two toner image-collecting devices (11) with at least a first toner image-collecting device and a final toner-image-collecting device optionally with at least one toner image-collecting device in between, said first toner-image-collecting device coming into contact with said final toner-image-collecting device or the next toner-image-collecting device in the array and the next toner-image-collecting device either coming into contact with following toner-image-collecting device in said array or said final toner-image-collecting device in said array, each toner image-collecting device being comprised in a colour unit (60) with at least one image-forming station (14) directly associated therewith that can transfer a toner image to said associated toner image-collecting device, a transfer zone (19) between a toner image-collecting device in a particular colour unit and a toner image-collecting device directly associated with a different colour unit (60), comprising the steps of: receiving the toner image or images on said first toner image-collecting device in a first colour unit (60); transferring said toner image or toner images on said first toner image-collecting device at a single transfer point either directly or via at least one intermediary toner image-collecting device each in a colour unit (60) to said final image-collecting device in said array of at least two toner image-collecting devices directly or indirectly to said receptor material from said final toner image-collecting device at a single transfer point on one side of said receptor element using a transfer device (18) such that the collected toner image transferred in said transfer zone contains the individual images from all image-forming stations in said multiple colour units, wherein at least one of the image-collecting devices (11) is a seamless belt having an overall stiffness in the range of 1 x 10<sup>-2</sup> to 1 x 10<sup>-6</sup> N/m.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">According to a second aspect of the present invention an electrostatographic printer is provided for forming an image onto a receptor element, which printer comprises: an array of at least two toner image-collecting devices with at least a first collecting device and a final collecting device optionally with at least one collecting device in between, said first collecting device coming into contact with said final collecting device or the next<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> collecting device in the array and the next collecting device either coming into contact with the following collecting device in said array or said final collecting device in said array, each collecting device being capable of receiving the toner images produced by a set of at least two electrostatographic stations directly associated therewith via a transfer means for transferring the toner image from each directly associated image-producing electrostatographic station in said set to said directly associated collecting device together, if applicable, with the cumulated toner images from the preceding collecting device; each set of electrostatotographic stations comprising:

The photosensitive medium (1) rotates, in a circular or other movement that allows the photosensitive medium to pass the various parts of the image-forming station. At a particular position in the image-forming station the photosensitive medium passes a charging device (7), which could, for example, be a corona wire or a charging roller, which is placed at a potential that puts charges on the photosensitive medium. The photosensitive medium next passes a light emitting device (8). This device could be a laser or a set of LED's or other light emitting components. The light emitting device (8) emits the light in a pattern that corresponds at least partly to the image to be formed in the colour of the print station. In another embodiment, the light emitted is the reverse of the image to be formed in that colour. The result of the light shining on any place on the photosensitive medium is that the amount of electrical charge on the place where the light is received changes, which results in an image-wise pattern of charges on the photosensitive medium called an electrostatic latent image.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">While rotating, the photosensitive medium (1) next passes an image-developing unit (3). The image developing unit (3) brings the toner of the colour of the image-forming station into contact or near contact with the photosensitive medium (1) in a development zone. In that development zone, the toner is in a charged state, resulting in an image-wise transfer of toner towards the photosensitive medium.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">While rotating, the photosensitive medium (1) next passes a toner image-collecting device (2) which it contacts. In the contact zone, on the other side of the toner image-collecting device, a transfer charge device (4) is placed so that the charged toner on the photosensitive drum is attracted towards the transfer charge device (4) and hence moves to<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the toner image-collecting device (2). The movement of the charged toner towards the transfer charge device is called electrophotographic transfer. The transfer charge device could be a corona wire, or a shielded corotron also known as a scorotron. Another embodiment uses a roller. An electric potential is applied to the transfer charge device so as to attract the charged toner thereby enabling it to be transferred from the photosensitive drum to the toner image-collecting device (2).</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">While rotating, the photosensitive medium typically can also pass a discharging device (6) to remove charge on the surface of the photosensitive medium and charge on the toner that was not transferred to the collecting device (2). The photosensitive medium next passes a cleaning device (5) that removes any residual toner from the photosensitive medium.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> exemplifies a colour unit (60) with two image-forming electrophotographic stations. A colour unit contains a toner image-collecting device (11) and at least one image-forming electrophotographic station (14), each in contact with the said toner image-collecting device. In the contact zone (16), a transfer device (4) allows the image to be transferred from the image-forming electrophotographic station to the toner image-collecting device. Having more image-forming electrophotographic stations has the advantage of having more colours of toner that can be used to form the final image.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Since each image-forming electrophotographic stations is in contact with a toner image-collecting device, putting all image-forming electrophotographic stations on a one toner image-collecting device requires the toner image-collecting device to become larger in circumference. This poses more challenges and higher cost to produce, and more difficulties to handle. Therefore the invention provides a way of having more image-forming electrophotographic stations without resulting in a toner image-collecting device that is too large.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">This results in a composite image on the toner image-collecting device that is formed out of the images produced by the image-forming electrophotographic stations.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">According to the invention, there are preferably at least two colour units, each with one toner image-collecting device. Each of the toner image-collecting devices is or can be in contact with multiple image-forming electrophotographic stations (14), each forming an image-wise toner image in a specific colour. Multiple image-forming electrophotographic stations can produce the same colour, but each image-forming electrophotographic station produces only one colour. That way, each toner image-collecting device collects the image of at least one colour, and collects the images of the image-forming electrophotographic<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> stations by electrophotographic transfer from the image-forming electrophotographic stations to the collecting device.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> shows a schematic representation of the transfer of three toner images, T1, T2 and T3 from a single toner image collecting device to the receptor material.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">One of the key aspects in the evaluation of print quality is the registration between the different colours making up the image. For a print engine with different print stations, one for each colour, the colours are inherently created at different moments in time, and are collected at either an intermediate medium, or at their final destination the receptor material (print medium).</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Once formed, there is no way of modifying the position of a colour: the trajectory up to the receptor material is considered as a known and fixed path. However, in reality, there are some influences that make the trajectory to the receptor material variable. In a time triggered printing principle, any speed variations result in positional differences of the colours. Moreover, if any intermediate transportation member or the final receptor material has a variable stretch status (or different tension) and then relaxes to the original stretch status, the position of the printed image on that receptor material also changes. In most cases the cause of the stretch is a force or tension. If this is the case, the result is a displacement, which is inversely proportional to the stiffness of the receptor material. An infinitely stiff receptor material would react to varying disturbance forces without changing the position of the colour image. Therefore, a print engine featuring several long image colour trajectories has preferably very constant and stable speed control, and consists of stiff components.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">With perfect speed and tension control of all components in the system any print engine concept could realize printing with good registration results. However, the effort required to arrive at that perfect speed and tension control can vary considerably from one print engine concept to another. The choice of print engine concept including process speed determines how much effort is required to achieve good registration results.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In the print engine concept it is very important to consider, which components in the system add most uncertainty. In the case of a print engine, it is clear that the receptor material applied by the user is not (or is less) perfectly known by the machine control, unless a multitude of sensors is used.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">A simulation study was performed of the influence of receptor material on the registration between two independent belts and the effect of speed-regulated and couple-regulated drive control at different process speeds using MATLAB® software from the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> company MATHWORKS. The problem was split into two parts: the dynamics of the rollers/belt/receptor material system; and the printing process.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">A time simulation was performed of the dynamics of the rollers/belt/receptor material system, driven by the motors and disturbed by e.g. a force, e.g. from a scraper, on a roll. The great advantage is that non-linear aspects, such as the limitations of the motors, can be added to the model. This provides the movements of the rollers as a function of time. At least as interesting are the modal analysis (vibration eigen frequency) and frequency analysis (Bode plots) of the systems obtained.

Registration is then obtained from the differences from the calculated positions for each individual toner (e.g. colour if a coloured toner).</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">A rough calculation of the effect of the stretching correction shows that an increase in tension of 10 Newton causes a stretching of 6 x 10<sup>-5</sup> in the belt and thus it takes 1/(6 x 10<sup>-5</sup>) = 16,700 scan lines at 1200 dpi = 35 cm for a pixel shift to occur. At a printing speed of about 30 cm/s this corresponds to frequencies lower than 1 Hz. Thus if a disturbance means (e.g. a scraper) applies a higher force over a period of several seconds, the time difference between the colours will result in an observable effect.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref> shows the effect of applying a force to the belt via a disturbance means, e.g. a scraper, on the position of the rollers. If a disturbance means is placed with a particular force on the belt, the tension in the drawn part of the belt between the drive and the disturbance means increases, the tension in the pushed part decreases. The difference between the increase and the decrease corresponds to the extra force of the disturbance means. The actual value of for example the tension increase in the drawn part partially depends upon the stiffness ratio of the drawn and pushed parts. The rollers in the drawn part will experience a quite immediate change in position, and this is greater as the distance to the drive increases i.e. Y colour will experience a greater drift than K colour.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">From then the belt runs further, but with a higher tension or stretched condition near the print stations. The lines there will, after renewed relaxation to the normal belt tension, come closer together than before the force was applied with the disturbance means.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">At the same belt location Y-lines and K-lines from other moments appear in which the K-lines experience sudden positional changes, the Y-lines were still printed in the<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> force-less period of the disturbance means. Thus a drift in the K-lines with respect to the Y-lines occurs.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The printing process proceeds under increased tension: This can be explained in two ways: either one compares the situation with the situation under normal belt-tension and then the K-lines become closer together or one compares the situation with the situation of the actual belt position, but then through the extra stretching the Y-lines become further apart.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">After three stations have been passed [Black(K)→Magenta(M)→Cyan(C)] a sudden shock in Y appears on the paper as a result of the Y-pressure being delayed at that moment (and more than the M drum), the lines are closer to one another. Thereby the registration returns to its original level, see <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 7</figref>.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">This effect of printing on a belt exhibiting varying stretching or tension condition over time, can be extrapolated to any transfer at different locations of toner or ink images constituting a complete print, to a receptor material that is flexible to some extent. The disclosure in the next paragraphs uses these analogies to compare different machine configuration.</p><heading id="h0010"><b>TWO SEPARATE BELTS:</b></heading><p id="p0082" num="0082"><figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 8</figref> shows a first (11) and second (12) toner image-collecting devices (seamless belts) with toners T4, T5, T6 and T7; and T1, T2 and T3 respectively in contact with a receptor material (13). For both toner-image collecting devices separately in contact with the receptor material, any registration between two colours that are printed on a different belt will be determined by the receptor material properties. A machine configuration suitable for an industrial market should also allow good registration performance with thin flexible foils. Therefore, a similar simulation is used to evaluate this medium impact on the registration in case of two separate belts.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">The physical model now consists of two belt modules, each connected in the transfer point to the receptor material as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 8</figref>. A speed-controlled motor drives the receptor material. Disturbance forces can be applied to the belts (representing variable disturbance means forces) and on the receptor material (e.g. force variations in the contact fusing system). The same reasoning regarding the registration as used above resulting in a requirement for a stiff medium, equally applies to the receptor material<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p id="p0084" num="0084">With a sudden increase in the disturbance means (e.g.scraper) force on the belt (or a variation of it over time), the tension in both the belt, but also the receptor material tension changes as through the electrostatic forces, the receptor material also pulls the belt. However, the large time delay between the print stations on the different belts, combined with the low stiffness of some receptor materials, result in a cumulative registration error build up. The registration error within belts is acceptable (10 µm), but with very flexible receptor materials, the registration between the belts, can be as large as 100µm, see <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 9</figref>.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">Changing the receptor material parameters to a more stiff medium (like cardboard), reduces considerably the registration error between the belts.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Another source of disturbance can be found in the receptor material itself. Though an accurate control system of the web itself is indispensible, it is interesting to evaluate the effect of the imperfections of that control system on the two-belt architecture. In the elementary simulation, a step-increase in the force of the contact fuser is applied. The result is a variation in the web tension, but different in each part of the web.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">The stress condition of the receptor material at the different belt-receptor material transfer points is also different. The effective distance between the lines becomes therefore different, and the registration error builds up continuously (see the formula (4) above). This is of course not realistic, but indicates an extra concern of the architecture with two separate belts, see <figref idrefs="f0009 f0010 f0011 f0012">Figure 10</figref>.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">The architecture with two individual belts in contact with the receptor material at different places is more sensitive in terms of registration errors to variations in web tension, or stiffness parameters of the receptor material, compared to an architecture where all colours are transferred to the receptor material in one single point.</p><heading id="h0011"><b>TWO CONNECTED COLLECTING DEVICES:</b></heading><p id="p0089" num="0089">The model has been used to model the effect of a configuration using connected toner image collecting devices, for example two connected toner image collecting devices. In such configurations transfer to the receptor material is confined to a single toner image collecting device. This means that the registration between the colours is already fixed as soon as the last colour is added to the last intermediate member. The final transfer step toward the receptor material cannot change anything to the registration quality; in other words, no variations in speed, tension condition in the receptor material can have any effect on the final registration.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p><p id="p0090" num="0090">The big advantage of the present invention is therefore its insensitivity to the receptor material properties (without any complicated sensors, actuators etc.) in combination with a limitation in the size, and hence increased manufacturability, of the intermediate collecting devices.

This cleaning ensures the toner image-collecting device is free of residual toner before a new image is transferred to it.

This cleaning ensures the toner image-collecting device does not accumulate toner on the inside.

This means there should be no large area where the image-collecting devices are almost touching. Such an area must be avoided because in such an area, the toner can be attracted enough so that it crosses the small gap between the toner image-collecting devices, and actually transfer over a certain distance, resulting in a disturbance of the image.</p><p id="p0140" num="0140">One way to avoid a larger area where the image-collecting devices are almost touching is to make the roller (220) on the inside of one toner image-collecting device substantially smaller than the roller (221) on the inside of the other toner image-collecting device.<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --></p><p id="p0141" num="0141">In another embodiment, such as that shown in <figref idrefs="f0015">Figure 15</figref>, the receptor material contacts a toner image-collecting device in a transfer zone, where the toner image-collecting device is below the receptor material during the contact zone. In this way, the receptor material leaves the transfer zone with a multi-colour image at a higher distance to the bottom of the machine. A higher distance has the advantage that with a roll (52) and possibly a second roll (53), where these rollers don't touch the imaged side of the receptor material, the material can be led to a fusing device (51). This fusing device does not add additional height to the machine since the receptor material has turned with the rollers. The fact that the rollers don't touch the imaged side of the receptor material is especially important since at that moment, the image is not fused yet, and any mechanical contact can disturb the formed image.</p><p id="p0142" num="0142">According to a preferred embodiment, there can be charging corona's (210) before the transfer from one toner image-collecting device to another. This can help to induce a more equal charge to all toner particles that are present on the toner image-collecting device, and result in a better image transfer.</p><p id="p0143" num="0143">In a preferred embodiment, there can be a charging corona (211) before the transfer from a toner image-collecting device to the receptor material (13).

This helps the image transfer to the receptor material with certain materials that contain e.g. a metalized layer. In such media, the layer that is metalized shields the toner on the toner image-collecting device from the transfer device (18), resulting in a poor transfer. To remedy this, an electrical potential applied to the roller (222) on the inside of the toner image-collecting device creates an electrical field that pushes the toner towards the receptor material, with a good image transfer as a result.</p><p id="p0145" num="0145">It is to be understood that although preferred embodiments, specific constructions and configurations, as well as materials, have been discussed herein for devices according to the present invention, various changes or modifications in form and detail may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention.
