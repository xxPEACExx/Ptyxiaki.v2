A typical ATV system includes ticket validation machines installed on board of the public transportation vehicles. They represent the Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) subsystems designed to reduce the human presence and to eliminate the fare evasion Each validation records the ticket ID, the location and timestamp. Alternatively, the ATV system can use the Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) subsystems to associate the validation with the bus line, stop identifier and direction.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The ensemble of ticket validations collected in an ATV system represents a valuable information for understanding the vehicle and passenger flows in the network. Data collected by ATV systems can be analysed in order to provide valuable insights for the transit and public transportation agencies and assist them in the decision making processes.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Public transportation vehicles (e.g., buses, metro, etc) are subject to diversion and delays due to a road traffic collision. If a bus is delayed, the driver notifies the Transportation Services Department via a communications radio in the bus. If the bus is equipped with an AVL system, it detects any delay beyond the schedule and informs the agency.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Automatic vehicle location (AVL) is an automated vehicle tracking system made possible by navigational technologies such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS). AVL is used for monitoring the emergency location of vehicles and fleet management.

In general, a transfer time sample can be analyzed from ticketing data that includes data indicative of a plurality of stops. An optimal set of stop pairs can be selected from among the pluraility of stops based on a plurality of factors including a coverage, a volume and a distance between at least two stops among the plurlaity of stops. A structural outlier associated with the transfer time sample can be then detected in order to detect traffic delays determined from the optimal set of stop pairs selected from among the plurality of stops. Note that such a structural outlier can comprise an outlier in a spatio-temporal series collected from the transfer time sample. Additionally, the ticketing data can include ticket validation timestamps.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Ticket validation timestamps can thus be employed an alternative source for traffic problem detection.

Instead of (or together with) an AVL system, ticket validation data can be mined for traffic detection cases.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Two main points are stressed here. First, ticket validation data is a massive dataset which can be used to track traveller activities. Ticket validation data represents an important source of information for PT traffic analysis and monitoring. Since all buses are equipped with fare collection systems, for example, they generate a massive collection of fare transactions with timestamps, which can be analysed for critical insights on bus ridership. Second, the disclosed embodiments can be complementary to AVL systems. In PT installations where AVL is not available or where existing AVL offers a partial coverage (not all buses/routes are equipped with AVL), the analysis of ticket validations can compensate the miss. As will be described in greater detail herein, under certain conditions, this analysis can produce statistically reliable insights about the traffic.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As will be discussed in further detail herein, traffic detection is presented as the structural outlier detection in spatio-temporal series produced by ticket validation timestamps. Using a simple example, a transfer time between bus stops can be identified as the core element for capturing both normal and abnormal episodes in bus rides. As will also be discussed in greater detail, some critical issues can be identified when configuring a robust and accurate detector. The stop selection can be formalized as an combinatorial optimization problem and a greedy algorithm can be utilled to solve such a problem in an approximative manner. Additionaly, implementation details and report simple evaluation for a Nancy dataset are described herein.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Before further discussion of embodiment details, it will be appreciated that the present invention can be implemented in a variety of different embodiments and contexts,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> such as for example, a method, data-processing system, or computer program product / processor-readable medium. Accordingly, the present invention may in some embodiments can take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, or in other embodiments, as an entirely software embodiment. Other embodiments can combine software and hardware aspects all generally referred to herein as a "circuit" or "module." The present invention may take the form of a computer program product on a computer-usable storage medium having computer-usable program code embodied in the medium. Any suitable computer readable medium may be utilized including hard disks, USB flash drives, DVDs, CD-ROMs, optical storage devices, magnetic storage devices, etc.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention may be written in an object oriented programming language (e.g., JAVA, C++, etc.) The computer program code, however, for carrying out operations of the present invention may also be written in conventional procedural programming languages, such as the "C" programming language or in a visually oriented programming environment, such as, for example, visual basic.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to a user's computer through a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), wireless data network e.g., WiFi, WiMax, 802.11x, and cellular network or the connection can be made to an external computer via most third party supported networks (e.g. through the Internet via an internet service provider).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The embodiments are described at least in part herein with reference to flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams of methods, systems, and computer program products and data structures according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the illustrations, and combinations of blocks, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general-purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions/acts specified in the block or blocks.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable memory that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable memory produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function/act specified in the block or blocks.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide steps for implementing the functions/acts specified herein.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1-2</figref> are provided as exemplary diagrams of data-processing environments in which embodiments of the present invention may be implemented.

Many modifications to the depicted environments may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosed embodiments.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the disclosed embodiments may be implemented in the context of a data-processing system 100 that includes, for example, a central processor 101, a main memory 102, an input/output controller 103, a keyboard 104, an input device 105 (e.g., a pointing device, such as a mouse, track ball, pen device, etc), a display device 106, a mass storage 107 (e.g., a hard disk), a USB (Universal Serial Bus) peripheral connection 109 and "other" components 111. As illustrated, the various components of data-processing system 100 can communicate electronically through a system bus 110 or similar architecture. The system bus 110 may be, for example, a subsystem that transfers data between, for example, computer components within data-processing system 100 or to and from other data-processing devices, components, computers, etc.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a computer software system 150 for directing the operation of the data-processing system 100 depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. Software application 154, stored in main memory 102 and on mass storage 107, generally includes or is associated with a kernel or operating system 151 and a shell or interface 153. The software application 154<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> can include a module 152 (e.g., software module). One or more application programs, such as software application 154, may be "loaded" (i.e., transferred from mass storage 107 into the main memory 102) for execution by the data-processing system 100. The data-processing system 100 receives user commands and data through user interface 153; these inputs may then be acted upon by the data-processing system 100 in accordance with instructions from operating system module 151 and/or software application 154.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The following discussion is intended to provide a brief, general description of suitable computing environments in which the system and method may be implemented. Although not required, the disclosed embodiments will be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a single computer. In most instances, a "module" constitutes a software application. Thus, for example, module 152 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> may be implemented as such a module and may include instructions for implementing the method(s) and/or approach described herein.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Generally, program modules include, but are not limited to routines, subroutines, software applications, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc., that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types and instructions. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the disclosed method and system may be practiced with other computer system configurations, such as, for example, hand-held devices, multi-processor systems, data networks, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, networked personal computers,, minicomputers, mainframe computers, servers, and the like.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Note that the term module as utilized herein may refer to a collection of routines and data structures that perform a particular task or implements a particular abstract data type. Modules may be composed of two parts: an interface, which lists the constants, data types, variable, and routines that can be accessed by other modules or routines, and an implementation, which is typically private (accessible only to that module) and which includes source code that actually implements the routines in the module. The term module may also simply refer to an application, such as a computer program designed to assist in the performance of a specific task, such as word processing, accounting, inventory management, etc.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The interface 153, which is preferably a graphical user interface (GUI), can serve to display results, whereupon a user may supply additional inputs or terminate a particular<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> session. In some embodiments, operating system 151 and interface 153 can be implemented in the context of a "windows" system. It can be appreciated, of course, that other types of systems are potential. For example, rather than a traditional "windows" system, other operation systems, such as, for example, a real time operating system (RTOS) more commonly employed in wireless systems may also be employed with respect to operating system 151 and interface 153.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1-2</figref> are thus intended as examples, and not as architectural limitations of the disclosed embodiments. Additionally, such embodiments are not limited to any particular application or computing or data-processing environment. Instead, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the disclosed approach may be advantageously applied to a variety of systems and application software. Moreover, the disclosed embodiments can be embodied on a variety of different computing platforms, including Macintosh, Unix, Linux, and the like.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Turning now to transportation systems, it can be appreciated that any delay in, for example, a bus ride can cause delays in passenger boardings and therefore delays in their ticket validations. The disclosed embodiments address the inverse problem. The ticket validation timestamps can be analyzed in order to automatically determine important bus delays due to incidents, congestions or other problems. The core element derives from observing the transfer time between two bus stops on a given route. Bus ridership is a complex spatial-temporal process and the transfer time between two stops is an object of unknown and unobserved factors. While a few validation timestamps may give an unclear and random picture, a large number of validations can be collected in order to analyze them and to build a robust detector.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">A number of factors can be considered with respect to the disclosed embodiments. First, important traffic problem results in a criticald deviation from the expected transfer time, and such deviation can be statistically measured. The deviation often concerns not one or two,bu tmultiple stops at the same time. The traffic cases can be treated as the outlier detection in the transfer time for stops affected by the delay.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In general, the traffic problem can be expressed as the structural outlier detection in spatio-temporal series produced by ticket validation timestamps. A transfer time between two bus stops can be identified as the core criteria for capturing both normal and abnormal episodes in bus rides. Additionally, above can be extended by identifying core<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> aspects to take into account in order to configure a robust and accurate predictor. These aspects can include, for example, the traffic volume between the stops and its regularity, the distance between stops and the coverage of the route by selected segments. Additionally the task can be defined as a a <i>selection of bus stop pairs</i> and expressed as a combinatorial optimization problem. Due to the NP-completeness of the task, a greedy solution to the stated problem can be provided, which is proved to be close to the optimal solution.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a group of graphs and charts to demonstrate tracking of transfer time between different stops, in accordance with the disclosed embodiments. The simple examples shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> includes graphs 301, 303 and histograms 305, 307. Graph 301, for example, illustrates a time-space chart for a bus line with 15 stops. It can be assumed that five of these stops (A, B, C, D, E) are equipped with AVL signposts (shown as vertical lines in graph 301). Graph 301 furth indicates three bus rides R1, R2 and R3, and straight lines that trace their schedule time, with additional lines indicating the maximal ride delay (for example, set to 10 minutes beyond the schedule). The real rides are also indicated. When the ride track crosses a line, a delay message is triggered. As the graph indicates, R1 and R2 rides went OK, while ride R3 triggered a delay warning at stops D and E. Graph 301 thus indicates a) Ride delay in AVL system, and graph 303 indiacates ride delay by mining validation timestamps. Histograms 305 and 307 indicates delays as outliers in transfer time. Graph 303 follows the same example, where the fare collection system is utilized instead of AVL. In this case, the schedule is not available, and ticket validation timestamps are recorded at all stops. In graph 303, validation timestamps are shown strips for all stops and rides.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The disclosed embodiments track the transfer time between different stops, provided by pas-sengers validating their tickets during the same ride. Histograms 305, 307 are transfer time histograms for two selected stop pairs, from 'c' to 'h' and from 'A' to 'i' (shown as segments in the diagram). To determine the delay in ride R3, two conditions should be satisfied. First, the delay should be observed as a deviation from the expected be- haviour. Second, such deviations should occur simultaneously in multiple stop pairs covering different segments of the route, including 'c-to-h', 'A-to-i' and others. Arrows in the distribution plots indicate delays as outliers in the transfer time.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The traffic detection problem can be defined as tracking abnormal behavior in the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> transfer time between bus stops along the bus route. The structured outlier detection can constitute the method where transfer time outliers are simultaneously caught for different stop pairs. For multi-stop lines, a number of stop pairs can be selected for the simultaneously outlier tracking. When selecting the pairs, the following issues can be take into account:</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Validation volume: Stops with dense validation volume are preferred to stops with low one, as they are likely to contribute in statistically reliable predictions;</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Distance: Tracking the transfer time between two remote or two neighbour stops can catch events of different granularity, on global and local level. It is preferable that both cases are represented in the selection.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Coverage: Sampling the transfer time between bus stops reflect both normal and abnormal events occurred within the corresponding line segment. Therefore, the selection of stop pairs should cover the whole line. No stop should remain without covering by at least one time tracking.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Quality control: When ADC generates erroneous timestamps making the transfer time between some stops out of utility. Therefore, those bus pairs which are allowed to contribute to the traffic detection problem should be assessed.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">As will be explained in greater detail, there are three main contributions to the method, namely, the quality control of transfer time samples, the selection of stop pairs, and the structural outlier detection on the selection.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The transfer time sample between stops si and sj is a collection of values t = t" - t' where t" and t' are validation timestamps at si and sj during the same ride, registered by different passengers. Given the transfer time sample, the quality control refers to checking if the sample induced by validation timestamps is consistent with struc- tural outlier detection. We use the normality test to reject cases when data can not be assessed and therefore deployed for the outlier detection. Specifically, the Lilliefors test of the default null hypothesis that the transfer time sample comes from a distribution in the normal family can be employed, against the alternative that it does not come from a normal distribution. In general, the Lilliefors test is a 2-sided goodness-of-fit test suitable when a fully-specified null distribution is unknown and its parameters must be estimated. The Lilliefors test statistic is the same as for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as indicated by Equation (1) below:<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> <maths id="math0001" num="(1)"><math display="block"><mi>K S</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>max</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">X</mi></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mfenced open="|" close="|" separators=""><mi>SC DF</mi><mspace width="1em"/><mfenced><mi mathvariant="normal">x</mi></mfenced><mo>-</mo><mi>CDF</mi><mspace width="1em"/><mfenced><mi mathvariant="normal">x</mi></mfenced></mfenced><mo>,</mo></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="103" he="23" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As indicated in Equation (1), SCDF represents the empirical cdf estimated from the sample and CDF is the normal cdf with mean and standard deviation equal to the mean and standard deviation of the sample.

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>, one bus line is processed in Nancy and transfer time distributions processed for 30 randomly selected stop pairs.
