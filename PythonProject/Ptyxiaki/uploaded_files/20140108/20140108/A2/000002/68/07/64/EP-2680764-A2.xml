More specifically, the present invention is directed to an apparatus and method for sealing a puncture site in the wall of a tubular tissue structure, or in the wall of a body cavity with a stabilizer used to stabilize the material used to seal the puncture site as the material is positioned. The material is inserted into the puncture site as a ribbon or sheet on an introducer element such as a needle, a cannula, a guide wire, an introducer element adapted for dialysis, an introducer element adapted for catheterization, a trocar, or any other introducer element used to access the lumen of a tubular tissue structure or used to access a body cavity.</p></abstract><description mxw-id="PDES51232624" ref-ucid="WO-2012118752-A2" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="2"/>--><p id="p0001" num="0001"> System and Method for Scaling Access The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for achieving rapid hemostasis in scaling a puncture in a tubular tissue structure or the wall of a body cavity. More particularly, the present invention is directed to sealing a puncture site with submucosal tissue or another extracellular matrix-derived tissue capable of remodeling endogenous connective tissue. </p><p id="p0002" num="0002"> The control of bleeding during and after surgery is important to the success of the procedure. The control of blood loss is of particular concern if the surgical procedure is performed directly upon or involves the patient's arteries and veins. Well over one million surgical procedures are performed annual ly which involve the insertion and removal of catheters into and from arteries and veins. Accordingly, these types of vasculature procedures represent a significant amount of surgery in which the control of bleeding is of particular concern. </p><p id="p0003" num="0003"> Typically, the insertion of a catheter creates a puncture through the vessel wall and upon removal the catheter leaves a puncture opening through which blood may escape and leak into the surrounding tissues. Therefore, unless the puncture site is closed clinical complications may result leading to increased hospital stays with the associated costs. To address this concern, medical personnel are required to provide constant and continuing care to a patient who has undergone a procedure involving an arterial or venous puncture to insure that post-operative bleeding is controlled. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004"> Surgical bleeding concerns can be exacerbated by the administration of a blood thinning agent, such as heparin, to the patient prior to a catheterization procedure. Since the control of bleeding in anti -coagulated patients is much more difficult to control, stemming blood flow in these patients can be troublesome. A common method of healing the puncture to the vessel is to maintain external pressure over the vessel until the puncture seals by natural clot formation processes. This method of puncture closure typically takes about thirty to ninety minutes, with the length of time usually being greater if the patient is hypertensive or anti-coagulated. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005"> Furthermore, it should be appreciated that utilizing pressure, such as human hand pressure, to control bleeding suffers from several drawbacks regardless of whether the patient is hypertensive or anti-coagulated. in particular, when human hand pressure is utilized, it can be uncomfortable for the patient, can result in excessive restriction or interruption of blood flow, and can use costly professional time on the part of the hospital staff. Other pressure techniques, such as pressure bandages, sandbags, or clamps 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 require the patient to remain motionless for an extended period of time and the patient must be closely monitored to ensure the effectiveness of these techniques. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006"> Other devices have been disclosed which plug or otherwise provide an obstruction in the area of the puncture. In current practice, submucosal tissue or another extracellular matrix-derived tissue is used to seal punctures in tubular tissue structures, such as blood vessels, or in the wall of a body cavity. The prior art method of placing the submucosal or extracellular matrix-derived tissue is described in U.S. Pat. No. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">6,790.220, which is herein incorporated by reference, a simplified version of which is reproduced in Figures 1 A- 1 D. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> An introducer 10 with a sheath 1 1 carrying a ribbon or sheet 12 f extracellular matrix-derived tissue is inserted through the skin, the underlying muscle tissue, and through the blood vessel wall. Ribbon or sheet 12 includes a cuff 14 and an extended length 15. The cuff 14 is usually situated and secured directly above a hole 13 in the sheath 1 1 , in which the extended length 15 is inserted. The outer diameter of the cuff 14 is greater than the outer diameter of the sheath 1 1 . As is also shown in FIG. 1 A, pull-up tether 16 is woven through the extended length 15 and pull down tether 18 is woven into the cuff 14 and both tethers are exposed externally. The introducer 10 is inserted until the greater diameter of the cuff 14 prevents further insertion of the introducer 10. The cuff 14 is then released so that it is free to move relative to the sheath 1 1 . The sheath 1 1 , is advanced as the cuff remains in position and the extended length is withdrawn from the interior of the sheath 1 1 through the hole 13. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> When the procedure is completed, the entry to the artery will need to be closed. As shown in Figs. I B- l D, the user pulls the tethers 16. 1 8 to bunch the ribbon or sheet 12 into a ball 15. When the sheath remains inserted, the ball 15 is held to the side of the puncture site by the sheath 1 1 . When the sheath is removed, the ball 1 5 moves into the puncture site, sealing the puncture site immediately. When the user determines that the patch completely seals the hole in the tubular structure, the tethers 16, 18 may then be cut and removed. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> This method of sealing a hole in a tubular structure has an excellent safety profile, but can suffer from inconsistent tether compression of the device. If the user pulls too hard on the tether, the ribbon or sheet may be pulled out of position to seal the hole. At the same time, if the user does not pul l hard enough on the tether, the ribbon or sheet will not be compressed sufficiently to effectively seal the hole. Even after the ribbon or sheet is compressed into a ball, by removing the sheath a space is created

 within the cuff. An incomplete mechanical closure of the hole may contribute to longer hold times being necessary to reach hemostasis. Some users advocate adding a "little" pull on the suture tether to further tighten the ball after removing the sheath, but it's success is very operator dependent and inconsistent. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> In addition, in order to determine when hemostasis has been achieved, the user must hold pressure externally on the skin over the puncture site and intermittently check for bleeding at the skin level. However, this method is not consistent in revealing what is actually going on at the rteriotomy site, sometimes very deep inside other tissue. This uncertainty can lead to hold times that are longer or shorter than needed contributing to hematomas or ecchymosis. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> Accordingly, there is a need for surgical techniques suitable for sealing punctures in a tubular tissue structure or in the punctured wall of a body cavity, such as a heart chamber, or a body cavity of another organ, that is more consistent between users and allows more certainty in determining hemostasis. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> The present invention provides among other things an apparatus and method for sealing punctured tubular tissue structures, including arteries and veins, such as punctures which occur during diagnostic and interventional vascular and peripheral catheterizations, or for sealing a puncture in the wall of a body cavity. More specifically, the apparatus and method of the present invention employ a stabilizer to allow more consistent sealing of punctures in tubular tissue structures, such as blood vessels, or in the wall of a bod cavity. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> it is an object of the invention to provide a method and apparatus for sealing a hole in a tubular tissue structure or in the wall of a body cavity. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> It is another object of the invention to provide an accessory stabilizer that may be used with existing devices used to seal a hole in a tubular tissue structure or in the wall of a body cavity. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> The above and other objects are achieved using a device involving an introducer element with a sheath, a stabilizer, and a ribbon or sheet of material having an extended portion and a cuff detachably coupled to the sheath. A tether is connected to the ribbon or sheet of material to manipulate the shape or position of the material. In a particular embodiment, the stabilizer is positioned about the sheath above the cuff, at a distance substantially equal to the length of the extended portion of the ribbon or sheet of material. This allows the sheath to be inserted the distance of the extended portion of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 the ribbon or sheet fully exposing the ribbon or sheet from the interior of the sheath before the cuff contacts the stabilizer. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017"> The stabilizer may be a length of hollow tubing that is detachably coupled to the sheath. The tether may pass between the sheath and the stabilizer. The stabilizer may further comprise a valve to selectively allow blood or other materials through the stabilizer. The stabilizer may alternatively be a ring integral to the sheath of greater circumference than the portion of the sheath below the ring. In a particular embodiment, the stabilizer is detachably coupled to the sheath such that tension on the tether detaches the stabilizer from the sheath. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018"> The sheath may be marked to indicate a distance from the end of the sheath to the mark substantially equal to the length of the stabilizer. In this way, the mark wil l appear above the stabilizer when the sheath has been removed from the puncture site. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019"> In another embodiment of the invention, a stabilizer is provided involving a hollow tube that is detachably coupled to an existing apparatus for sealing a puncture site in a tubular structure. </p><p id="p0020" num="0020"> The above and other objects may also be achieved using a method involving inserting an introducer with a sheath into the puncture site in the tubular structure. A ribbon or sheet of material and a stabilizer are coupled to the sheath, and a tether is coupled to the ribbon or sheet of material to allow manipulation of the ribbon or sheet of material. The ribbon or sheet of material has a cuff and an extended portion, the cuff being situated around the exterior circumference of the sheath and the extended portion initially residing inside the sheath entering through a hole in the sheath adjacent to where the cuff is coupled to the extended portion of the ribbon or sheet. The sheath is entered into the tubular structure until the wider cuff makes entry into the puncture site more difficult. In a particular embodiment, the cuff and the and stabilizer are removably coupled to the sheath to restrict movement of the ribbon or sheet and stabilizer during insertion. When the cuff contacts the puncture site, the cuff is detached from the sheath to allow movement of the ribbon or sheet relative to the sheath and the the stabilizer may be de-coupled from the sheath and contacted to the cuff to stabilize the cuff against the puncture site. The sheath is then further inserted into the tubular structure to expose the extended length from the sheath. The stabilizer maintains contact with the cuff as the ribbon or sheet is manipulated into a bal l position to seal the puncture site upon removal of the sheath. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 Once the ribbon or sheet is pulled into a compact ball, the tether may be locked in position. The sheath may be withdrawn, while the stabilizer remains in contact with the cuff to secure the cuff in position about the puncture site. The sheath may have a mark indicating to the user when the sheath has been removed from the puncture site. When the sheath is removed, the balled ribbon or sheet is pulled into the puncture site, sealing the tubular structure. In a particular embodiment, the stabilizer is a hollow tube and the user may hold the stabilizer in contact with the cuff and the puncture cite to ensure that bleeding has stopped at the puncture cite. This is particularly helpful when the puncture site is not visible within the body of a patient. If any bleeding is observed, the ribbon or sheet may be further manipulated with the tether to more completely seal the puncture site until a lack of bleeding at the puncture site is observed through the stabilizer. If desired, a thrombogenic material may be introduced to the puncture site through the stabilizer. </p><p id="p0021" num="0021"> Aspects and applications of the invention presented here are described below in the drawings and detailed description of the invention.

 catheter is introduced into the vascular system by first penetrating the skin, underlying muscle tissue, and the blood vessel with a needle, and a guide wire is inserted through the lumen of the needle and enters the blood vessel. Subsequently, the needle is stripped off the guide wire and an introducer 100 is fed over the guide wire and pushed through the skin and through the vessel wall to enter the vessel. The guide wire can then be removed and a catheter is fed through the lumen of the introducer 100 and advanced through the vascular system until the working end of the catheter is positioned at a predetermined location. Alternatively, the guide wire may be left in place throughout the procedure and the introducer 100 removed before the guide wire is removed. At the end of the catheterization procedure, the catheter is withdrawn. The introducer 100 is also removed and the opening through which, for example, the introducer 100 is inserted must be sealed as quickly as possible once the procedure is completed. A Ithough a typical catheterization procedure utilizing an introducer 100 is described, the described procedure is non-limiting. Furthermore any embodiment of the introducer 100 described below is applicable to any other introducer element for use in accessing the lumen of a tubular tissue structure or a body cavity in accordance with the invention. </p><p id="p0032" num="0032"> The present invention may be employed, for example, to rapidly seal a puncture site in a blood vessel upon completion of a catheterization procedure. The introducer 100 illustrated in FIG. 2 is an exemplary embodiment and has a user distal end 102 for insertion into a blood vessel and a user proximal end 104. A standard introducer comprises a dilator 106 and a sheath 108 which extends axially over the dilator 106, a sheath cap 1 10 disposed axially over a portion of the sheath 108 and a valve cap 1 12 connected to the sheath cap 1 10 and to a side port tube 1 14. Sheath 108 may be extended to accommodate particularly obese patients. A standard introducer may also comprise a three-way valve (not shown) and a syringe connector (not shown) connected to an end of the side port tube 1 14, adapted for the attachment of a syringe to the introducer 100 and connected to the valve cap 1 12. The introducer 100 depicted in FIG. 2 further comprises a stabilizer and a ribbon or sheet 1 18, that may be composed of submucosal tissue or another extracellular matrix-derived tissue. </p><p id="p0033" num="0033"> The ribbon or sheet 118 has an extended portion 120 which is inserted into a tubular tissue structure, such as a blood vessel, and a cuff 122 which remains outside of the punctured vessel wall. The cuff 122 extends about the circumference of the sheath 108 and the extended portion enters into a hole 123 in the sheath 108, and extends axially toward the distal end 102 of the sheath. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
 A stabilizer 124 is placed about the sheath 108 between the ribbon or sheet 1 1 8 and the sheath cap 1 10. Stabilizer 124 may included a knob, handle, or ergonomic protrusion 125 for the user's convenience in manipulating the stabilizer 124. The stabilizer may extend axially from the sheath cap 1 10 to the cu f 122. Preferably, the stabilizer 124 is separated from the ribbon or sheet 1 18 by a distance approximately equal to the axial length of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 and is detachably coupled to the sheath 108 such that the stabilizer 124 is initially immobile, but may be detached so that it is free to move in an axial direction relative to the sheath 108. The distance that the stabilizer is separated from the ribbon or sheet 1 1 8 allows the sheath 108 with the attached stabilizer 124 to move relative to the ribbon or sheet 1 18 such that the extended portion 120 is withdrawn from the hole 123 as the introducer 100 is inserted into the puncture site. </p><p id="p0034" num="0034"> The cuff 122 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 may initially be held in place, for example, by a wire attached to the cuff 122 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 and the body of the sheath 108, the sheath cap 1 10 or the valve cap 1 12. As a result, the ribbon or sheet 1 18 is prevented from being pushed up or down relative to the sheath 108 of the introducer 100 when the user inserts the introducer 100 through, for example, a vessel wall with his hand in contact with the ribbon or sheet 1 18. The wire may be coupled to the release tether 126, described below, or may be cut to allow the cuff 122 of the ribbon or sheet 1 1 8 to move axially relative to the sheath 108 and to be gathered externally to seal the puncture site. In other embodiments, the cuff 122 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 or other parts of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 may be held in place by metal or plastic clamps, O- rings, or the like, which ma be removed from the end of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 when it is necessary to gather the ribbon or sheet 1 18 externally to seal the puncture site. </p><p id="p0035" num="0035"> As also depicted in FIG. 2 and Fig. 3A, in one embodiment the extended portion 120 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 is initially situated inside the sheath 108 to prevent the ribbon or sheet 1 18 from rolling up the introducer 100 upon insertion into the blood vessel when the ribbon or sheet 1 18 is positioned during insertion into a blood vessel 140. Although the ribbon or sheet 1 1 8 is depicted inside the sheath 108 in FIG. 2, any configuration of the extended portion 120 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 can be used which prevents the ribbon or sheet 1 18 from rolling up the introducer 100 upon insertion into the blood vessel. </p><p id="p0036" num="0036"> The ribbon or sheet 1 18 may have one or more tethers 126, 128 attached at or near to the cuff 122 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 and a tether 130 attached at or near to the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="10"/>-->
 extended portion 120 of the ribbon or sheet 118. For example, one or more pull-up tethers 130 may be attached at or near to the extended portion 120 of the ribbon or sheet 118, and one or more pull-down tethers 128 may be attached at or near to the cuff 122 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18. One or more release tethers 126 may be attached at or near to the cuff 122 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18, and to the stabilizer 124. The function of the various types of tethers is described below. </p><p id="p0037" num="0037"> The pull-up tether 130 is attached to the ribbon or sheet 1 18 at or near the extended portion 120 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 and is woven axial ly upwards towards the cuff 122 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 (and thus upwards towards the puncture site). Thus, a portion of the pull-up tether is inserted into the blood vessel 140 when the introducer 100 is pushed through the blood vessel wall and a portion of the pull-up tether 130 remains externally exposed to be manipulated by a user. Upon completion of the procedure, such as catheterization, the portion of the pull-up tether 130 remaining externally exposed is pulled to gather the extended portion 120 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 into a compressed ball shape 127 adjacent to the puncture site as shown in Fig. 3. </p><p id="p0038" num="0038"> The pull-down tether 128 is attached at or near the cuff 122 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 and extends axially downwards between the ribbon or sheet 1 18 and the positioning tube 1 16 towards the distal end of the positioning tube 1 16. The pull-down tether 128 further extends radially inwards under the positioning tube 1 16 and then extends axially upwards towards the proximal end of the positioning tube 1 16. Thus, the attached end and the unattached end of the pull-down tether 128 remain externally exposed when the introducer 100 is inserted into the blood vessel wall. Upon completion of the procedure the unattached end of the pull-down tether 128 is pulled to gather the cuff 122 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 into a compressed ball shape 129 at the puncture site from the outside of the vessel wall as shown in Fig. 4. </p><p id="p0039" num="0039"> In one embodiment of the invention, a release tether 126 is attached to the ribbon or sheet 1 18. The distal end of the release tether 126 is attached at or near the cuff 122 of the ribbon or sheet 1 8. The release tether 126 extends axially upwards towards the proximal end of the sheath 108. The proximal end of the release tether 126 remains externally exposed. The release tether is pulled to allow the ribbon or sheet 1 1 8 to move relative to the sheath 108. The release tether 126 may also be coupled to the stabilizer 124, such that a single tether releases the ribbon or sheet 1 18 and the stabilizer 124 to move relative to the sheath 108.

 Preferably the present invention has one or more release tethers 126, one or more pull-up tethers 128, and one or more pull-down tethers 128. However, the invention may have any combination of pull-up tethers 130, pull-down tethers 128, and release tethers 126, or may lack one or more types of tethers. For example, the invention may lack a release tether 126 or a pull-down tether 128. </p><p id="p0040" num="0040"> Tethers with different functions (i.e., the release tether 126, the pull-up tether 130, and the pull-down tether 128) may have different indicia disposed thereon, such as different colors, so that the user can easily identify the tether with the desired function. Alternatively, tethers with different functions may have different caps attached to the externall exposed ends so that the tether with the desired function can be easily identified. The tethers are preferably made of resorbable thread and the tethers can be attached to the ribbon or sheet 1 1 8 by any suitable means. For example, the tethers can be tied to the ribbon or sheet 1 1 8 or hooked to the ribbon or sheet 1 18 by using hooks, barbs, etc. (e.g., for tethers with attachment points that remain externally exposed when the introducer 100 is inserted into the vessel wall). </p><p id="p0041" num="0041"> The present invention is also directed to a method of sealing a puncture site in the wall of a tubular tissue structure or the wall of a body cavity. Referring to Fig. 3A, the method comprises the steps of inserting an introducer 100 into the puncture site through the skin 142 with a stabilizer and a ribbon or sheet 1 18 having a cuff 122 and an extended portion 120. The cuff 122 of the ribbon or sheet 1 1 8 remains outside of the punctured wall and the extended portion 120 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 is inserted into the tubular tissue structure. Once the extended portion 120 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 has been inserted, the ribbon or sheet 1 18 and the stabilizer 124 is released to move axial ly relative to the sheath 108 by pulling the release tether 126. The stabilizer 124 contacts the cuff 122 and holds the ribbon or sheet 1 18 in position while the sheath 108 may be further inserted into the tubular tissue structure to expose the extended portion 120 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18. </p><p id="p0042" num="0042"> Referring to Figs. 3B-C, the sheath may be inserted until the stabilizer 124 abuts the cap 1 10. Tethers 128, 130 may be pulled to compress the cuff 122 and extended portion, 120 respectively, of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 about the puncture site while stabilizing the cuff 122 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 in position relative to the puncture site with the stabilizer 124. The user pulls the user proximal end of the pull-up tether 130 to gather the extended portion 120 into a ball shape 127 proximal to the puncture site in the blood vessel wall. The user proximal end of the pull-down tether 128 is also pulled to 
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->
 position the cuff 122 in a ball shape 129 proximal to the exterior of the puncture site as shown in Figs. 3C-D. </p><p id="p0043" num="0043"> Referring to Figs. 3D-E, as the sheath 108 is pulled out of the puncture site, the cuff 122 of the ribbon or sheet 1 1 8 can be held in place by the stabilizer 124. Mark 140 on the sheath 108 indicates that the distal end 102 of the sheath 108 has cleared the puncture site. The compressed balls 127, 129 of the ribbon or sheet 1 18 replace the sheath 108 in the puncture site to form a hemostatic seal in the puncture site. If some bleeding at the puncture site remains and is detected after the sheath 108 is removed, the tethers 130, 128 may be further tensioned while the stabilizer 124 holds the ribbon or sheet 1 18 in position to more tightly compress and more effectively position the ribbon or sheet 118 to effectively seal the puncture site. In a closed procedure, the stabilizer 124 couples the puncture site to the exterior of the patient's skin, and the user may visually confirm hemostasis at the artery by observing whether blood is expelled from the stabilizer 124. If bleeding persists, the user may exert more tension on the tethers as described above. In some embodiments, the stabilizer 124 includes a valve 125 to prevent blood from being expelled from the stabilizer. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044"> The exposed portion of the tethers can be removed by cutting. In the above- described method, the ribbon or sheet 1 18 can be gathered into the puncture site after, during, or before removal of any of the components of the introducer element. </p><p id="p0045" num="0045"> In one embodiment f the invention a puncture site is sealed in the wall of a blood vessel 140 in a patient undergoing catheterization. Although the use of an introducer 1 0 adapted for catheterization is illustrated in FIGs. 2-3. it is understood that the present invention is applicable to any type of procedure in which an introducer element is used to provide access to the lumen of a tubular tissue structure, such as a blood vessel, or to a body cavity. For example, the present invention is applicable to procedures in which an introducer element such as a needle, a cannula, a guide wire, an introducer element adapted for dialysis, a trocar, or any other introducer element used to access the lumen of a tubular tissue structure or to a body cavity is used.
