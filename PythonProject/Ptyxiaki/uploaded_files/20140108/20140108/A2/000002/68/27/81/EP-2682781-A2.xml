A laser radar device emits a laser beam ahead of a vehicle, and receives reflected light, thereby detecting an obstacle or the like ahead of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">A generic laser radar device includes a photoemitter that generates a pulsed laser light beam, and that scans the light beam in a horizontal direction; a photodetector such as a photodiode that receives the laser light which is reflected by the object in front of the vehicle, and that converts it into a voltage signal; and an optical receiver including an optical element such as a lens that guides the reflected light toward the photodetector. A distance between the vehicle and the object can be calculated by a time difference between a moment at which the pulsed laser is generated and a moment at which the reflected light is received by the photodetector.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Usually, a pulsed laser light is generated by applying a pulse-shaped driving current to a semiconductor laser diode, and the pulsed laser light is guided to an optical scanner that scans light in the horizontal direction through optical coupling element such as a coupling lens. For example, a polygon mirror or a galvanometer mirror has been used as the optical scanner. By scanning a laser beam by a mirror device, distance measurement can be performed across a wide range in the horizontal direction.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In addition to expansion of the range of the measurement in the horizontal direction, recently, there is a need for two-dimensional scanning, in which a beam is also scanned in a vertical direction, and there is a need for multi-line scanning (multi-layered), in which a measured area in the vertical direction is divided and a light beam is horizontally scanned.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As a means for achieving the two-dimensional scanning or the multi-line scanning, in general, a configuration can be considered in which scanning devices, scanning directions of which are different by 90 degrees, are connected in series, and beam scanning in the horizontal direction is performed and subsequently the beam scanning in the vertical direction is performed. As a means for more easily achieving the multi-line scanning, a method can be considered in which a tilt angle is defined for each of reflection planes of a rotational polygon mirror relative to a rotation axis of the rotational polygon mirror such that the tilt angles of the corresponding reflection planes are different<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> from each other. Additionally, as a means for enabling the multi-line scanning in which measured areas are different in the vertical direction, a configuration may be adopted in which more than one of photodetectors are arranged in the vertical direction.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As described above, for a laser radar device which scans a laser beam, a method has already been known in which, in addition to scanning in the horizontal direction, measurement is performed by dividing a detection area in the vertical direction.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Unfortunately, with a laser radar device according to related art, as a number of layers in the vertical direction increases, the cost is significantly increased and/or the size of the device is significantly increased.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">For example, when the configuration is adopted in which the plural photodetectors are arranged in the vertical direction, it may be required to prepare the photodetectors so that a number of light receiving areas of the photodetectors is equal to a number of layers of the detection area, which is divided in the vertical direction. For a laser radar device for a medium to long distance which is greater than several tens of meters, in general, an avalanche photodiode (APD), which has a high detection sensitivity, is used as the photodetector. However, an APD element is expensive. When the number of the light receiving areas is increased, the number of the APDs to be used is also increased, thereby increasing the cost. In addition, for the divided detection areas, it may be required to individually prepare detection signal processing systems, such as an amplifier circuit, and control is complicated. This can also be a cause of an increase in the cost.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">When the detection area in the vertical direction is divided by making the tilt angles of the mirrors included in the polygon mirror relative to the rotation axis to be different from each other, it may be required that a number of the mirror surfaces is greater than or equal to a number of the layers in the vertical direction. Thus, the size of the polygon mirror is enlarged. A problem is that it can be a cause of an increase in size of the whole device.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Patent Document 1 (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPH09274076B"><text>H09-274076</text></patcit>) discloses a configuration of a laser radar device which scans a laser beam. In the configuration, beam scanning is performed by a polygon mirror, which includes mirror surfaces whose tilt angles relative to a rotation axis of the polygon mirror are different from each other, so as to divide a detection area in the vertical direction into multiple layers.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The invention disclosed in Patent Document 1 includes a configuration such that the multiple areas, which are divided in the vertical direction by the polygon mirror having the mirror surfaces with the different tilt angles, are scanned by a beam.

The polygon mirror 3 is rotated by a motor 9. The motor 9 has a rotation axis 14 which is in parallel with a Y-axis. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, a light beam 13 scans an XZ plane in accordance with rotation of the polygon mirror 3. The light beam 13 emitted from the laser radar device is reflected by the detection target. The light beam 13 is guided to a photodetector 11 through receiving mirrors 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d, and a receiving lens 10. Then, the light beam 13 is detected as a reflected signal 7.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The light reflected by the detection target is reflected at a reflecting point in random directions. However, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>, only a light component which is reflected along an optical path which is the same as that of the light beam emitted from the laser radar device enters the polygon mirror 3 again. Namely, the beam which is emitted by the laser radar device and the reflected light are reflected by the same mirror among the mirrors 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d which are included in the polygon mirror 3. Further, rotational speed of the mirrors is very slow relative to the speed of light. A rotation angle of the polygon mirror 3 which corresponds to a time difference between a moment at which the emitted beam is reflected by one of the mirror surfaces 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d and a moment at which the reflected light is reflected by the one of the mirror surfaces 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d is so small that it can be negligible.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The reflected signal 7 is reflected by the polygon mirror 3 as a receiving mirror. The reflected signal 7 is a light beam that always travels in a direction which is perpendicular to the Y-axis, regardless of the rotation angle. After that, the light beam is condensed by the receiving lens 10 onto the photodetector 11. In this manner, by performing optical scanning and reception of the reflected light by rotating the scanning mirror and the receiving mirror by the common rotation axis 14, it is<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> possible to perform distance measurement corresponding to a predetermined angular range in a horizontal direction (on an XZ-plane).</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A light beam irradiation angular range in the vertical direction is defined by a beam flare angle in the vertical direction of the light beam 6 which is emitted from the laser radar device. The beam flare angle in the vertical direction depends on light emission width of the light source 22 and a focal length of the coupling lens 21. Accordingly, by controlling values of the light emission width of the light source 22 and the focal length of the coupling lens 21, the light beam having a predetermined flare angle in the vertical direction is emitted from the laser radar device. Since the reflected signal 7 from the detection target returns the receiving mirror 3 by traveling the optical path which is the same as that of the emitted light beam 6, the reflected signal 7 which is coupled with the receiving lens 10 through the receiving mirror 3 also has a flare angle in the vertical direction which is the same as the flare angle of the emitted light beam. Thus, the reflected signal 7 which passes through the receiving lens 10 is condensed at a position which is shifted in the Y-axis direction from the center of the optical axis on a plane on which the photodetector 11 is arranged, depending on an angular component of the reflected signal 7.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, by arranging a plurality of photodetectors 11 in a line in the vertical direction (the Y-axis direction) and detecting reflected signals by the corresponding photodetectors 11, measurement can be made in which the vertical direction is divided into a number of ranges. Here, the number of the ranges is the number of the phtodetectors 11. By controlling a detection width in the Y-axis direction of the whole photodetectors 11 and a focal length of the receiving lens, the angular detection range in the vertical direction is determined. By matching the determined angular detection range with the light beam irradiation angular range, and by detecting the reflected signals 7 by dividing the photodetector 11 into a plurality of detection areas in the Y-axis direction, multi-layer operations in the vertical direction are enabled.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Further, as a method of making a multi-layered detection range in the vertical direction, a method is considered in which tilt angles of the mirrors included in the polygon mirror 3 with respect to the rotation axis 14 of the motor 9 are set to be different from each other. By providing predetermined tilt angles to the mirrors of the polygon mirror 3, an emission angle in the vertical direction of the emitted light beam 13 is controlled, and each time the mirror surface by which the light<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> beam 6 is reflected is changed, a vertical output angle is changed. The reflected signal 7 is guided to the photodetector 11 through the receiving lens 10 by the reflection on the mirror surface, which is the same as the mirror surface which reflects the light beam 6. Since the beam irradiation range and the light detection area are defined by the tilt angle of the mirror, the detection range in the vertical direction can be multi-layered without increasing the number of the photodetectors 11.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">FIGS. 5 through 8</figref> are diagrams illustrating a basic configuration of the laser radar according to the embodiment. <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram showing a configuration of the laser radar, when the laser radar is viewed from a side. <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram showing the configuration of the laser radar in the XZ-plane including a line A1A2 of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram showing the configuration of the laser radar in the XZ-plane including a line B1B2 of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref> depicts the light beam 6 which is emitted from the laser radar device through the polygon mirror 3.

Thus, the reflected signal 7 which is returned to the laser radar device may be deemed to be parallel light. The reflected signal 7 is coupled with the receiving lens through the polygon mirror 3 and the corner mirror 4, and the reflected signal 7 is eventually guided to the photodetector 11, which is implemented on a photodetector driving circuit.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The polygon mirror 3 is attached to the motor 9 having the rotation axis 14.

The light beams 13a and 13b have corresponding predetermined flare angles 18 and 19 in the vertical direction. A value of the flare angle 18 of the light beam 13a is set to be the value which is almost equal to the angular detection range for one layer in the vertical direction.

An output angle of the light beam 13a is different from an output angle of the light beam 13b. A difference 20 between the output angles is set to be an angle which is almost equal to a detection angle of one layer in the vertical direction.

The number of the light sources 22a and 22b and the number of the coupling lenses 21a and 21b are equal to the number of the light beams. Light emission timing of the light sources 22a and 22b can be individually controlled. The light beam 13a is emitted by causing the light source 22a to emit the light by applying a predetermined modulation pattern by using the light source driving circuit.

During the first round, only the light beam 13a is pulse-emitted at a constant frequency. During the second round, only the light beam 13b is pulse-emitted at the constant frequency. Namely, emission timing of the light beam 13a and that of the light beam 13b are different from each other. Further, a pulse irradiation time period is limited to be within a time interval in which the light beam is projected within the angular detection range in the horizontal direction by the polygon mirror 3.

The configuration of the laser radar device according to the related art improves detection sensitivity by preventing ambient light from being guided to a photodetector by limiting a receiving range of reflected light by scanning by the polygon mirror. However, in order to obtain a sufficient light receiving amount, an area corresponding to one surface of the mirror may not be reduced. Thus, increase in the number of the mirror surfaces is directly linked to increase in size of the polygon mirror. Consequently, the laser radar device is increased in size, and the cost for components is increased.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In contrast, according to the embodiment, since multiple light beams are utilized, even if the number of the layers in the vertical direction is increased, the number of the mirror surfaces of the polygon mirror 3 is not increased.

Further, since the emission timings of the multiple light beams are different from each other, even if there is only one range of the photodetector, the detection signals of the multiple light beams are not interfered with each other. Accordingly, even if the number of the detection layers is increased, the number of the ranges of the photodetector is not increased.

The method of <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 14</figref> is the same as that of <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 13</figref> in a point that the emission timing of the light beam 13a and the emission timing of the light beam 13b are made different from each other. However, the method of <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 14</figref> is different from that of <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 13</figref> in a point that the two light beams are alternately emitted.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The polygon mirror 3 rotates, and first the light beam 13a and the light beam 13b are scanned by the mirror surface 3a. Here, a predetermined emission time difference is provided between the emission timing of the light beam 13a and the emission timing of the light beam 13b. Namely, by the scanning by the mirror surface 3a, Layer 1 and Layer 2 are detected almost simultaneously. Similarly, Layer 3 and Layer 4 are almost simultaneously detected by the mirror surface 3b, Layer 5 and Layer 6 are almost simultaneously detected by the mirror surface 3c, and Layer 7 and Layer 8 are almost simultaneously detected by the mirror surface 4. Therefore, all the eight layers are detected while the polygon mirror 3 rotates one round.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">According to the method of <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 14</figref>, the rotational speed of the polygonal mirror 3 may be a half of that of the method of <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 13</figref>. Thus, the rotational control becomes easier, and reliability in long-time driving can be improved.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Here, it is preferable that the time difference between the emission timing of the light beam 13a and the emission timing of the light beam 13b is greater than or equal to 3 microseconds. The reason is that if the time difference between the emission timings is too small, and if the light which is caused by the light beam 1 when the light beam 13a is reflected by an object in a distant place and the light which is caused by the light beam 13b when the light beam 13b is reflected in the vicinity of the laser radar device are mixed, the mixed signals may not be separated.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">For the laser radar device, when a difference between the time at which the light pulse is emitted and the time at which the reflected light is detected is denoted by Δt, the distance L between the laser radar device and the detection target is given by L = Δ t × c ÷ 2. Here, c is the speed of light. By the above formula, when the Δt is 3 microseconds, L is 450 m. For a vehicle-mounted laser radar device, the maximum distance to be detected is approximately 200 m. Thus, if the reflected light is<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> returned from a place which is located 450 m ahead of the laser radar device, the intensity of the reflected light is sufficiently small, and the reflected light beams caused by multiple light beams are prevented from interfering with each other.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Further, for a usual laser radar device, an emission frequency of the laser pulse is set to be within a range from 10 kHz to 100 kHz. When the emission frequency is converted into the emission period, it is within a range from 10 microseconds to 100 microseconds. Accordingly, it is preferable to set the emission timing difference of the light beams to be less than or equal to 10 microseconds.</p><heading id="h0003">[Example 3]</heading><p id="p0052" num="0052">In the embodiment, the multiple light beams are utilized. In an optical system included in the laser radar device according to the embodiment, it is preferable to arrange the light beams to be as close to each other as possible. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref>, when the two light beams are arranged in parallel in the horizontal direction, it may be required that each of the mirror surfaces of the polygon mirror 3 has a sufficient width to reflect both the light beams. Thus, when the space between the light beams is wide, the area of the mirror becomes large, and it can be a cause of increase in size of the device.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">When the number of the light beams is to be increased while the light beams are arranged to be as close to each other as possible, it is effective to perform beam synthesis. <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 15</figref> shows a situation in which the projected beam is propagating, when the two light beams are synthesized to be within a region of almost one light beam by the beam synthesis. Further, <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 16</figref> shows a specific example of a configuration of the light beam generator of <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 15</figref>.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">As an example, a method of achieving the beam synthesis is explained by referring to <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 16</figref>. Here, a case is considered in which the number of the light beams is two. The light beam generator 2 includes two light sources 22a and 22b which are implemented on a light source driving circuit 26; the two coupling lenses 21a and 21b; a half-wave plate 27; a polarization beam splitter (PBS) 28; and the corner mirror 4 that changes a traveling direction of the one of the light beams. In <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 16</figref>, the light sources 22a and 22b are implemented on the common light source driving circuit 26. However, emission control of the light sources 22a and 22b may be performed by corresponding individual driving circuits. Further, with regard to the optical axis of the light source and the optical<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> axis of the coupling lens, since the offset is provided in the Y-axis direction, the output angles in the vertical direction of the light beams 13a and 13b are different from each other.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The light beams 13a and 13b which are almost in parallel are generated by the corresponding light sources 22a and 22b, and the coupling lenses 21a and 21b. A polarization direction of the light source 22a coincides with a polarization direction of the light source 22b. Here, it is assumed that the electric fields oscillate in the Y-axis direction. As for the light beam 13a, when the light beam 13a passes through the half-wave plate 27, the polarization direction of the light beam 13a is rotated by 90 degrees, and the light beam 13a becomes a polarized light such that the electric field oscillates in the X-axis direction. As for the light beam 13b, the polarization direction of the light source 22b is maintained as it is, and the electric field oscillates in the Y-axis direction. When the light beams 13a and 13b enter the PBS 28, due to the difference in the polarization directions, the light beam 13a passes through the PBS 28, whereas the light beam 13b is reflected by the PBS 28. Consequently, the light beam 13a and the light beam 13b are synthesized, so that they become a single light beam on the XZ-plane.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The polarization directions of the two beams after the beam synthesis are different by 90 degrees. It is possible that, due to the difference in the polarization directions, the detection sensitivity of the laser radar device with respect to the projected light beam 13a is different from the detection sensitivity of the laser radar device with respect to the projected light beam 13b. In such a case, it is effective to make the synthesized two beams pass through a quarter-wave plate. After the synthesized two beams pass through the quarter-wave plate, the synthesized two beams become circularly polarized light. Consequently, the dependency of the detection sensitivity of the laser radar device on the polarization may be resolved.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">By performing the above-described beam synthesis, even if the number of the light beams is increased, the light beams are output to outside the laser radar device through almost the same path. Consequently, increase in size of the optical system can be suppressed. A case can be considered in which it is difficult to arrange the light sources or the coupling lenses to be close to each other, so as to improve the heat dissipation characteristic of the laser diodes, or to adjust the positions of the coupling lens precisely. In such a case, by performing the beam synthesis, a region where the light beams propagate can be narrowed down to be a region for almost one beam. Consequently,<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> increase in size of the optical system is avoided, and the layout of the optical system can be flexibly designed.</p><heading id="h0004">[Example 4]</heading><p id="p0058" num="0058"><figref idrefs="f0016">FIGS. 17</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0017">18</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0018">19</figref> shows an example of the laser radar device which adopts the beam synthesis. <figref idrefs="f0016">FIG. 17</figref> is a diagram showing the laser radar device which is viewed from a top surface. <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 18</figref> is a diagram showing the laser radar device which is viewed from a side surface. <figref idrefs="f0018">FIG. 19</figref> is a diagram showing the laser radar device which is viewed from behind.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The two light sources 22a and 22b emit light beams from a bottom surface of the laser radar device in the Y-axis direction.

The traveling direction of the synthesized light beam is changed to the minus X-axis direction. Subsequently, the light beam is guided to the polygon mirror 3 through corner mirrors 4a and 4b. Then, the light beam is emitted from the laser radar device as the light beam 6. The reflected signal 7 is guided to the receiving lens 10 through the polygon mirror 3 and the corner mirror 4a.

For example, when the number of the beams is two, it may be necessary to cover the angular range of 2.0 degrees in the vertical direction.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">It may be required that the receiving optical system is able to completely receive the reflected light from the horizontal and vertical angular ranges, which are defined in this manner. At the same time, in order to prevent receiving stray light and background light, it may be necessary to avoid setting the receiving angle to be too wide. The range of the receiving angle is determined by the size of the photodetector 11 and the focal length of the receiving lens 10.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">For example, when the size of the photodetector 11 is such that 0.06 mm in the horizontal direction, and 1.2 mm in the vertical direction, and when the focal length of the receiving lens 10 is 35 mm, the range of the receiving angle is such that 0.1 degrees in the horizontal direction, and 2.0 degrees in the vertical direction.

Thus, by setting the focal length of the receiving lens 10a, which condenses the horizontal directional component, to be greater than that of the receiving lens 10b, which condenses the vertical directional component, the effect of the positional shift during the lens position adjustment can be reduced. For example, when the focal length of the receiving lens 10a is 70 mm, and when the focal length of the receiving lens 10b is 35 mm, the size of the photodetector 11, which is required to achieve the range of receiving angle such that 0.1 degrees in the horizontal direction and 2.0 degrees in the vertical direction, is that 0.12 mm in the horizontal direction, and 1.2 mm in the vertical direction.

Further, in this example, the receiving lens 10 includes two cylindrical lenses 10a and 10b. However, the configuration of the receiving lens 10 is not limited to this example.
