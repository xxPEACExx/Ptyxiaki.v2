Such lateral displacement of the belt, if not corrected, would cause breakage or failure of the imaging process where the belt reaches the axial end of the roller and eventually slips off the belt support assembly.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">To address this problem, several techniques have been proposed which employ a belt tracking system connected to an axial end of the belt support roller to control the lateral position of the movable belt.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For example, there is known a belt tracking system in which a movable belt is entrained around a steering roller. The steering roller is equipped with a pair of rotary, slidable members each rotatably mounted to an axial end of the roller to define an inclined, conical interfacial surface therealong to slidably contact a stationary member. The system is designed to correct lateral displacement of the belt by tilting the steering roller as the slidable member slides against the stationary member along the inclined interfacial surface where the belt moves laterally outward to the axial end of the roller.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The inventors have recognized that, although generally successful, the belt tracking system that employs sliding contact between the slidable member and the stationary member for tilting the steering roller can fail to work properly where the slidable member occasionally separates from the stationary member due to an external force, such as, for example, tension in the movable belt stretched around the belt supporting roller.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">Exemplary aspects of the present invention are put forward in view of the above-described circumstances, and provide a novel belt tracking system for controlling the lateral position of a movable belt entrained about a plurality of generally parallel rollers for moving in a trans-axial direction perpendicular to an axial direction in which the rollers extend parallel to each other.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In one exemplary embodiment, the belt tracking system includes a roller shaft, a stationary member, and a slidable member. The roller shaft extends outward in the axial direction from an axial end of a specific one of the plurality of generally parallel rollers. The stationary member is fixed in position adjacent to the roller shaft to define a first interfacial surface therealong. The slidable member is co-movably coupled with the roller shaft to define a second interfacial surface therealong inclined relative to the axial direction. The slidable member is slidable against the stationary member along the interfacial surfaces to<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> cause the roller shaft to move in a direction perpendicular to the axial direction as the belt moves laterally outward in the axial direction. The belt tracking system includes means for pressing the slidable member against the stationary member to maintain continuous contact between the first and second interfacial surfaces.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The biasing means includes, for example, a stationary support fixed in position, and a swivelable member co-movably coupled with the roller shaft, while pivoted at a pivot point on the stationary support.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The biasing means may convert a resultant of tensile forces in the belt acting on the roller into a biasing force acting on the swivel able member to mechanically bias the slidable member against the stationary member.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The biasing force converted from the resultant force may exert a torque on the swivelable member around the pivot point, which in turn forces the roller shaft in a direction angled relative to a line of action of the resultant force.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The pivot point may be positioned opposite a point of contact between the first and second interfacial surfaces with respect to the line of action of the resultant force.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The line of action of the resultant force may be equidistant from two planes tangential to the roller, one being substantially coplanar with the belt surface immediately upstream from the roller, and the other being substantially coplanar with the belt surface immediately downstream from the roller.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">At least one of the plurality of generally parallel rollers may be displaceable to change the line of action of the resultant force, in such cases the pivot point may remain opposite the point of contact between the first and second interfacial surfaces with respect to the line of action of the resultant force changing upon displacement of the displaceable roller.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The biasing means may further include an elastic member connected between the swivelable member and the stationary support to elastically retain the roller shaft in position.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The belt tracking system may be operatively connected to each of two axial ends of<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the roller.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The belt tracking system may be provided to more than one of the plurality of generally parallel rollers.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Other exemplary aspects of the present invention are put forward in view of the above-described circumstances, and provide an image forming apparatus employing the belt tracking system.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">For example, the system may be incorporated in one of an intermediate transfer unit for transferring a toner image from a photoconductive surface, a conveyance unit for conveying a recording medium, and a fixing unit for fixing a toner image in place on a recording medium.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Other exemplary aspects of the present invention are put forward in view of the above-described circumstances, and provide a multi-roller assembly for supporting a movable belt including a plurality of generally parallel rollers about which the movable belt is entrained for moving in a trans-axial direction perpendicular to an axial direction in which the rollers extend parallel to each other, and the belt tracking system.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">A more complete appreciation of the disclosure and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein:

However, the disclosure of this patent specification is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected, and it is to be understood that each specific element includes all technical equivalents that operate in a similar manner and achieve a similar result.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, exemplary embodiments of the present patent application are described.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates an image forming apparatus 100 according to one or more embodiments of this patent specification.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the image forming apparatus 100 comprises a tandem color printer that employs four imaging stations, including first through fourth photoconductors 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d arranged in series, for forming toner images with four different colors: black,<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> magenta, cyan, and yellow. Since the imaging stations are of an identical configuration except for the color of toner used for image formation, features of the photoconductor and its associated imaging equipment described herein apply to all the imaging stations unless otherwise indicated.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In each imaging station, the photoconductor 1 is rotatable in a direction indicated by arrow B, while surrounded by various pieces of imaging equipment, including a discharging device, a charging device 8, a development device 10, and a cleaning device 12, with an exposure device 9 directing a laser beam L to the photoconductive surface, which work in cooperation with each other to form a toner image on the photoconductive surface.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Also included in the image forming apparatus 100 is an intermediate transfer device including an intermediate transfer belt 3 disposed opposite and in contact with the photoconductors 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d. The intermediate transfer belt 3 is entrained about a plurality of belt support rollers, including a driver roller 51 equipped with a suitable rotary actuator, as well as idler rollers 52, 53, and 54, aligned generally parallel to each other. As the driver roller 51. rotates, the belt 3 rotates in a direction indicated by arrow A in conjunction with the idler rollers 52, 53, and 54.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Four primary transfer rollers 11a, 11b, 11c, and 11d are disposed opposite the photoconductors 1a, 1b 1c, and 1d, respectively, via the intermediate transfer belt 3 to form four primary transfer nips therebetween, through each of which the toner image is primarily transferred from the photoconductor 1 to the belt 3. A secondary transfer roller 17 is disposed opposite the belt support roller 51 via the intermediate transfer belt 3 to form a secondary transfer nip therebetween, through which the toner image is secondarily transferred from the belt 3 to a recording medium, such as a sheet of paper S.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Additionally, a belt cleaner 20 may be disposed opposite the belt-support roller 52 to remove untransferred, residual toner particles that remain on the belt surface after secondary image transfer.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In the present embodiment, the intermediate transfer belt 3 comprises a looped belt composed of one or more layers of material. In the case of a mono-layered belt, the belt material may be selected from polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), polycarbonate (PC), and polyimide (PI). In the case of a poly-layered belt, the belt may be formed of a substrate of relatively rigid fluorine rubber, PVDF, or polyimide resin, with a smooth coating of fluorine resin deposited on the substrate.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the present embodiment, the belt support roller 52 located immediately downstream from the primary transfer nip in the belt rotation direction A comprises a tension roller equipped with a biasing member 52a that elastically biases the roller 52 outward, that is, away from other belt support rollers 51 and 53, so as to maintain proper tension in the belt 3 for effective imaging performance, such as, for example, conveyance of the recording medium S.

The laser exposure selectively dissipates the charge on the photoconductive surface to form an electrostatic latent image thereon according to image data representing a particular primary color. Then, the latent image enters the development device 10, which renders the incoming image visible using toner. The toner image thus obtained is forwarded to the primary transfer nip between the intermediate transfer belt 3 and the primary transfer roller 11.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">At the primary transfer nip, the primary transfer roller 11 is supplied with a bias voltage of a polarity opposite that of the toner on the photoconductor 1 (for example, a positive bias voltage where the toner assumes a negative charge). This electrostatically transfers the toner image from the photoconductive surface to an outer surface of the belt 3,<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> with a certain small amount of residual toner particles left on the photoconductive surface.

The slidable member 41 is positioned<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> axially outward from, and in contact with, the flange 30, so that the slidable member 41 may move in the axial direction Z along the roller shaft 6 as the flange 30 moves laterally in the axial direction Z, for example, upon lateral movement of the belt 3. A suitable rotation restrictor may be provided around the slidable member 41 to prevent the slidable member 41 from rotating together with the roller shaft 6.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The interfacial surface 41a of the slidable member 41 comprises any inclined surface, such as a planar surface, a conical surface, or the like, positioned around the roller shaft 6 to contact the interfacial surface 42a of the stationary member 42.

Thus, the flange 30 freely rotates around the roller shaft 6 as the belt 3 moves in the trans-axial direction to cause frictional contact between the belt edge 3a and the contact surface 30a. Also, the flange 30 freely moves in the axial direction Z along the roller shaft 6 as the belt 3 moves laterally outward in the axial direction Z to exert pressure from the belt edge 3a against the contact surface 30a.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Compared to holding the flange stationary in position, allowing free rotation of the flange 30 together with the belt 3 reduces load due to friction between the belt edge 3a and the contact surface 30a, thereby preventing damage to the belt 3 and abrasion on the contact surface 30a.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The contact surface 30a of the flange 30 comprises a generally planar, flat surface with a circular peripheral shape concentric with the rotational axis of the roller 52.

Such arrangement effectively prevents substantial displacement or walk of the belt, in which the belt reaches the axial end of the roller and eventually slips off the belt support roller.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">During operation, as the driver roller 51 rotates, the belt 3 rotates or moves in the trans-axial direction Y to in turn cause the steering roller 52 to rotate. As the belt 3 moves laterally outward in the axial direction Z along the roller 52, for example, due to a lack of parallel alignment between the belt supporting rollers, the contact surface 30a of the flange 30 contacts the belt edge 3a to prevent further displacement of the belt 3, thereby maintaining the belt 3 in its proper lateral position in the axial direction Z.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Where the belt 3 is in its proper operational position, the belt edge 3 a merely touches or slightly contacts the flange 30 with only a small contact pressure applied from the belt edge 3a to the flange 30, which does not cause the flange 30 to move outward in the axial direction<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> Z.

With the slidable member 41 thus descending, the roller shaft 6, which penetrates through, and therefore is co-movable with, the slidable member 41, is forced downward in the vertical, trans-axial direction X perpendicular to the axial direction Z.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">As a result, the steering roller 52, having its one axial end vertically displaced and the other axial end held in position, becomes tilted or inclined relative to other rollers included in the multi-roller assembly, as shown in FTG. 2B. Such inclination of the roller 52 eventually causes the belt 3 to move laterally inward to resume its proper operational position in the axial direction Z, as described below with additional reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGs. 3A and 3B</figref>.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref>, the belt 3 may experience lateral displacement due to a lack of parallel alignment between the two belt support rollers 52 and 53, the former being exactly parallel to the axial direction Z and the latter being slightly tilted away from the axial direction Z (i.e., having its left end closer to the viewer than its right end in the drawing). Thus, the belt 3 has its longitudinal axis angled at a clockwise angle α away from the trans-axial direction Y.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">At this point, where the belt 3 travels a distance D in the trans-axial direction Y, a given point on the belt surface moves by an amount D*tanα to one side (i.e., the right side in the drawing) in the axial direction Z.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B</figref>, as the lateral displacement of the belt 3 shifts the axial end of the roller 52 in the trans-axial direction X perpendicular to the axial direction Z, the roller 52<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> becomes angled away from parallel alignment (i.e., having its left end closer to the viewer than its right end in the drawing) whereas the roller 53 remains in its original angular position.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Note that the roller 52 is now tilted away from the axial direction Z at a greater angle than the other roller 53. This difference in tilting angle between the belt support rollers 52 and 53, that is, inclination of the roller 52 with respect to the other roller 53, results in a counterclockwise angle β at which the longitudinal axis of the belt 3 is angled away from the trans-axial direction Y.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">At this point, as the belt 3 travels a distance D in the trans-axial direction Y, a given point on the belt surface moves by an amount D*tanβ to the side opposite that to which belt displacement took place in the axial direction Z before tilting of the roller 52.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">As the amount of displacement D*tanα experienced by the belt 3 to one lateral side is cancelled out by the amount of displacement D*tanβ to the other lateral side, the belt 3 can remain within a desired operational position in the axial direction Z to allow for proper functioning of the imaging equipment.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">Thus, the belt tracking system 40 corrects lateral displacement of the belt 3 by tilting the steering roller 52 as the slidable member 41 slides against the stationary member 42 along their contact, interfacial surface 41a and 42a where the belt 3 moves laterally outward to the axial end of the roller 52.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">The inventors have recognized that, although generally successful, the belt tracking system that employs sliding contact between the slidable member and the stationary member for tilting the steering roller can fail to work properly where the slidable member occasionally separates from the stationary member due to an external force, such as, for example, tension in the movable belt stretched around the belt supporting roller.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGs. 4A and 4B</figref>, consider an exemplary belt tracking system in which a movable belt 90 is entrained around a steering roller 91.

The pivot point P remains opposite the point of contact Q between the first and second interfacial surfaces 42a and 41a with respect to the line of action R of the resultant force F changing upon displacement of the displaceable roller.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">Specifically, as mentioned earlier, the belt support roller 53 located immediately<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> downstream from the tension roller 52 in the belt rotation direction A comprises a displaceable roller that can be displaced relative to the imaging stations depending on a mode of operation in which the image forming apparatus 100 operates, including, for example, full-color printing mode and monochrome printing mode.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">For example, in the full-color mode where an image is formed employing all the four primary colors, the displaceable roller 53 is positioned in its first operational position relatively close to the imaging stations to cause the belt 3 to contact all the four photoconductors 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">Conversely, in the monochrome mode where an image is formed employing only the color black, the displaceable roller 53 is positioned in its second operational position relatively far from the imaging stations to cause the belt 3 to contact only the single photoconductor 1a, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6B</figref>.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">Thus, changing the operation mode of the image forming apparatus 100 involves displacement of the displaceable roller 53 relative to the steering roller 52, which in turn changes the angle formed by the tangential planes T1 and T2 along which the belt 3 extends immediately upstream and downstream, respectively, from the roller 52, resulting in a concomitant change in the line of action R of the resultant force F acting on the swivelable member 43.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">Note that, in the present embodiment, the pivot point P remains opposite the point of contact Q with respect to the line of action R irrespective of whether the displaceable roller 53 is in its first operational position (<figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6A</figref>) or in its second operational position (<figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6B</figref>).</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">Such arrangement allows the biasing mechanism 60 to reliably maintain continuous contact between the interfacial surfaces of the slidable member 41 and the stationary member 42 regardless of whether the image forming apparatus 100 operates in the monochrome mode or in the full-color mode, leading to more effective operation of the belt tracking system 40.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">For comparison purposes, and for facilitating a ready understanding of the belt<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> tracking system 40 according to the present embodiment, consider a configuration in which the pivot point P is not always located opposite the point of contact Q between the first and second interfacial surfaces 42a and 41a with respect to the line of action R of the resultant force F.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0007">FIGs. 8A and 8B</figref>, the pivot point P is shown located on the same side as the point of contact Q with respect to the line of action R where the displaceable roller 53 is in its first operational position (<figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8A</figref>), and opposite the contact point Q with respect to the line of action R where the displaceable roller 53 is in its second operational position (<figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8B</figref>).</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">In such cases, the resultant biasing force Fb is directed differently depending on the operational mode of the image forming apparatus, that is, away from the point of contact Q in the full-color mode, and toward the point of contact Q in the monochrome mode. That is, continuous contact between the interfacial surfaces of the slidable member 41 and the stationary member 42 would be lost where the apparatus operates in the full-color mode.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">By contrast, the belt tracking system 40 according to the present embodiment can reliably maintain continuous contact between the interfacial surfaces of the slidable member 41 and the stationary member 42, owing to the pivot point P remaining opposite the point of contact Q with respect to the line of action R even where the displaceable roller 53 is displaced, for example, upon a change in the operational mode of the image forming apparatus 100.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">Referring back to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGs. 6A and 6B</figref>, the belt tracking system 40 is shown further including an elastic member 45 connected between the swivelable member 42 and the stationary support 46 to elastically retain the roller shaft 6 in position.</p><p id="p0105" num="0105">In the present embodiment, the elastic member 45 comprises a coil spring disposed in tension between the stationary support 46 and the swivelable member 43. Alternatively, instead of a coil spring, the elastic member 45 may be configured as any suitable elastic<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> material, such as a leaf spring, a rubber band, or the like.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">During operation, where the roller shaft 6 moves downward in the vertical, trans-axial direction X for correcting the lateral position of the belt 3, the swivelable member 43 rotates in a first rotational direction M1, counterclockwise in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGs. 6A and 6B</figref>, around the pivot 43a.</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">As rotation of the swivelable member 43 causes the elastic member 45 to stretch, the resultant elastic force, which opposes the change in length of the elastic member 45, causes the swivelable member 43 to rotate backward in a second rotational direction M2, clockwise in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGs. 6A and 6B</figref>, around the pivot 43a.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">Thus, with the elastic member 45 connected between the swivelable member 43 and the stationary support 46, the roller shaft 6, which is co-movable with the swivelable member 43, tends to move upward after being displaced downward in the trans-axial direction X. Such elastic retention of the roller shaft 6 prevents the slidable member 41 from falling off the stationary member 42 due to tension in the belt 3, leading to continuous contact between the interfacial surfaces 41a and 42a of the slidable member 41 and the stationary member 42, which allows for more reliable operation of the belt tracking system 40.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">Although a particular configuration has been illustrated, the belt tracking system 40 according to this patent specification may be configured otherwise than that described herein. For example, instead of providing the belt tracking system 40 to only one axial end of a specific roller, the belt tracking system 40 may be operatively connected to each of two axial ends of the roller. Further, the belt tracking system 40 may be provided to more than one of the plurality of generally parallel rollers about which the movable belt is entrained.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">Moreover, the belt tracking system 40 may be employed in any type of imaging equipment incorporating a multi-roller belt support assembly, such as an intermediate transfer unit for transferring a toner image from a photoconductive surface, a conveyance unit for conveying a recording medium, and a fixing unit for fixing a toner image in place on a<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> recording medium, included in the image forming apparatus, such as a photocopier, facsimile machine, printer, plotter, or multifunctional machine incorporating several of these features.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">In each of those alternative embodiments, various beneficial effects may be obtained owing to provision of the biasing mechanism 60 and other aspects of the belt tracking system 40 according to this patent specification.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">Numerous additional modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the disclosure of this patent specification may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982115" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A belt tracking system (40) for controlling the lateral position of a movable belt (3) entrained about a plurality of generally parallel rollers (51, 52, 53, 54) for moving in a trans-axial direction (X, Y) perpendicular to an axial direction (Z) in which the rollers (51, 52, 53, 54) extend parallel to each other, the system (40) including:
