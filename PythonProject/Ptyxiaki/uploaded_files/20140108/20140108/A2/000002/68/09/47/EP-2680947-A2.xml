Some swing adsorption processes are performed in a plurality of adsorbent beds, each within its own vessel.

However, such designs are generally not desirable for large scale operations that require large diameter adsorbent beds or where a small footprint is critical, such as on off-shore platforms or in arctic or desert environments. Therefore, there is a need in the art for swing adsorption apparatus that can be used for large scale gas separations and which occupy a small footprint. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> [0006] In accordance with the present invention there is provided an adsorbent bed system comprising: (a) a first bed of adsorbent material capable of selectively removing a target gas from a gaseous mixture, which adsorbent bed is substantially cylindrical shape; and (b) a second bed of adsorbent material capable of selectively removing a target gas from a gaseous mixture, which second adsorbent bed has a substantially cylindrical shape and being disposed about the first bed of adsorbent material and is substantially the same cross- sectional area as the cross-sectional area of the first adsorbent bed. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> [0007] In a preferred embodiment, a third bed of adsorbent bed material capable of selectively removing a target gas from a gaseous mixture and being substantially annular in shape and being disposed about the second bed of adsorbent material, the third bed of adsorbent material having approximately the same cross-sectional area as the cross-sectional area of the first and second beds of adsorbent material. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> [0008] In another preferred embodiment, a fourth bed of adsorbent material which has selectivity to a target gas in a gaseous mixture and having a substantially cylindrical shape and being disposed about the third bed of adsorbent material, the fourth bed of adsorbent material having approximately the same cross-sectional area as the cross-sectional area of the first, second and third beds of adsorbent material.

 [0015] Other applications in the technical area include U.S. Patent Application Nos. 61/447,806, 61/447,812, 61/447,824, 61/447,848, 61/447,869, 61/447,835, and 61/447,877, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. </p><p id="p0021" num="0021"> [0016] The present invention relates to compact configurations for swing adsorption equipment suitable for use at remote locations where space is at a premium. For example, there is a great need for compact equipment designs for equipment used on off-shore platforms. Any swing adsorption equipment used off-shore should fit within a defined compact space allotted to it on the platform. The only conventional swing adsorption systems that can presently be used off-shore are systems containing only a few relatively small adsorbent beds capable of processing only a relatively small volume of feed gas. Consequently, large volumes of gases to be separated typically cannot be performed offshore. The present invention allows for smaller swing adsorption equipment sizes, but without any appreciable sacrifice to performance capacity when compared to conventional swing adsorption equipment of comparable performance capacity. The present invention incorporates a compact design for multiple adsorbent beds that can be encased in a single vessel to form the adsorbent bed unit, each bed sharing a common actuator system with the other beds of the vessel. All vessel walls in the concentric arrangements are preferably of suitable thickness to withstand pressures in the range of 100 bar to 200 bar. The vessel walls are preferably multi-layered to facilitate drop-in or change-out of adsorbent beds, as well as for increasing durability for cyclic pressure swing conditions. These wall may be cylindrically shapped or other suitable geometric shapes. The vessels walls can also be suitably corrugated or stiffened in sections by any conventional means known in art. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022"> [0017] Non-limiting swing adsorption processes include pressure swing adsorption (PSA), vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA), temperature swing adsorption (TSA), partial pressure swing adsorption (PPSA), rapid cycle pressure swing adsorption (RCPSA), rapid cycle thermal swing adsorption (RCTSA), rapid cycle partial pressure swing adsorption (RCPPSA), as well as combinations of these processes such as pressure/ temperature swing adsorption. </p><p id="p0023" num="0023"> [0018] PSA processes rely on the phenomenon of gases being more readily adsorbed within the pore structure or free volume of an adsorbent material when the gas is under pressure, i.e., the higher the gas pressure, the greater the amount readily-adsorbed gas adsorbed. When the pressure is reduced, the adsorbed component is released, or desorbed. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 Accordingly, the process may include one or more of these steps to separate certain gases from a stream. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024"> [0019] PSA processes may be used to separate gases of a gas mixture because different gases tend to fill the micropore of the adsorbent to different extents. If a gas mixture, such as natural gas, is passed under pressure through a vessel containing a polymeric or microporous adsorbent that is more selective towards carbon dioxide than it is for methane, at least a portion of the carbon dioxide is selectively adsorbed by the adsorbent, and the gas exiting the vessel is enriched in methane. When the adsorbent reaches the end of its capacity to adsorb carbon dioxide, it is regenerated by reducing the pressure, thereby releasing the adsorbed carbon dioxide. The adsorbent is then typically purged and repressurized and ready for another adsorption cycle. </p><p id="p0025" num="0025"> [0020] TSA processes rely on the phenomenon that gases at lower temperatures are more readily adsorbed within the pore structure or free volume of an adsorbent material compared to higher temperatures, i.e., when the temperature of the adsorbent is increased, the adsorbed gas is released, or desorbed. By cyclically swinging the temperature of an adsorbent bed, TSA processes can be used to separate gases in a mixture when used with an adsorbent that is selective for one or more of the components of a gas mixture. </p><p id="p0026" num="0026"> [0021] Swing adsorption processes typically take place in a vessel containing one or more adsorbent beds. In multi-bed systems, each adsorbent bed may undergo a different step in an adsorption cycle, such as an adsorption step, one or more depressurization/desorption steps, one or more blow-down steps, and one or more repressurization steps. The flow of fluid to and from each bed is typically controlled by either a poppet valve and/or a rotary valve assembly. </p><p id="p0027" num="0027"> [0022] Any suitable adsorbent bed material that can be used for the separation of a target gas from a gaseous mixture can be used for the adsorbent bed system of the present invention. The adsorbent is typically comprised of an adsorbent material supported on a non- adsorbent support, or contactor. Non-limiting examples of the form of the adsorbent bed of the present invention include beds of: beaded or pelletized adsorbent particles; an adsorbent material on a structured contactor, such as a parallel channel contactor. Preferred structured contactors may contain substantially parallel flow channels wherein 20 volume percent, preferably 15 volume percent or less of the open pore volume of the contactor, excluding the flow channels, is in pores greater than about 20 angstroms. Flow channels, as used herein, 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
 means that portion of the contactor in which gas flows when a steady state pressure difference is applied between the point, or place, at which a feed stream enters the contactor and the point, or place, at which a product stream leaves the contactor. In a parallel channel contactor, the adsorbent is typically incorporated into or onto the wall of the flow channel. Non-limiting examples of geometric shapes of parallel channel contactors include various shaped monoliths having a plurality of substantially parallel channels extending from one end of the monolith to the other; a plurality of tubular members, stacked layers of adsorbent sheets with and without spacers between each sheet; multi-layered spiral rolls, spiral wound adsorbent sheets, bundles of hollow fibers, as well as bundles of substantially parallel solid fibers. "Parallel channel contactors" are defined as a subset of adsorbent contactors comprising structured (engineered) adsorbents in which substantially parallel flow channels are incorporated into the adsorbent structure. Parallel flow channels are described in detail in United States Patent Applications US 2008/0282892 and US 2008/0282886, both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. These flow channels may be formed by a variety of means and in addition to the adsorbent material, the adsorbent structure can contain items such as, but not limited to, support materials, heat sink materials, void reduction components, and heating/cooling passages. </p><p id="p0028" num="0028"> [0023] In preferred embodiments, adsorbent materials that can be used include high surface area (&gt;10 meters squared per gram (m<sup>2</sup>/gm) and preferably &gt;75 m<sup>2</sup>/gm) alumina, microporous zeolites (preferably zeolites with particle sizes &lt; 1 millimeter (mm)), other microporous materials, mesoporous materials and ordered mesoporous materials. Non- limiting examples of these materials include carbons, cationic zeolites, high silica zeolites, highly siliceous ordered mesoporous materials, sol gel materials, ALPO materials (microporous and mesoporous materials containing predominantly aluminum phosphorous and oxygen), SAPO materials (microporous and mesoporous materials containing predominantly silicon aluminum phosphorous and oxygen), MOF materials microporous and mesoporous materials comprised of a metal organic framework) and ZIF materials (microporous and mesoporous materials comprised of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks).

 adsorption equipment 10 showing the need for two separate adsorption vessels 12, 14. Each vessel contains an adsorbent bed of adsorbent material. Each vessel 12, 14 requires its own actuator assembly and fluid communication conduits A, D, E between vessels. Also shown bordering this figure is a footprint 20 of the space such a conventional system requires. In contrast to this conventional two adsorbent bed system is the adsorbent bed structure of the present invention shown in Figure 2 hereof. Figure 2 shows a first bed 22 at the core of a vessel with a second bed 24 forming a ring about the first adsorbent bed 22 (e.g., may be annularly positioned). The border of Figure 2 also shows a footprint 26 for this two adsorbent bed system, which footprint 26 is about 40% less than the footprint 20 required for the conventional two adsorbent bed system shown in Figure 1. The second adsorbent bed 24, which may have the same adsorbent material as the first bed 22, has the same face cross- sectional area of first bed 22. Therefore, second bed 24 has the same capacities/production (for the same cycle and flow rates) as first bed 22. The first adsorbent bed 22 and the second adsorbent bed 24 may be separated by a material that is non-permeable to the gas flowing through the adsorbent beds. This prevents the leakage of gas from one adsorbent bed to the other. </p><p id="p0030" num="0030"> [0025] Figures 3 and 4 are similar to Figures 1 and 2, but these figures compare a four bed system for conventional swing adsorption technology and that of the present invention. Referring to Figure 3, each vessel 30, 32, 34 and 36 contains a bed of adsorbent material. Each vessel 30, 32, 34 and 36 requires its own actuator assembly and fluid communication conduits between vessels. For simplicity purposes, the entire conduit system for communication between the four vessels is not shown. Also, shown bordering this figure is a footprint 38 of the space such a conventional system requires. In contrast to this conventional four adsorbent bed, is the adsorbent bed system of the present invention shown in Figure 4. Figure 4 shows a first adsorbent bed 40 at the core of a vessel with a second adsorbent bed 42 forming a ring (e.g., annularly positioned) about the first adsorbent bed 40. About the second adsorbent bed 42 is a third adsorbent bed 44 annularly positioned, or forming a ring, about the second adsorbent bed 42. About the third adsorbent bed 44 is a fourth adsorbent bed 46 annularly positioned, about the third adsorbent bed 44. Each adsorbent bed may preferably be separated from the other beds by a material that is non-permeable to the gas flowing through it to prevent leakage to other adsorbent beds and to contain pressure within the respective beds. The border of Figure 4 also shows a footprint 48 for this four adsorbent bed system, which footprint 48 is approximately 50 % less than the footprint 38 required for a

 convention four adsorbent bed system shown in Figure 3. The second adsorbent bed 42, the third adsorbent bed 44 and the fourth adsorbent bed 46 have substantially the same face cross-sectional area as the first adsorbent bed 40. Therefore, each of the second adsorbent bed 42, the third adsorbent bed 44 and the fourth adsorbent bed 46 have the same capacities or production (for the same cycle and flow rates) as the first adsorbent bed 40. It is noted that the drawings are not drawn to scale, and that the second adsorbent bed 42 has a larger radial dimension than the third adsorbent bed 44. Likewise, the third adsorbent bed 44 has a larger radial dimension than the fourth adsorbent bed 46. One skilled in the art readily recognizes that more than four beds can be used in accordance with the present invention. Any additional beds may have the same face cross-sectional area as the first bed 40. </p><p id="p0031" num="0031"> [0026] Again, it can be seen that the adsorbent bed configurations of the present invention require a substantially smaller footprint than a conventional swing adsorption system comprised of the same number of adsorbent beds, each requiring its own actuator system. </p><p id="p0032" num="0032">[0027] Figure 5 is a perspective representation of a cross-section of a four adsorbent bed system of the present invention. This representation shows that the size of the system may be further reduced because multiple poppet valves 52 can share the same actuator drive apparatus 50, as opposed to conventional systems that require a separate actuator drive for each adsorbent bed. It is noted that only a few drives are sketched in Figure 5 for clarity. This feature also allows for better gas distribution since additional ports can be distributed around the annular regions. </p><p id="p0033" num="0033"> [0028] The direction of flow of the gas streams through the different adsorbent beds may be configured to facilitate transfer of heat between the adsorbent beds. For example, the direction of gas flow in beds 1 and 3 could be opposite to the direction of gas flow in beds 2 and 4. </p><p id="p0034" num="0034"> [0029] Practice of the present invention also has the advantages of: reduced equipment weight and complexity; more efficient manufacture and assembly of the adsorbent beds; and maintaining uniformity and identical nature of each bed, which are important to separation performance. If structured materials are used for the adsorbent beds of the present invention their assembly is facilitated by the multiple/distributed concentric shapes. For example, in spiral wound structures, each concentric shell provides the core around which the spiral winding for each bed can be initiated, but it is difficult to maintain a proper tension during

 spiral winding of large-diameter conventional, (non-annular) cross-section vessels. For monolithic structures as well, the processes of forming uniform structures, are greatly improved when a single structure is made, rather than when separate structures are independently made. Accordingly, by using a single block of material, the multiple vessels are assembled in-situ by suitable introduction of the successive vessels walls, taking advantage of the configuration provided by the present invention. One preferred way of assembling the multiple adsorbent bed system of the present invention is to place annular grooves into an adsorbent monolith and sliding annular rings of impermeable material into the grooves running the length of the monolith material. </p><p id="p0035" num="0035">[0030] Adsorptive kinetic separation processes, apparatus, and systems, as described above, are useful for development and production of hydrocarbons, such as gas and oil processing.

The non-protogenic nitrogenous compound selectively reacts with at least a portion of the H2S in the feed gas mixture. Examples of suitable porous solid supports include activated charcoal or solid oxides (including mixed oxides), such as alumina, silica, silica-alumina or acidic or non-acidic zeolites. The basic non-protogenic nitrogenous compound may simply be physically sorbed on the support material (e.g. by impregnation or bonded with or grafted onto it by chemical reaction with the base itself or a precursor or derivative in which a substituent group provides the site for reaction with the support material in order to anchor the sorbent species onto the support). Bonding is not, however, required for an effective solid phase sorbent material. Support materials which contain reactive surface groups, such as the silanol groups found on zeolites and the M41 S silica oxides are capable of reacting with siloxane groups in compounds, such as trimethoxysilylpropyldimethylamine.

A wide variety of basic nitrogen-containing compounds may be used as the essential sorbent. If desired, a combination of such compounds may be used. The requirement for the desired selectivity for H<sub>2</sub>S adsorption is that the nitrogenous groups be non-protogenic, that is, incapable of acting as a proton donor. The nitrogenous groups therefore do not contain an acidic, dissociable hydrogen atom, such as nitrogen in a primary or secondary amine. It is not required that the whole compound be aprotic, only that the nitrogen- containing groups in the compound be non-protogenic. Non-protogenic nitrogen species cannot donate an H<sup>+</sup> (proton), which is a prerequisite for the formation of carbamates as a route for the CO2 chemisorption reaction in the absence of water; they are non- nucleophilic under the prevailing reaction conditions.

Favorable adsorbent kinetics may be realized by, while limiting bed pressure drop to acceptable values, utilizing parallel channel contactors wherein the feed and purge gases are confined to a plurality of very narrow (1000 to 30 micron diameter) open channels that are lined to an effective thickness of the adsorbent material. </p><p id="p0062" num="0062"> By "effective thicknesses", we mean a range of about 500 microns to 5 microns for most applications.

 By "internal temperature control", we mean the use of a heating and cooling fluid media, either gaseous or liquid, preferably liquid, that can be circulated through the same adsorbent lined channels that are utilized for the gaseous feed flow. Internal temperature control requires that the adsorbent material not be adversely affected by the temperature control fluid and that the temperature control fluid be easily separated from the previously adsorbed species (H<sub>2</sub>S and CO<sub>2</sub>) following the heating step. Further, for internal temperature control, the pressure drop across each of the parallel channels in the structured bed during the gaseous feed adsorption step is preferably sufficiently high to clear each channel (or the single channel in the case of spiral wound designs) of the temperature control fluid. Additionally, internal fluid flow temperature designs preferably utilizes an adsorbent that does not strongly adsorb the temperature control fluid so that H<sub>2</sub>S and CO<sub>2</sub> may be usefully adsorbed even in the presence of the temperature control fluid. </p><p id="p0064" num="0064"> Non-limiting examples of such adsorbents include amine functionalized microporous and mesoporous adsorbents. A non-limiting example of such a system may be the use of supported amines on a water stable support with the use of hot and cold water (pressurized liquid or used as steam for heating) for heating and cooling. Whereas liquid water is left within the adsorbent wall during the adsorption step, if the thickness of the adsorbent wall is kept small (less than 1000 microns, preferably less than 200 microns, and most preferably less than 100 microns) it may be possible for I¾S and CO<sub>2</sub> to diffuse through the liquid water in time scales less than 1 minute, more preferred less than 10 seconds to become adsorbed by the supported amine.

Feed gas is passed through the inner diameter of the porous fiber to be adsorbed by the adsorbent at lower temperatures, while cool temperature control fluid is flowing over the fibers outer diameters. Desorption may be accomplished by passing hot temperature control fluid, preferably in a counter-current direction over the fibers outer diameter, thus heating the adsorbent. The cycle is completed by exchanging the hot temperature control fluid with cold fluid to return the fiber containing the adsorbent to the desired adsorption temperature. </p><p id="p0067" num="0067"> In a preferred embodiment, the rate of heat flow in the system may be such that a sharp temperature gradient in the temperature control fluid may be established during heating and cooling such that the sensible heat of the system can be recuperated within the adsorbent bed structure. For such a non-limiting hollow fiber example, the useful fiber outer diameter dimension is less than 20,000 microns, preferably less than 2000 microns, and most preferably less than 1000 microns. The useful hollow fiber inner diameters (the feed gas channels) is less than 10,000 microns, preferably less than 1000 microns, and most preferably less than 500 microns as suitable based on the desired adsorption and desorption cycle times, feed adsorbed species concentrations, and adsorbent layer swing capacity for those species. </p><p id="p0068" num="0068"> In one or more embodiments, it is advantageous to keep the ratio of non-adsorbing thermal mass in the adsorbent bed to adsorbent as low as possible. This ratio may preferably be less than 20, more preferably less than 10, and most preferred less than 5. In this manner, the sensible heat of the system that must be swung in each cycle may be kept to a minimum. </p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Concept O: A relatively low flow of about 0.01 to 5 % of the total feed of a clean gas substantially free of H<sub>2</sub>S or CO<sub>2</sub> is utilized as a purge gas. Non-limiting examples of such gases (i.e., "clean gas") include methane and nitrogen that are maintained flowing through the parallel channels in a direction counter-current to the feed direction during at least a portion of the desorption steps of the process. It is preferred that the flow rate of this clean gas be sufficient to overcome the natural diffusion of the desorbing H<sub>2</sub>S and</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">CO<sub>2</sub> to maintain the product end of the adsorbing channel in a substantially clean condition. That is, the purge stream should have sufficient flow rate to sweep the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="20"/>-->
 desorbing CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S from the channels and/or pores. It is this counter-current purge flow during desorption that ensures that on each subsequent adsorption cycle there may be no bleed-through of target species, such as H<sub>2</sub>S or CO<sub>2</sub> into the product stream. A further benefit or objective of the clean purge is to assist in desorption of contaminants by reducing the partial pressure of contaminants in the flow channels of the adsorbent bed. This lessening of the partial pressure may be utilized to drive the contaminants from the adsorbent bed. </p><p id="p0071" num="0071"> A preferred cycle and bed design for the practice of the present invention is that the product end of the adsorbent channels, i.e. the end opposite the end where feed gases enter) have a low, or ideally essentially zero concentration of adsorbed I¾S and CO<sub>2</sub>. In this manner, and with suitable structured channels as described above, the H<sub>2</sub>S and CO<sub>2</sub> may be rigorously removed from the feed gas stream. The downstream end of the bed can be kept clean as described by maintaining a low flow of a clean fluid substantially free of ]¾S and CO<sub>2</sub>, in a counter-current direction relative to the feed direction, during the desorption step(s), or more preferably, during all the heating and cooling steps in the cycle. It is further preferred that during the adsorption step, the adsorption part of the cycle be limited to a time such that the advancing adsorption front of ]¾S and CO<sub>2</sub> loaded adsorbent not reach the end of the channels, i.e. adsorption to be halted prior to H<sub>2</sub>S and/or CO<sub>2</sub> breakthrough so that a substantially clean section of the adsorbent channel remains substantially free of target species. With reasonably sharp adsorption fronts, this may allow more than 50 vol.% of the adsorbent to be utilized, more preferred more than 75 vol.%, and most preferred more than 85 vol.%. </p><p id="p0072" num="0072"> [0034] The processes, apparatus, and systems provided herein are useful in large gas treating facilities, such as facilities that process more than five million standard cubic feet per day (MSCFD) of natural gas, or more than 15 MSCFD of natural gas, or more than 25 MSCFD of natural gas, or more than 50 MSCFD of natural gas, or more than 100 MSCFD of natural gas, or more than 500 MSCFD of natural gas, or more than one billion standard cubic feet per day (BSCFD) of natural gas, or more than two BSCFD of natural gas. </p><p id="p0073" num="0073"> [0035] Compared to conventional technology, the provided processes, apparatus, and systems require lower capital investment, lower operating cost, and less physical space, thereby enabling implementation offshore and in remote locations, such as Arctic
