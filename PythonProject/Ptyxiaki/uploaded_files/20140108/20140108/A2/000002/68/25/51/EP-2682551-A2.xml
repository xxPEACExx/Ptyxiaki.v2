Such an adjustment has the purpose of recovering possible bending of the door or the window or of allowing it to work even in the case in which the mounting of the door or window suffers some geometrical misalignment or displacements.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Among such hinges there are those which allow, in addition to a longitudinal adjustment (that is, with position adaptation along the axis of rotation of the hinge itself), a transversal adjustment (that is, according to a direction lying in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the hinge and parallel to the wall on which the opening to be shut by the window or door is formed); such an adjustment makes it possible to achieve a substantial off-centering between the two mutually pivoting elements forming the hinge (of which one is connected to the fixed frame and one connected to the actual mobile frame or window or door) so as to compensate for possible positioning errors between the window or door and fixed frame.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Examples of hinges of this type are described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP2186980A"><text>EP2186980</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP2194218A"><text>EP2194218</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP1173649A"><text>EP1173649</text></patcit>. Such known hinges do, however, have numerous drawbacks. In particular, they are complex, foreseeing a large number of mechanical components, and therefore have high production costs. Moreover, also due to their structural complexity, they are difficult to assemble and adjust. Another example of known hinge is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO2006060018A"><text>W02006/060018</text></patcit>. This hinge comprises a pin through which the pivoting coupling between the two hinge elements is carried out, the pin comprising two end branches joined by an intermediate, inclined deviation portion. In this way the branches result mutually off-centered and parallel, whereby a relative displacement of the hinge elements along an adjustment direction is obtained in response to an adjustment rotation of one of the branches. This hinge still has some of the above mentioned<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> drawbacks and in any case, once the adjustment has been carried out, there are problems in terms of appearance that make the hinge unsatisfactory, or in any case, that make it necessary to adopt and rearrange additional components.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The object of the present invention is to provide a hinge for doors or windows, of the type that can be transversally adjusted, which overcomes the drawbacks mentioned above, in particular being structurally simple and therefore less subject to failures, and with lower production and maintenance costs with respect to known hinges.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A particular object of the invention is then to provide a hinge of the aforementioned type which can be adjusted in a simple and functional manner, and that at the same time has a valuable and clean appearance after the adjustment operations, without an increase of operations or additional components to be mounted afterwards.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">These and other objects are achieved with the adjustable hinge according to the invention, the essential characteristics of which are defined by the first of the attached claims. Further important characteristics are defined by the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The characteristics and the advantages of the adjustable hinge according to the present invention shall become clearer from the following description of an embodiment thereof given as an example and not for limiting purposes with reference to the attached drawings in which:
<ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> is an axonometric view of the hinge in a typical configuration of use, i.e. associated with a mobile frame of a window or door for mounting the latter to a fixed frame with a vertical axis of rotation;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">figure 2</figref> is a view of the hinge in longitudinal section, i.e. made according to a plane in which the axis of rotation of the hinge itself lies;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">figure 2a</figref> is an enlarged view of <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 2</figref> in a central area of the hinge;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">figure 3</figref> is a plan view of a pin for the rotation of the hinge, represented separately and oriented according to the configuration of use according to the previous figures;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">figure 4</figref> shows separately, enlarged and in a perspective view, a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> central plug of the hinge;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">figure 5</figref> is a cross section view of the hinge (i.e. according to a plan that is perpendicular to the aforementioned axis of rotation), made at the height of an upper element of the hinge in the position of minimum transverse off-centering or of zero adjustment, with the door or window frame in the closed configuration;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">figure 6</figref>, analogously to <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 4</figref>, shows a cross-section view with the upper element in the position of maximum transverse off-centering or maximum adjustment displacement, again with the window or door frame in the closed configuration;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">figure 7</figref> is an axonometric view of an upper closing cap of the hinge;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">figure 8</figref> shows an axonometric view from below of the central plug mounted on the pin of rotation of the hinge, represented separately; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">figure 9</figref> shows an exploded and axonometric view of a variant embodiment of the central plug.</li></ul></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">For the sake of clarity, and with no limiting purposes, in the present description the terms "lower" and "upper" refer to the ground plane and consequently to a typical configuration of use of the hinge with vertical axis of rotation; for example and in particular, by "lower" it is thus meant an element of the hinge that is made integral with the fixed frame and that is intended to always be closest to the ground plane, <i>vice versa</i> by "upper" there is meant an element that is made integral with the mobile frame of the door or the window arranged higher with respect to the same plane.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">With reference to the aforementioned figures, the hinge according to the invention comprises in the depicted embodiment, as mentioned, two hinge elements one on top of the other, of which the lower element 1 is adapted to be connected integral with a fixed frame 2 of a window, door etc. and the upper element 3 is integrally connected to an upright 4 of a mobile frame of the window or door. The connection between the hinge elements and the frame/upright is carried out with conventional methods, such as screws that secure to the frame/upright respective connection wings 1a, 3a extending from the hinge elements.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The lower hinge element 1 is substantially cylindrical whereas the upper hinge element 3 has a substantially cylindrical main body 31 from which a rib 30 projects,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> according to a first transversal (I. e. radial) direction Y1. The rib 30, running longitudinally along the body 31, has a curved head face 30a, with a curvature that can be compared to that of the main body, and slanting sides 30b that connect the head face to the external surface of the body itself.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The hinge elements 1, 3 are substantially tubular, so as to define, on the inside, corresponding cylindrical through housings 5, 6 for housing a pin 7 that allows for the pivoting coupling between the two hinge elements. The upper hinge element, or more precisely the relative main body 31, has a diameter that is smaller than the lower element, with the effect that shall be understood from the foregoing description.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The pin 7 (shown separately in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 3</figref>) comprises two end branches with a cylindrical section, joined to one another so as to be parallel but not coaxial, thus overall obtaining a substantially S-like shape. One lower end branch 70 inserts in the respective lower housing 5 whereas one upper branch 71 inserts in the respective upper housing 6. Each of the branches moreover defines a central axis thereof respectively X0, X1, such axes; of course, coincide with the axes of the housings of the hinge elements. More precisely, the two straight end branches 70, 71, and in particular the axes X0, X1 thereof are mutually off-centred by an amount H (indicated in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 3</figref> and in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 2a</figref>) according to the first transversal direction Y1, such a direction, lying in a plane perpendicular to the axes X0, X1, being also perpendicular to the plane of the fixed frame.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The connection between the two end branches of the pin 7 is carried out via an intermediate portion 72, in turn cylindrical, but with a longitudinal development that is substantially smaller with respect to the end branches, and has a slanted axis.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The hinge according to the invention further comprises a plug 8 that is arranged between the two elements 1, 3 and is provided with a slanted through channel 83 that houses the intermediate portion 72 of the pin 7 in a locked manner. The plug 8, which will be described in detail hereafter, moreover provides a crescent-shaped step 83a formed within the through channel 83, which as shown in particular in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 2a</figref>, abuts on a shoulder 73 formed on the pin 7 between the upper straight branch 71 and the slanted intermediate portion 72. The step and the shoulder are such that the first rests on the second, due to gravity, and as a consequence the load stress is discharged<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> from the plug onto the pin.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The upper end branch 71 can be locked, and is indeed locked in the normal use of the hinge, within the respective upper housing 6 through the forcing action of threaded screw members 9. The latter engage in threaded holes 32 obtained in a radial direction on the rib 30. In order to permit the mutual rotation of the two hinge elements and therefore the rotation of the mobile frame with respect to the fixed frame, the lower end branch 70 is on the other hand pivotable inside the respective lower housing 5 that is suitably covered by a bushing 50 made from material with low friction coefficient.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Adjustment means are associated to the pin 7, said means comprising in particular, according to the illustrated embodiment, a hexagonal-shaped seat 7a formed at the top of the pin 7 coaxially with the axis (X1), suitable for the insertion with a tool of the known type such as a hex key. By acting on the pin 7 through such a tool it is possible, upon loosening the screws 9, to control its relative rotation around the axis X1 of the upper branch 71 with respect to the upper element 3. Such a rotation, due to the off-centering between the two branches of the pin and of the constraint exerted by the lower element that is integral with the fixed frame, has the effect of moving the aforementioned axis X1 with respect to the axis X0 of the lower branch 70, along a second transversal direction Y2 that actually represents the desired transversal adjustment direction (i.e. a direction on a plane perpendicular to the axis of the rotation of the hinge, represented by X0, and parallel to the plane of the fixed frame). Such a displacement is easily understood by comparing <figref idrefs="f0002">figures 5 and 6</figref>, which indeed refer to a position of zero adjustment (axes X0 and X1 being aligned along the direction Y1) and to a position of maximum displacement in the adjustment direction Y2.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 3</figref>, the off-centered adjustment according to Y2 can occur both with a movement towards or away from one another, corresponding respectively to relative angular displacements α (for the adjustment towards one another) and β (for the adjustment away from one another).</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Returning now to the plug 8 (shown on its own in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 4</figref>), this has a central portion 80 that is substantially disc-shaped with flat faces 80a, 80b respectively facing the lower hinge element and the upper hinge element. The upper flat face 80b acts as an abutment surface for the upper hinge element 3, whereas the lower flat face 80a is<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> kept slightly spaced from the lower hinge element 1 due to the resting of the lower branch 70 at the bottom of the bushing 50.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Some projections extend from such flat faces, one of which is a substantially cylindrical upper projection 82 that is engaged in a suitable flaring made at a lower end of the upper housing 6, and a lower projection 81 having a concave conical segment that is engaged in the lower housing 5, although without contact, i.e. with a certain clearance. For such a purpose the already mentioned bushing 50 indeed has a flared mouth with a conical shape so as to allow the housing of the intermediate slanted portion 72 of the pin 7, and at the same time of the lower projection 81 that at least partially wraps the same portion 72. In practice, the lower projection 81 has such a shape as to match the slanted portion 72 thus giving the group an overall truncated cone shape (see in particular <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 8</figref>) which is housed with clearance in the conically flared mouth of the bushing 50.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The channel 83 is obviously slanted and opens on the aforementioned projections, which in turn are thus off-centered so as to be spaced correspondingly to the distance H between the aforementioned axes X0, X1 of the end branches 71, 72 of the pin 7.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">With particular reference again to <figref idrefs="f0002">figures 5 and 6</figref>, a wall 84 rises from the upper flat face 80b developing in a C-shaped circle, so as to be centred on the axis X0 and symmetrical with respect to the plane X0-X1, along a part of the periphery of the central disc 80, spaced however from the aforementioned periphery so as to define a free strip 80c. A chamber 80d is moreover delimited between the concave side of the wall 84, i.e. facing towards the centre of the disc, and the upper cylindrical projection such as to house the rib 30 of the upper hinge element. The wall 84 further comprises a shaped end teeth 85 that thickens the same wall by projecting towards the centre of the disc. The side surface of each tooth 85 has an inner concave face 85a that fronts, following its curvature, the cylindrical side surface of the upper hinge element 3. The concave face 85a joins the concave side of the wall 84 via an abutment face 85b, having a substantially radial arrangement, which represents the actual delimitation of the chamber 80d. A head face 85c, on the other hand, joins the inner concave face 85a to the outer side surface of the wall 84, representing its end.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">When the hinge is in the zero adjustment position (<figref idrefs="f0002">figure 5</figref>) the rib 30 occupies the center of the chamber 80d, with the wall 84 which is consequently symmetrical with respect to the rib. On the other hand, when the hinge is in the maximum transversal adjustment position, an abutment face 85b acts as an end stop for the rib 30, through the abutment with one of the slanting sides 30b (<figref idrefs="f0002">figure 6</figref>). Obviously, the rib abuts with one or the other inner abutment face according to whether the transversal adjustment is towards one another or away from one another.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The hinge according to the invention is finished off with a cover 10 that is arranged so as to partially wrap the upper hinge element 3 and offer the hinge a continuous external surface even following the adjustment movement, in spite of the off-centering between the two hinge elements 1, 3. For such a purpose, the cover, substantially a tubular cylinder with an open C-shaped section having a suitable diameter, is arranged and kept coaxial (despite the adjustment movement) with the lower hinge element 1, hiding the rib 30 and reaching the external surface of the main body 31 of the upper element in proximity to the connection wing 3a (as can be clearly seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">figures 5 and 6</figref>).</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The cover 10 thus has an outer diameter corresponding to that of the lower element 1 and, since it is arranged coaxially with respect to it, gives also the upper element the same diameter, forming an outer side surface of the hinge that is completely continuous in the transition between the two elements. In order to achieve this result, the cover 10 is arranged, at the bottom, resting on the peripheral free strip 80c of the disc 80 of the plug 8, in radial abutment on the wall 84, and has, along the free edges, respective shaped projections 11, adapted to hook onto the teeth 85 of the same wall, in particular for abutting on the head faces 85c. The projections 11 also have concave faces 11a that, like the concave faces 85a of the teeth 85 and continuously with them, front, following the curvature, the cylindrical side surface of the upper hinge element. Such a surface is substantially joined up with the external surface of the cover, with a minimal discontinuity and, in any case, with almost no negative impact on the appearance of the hinge.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The cover 10 finishes off its work of improving the appearance of the hinge, thanks to a closing cap 12, which is arranged over the upper hinge element 3 so as to<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> shut the housing 6. The cap 12 engages in a reversible manner with the cover 10 and with the pin 7 by means of the seat 7a; the removal is indeed necessary in order to access the seat 7a for actuating/adjusting the pin 7. More in detail, the cap 12 is in turn used as a support and reference means for the cover 10 in the upper area, again so as to keep the cover itself coaxially centred with the disc 80 and therefore with the lower element 1 (axis X0).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">For such a purpose the cap 12, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">figures 7 and 8</figref>, comprises, on a disc-shaped base 120, an analogous wall 121, shaped analogously to the wall 84 of the plug 8. The wall 121 of the cap indeed has an arc-shaped peripheral development and shaped teeth 121a for engaging with the cover, as well as for the end-stop abutment of the rib 30. A peg 122 also extends from the disc-shaped base 120 so as to engage with the seat 7a, having thus the same cross-section (for example hexagonal-shaped). The cap advantageously further has lips 123 that, projecting annularly from the disc-shaped base around the peg 122, are adapted to snap fit with the end of the upper branch of the pin 7. For this purpose, such an end can advantageously have peripheral connection throats 71a.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A bottom 11 finally closes the housing 5 of the hinge element 1. Between the bottom 11 and the bushing 50, within the housing 5, longitudinal adjustment means 13 of the known type are housed, like for example a screw that acts on the bushing, not described in detail.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The hinge according to the invention has numerous advantages. First of all the transversal adjustment can occur in a simple and rapid manner, without it being necessary to dismount the hinge or portions thereof (it is sufficient to remove the cap 12). A simple rotation, which can be exerted with tools that can be easily found on the market, such as a hex key, leads to a precise and reliable adaptive control of the mutual position between the fixed frame and the mobile frame. This is accomplished with a hinge that is simple in terms of its construction since it is made by a small number of components. Consequently, the production costs are extremely low.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">An important aspect of the invention lies also in the fact that, thanks to the particular solution provided by the cover and by the suitably shaped plug, the hinge, contrarily to known solutions, has a pleasing appearance because as mentioned there<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> is always the continuity of the external surface also during the adjustment and in the maximum transversal adjustment positions. The alignment between the cover and the lower element of the hinge is strongly kept, and, at the same time, the cover dynamically adapts to the relative displacement of the upper element, in a completely automatic manner, without any need for being rearranged manually; this is due to the connection of the cover to the plug, with which it is integral, and to the fact that the plug, during the rotation of the pin 7, rotates around X0.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">More in detail, during normal operation of the hinge the pin-plug assembly rotates around X0 (the unit formed by the intermediate portion 72 and the lower projection 81 being a conical male part that rotates in the conical housing of the bushing 50). The cover 10 remains integral with the upper hinge element.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In order to carry out the adjustment, the cap 12 is removed and, by operating as already indicated above on the pin 7, the reference means for the cover (wall 84) rotate integrally with the pin around the axis X0, with the functional and aesthetic result that has just been described. In the same way also the seat 7a rotates, so that when the cap 12 is rearranged, it can be engaged with the same seat and with the cover 10 exactly like before, integrally supporting the cover even at the upper end. Practically, it is like if also the cap, in addition to the plug, were rotated as a unit with the pin to keep the cover in the desired alignment with the lower hinge element.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Of course, the orientation of the seat 7a with respect to the central plug and the orientation of the peg 122 in relation to the wall 121 are coherent with one another, and in particular, advantageously, are such that the seat 7a and the peg 122 have two opposite angles that are aligned according to the plane X0-X1 (such a plane, in the zero adjustment position, developing according to the transversal direction Y1). Since the coupling between the seat and the hexagonal pegs can occur only in three specific angles that are angularly spaced by 120°, during the rearrangement of the cap, the angle that automatically aligns the cap itself with respect to the pin can be easily chosen.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The cover remains centered on the lower element (it is engaged with the wall 84) rotating as a unit with the plug around the axis X0 due to the integral engagement with the intermediate slanting portion. Such a rotation results in a dynamic adaptation of the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> cover 10 in relation to the upper element (see <figref idrefs="f0002">figures 5 and 6</figref>).</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Again, a further advantage is given by the fact that the hinge, according to the present invention, is suitable for supporting also heavy loads. The pin has a constant section and therefore it does not have areas of potential structural weakness. Moreover, the shoulder 73 carries out an extremely important role in supporting the load (weight of the mobile frame), which is transmitted from the upper element to the plug 8 and, indeed, from this to the pin 7. Such a solution ensures that the hinge, having a wide possibility of transversal adjustments, is in any case suitable for being used in industrial applications (that is, big sized window or door frames).</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The material used for the pin is preferably a metal material with high mechanical resistance, like for example steel. The pin is preferably made through metalworking operations such as turning, although other solutions can also be foreseen such as casting, etc.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The cap and the bottom can be made from plastic material. For the plug, due to the stress it is subjected to, a metal material is, on the other hand, indicated. However, in order to optimise the appearance of the hinge in relation to the other components, the plug can have a core made from metal material and a hoop lining made from plastic material. Such a variant embodiment is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 9</figref>, in which it can be noted that in this case there is a central wall portion 184 which is integral with the peripheral plastic hoop lining, indicated with reference numeral 108". On the other hand, the end teeth 185 are integral with the core of the plug 108', the end teeth forming the two portions giving continuity to the abutment wall like in the previous embodiment. The hoop lining 108" is obviously ring-like and shaped so as to be engaged with the core 108', suitable machining being carried out to obtain a forced and/or snap fit engagement.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Despite the spatial references used in the present description, it is obvious that equivalent configurations that are arranged with different orientation or also configurations that are mirrored with respect to the one in the example above, are within the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The present invention has in fact been described with reference to its preferred embodiments. It should be understood that other embodiments can be foreseen that<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> belong to the same inventive core, all covered by the following claims.</p></description><claims
