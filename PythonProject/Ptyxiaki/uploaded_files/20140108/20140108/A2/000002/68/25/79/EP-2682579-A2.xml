Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">For example, as is described in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2008274952A"><text>2008-274952</text></patcit> (<patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2008274952A"><text>JP 2008-274952 A</text></patcit>), there is known an exhaust emission control system for an internal combustion engine, which includes a NOx purification catalyst and a reducing agent supply mechanism. The NOx purification catalyst purifies nitrogen oxides (NOx) in exhaust gas. The reducing agent supply mechanism supplies reducing agent to an exhaust passage. The reducing agent is utilized to purify NOx at the NOx purification catalyst. In the reducing agent supply mechanism, urea aqueous solution is injected from the addition valve to the exhaust passage. The injected urea aqueous solution is heated by the heat of exhaust gas. Thus, the urea aqueous solution changes into ammonia by the hydrolysis of urea. The ammonia is adsorbed by the NOx purification catalyst. Thus, NOx flowing into the NOx purification catalyst is reduced and purified.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Incidentally, for example, when the temperature of exhaust gas is low, urea in the urea aqueous solution injected from the addition valve forms a deposit, such as a crystal and a mixture, originating from urea without being hydrolyzed into ammonia, and is deposited in the NOx purification catalyst, or the like. Therefore, the NOx purification efficiency of the NOx purification catalyst decreases. In the exhaust emission control system described in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2008274952A"><text>JP 2008-274952 A</text></patcit>, when it is determined that a deposit amount in the NOx purification catalyst has reached a threshold, temperature raising control for raising<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the temperature of exhaust gas is executed. Thus, the deposit deposited in the NOx purification catalyst is vaporized and removed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Incidentally, temperature raising control for raising the temperature of exhaust gas includes not only control for removing a deposit that originates from urea in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2008274952A"><text>JP 2008-274952 A</text></patcit> but also, for example, control for regenerating a filter that traps particulate matter (PM) in exhaust gas. In addition, during high-load operation of an internal combustion engine, the temperature of exhaust gas rises. In this way, during engine operation in which the temperature of exhaust gas becomes high, the addition valve of the exhaust emission control system is exposed to high-temperature exhaust gas. Therefore, when urea aqueous solution is present in the addition valve during engine operation in which the temperature of exhaust gas is high, urea aqueous solution boils in the addition valve. Thus, the metal material of the addition valve may corrode.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The invention provides an exhaust emission control system for an internal combustion engine, which is able to suppress metallic corrosion of an addition valve due to boiling of reducing agent in the addition valve, and a control method for the exhaust emission control system.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A first aspect of the invention provides an exhaust emission control system for an internal combustion engine. The exhaust emission control system includes: an addition valve that supplies reducing agent to an exhaust passage and a supply tube that supplies the reducing agent to the addition valve, wherein, when a temperature of exhaust gas flowing through the exhaust passage is higher than or equal to a reference temperature, recovery control for recovering the reducing agent in the supply tube is executed.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">With the above configuration, when the temperature of exhaust gas is higher than or equal to the reference temperature and the reducing agent easily boils in the addition valve, the reducing agent in the supply tube is recovered. Therefore, it is possible to recover the reducing agent in the addition valve through the supply tube. Thus, it is possible to suppress boiling of the reducing agent in the addition valve. Thus, it is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> possible to suppress metallic corrosion of the addition valve due to boiling of the reducing agent in the addition valve.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the exhaust emission control system according to the first aspect of the invention, the recovery control may be executed when the temperature of exhaust gas, which is acquired through any one of actual measurement and estimation, is higher than or equal to the reference temperature.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">With the above configuration, the actually detected temperature of exhaust gas or the temperature of exhaust gas estimated from the engine operating state, or the like, is compared with the reference temperature, so it is possible to determine whether the temperature of exhaust gas is higher than or equal to the reference temperature. Then, it is possible to execute recovery control when the temperature of exhaust gas is higher than or equal to the reference temperature.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the exhaust emission control system according to the first aspect of the invention, the recovery control may be executed in an engine operating state where the temperature of exhaust gas is higher than or equal to the reference temperature.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The temperature of exhaust gas varies on the basis of the engine operating state. Therefore, whether the temperature of exhaust gas rises to the reference temperature or above may be determined not on the basis of the temperature of exhaust gas itself but on the basis of the engine operating state. Then, in the above configuration, the recovery control is configured to be executed in the engine operating state where it is estimated that the temperature of exhaust gas is higher than or equal to the reference temperature. With this configuration as well, it is possible to execute the recovery control when the temperature of exhaust gas is higher than or equal to the reference temperature.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the exhaust emission control system according to the first embodiment of the invention, a filter that traps particulate matter in exhaust gas may be provided in the exhaust passage, regeneration process for regenerating the filter may be executed by raising the temperature of exhaust gas when an amount of the particulate matter trapped by the filter becomes larger than or equal to a threshold, and the recovery control may be executed when the amount of the particulate matter trapped by the filter is larger than or<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> equal to a reference amount that is smaller than the threshold.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">With the above configuration, when the particulate matter trapped by the filter is larger than or equal to the reference amount, urea aqueous solution recovery control is executed, so the urea aqueous solution recovery control is executed in advance of a situation that the amount of particulate matter trapped by the filter becomes larger than or equal to the threshold and then temperature raising control for regenerating the filter is executed. Thus, it is possible to start the recovery control in advance of the situation that the temperature of exhaust gas is higher than or equal to the reference temperature.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the exhaust emission control system according to the first aspect of the invention, the recovery control may be executed when it is predicted that an engine operating state changes into a state where the temperature of exhaust gas is higher than or equal to the reference temperature.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As described above, the temperature of exhaust gas varies on the basis of the engine operating state. Then, it is possible to predict to some extent whether the engine operating state changes into the state where the temperature of exhaust gas rises to the reference temperature or above. Then, in the above configuration, when it is predicted that the engine operating state changes into the state where the temperature of exhaust gas is higher than or equal to the reference temperature, the recovery control is executed in advance of the change. With the above configuration, it is possible to start the recovery control in advance of the situation that the temperature of exhaust gas is higher than or equal to the reference temperature.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the exhaust emission control system according to the first aspect, the engine operating state where the temperature of exhaust gas is higher than or equal to the reference temperature may be established when temperature raising control for raising the temperature of exhaust gas is executed.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the exhaust emission control system according to the first aspect, the engine operating state where the temperature of exhaust gas is higher than or equal to the reference temperature may be established when the internal combustion engine is operating at high load.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The temperature raising control may be, for example, control for raising the temperature of exhaust gas in order to eliminate soot, deposit, or the like, deposited in an exhaust system.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the exhaust emission control system according to the first aspect of the invention, when the temperature of exhaust gas is higher than or equal to a predetermined temperature that is higher than the reference temperature while the recovery control is being executed, the recovery control is stopped, and the reducing agent is injected from the addition valve.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the above configuration, when the temperature of exhaust gas is higher than the predetermined temperature that is higher than the reference temperature and the addition valve may undergo heat damage during recovery control, the reducing agent is injected from the addition valve. When the reducing agent is injected, relatively low-temperature reducing agent is supplied from, for example, a tank, or the like, to the addition valve, so the addition valve is cooled. Thus, it is possible to suppress heat damage to the addition valve.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A second aspect of the invention provides a control method for an exhaust emission control system for an internal combustion engine. The exhaust emission control system includes: an addition valve that supplies reducing agent to an exhaust passage and a supply tube that supplies the reducing agent to the addition valve. The control method includes: when a temperature of exhaust gas flowing through the exhaust passage is higher than or equal to a reference temperature, executing recovery control for recovering the reducing agent in the supply tube.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">Features, advantages, and technical and industrial significance of exemplary embodiments of the invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like numerals denote like elements, and wherein:
