The subject application often requires supply of nanosilver colloid in a relevant solvent: water, specific alcohol, appropriate oil, etc., depending on the target application. Although water colloids are fairly widely accessible, ordering a colloid based on a given solvent may require submitting a special order to the producer, which involves additional waiting time and high costs or is difficult to accomplish. A particular problem occurs in the case of the colloids of silver nanoparticles of a small diameter, i.e. 3 to 8 nm, available only from few producers.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In retail, there are available highly concentrated nanosilver solutions with particle sizes from 3 to 9 nm and concentration of approx. 100,000 ppm.

This kind of preparation has a high content of pollutants, reaching a few %, probably due to its specific manufacturing process. For example, in the above mentioned preparation 100K, the dry matter contains 95% of pure silver and 5% of pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrates and nitrites. These residues significantly deteriorate biocidal properties of nanosilver, which is undesirable in highly specialised applications, for instance in food and pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, these concentrates are not suitable for direct dilution.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It would be preferable to develop a method of manufacturing bactericidal colloids from a nanosilver concentrate, which would allow to obtain colloids of a high purity, based on desirable solvents, which could be different from the solvent of the concentrate. It would allow free manufacturing of colloids for specific purposes from concentrates available in retail.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The object of the invention is a method for manufacturing of bactericidal colloids from a colloidal nanosilver concentrate.

The method allows to obtain a colloid based on a wide range of solvents, which can be selected depending on the desired application of the colloid and which can be different from the solvent on which the concentrate is based.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The invention is shown by means of exemplary embodiment on a drawing, in which:

Such small<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> particles of a size similar to silver (Ag) atoms require special treatment and cannot by efficiently processed using other methods, which are usable for colloids of particle sizes above ten nanometres.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Nanosilver concentrate is collected from a tank 101 and supplied to separate branches A, B, C of the technological line, so as to develop colloids based on different solvents for different branches, meant for different industries and with different quality requirements. This makes the process optimal for conditions of any desirable colloid, whilst the requirements for one kind of final product have no impact on the requirements for another product. In each of the branches, the concentrate is placed in a vacuum dryer 102A-102C, in which the primal solvent of the colloid undergoes evaporation to obtain dry matter, that is silver with pollutants. The dry matter has the form of gritted powder, in which silver molecules undergo gritting, but the process is reversible. The dry matter is supplied to a purifying reactor 103A-103C, presented schematically in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. The reactor is a quartz pipe 201 with a heating coil 202 wound around it, connected to an adjustable source of alternating current 203. The pipe 201 is filled in approx. 1/3 of its volume with the dry matter 206 and, using a vacuum pump 205, vacuum is generated inside the pipe. The temperature of the coil wound around the pipe is adjusted so as to obtain the temperature of 180°C do 210°C inside the pipe. As a result of the heating, which is conducted within 1 to 2 hours, a release of absorbed gasses from the surface of nanosilver is performed. The temperature causes thermal decomposition of pollutants, such as nitrates, which are then extracted by an extractor 204 using a vacuum pump 205. After the extraction of pollutants, the dry matter has much higher level of purity, usually about 99%. The next step involves pouring alcohol (e.g. methyl alcohol) on the purified dry matter, in the amount approx. ten times higher by volume than the volume of the dry matter. For about 1 hour the solution of alcohol and silver is mixed in a stirrer 104A-104C, preferably a magnetic stirrer, which guarantees high level of purity. Washing in alcohol partially dissolves the hydrocarbon protective shell around the individual molecules of nanosilver, i.e. their further purification. Next, the concentrate of nanosilver is dried in a vacuum dryer 105A-105C in order to evaporate the alcohol. This way a dry matter is obtained with silver content of approx. 99.5%. Then, the purified dry matter is dissolved in a solvent appropriate<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> for a given output colloid, in a stirrer 106A-106C, slowly stirring for about 1 hour. The amount of solvent is selected depending on the desired final concentration, for example to obtain the concentration of 1000 ppm per each 1g of dry matter, 1000 g of solvent is applied. Thus obtained mixture is poured into a sonicator tank 107A-107C. The sonicator 107A-107C, also called an ultrasonic homogeniser or an ultrasonic disintegrator, has a stirring probe placed in the tank, with induced vibration thanks to which the liquid is mixed in the tank. Preferably, the vibrations have the frequency of approx. 20 kHz during 5 to 10 minutes. The application of the sonicator provides uniformity of the mixture and consolidation of the colloid, which does not stratify, remaining uniform for a long time, that is for at least several months. The mixture from the sonicator is submitted to quality control at a station 108A-109C, equipped with necessary gauge tools, such as spectrophotometer, microscopes, Malvern Zetasizer Nano, analytical balance and other tools, required for measuring the parameters of bactericidal colloid. After thorough analysis of the parameters, the colloid is moved to tanks 109A-109C, in which it is stored and prepared for transport.</p><heading id="h0001"><b>Example 1.</b></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">In a separate branch of the technological line, 1,500 ml of Nanosilver 100K preparation by Amepox, <img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="4" he="8" img-content="character" img-format="tif" inline="yes"/> ódź was dried to obtain 150 g of dry matter, which was heated in a purifying reactor for 1 hour in a temperature of 180°C.

The dry matter was divided into 5 portions of 20g each, and each portion was mixed with 5,000 ml of paraffin compound, mixed in a stirrer for 1 hour, and then placed in a sonicator and mixed by vibration (at a frequency of 20 kHz) for 10 minutes. A nanosilver colloid with a concentration of 4,000 ppm in paraffin was obtained in the process.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>Example 4.</b></heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">In a separate branch of the technological line, 420 ml of Nanosilver 100K preparation by Amepox, <img id="ib0005" file="imgb0005.tif" wi="4" he="7" img-content="character" img-format="tif" inline="yes"/> ódź was dried to obtain approx. 42g of dry matter, which was heated in a purifying reactor for 1 hour in a temperature of 210°C.
