The low-beam light distribution pattern PL is a low-beam light distribution pattern of a left light distribution, and includes a first cutoff line CL1 to a third cutoff line CL3 on the upper end edge. The first cutoff line CL1 and the second cutoff line CL2 extend in a horizontal direction so as to have a left-right different level from each other with line V-V, which is a vertical line passing through a vanishing point in the front direction of the lamp, as a boundary. In addition, the third cutoff line CL3 obliquely extends toward the lower right portion from the right end portion of the second cutoff line CL2, and is connected to the left end portion of the second cutoff line CL2.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">An addition light distribution pattern PA is a light distribution pattern which is formed by irradiation light from all light emitting elements included to the second lamp units 38 of the right headlight unit 22R and the left headlight unit 22L. In the additional light distribution pattern PA, the lower end is formed in a belt shape which horizontally extends so as to be positioned on the first cutoff line CL1. Therefore, the second lamp unit 38 may function as a high-beam light source.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">A relationship between the additional light distribution pattern PA and the light emitting element array 52 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4(b)</figref>.

In other words, the partial region is formed by composition of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the irradiation light from the light emitting elements.

Thereby, the illuminance of each partial region is adjusted, and the illuminance distribution in the additional light distribution pattern PA is changed. By appropriately performing the adjustment, an electronic swivel control operation can be performed, in which the irradiation region, which is an aggregation of the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> irradiated partial regions, moves the additional light distribution pattern PA to the left and the right in the horizontal direction.
