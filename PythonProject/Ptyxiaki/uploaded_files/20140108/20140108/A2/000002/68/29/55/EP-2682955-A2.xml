More particularly, the present invention relates to filler components used in communication cables.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Description of Related Art:</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Communication cables are broadly grouped into two arrangements, fiber optic cables and metal conductor cables, each of which has their own unique set of construction parameters that affect the quality of the communication signals carried therethrough.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Regarding metal conductor cables, one typical arrangement is the LAN (Local Area Network) cable that is usually constructed of four pairs of twisted insulated copper conductors encased within a jacket. Other larger cables may em ploy more pairs of conductors.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In this typical four pair LAN cable construction, in addition to protecting against external environmental interferences, in order to decrease cross talk between signals passing through one pair, and signals passing through adjacent pairs within the same LAN cable, the pairs of conductors are twisted. Moreover, as the signal interference between pairs is highest when conductors of adjacent pairs lie parallel to one another, pairs are twisted around one another at different rates (i.e. at different lay lengths) to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> minimize the instances of parallel conductors in adjacent pairs. Other items such as tapes, fillers, or cross fillers may be added to even further reduce the amount of cross talk between pairs within the cable.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For example, in prior art arrangements where four twisted pairs are included in one jacket it is common to use four different lay lengths, one for each of the four twisted pairs. These varied rates of twisting result in a reduced number of incidences where the wires in the pairs run parallel to one another, effecting a reduction in crosstalk. For example, in a typical four pair cable, arranged in a compact square/rectangle, there are six different crosstalk combinations that need to be addressed, as shown in prior art <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> (labeled C1-C6).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is typically known that the shorter the lay length of a particular pair in a multi-pair cable, the more crosstalk is reduced. However, shorter lay lengths obviously use more wire per length of cable, and thus there are limitations on how short the lay length can be in any given copper wire twisted pair. Therefore, it is ideal to have the longest lay length possible that meets the desired crosstalk threshold.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">One prior art manner for addressing such cross talk issues is to isolate the longest lay length pair in a four pair LAN cable, making it equidistant to the other three pairs in the same cable and as far as possible from other pairs in adjacent LAN cables. For example, as shown in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US7550674B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 7,550,674</text></patcit>,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> a plurality of unshielded twisted pairs are provided, each of which has a different lay length. The jacket encloses the plurality of unshielded twisted pairs, and the unshielded twisted pair that has the longest lay length among the plurality of unshielded twisted pairs positioned within the center of the jacket, substantially along the central longitudinal axis of the cable. See prior art <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">To maintain such geometry and its advantageous electrical characteristics, bumper elements are disposed around the central pair in between the outside pairs. The bumper elements are typically polymers formed as solid, foamed or hollow structures, however, alternative materials and structures may be used. These bumpers are advantageously of a dimension substantially equal to the diameter of a twisted pair, and are used for maintaining a regular geometry along the length of cable as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, the necessity of the bumpers to maintain the pair geometry in the cable necessarily leads to the drawback of using additional components in the cable, which is always a disadvantage in cable construction owing to added size, weight, cost and fuel load (fuel load affects the flame and smoke performance of cable constructions in flame tests).</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Another problem with these bumpers is that their proximity to the pairs that they separate disturbs the signal's electromagnetic field and reduces the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> effectiveness of the transmission signal through the pair owing to the detrimental dielectric properties of the polymers from which they are constructed. Although foaming the polymers used to make these bumpers is a possible solution and in theory could yield improved electrical performance, foaming is generally a non-preferred option owing to its added processing/extrusion difficulties versus solid profile extrusion.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>Objects and Summary -</b></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present arrangement overcomes certain drawbacks with the prior art by providing a low cost and effective bumper for maintaining proper spacing geometry of the twisted pairs within a communications/LAN cable without requiring the use of foamed polymers.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Such improved bumpers are profiled so as to maintain a sufficient cross sectional diameter at any point along the length of the cable, while simultaneously significantly reducing polymer consumption making use of a profiled shape. Moreover, the profiled shapes of the bumpers include significant airspace reducing the overall negative dielectric effects on the signals in the pairs adjacent the bumpers.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">To this end the present arrangement is directed to a cable containing one or more polymeric elements for reduction of crosstalk. The cable includes a plurality of unshielded twisted pairs, each of which is an insulated conductor pair twisted around one another, each having a different lay length.

However, the invention is not limited in this respect. The present invention may also be applied to cables having larger or smaller counts of twisted pairs 12 as desired.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> Twisted pairs 12a-12d are described as copper, but any desired conductive metal may be substituted as desired. Furthermore, the copper in pairs 12 are coated with typical polymer coatings, such as PE (Polyethylene) or FEP (Fluoronated Ethylene Polymer) or other insulators based on the desired cost and fire safety standards. Jacket 14 is also an extruded polymer as well, formed from PVC (Poly Vinyl Chloride) or FRPVC (Flame Resistant PVC), or other such polymer compositions.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">As with standard four pair cables each of twisted pairs 12a-12d has a different rate of rotational twisting resulting in different lay lengths. I n the present illustration, twisted pair 12a is presumed to have the shortest lay length and pair 12d has the longest lay length. For example a typical cable 10 may employ lay lengths in the ranges of 0.3" to 0.55" (0.3", 0.325", 0.35" and 0.55"). Obviously, these lay lengths for pairs 12 are by way of illustration only, with the invention being equally applicable to any desired lay lengths depending on the desired crosstalk tolerance and desired mechanical (weight etc.) specifications.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, pairs 12a-12d are arranged in a three spoked wheel arrangement with pair 12d, having the longest lay length, being centrally located substantially along the center longitudinal axis of cable 10. The three pairs 12a-12c having the shorter lay lengths are disposed apart from one<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> another, outwards towards the inside diameter of jacket 14. Ideally, pairs 12a-12c are disposed substantially 120° apart.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In one embodiment of the present invention, bumper elements 16 are disposed around central pair 12d and in between pairs 12a, 12b and 12c respectively. As described in full detail below bumper elements 16 are typically polymers formed using specialized shapes to simultaneously maintain the geometry of pairs 12a-12d while reducing the amount of polymer used and maximizing the amount of open space/air to reduce any dielectric interference in the signals in pairs 12a-12d.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">A reduction of polymer content can be achieved by the introduction of contoured/shaped bumpers 16 as described in more detail below. The shapes for contoured bumpers 16 can differ, but, regardless of the shape, should retain its structural integrity against crushing, bending, pulling, and normal abuse of cable 10.
