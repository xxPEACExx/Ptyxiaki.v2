Accordingly, embodiments are merely described below, by referring to the figures, to explain aspects of the present invention.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of a display apparatus 100 according to one or more exemplary embodiments.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the display apparatus 100 may be provided with an image communication camera 140. The image communication camera 140 according to one or more embodiments may be installed in an upper back of the display apparatus 100 and may be movable up and down. While being used (i.e., operated), the image communication camera 140 may move up and may protrude outward from a top of the display apparatus 100. The upper back of the display apparatus 100 may be provided with an insertion portion 240 in which the image communication camera 140 may be accommodated when the image communication camera 140 moves down.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example in which the image communication camera 140 is installed in the upper back of the display apparatus 100, but the embodiments are not limited thereto. Alternatively, for example, the image communication camera 140 may have a structure for up/down sliding and thus may be installed so that it can protrude outward.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In this embodiment, the display apparatus 100 may have a structure that the image communication camera 140 may come out only when it is used.

However, the embodiments are not limited to this example of the display apparatus 100. Alternatively, for example, the display apparatus 100 may be applied to not only the TV but also various examples such as a monitor, etc.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Also, the kind of images displayable by the display apparatus 100 is not limited to a broadcasting image. For example, the display apparatus 100 may process various images such as a moving picture, a still picture, an application, an on screen display (OSD), a graphic user interface for various operation control, etc. based on a signal/data received from various image sources (not shown) of various formats to be displayed.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In accordance with one or more exemplary embodiments, the display apparatus 100 may be achieved by a smart TV. The smart TV may receive and display a broadcasting signal in real time, and may have a web browser function so that various contents can be searched and enjoyed through Internet and a convenient user environment may be provided for this while displaying the broadcasting signal in real time.
