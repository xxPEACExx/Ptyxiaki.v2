More specifically, the invention relates to an adjustable damper for use with a vehicle suspension.</p><heading id="h0003">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Vehicle suspension systems typically include a spring component or components and a dampening component or components. Typically, mechanical springs, like helical springs are used with some type of viscous fluid-based dampening mechanism and the two are mounted functionally in parallel. In some instances, a spring may comprise pressurized gas and features of the damper or spring are user-adjustable, such as by adjusting the air pressure in a gas spring. A damper may be constructed by placing a damping piston in a fluid-filled cylinder (e.g., liquid such as oil). As the damping piston is moved in the cylinder, fluid is compressed and passes from one side of the piston to the other side. Often, the piston includes vents there-through which may be covered by shim stacks to provide for different operational characteristics in compression or extension.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Conventional damping components provide a constant damping rate during compression or extension through the entire length of the stroke. Other conventional damping components provide mechanisms for varying the damping rate. Further, in the world of bicycles, damping components are most prevalently mechanical. As various types of recreational and sporting vehicles continue to become more technologically advanced, what is needed in the art are improved techniques for varying the damping rate.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">According to certain embodiments, there is provided a vehicle suspension damper comprising:
<ul><li>a damping chamber containing a damping fluid, and a piston and a piston rod moveable in the damping cylinder;<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></li><li>a valve for controlling movement of said damping fluid in compression and/or rebound of said vehicle suspension damper, the valve having:
<ul><li>a primary valve member for resisting damping fluid flow along a first fluid flow path from a first side of the valve to a second side of the valve;</li><li>a first pressure reducing means and a second pressure reducing means in a second fluid flow path between said first and second sides of the valve;</li><li>wherein a surface of the primary valve member is exposed to damping fluid in said second fluid flow path between said first and second pressure reducing means;</li><li>the arrangement being such that, in use, during compression and/or rebound of said vehicle suspension damper damping fluid is urged to flow through said first fluid flow path at a first fluid pressure resisted by said primary valve member, and at the same time pressure of damping fluid in the second fluid flow path is reduced by the first and second pressure reducing means to a second fluid pressure lower than said first fluid pressure; and</li><li>the second fluid pressure acts on a said surface of said primary valve member whereby so that the primary valve member increases its resistance to damping fluid flow along said first fluid flow path.</li></ul></li></ul></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The surface of the primary valve member may be a force-generating surface. In particular, the surface may be oriented so that, when said second fluid pressure acts against the surface, a resultant force is generated on the primary valve member tending to offer increased resistance to fluid flow through the first fluid flow path. In certain embodiments the force-generating surface comprises an area that is substantially perpendicular to the direction of the resultant force.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In certain aspects the valve further comprises a reaction surface that remains stationary relative to the force-generating surface under application of said second fluid pressure. For example, the reaction surface may be part of a valve body relative to which the primary valve member is movable by said second fluid pressure.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In some aspects, the valve is positioned in the vehicle suspension damper to receive damping fluid directly from a damping cylinder, whereby the first and second pressures are each a function of damping fluid pressure in the damping cylinder.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Preferably said first fluid flow path comprises a first area over which said first fluid pressure acts to urge said primary valve member open, and said<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> surface of said primary valve member comprises a second area over which said second fluid pressure acts to urge said primary valve member closed, and wherein a ratio of said first area to said second area determines how much resistance is provided by said primary valve member and thereby the damping characteristics of said vehicle suspension damper. In one embodiment said second area is smaller than said first area, for example said second area is about 60% or less of said first area. By adjusting the ratio of these two areas the designer and/or manufacture can determine <i>inter alia</i> the maximum force that the primary valve member can exert against a fluid port or a valve shim for example. In some embodiments, as the second area gets smaller in comparison to the first area (or the first area gets bigger in comparison to the second area), the maximum force decreases. In that way it is possible to determine whether the valve member provides a 'lock-out' function on the damper, or whether the valve member can only restrict damping fluid flow at maximum force, but not stop it completely.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Advantageously, an exterior surface of said primary valve member is exposed to damping fluid on said second side of said valve, and an interior surface of said primary valve member is exposed to damping fluid in said second fluid flow path, which interior surface comprises said surface. Since the surface is inside the primary valve member and between two pressure reducing means, the force provided by the primary valve member is not dependent on the temperature of the damping fluid or on on the position of the piston and piston rod in the main damping cylinder.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Preferably, said first pressure reducing means provides (i) a bleed for damping fluid at low compression or rebound velocities, and (ii) at higher compression or rebound velocities a reduction in damping fluid pressure that is directly proportional to the velocity of the damping fluid through the first pressure reducing means, whereby hydraulic locking of said primary valve member is inhibited.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In certain aspects said first pressure reducing means comprises at least one of an orifice (for example a bore or channel), a diffuser, a labyrinth, and a screw thread. In some embodiments the orifice is smaller in diameter than an inlet channel to the valve.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Advantageously, said second pressure reducing means is adjustable, for example manually adjustable by a user and/or automatically adjustable by a computing device, whereby, in use, adjustment of said second pressure<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> reducing means effects a corresponding adjustment of said second fluid pressure, and thereby a corresponding change in the resistance by said primary valve member to damping fluid flow along said first fluid flow path. For example a user of the vehicle may adjust the second pressure reducing means directly on the damper, or remotely from the damper, possibly via an intermediate electronic controller. Additionally or alternatively, adjustment of the second pressure reducing means is performed by an electronic computing device. The computing device may be connected to one or more vehicle motion sensor, and may receive an input from the one or more vehicle motion sensor. The computing device may use the input to determine an adjustment for the second pressure reducing means that could increase or decrease damping force provided by the damper. Such an embodiment may be called an 'electronic valve'. In other words, the function of controlling damping according to inertia is performed by the combination of a sensor, an electronic controller and the valve described above. This arrangement permits much faster control of the valve than known inertia valves that rely on movement of a mass to effect valve control.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Adjustability of the second pressure reducing means enables the damping fluid pressure with the second fluid flow path to be adjusted, and thereby the force applied by the primary valve member to be adjusted also. Whilst the aforementioned area ratio controls the overall damping characteristics of the valve, adjustment of the second pressure reducing means controls the particular damping characteristics of the valve at any point in time, but within the limits set by the area ratio.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In other embodiments, the second pressure reducing means is provided with a fine tuning mechanism that allows a user to fine tune the damping characteristics of the valve. In some aspects the fine tuning mechanism is an adjuster that moves a metering edge to increase the partial block provided by the second pressure reducing means to damping fluid flow.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Preferably, said primary valve member acts directly against said first fluid pressure, the arrangement being such that, in use, when said second pressure reducing means is adjusted to reduce said second fluid pressure, said primary valve member is moved by said first fluid pressure to increase damping fluid flow through said first fluid flow path. In this way, very rapid changes damping characteristics can be achieved. For example, in certain embodiments<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> a switch between 'full firm' and 'full soft' damping characteristics can be achieved in less than 10ms, and sometimes less than 5ms.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In certain aspects, said second pressure reducing means comprises a pilot valve controllable by an electro-mechanical device. For example, the said second pressure reducing means may be at least one of a spool valve controlled by a magnetic latching solenoid, a needle positionable relative to a seat, a vane valve, a solenoid valve, and moveable screw.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In some situations when the first pressure reducing means is a an orifice and the second pressure reducing means is a pilot valve it has been found that, at high compression velocities, the pilot valve can close of its own accord. This is undesirable because the second fluid pressure increases, which causes the primary valve member to offer increased resistance to fluid flow, and may be even lock out depending on the set up. It has been found that this is due to a jet effect caused on the damping fluid by the orifice. Accordingly this problem may not be limited to the two specific kinds of first and second pressure reducing means mentioned. In order to solve this problem, a device for disrupting damping fluid flow in the second fluid flow path is incorporated in certain embodiments.

While the technology will be described in conjunction with various embodiment(s), it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the present technology to these embodiments. On the contrary, the present technology is applicable to alternative embodiments, modifications and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Furthermore, in the following description of embodiments, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present technology. However, the present technology may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, and components have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">Embodiments of vehicle suspension dampers described herein may include a valve assembly as set out in independent claim 13 appended hereto. The valve assembly may be used to regulate damping fluid flow in different parts of the suspension damper. For example, the valve assembly may be part of a base valve in a hydraulic suspension damper, such as a suspension fork and/or rear shock for a bicycle or motorcycle. Additionally or alternatively, the valve assembly may be included as part of a main piston assembly of the vehicle suspension damper, and may be used to control damping in compression and/or rebound. Additionally or alternatively, the valve assembly may be used to regulate damping fluid flow between a main damping chamber of the damping assembly and a reservoir, the reservoir for accommodating damping fluid as a piston shaft enters the main damping chamber in compression. The principle of operation of the valve assembly has wide application in vehicle suspension dampers; for example, by scaling the size of the valve assembly appropriately, it can be used in vehicles as small and light as bicycles (e.g. in the forks and/or rear shocks), and as heavy as military vehicles.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">Embodiments provide a system for controlling a vehicle's motion by increasing and/or decreasing damping forces within a vehicle suspension damper in quick response to sensed movement of the vehicle. Embodiments may be used in various types of vehicles, such as, but not limited to, bicycles, Side by<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> Sides (four-wheel drive off-road vehicle), snow mobiles, etc. Embodiments include a set of sensors coupled with a vehicle suspension damper having a electronic valve. Embodiments provide for a quicker response time, such as selectively applying damping forces, to terrain changes than the timing of responses from conventional vehicle suspension dampers.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Conventional inertia valves of conventional vehicle suspension dampers are mechanical. The conventional mechanical inertia valve operates to respond to a terrain change by applying damping forces when a vehicle's motion is sensed. However, by the time that the mechanical inertia valve senses the vehicle motion and then actually applies the damping force, the vehicle rider has already experienced some type of response to the varied terrain. For example, the vehicle rider might feel the vehicle's initial response to running over a large rock. Mechanical inertia valves have a response time that is measured at the speed of sound or less. Thus, a shock wave from a vehicle hitting a bump will be received and felt by the vehicle rider before the mechanical inertia valve can open and provide a "soft" ride. (A "soft" vs. "hard" mode of an inertia valve is explained below.)</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">Embodiments of the present technology include a set of sensors attached to the vehicle to sense vehicle motion and send control signals regarding these sensed vehicle motions to a control system of a vehicle suspension damper. The control system activates a power source of the vehicle suspension damper. The power source delivers a current to the electronic valve. The current causes a pilot valve assembly of the electronic valve to either open or close, thereby creating a "hard" mode having maximum damping force or a "soft" mode that provides a moderate damping force, respectively. Of significance, embodiments also enable components therein to provide damping functions other than via responding to a current delivered from a power source. The following lists some examples of alternative embodiments that operate to provide damping functions; it should be appreciated that the list is not exhaustive. In one example, a range of damping force may be manually selected by a user by manually adjusting a needle and jet arrangement. In another example, if the valve assembly is located on the main piston 245, a position sensitive bottom-out needle arrangement may provide for a needle engaging a jet deep into the travel of the suspension, thereby influencing a damping. Another example includes a pneumatic source (e.g., air bag springs) on a semi-truck, in which the pneumatic source drives pressure in the pilot pressure chamber 1520. As the vehicle is<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> loaded and thereby decreases the semi-truck's ride height, the air bag pressure is increased to enable the vehicle to return to the proper ride height. This increase in air pressure also corresponds to an appropriate increase in damping. Thus, in various embodiments: 1) if the set of sensors did not exist, or became inoperable for some reason, the components within embodiments are still enabled to provide damping functions; and/or 2) if the power source for some reason became unavailable, the components within embodiments are still enabled to provide damping functions. As described herein, various embodiments provide some damping function options in addition to the operation of the set of sensors in combination with the inertia valve. These options include the following: an electro-mechanical device (e.g., solenoid, latching solenoid, electric motor, piezoelectric actuator); a manually adjustable needle and jet arrangement; and a pressure signal from an outside pressure source (e.g., suspension air bag).</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">When a vehicle moves, a set of sensors, such as a set of accelerometers, in accordance with an embodiment, sense the vehicle's acceleration first. Subsequent to the sensing of the vehicle's acceleration, the vehicle's velocity is sensed, and then the vehicle's displacement is sensed. The set of sensors sends a control signal to the control system of the vehicle suspension damper as soon as the acceleration is sensed. Thus, in contrast to the use of conventional mechanical inertia valves, a damping force is caused to be applied by the electronic valve prior to the vehicle rider experiencing any response to terrain changes. In contrast to embodiments, the conventional mechanical inertia valve responds to a terrain change at the speed of sound or slower, such that the vehicle rider experiences a pressure wave before the conventional mechanical inertia valve is able to apply a damping force.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">Additionally, and of significance, embodiments include a control or orifice block with a control orifice therein. The control orifice functions to meter fluid flowing through the vehicle suspension damper such that the control orifice provides additional damping functions. The control orifice and the advantages thereof will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093"><figref idrefs="f0016">Figure 14</figref> shows a bicycle 1405, in accordance with an embodiment, having attached thereto a vehicle suspension damper 1410 and a set of sensors 1415. The vehicle suspension damper 1410, in this particular embodiment, is located within the front fork 1420 of the bicycle 1405. The set of sensors 1415 is configured for sensing a type of vehicle motion, such as tilt (roll), acceleration, velocity, etc. Further, the set of sensors 1415 may be positioned anywhere on<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> the vehicle that enables the receipt of accurate sensed information and which enables communication of a control signal (regarding the sensed information) to the vehicle suspension damper 1410.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">For example, in one embodiment, if the set of sensors 1415 senses that the vehicle is experiencing acceleration, the set of sensors 1415 sends a control signal to the vehicle suspension damper 1410.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095"><figref idrefs="f0017">Figure 15</figref> shows the vehicle suspension damper 1410, in accordance with an embodiment. The vehicle suspension damper 1410 includes an electronic valve 1500. The electronic valve 1500 includes at least a primary valve 1505, a first pressure reducing means which in this embodiment is an orifice block 1515, and a second pressure reducing means which in this embodiment is a pilot valve assembly 1510, all of which components cooperatively control the flow of fluid throughout the inertia valve and manipulate the fluid pressure within the pilot pressure chamber 1520.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">In basic operation, the permanent magnet 1560 of the solenoid assembly 1580 conducts through the component 1565 to attract the pilot spool 1570. This is the latched position as shown. The spool spring 1575 resists this condition. When the coil is turned on with positive polarity, it cancels the effect of the permanent magnet 1560 and the spool spring 1575 moves the pilot spool 1570 to the left or closed position. With negative polarity applied to the coil, the electromagnet is added to the permanent magnet 1560 and the pilot spool 1570 is drawn to the right or open position.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">The main oil flow path, or first fluid flow path, is through the center of the base valve and radially outwardly into piston port area 1525. Assuming there is enough pressure in the piston ports, it then blows off the valve shims 1530 and oil flows into the reservoir 40. A small amount of oil also flows in parallel through a second fluid flow path in the inertia valve 1500, and in particular through the control orifice 1535 and through the solenoid assembly 1580. This generates a pilot pressure inside the area of the primary valve 1505.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">The valve member 1540 acts to resist the valve shims 1530 from opening. This resistive force is dependent on pressure inside the area of the primary valve 1505 which is controlled by the pressure drop across the solenoid. Basically, when the solenoid is closed, there is high pressure inside the area of the primary valve 1505 (resulting in locked-out fork or firm damping, depending on the damping characteristics determined for the inertia valve 1500, as described in greater detail below). When the solenoid is open, there is low<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> pressure inside the area of the primary valve 1505 and the valve member 1540 pushes against valve shims 1530 with less force, allowing the valve shims 1530 to open under lower fluid pressure. This open position of the solenoid provides a normally-operating fork, by which is meant the damping characteristic of the inertia valve is determined predominantly by the tuning of the valve shims 1530 (although there is some damping effect provided by the control orifice 1535).</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">A more particular description follows. A control signal instructs the vehicle suspension damper 1410 to increase or decrease its damping force therein. The vehicle suspension damper 1410 is configured to respond to the control signal instruction. More particularly, the inertia valve of the vehicle suspension damper 1410, in response to the control signal instruction, quickly manipulates the pressure in the pilot pressure chamber 1520 of the inertia valve by moving/adjusting itself to at least partially close or open the flow ports 1550. The pressure in the pilot pressure chamber 1520 increases or decreases in proportion to the amount of closure or opening that the flow ports 1550 experience, respectively.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">In general, in embodiments, fluid in the inertia valve flows along a first fluid flow path from the damping cylinder interior 35 and through the shims 1530 (unless the shims 1530 are held closed under pressure from the valve member 1540, as will be described herein) via the piston port area 1525. Additionally, fluid also flows along a second fluid flow path from the damping cylinder interior 35 and through the control orifice 1535 of the orifice block 1515. After having flowed through the control orifice 1535, the fluid moves into the pilot pressure chamber 1520. From the pilot pressure chamber 1520, the fluid moves out of the pilot spool valve 1545 (wherein the pilot spool valve 1545 is in at least a partially open position) through a set of flow ports 1550 and into the reservoir 40. Additionally, from the pilot pressure chamber 1520, the fluid also moves into the area of the primary valve 1505. When the fluid presents a predetermined pressure against surface 1580 of the valve member 1540, a force proportional to the pressure is exerted on the valve member 1540 which urges it against the shims 1530. The valve member 1540 pushes against the shims 1530, thereby biasing the shims 1530 toward a closed position, even though fluid is moving through the shims 1530 from the piston port area 1525 and into the reservoir 40. If the force of the valve member 1540 against the shims 1530 is greater than the force of the fluid moving from the piston port area 1525 against the shims 1530, then the shims 1530 will become biased toward closing. Likewise, if the force of the fluid moving<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> from the piston port area 1525 against the shims 1530 is greater than the force of the valve member 1540 against the shims 1530, then the shims 1530 will be biased toward an open position, in which the fluid may remain flowing through the shims 1530.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">During compression of the shock absorber, in order to change the fluid pressure within the pilot pressure chamber 1520 in quick response to changes in the vehicle's position and speed, for example, embodiments use a control system to receive control signals from the set of sensors 1415. In accordance with the control signals received from the set of sensors 1415, the control system activates a power source that is attached to the inertia valve. The power source delivers a current to the inertia valve. The inertia valve responds to the delivered current by causing the pilot valve assembly 1510 to move and block or open at least a portion of the flow ports 1550 through which fluid may flow there through from the pilot pressure chamber 1520 and into the reservoir 40, thereby at least partially closing or opening the flow parts 1550.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">In general, upon compression of the shock absorber, the damper piston 5 moves into the damper cylinder interior 35. More particularly, when the flow ports 1550 are at least partially closed, the fluid pressure within the pilot pressure chamber 1520 increases such that the fluid pressure in the area of the primary valve 1505 also increases. This increase in the fluid pressure in the area of the primary valve 1505 causes the valve member 1540 to move toward the shims 1530 that are open and to push against the shims 1530, thereby causing the shims 1530 to at least partially or fully close. When these shims 1530 are at least partially or fully closed, the amount of fluid flowing there through decreases or stops. The movement of the damper piston 5 into the damper cylinder interior 35 causes fluid to flow through the piston port area 1525 and hence out through open shims 1530 and into the reservoir 40. The fluid also flows through the control orifice 1535 into the pilot pressure chamber 1520. If the shims 1530 are closed due to movement of the pilot valve assembly 1510 to block the flow ports 1550, then fluid may not flow out through the shims 1530 or out through the flow ports 1550 into the reservoir 40. Consequently, the ability of the damper piston 5 to move within the damper cylinder interior 35 to cause fluid to flow through the piston port area 1525 as well as through the flow ports 1550 is reduced or eliminated. The effect of the at least partial closure of the shims 1530 is to cause a damping function to occur. Thus, the movement of the pilot valve assembly<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> 1510 to at least partially block the flow ports 1550 causes the damping (or slowing of movement) of the damper piston 5 into the damper cylinder interior 35.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">In various embodiments, the control orifice 1535 operates cooperatively with the pilot valve assembly 1510 to meter the flow of fluid to the primary valve 1505. The control orifice 1535 is a pathway within the orifice block 1515 and is positioned between the damper cylinder interior 35 and the pilot pressure chamber 1520. The size of the control orifice 1535 is tunable according to the application; the size may be variously changed. The control orifice 1535 is a key component in enabling the quick and accurate response to sensed changes in a vehicle's motion. As will be explained herein, without the presence of the control orifice 1535, the vehicle would not experience damping during periods of low compression speed, or experienced too much damping during periods of high compression speeds. The pilot valve assembly 1510 would act like a bypass. In other words, without the control orifice, at low compression speed there would almost be no damping and the control orifice 1535 and pilot valve assembly 1510 would act like a bypass; but at higher compression speeds, pressure drop across the pilot valve assembly 1510 would cause a high pressure in the pilot pressure chamber 1520 and therefore too much clamping force on the shims 1530. The control orifice 1535, thus, allows damping to occur even during periods of low compression speed, and slows the damping rate during period of high compression speed.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">In this particular embodiment, it was discovered that (without the control orifice 1535) if the area of the primary valve is approximately 60% or more of the area of the piston port 1525, the valve member 1540 is hydraulically locked (at all speeds) onto the shims 1530. This led to undesirable high damping force at high compression speeds. Although in this particular embodiment the hydraulic lock occurred at about 60% area ratio and higher, this may not be true in all cases: there may be arrangements where a lock occurs at a higher or lower ratio than 60%, or where no lock occurs at all at any ratio. It is expected that that the particular ratio will be dependent on design parameters such as the valve shim arrangement and main piston design.</p><p id="p0105" num="0105">The solution is to cause a pressure drop of damping fluid before it enters the pilot pressure chamber 1520. This is achieved with the control orifice 1535. The control orifice 1535 provides some damping effect at low compression speeds (by enabling damping fluid to 'bleed' through the control orifice), but at high compression speeds provides a significant pressure drop to ensure that the<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> pressure inside the pilot pressure chamber does not get too high, thereby preventing the valve member 1540 from locking onto the shims 1530.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">In its present form, the control orifice 1535 is between 0.5mm and 2mm in diameter, but these sizes are dependent on the specific application and the desired damping curve. Pressure drop is directly proportional to the length of the control orifice 1535, but inversely proportional to its diameter. Either one or both of these parameters can be changed at the design stage to affect the performance of the control orifice 1535.</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">The essential function, in embodiments, of the control orifice 1535 is to create a pressure drop. Therefore, anything that will do this could be used in place of the specific arrangement shown. Some possible examples include: a diffuser; a labyrinth between parallel plates; leakage past a screw thread; etc.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">A further key feature of embodiments is the combination of the area of the surface 1580 inside the valve member 1540, the control orifice 1535, the pilot valve assembly 1510, and the way this combination enables a variable force to be applied to the shims 1530 to control the damping force at any point in time.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">In particular, the ratio of the surface area 1585 of the shims 1530 (The surface area 1585 is next to the piston port area 1525; the pressure is acting on the surface area 1585 of the shims 1530 as well as the surface area 1580 of the inside of the valve member 1540, within the primary valve area 1505.to the area of the surface 1580 inside the valve member 1540 controls the overall damping characteristic of the inertia valve 1500, i.e., what overall range of force can be applied to the shims 1530. By selecting this ratio appropriately, the valve member 1540 can be set up to move between full lockout and a completely soft state, or between a firm damping state and a soft state, for example.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">Within that overall range of force, a particular force at any point in time is set by the position of the pilot valve assembly 1510, which, as explained above, controls the pressure drop across the flow ports 1550. By adjusting the pressure drop across flow ports 1550, the pressure of fluid in the pilot pressure chamber 1520 is also adjusted. Since the pressure inside the pilot pressure chamber 1520 acts against surface 1580 of the valve member 1540, the force applied by the valve member 1540 to the shims is controllable by adjustment of the position of the pilot valve assembly 1510.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">It should be noted that the overall resistance to fluid flow along the first fluid flow path (i.e. through piston port area 1525 and past shims 1530) is given<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> by the sum of the force provided by the shims 1530, and the force applied to the shims 1530 by the valve member 1540.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">A significant feature is that force is generated on the valve member 1540 by control of pressure inside the area of the primary valve 1505 (in contrast to other valve bodies where force comes from pressure acting on the outside of the valve member 1540, usually from the damper reservoir). The ultimate source of pressure in the pilot pressure chamber 1520 is the pressure of the damping fluid in the main damping cylinder 35 during compression (but regulated by the control orifice 1535 and the pilot valve assembly 1510 to give a lower pressure in the pilot pressure chamber 1520).</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">There are significant advantages to the combination of the ratio of the area of the surface 1580 to the area of the piston port 1525, control orifice 1535, and the pilot valve assembly 1510. Some of them are as follows: 1) the damping force generated by inertia valve 1500 is not temperature sensitive; 2) the damping force generated by inertia valve 1500 is not position sensitive; 3) when using an electro-mechanical inertia device to control the pilot valve assembly 1510, the damping force can be turned on and off very quickly (recent experiments achieved 4ms between full firm and full soft- to the best of the applicant's knowledge and belief the fastest turning on and off of damping force in other devices is 20ms. The reason such fast speeds are achieved is because, when the pressure in the pilot pressure chamber 1520 is released, it is the pressure in the main damper (which is the same as the fluid pressure in the piston port area 1525) that pushes on the shims 1530 and moves the primary valve assembly 1510 back (which can happen very quickly). This is in contrast to other arrangements that rely on an electric motor to move a valve body, for example, which takes more time; 4) using a latching solenoid pilot valve enables full firm state to be maintained with no power; 5) the pilot valve assembly 1510 enables very large damping forces to be controlled using the same pilot valve assembly 1510 - this is because: (a) the pilot pressure is 'magnified' according to the ratio of the area of the primary valve 1505 to the area of the piston port 1525; and (b) because the pilot valve assembly 1510 is not required to move any element against the high pressure damping fluid; and 5) the primary valve assembly 1510 allows the damper to utilise conventional shims, but with some level of controllability over the damping force applied by the shims. This allows the shims to be tuned in a conventional manner. Furthermore, if power to the pilot valve assembly 1510 fails, the shock absorber will continue to operate (in contrast to<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> other electronically controlled shocks where power loss causes the shock to stop working completely).</p><p id="p0114" num="0114">Thus, the inertia valve 1500, including the primary valve 1505, the pilot valve assembly 1510, and the orifice block 1515, not only enables a variable force to be applied to shims 1530, but also enables the control of the damping force within the vehicle at any point in time. The pilot valve assembly 1510 meters a flow of fluid to the primary valve 1505 and enables the generation of relatively large damping forces by a relatively small solenoid (or other motive source), while using relatively low amounts of power.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">Furthermore, since the incompressible fluid inside of the primary valve 1505 of the shock absorber assembly causes damping to occur as the primary valve 1505 opens and the valve member 1540 collapses, embodiments enable both a controllable preload on the shims 1530 and a controllable damping rate. In one embodiment, and particularly in 4 wheel vehicles, the solenoid continuously powers the inertia valve and does not have a latching mechanism. In one embodiment, a monitor will continuously monitor power source and its operation in order to make sure that the wires leading to the power source do not get cut, thereby providing a dangerous situation for the rider and other vehicles.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">In regards to the area of the primary valve 1505, although it is shown as an internal base valve, it is not limited to this position or application. For example, it can be mounted externally of the vehicle suspension damper (for example in a 'piggy-back' reservoir). Further, it could be made part of the main damper piston (either in compression or rebound directions).</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">In considering the design of the control orifice 1535, it must have at least the following two functions: provision of low speed bleed; and provision of sufficient pressure drop at high speed to prevent hydraulic lock of the valve member 1540 onto the shims 1525. The general methodology for determining the diameter and/or length of the control orifice 1535 during design is as follows: (1) identify the desired damping curve that the damper should have; (2) determine from step (1) the target low speed damping force; (3) determine from step (1) the target high speed damping force; (4) make informed guess at control orifice diameter and/or length to achieve steps (2) and (3); (5) test the output damping forces produced by shock at different speeds within low to high speed range; (6) compare the measured damping curve against the desired damping curve; (7) if there is too much high speed damping force, then reduce the diameter of the control orifice (to lower the pressure inside the pilot pressure chamber 1520); (8)<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> if there is too much low speed damping force, then decrease the area ratio (between the area of the primary valve 1505 and the piston port area 1525), and increase the diameter of the control orifice 1535; and (9) repeat steps (5)-(8) until a good approximate to a desired damping curve is obtained. It is to be noted that in steps (7) and (8) the length of the control orifice can also be adjusted, either separately or in addition to the diameter, to achieve a similar effect.</p><p id="p0118" num="0118">In various embodiments, it was found that the pilot valve assembly 1510 would "auto-close" at a certain oil high flow rate. In one embodiment, a diffuser pin inserted into the vehicle suspension damper downstream of the control orifice 1535 is used to eliminate this auto-closing issue. <figref idrefs="f0018">Figure 16A</figref> shows an electronic valve 1600A with a diffuser pin 1605 positioned through one set of the cross holes 1610 going to the primary valve area 1505, in accordance with an embodiment.

The diffuser pin 1605 functions to disrupt the jet flow coming out of the control orifice 1535. <figref idrefs="f0019">Figure 16B</figref> shows an electronic valve 1600B with a diffuser plug 1620 pressed into, at least one of and at least partially, the orifice block 1515 and the pilot pressure chamber 1520, in accordance with an embodiment.

In this embodiment, the spool retainer 1635 (see <figref idrefs="f0019">Figure 16B</figref>) is replaced with the diffuser pin 1630. The diffuser pin 1630 and its position within the vehicle suspension damper 1600C functions to disrupt the jet flow coming out of the control orifice 1535 and to minimize the contact of the pilot spool assembly 1510 in the firm setting.</p><p id="p0119" num="0119">In another embodiment, the solenoid includes a "latching" mechanism to open and close the pressure-balanced pilot spool. Due to the latching configuration of the solenoid, power is only required to open or close the pilot valve assembly 1510. Power is not required to hold the pilot valve assembly 1510 open or closed in either setting. Consequently, embodiments enable reduced power consumption compared to the traditional shock absorber.</p><p id="p0120" num="0120">Further embodiments provide an externally-adjustable means of tuning the open state of the damper. An adjuster turns in or out to vary the effective orifice size of the pilot spool valve 1545 when in the open position.

A compression chamber is formed on one side of the piston 166 and a rebound chamber is formed on the other side of the piston 166.

In one embodiment, the latching solenoid assembly 905 (or latching spool valve assembly) includes: a pilot spool 210 which includes a magnetically active material; a spring 915 which is normally in compression and biases the pilot spool 210 toward a position obstructing ports 50A; a permanent magnet 920; and a coil 220 where power is supplied to the coil 220 by (in one embodiment) wires 925.

In one embodiment, the position of the spool valve assembly may be adjusted axially by means of the low speed adjuster 935. The low speed adjuster 935 (comprising multiple pieces), being for example, threaded at its lower end to the top cap 20 via the low speed adjuster threads 940, may be rotated to facilitate axial movement. In one embodiment, the<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> low speed adjuster 935 includes a non-round shape (e.g., hexagonal) that facilitates the rotation with relative axial movement (see 1105 of <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 11</figref>).</p><p id="p0144" num="0144">With reference now to <figref idrefs="f0011 f0012 f0013 f0014 f0015">FIGS. 9-13</figref>, when the lower portion of the low speed adjuster 935 moves downward axially, the cartridge of the pilot spool 210 is correspondingly moved and thereby further compresses the spring 915. As the cartridge is moved downward, the low speed adjuster metering edge 950 is moved into further obstruction of ports 50B, thereby restricting flow of damping fluid through the damper from an interior of the pilot spool valve assembly to an exterior of the damping assembly (note the open ports 50B shown in <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 12</figref>, in which the pilot spool valve 920 is shown in the open pilot position with the low speed adjuster 935 in the soft position).</p><p id="p0145" num="0145">In one embodiment, the pilot spool 210 is biased by spring 915 toward a position wherein the metering edge 930 of the pilot spool 210 further obstructs ports 50A (see <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 13</figref>, wherein the pilot spool 210 is shown in the open pilot position with the low speed adjuster 935 in the middle position). A force opposing the bias of the spring 915 is exerted on the magnetic component of the pilot spool 210 by the permanent magnet 920. When the pilot spool 210 is in its uppermost (corresponding to open ports 50A) position, it is retained by the magnetic force between the permanent magnet 920 and the pilot spool valve 925 where that force is sufficient to overcome the bias of the spring 915 (thereby holding the spring 915 in a compressed state).

For example, in one embodiment, the set of sensors 1415 is positioned on the seat post of a bicycle. In another embodiment, a first set of sensors is positioned near the front wheel, while a second set of sensors is positioned near the rear wheel.</p><p id="p0151" num="0151">In one embodiment, the set of sensors includes three accelerometers. The accelerometers define a plane of the vehicle's body, such that the acceleration and the tilt (i.e., pitch and roll) of the vehicle body may be measured. When the set of sensors senses vehicle motion which is determined to meet and/or exceed a predetermined threshold, then the set of sensors sends a control signal to the control system attached to the vehicle suspension damper. The predetermined threshold may be a constant in one embodiment. However, in another embodiment, the predetermined threshold may be a variable based on other situations sensed on the vehicle. Once a control signal is received by the power source, the power source that is attached to the vehicle suspension damper becomes activated. Upon activation, the power source sends a current to the vehicle suspension damper, thereby causing the pilot valve assembly to move, as was described herein. Various methods of sensing via accelerometers and other forms of motion via sensors are known in the art.<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --></p><p id="p0152" num="0152">As described herein, the vehicle upon which a set of sensors and a vehicle suspension damper may be attached may be a bicycle, a Side by Side, a snowmobile, etc. In the situation in which the vehicle is a Side by Side, such as a recreational off highway vehicle (ROV), more than one set of sensors may be used. For example, each wheel base (4) may include an embodiment of the system of the present technology. More specifically, each wheel base has attached thereto a different set of sensors, such as a set of accelerometers, each set being attached to a separate vehicle suspension damper. In another embodiment, one set of sensors (e.g., set of accelerometers) is attached to the ROV, as well as being attached to one or more vehicle suspension dampers.</p><p id="p0153" num="0153">If the ROV is traveling along a path that does not have any bumps or uneven terrain, then the vehicle suspension dampers may each be programmed to operate in a fully open mode (i.e., soft mode), in which the pilot spool valve 1545 of the pilot valve assembly 1510 is open to the flow ports 1550, thereby allowing fluid to flow from the damper cylinder interior 35 and into the reservoir 40 either through the first fluid flow path, with resistance provided by the shims 1530 (and no additional force provided by the valve member 1540), and/or through the control orifice 1535 that permits low speed bleed of damping fluid via the second fluid flow path. Thus, for example, when the right front tire of an ROV hits a large rock, the right front tire and a portion of the suspension attached to the tire (or attached wheel base) may rise upwards to move over the rock. The set of sensors attached to the ROV's right front side will sense the tire's upward movement, and will sense the tire reaching its peak upward movement (the peak of the rock), and will sense the tire beginning to move downwards. In one embodiment, the set of sensors on the ROV's right front side would send control signals to the vehicle suspension damper attached to the ROV's right front side throughout the tire's movement upward and downward. The control system attached to the vehicle suspension damper receives the control signals and causes the power source also attached to the vehicle suspension damper to deliver a current to the vehicle suspension damper in accordance with the control signals. In one embodiment, the delivered current functions to cause the pilot valve assembly 1510 to move to cause the flow ports 1550 to be at least partially blocked. As described herein, the pressure within the pilot pressure chamber 1520 increases due to the at least partially blocked flowports 1550, thereby causing the pressure within the area of the primary valve 1505 to increase. The valve member 1540, in response increased pressure in the area of the primary<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> valve 1505, is urged against the shims 1530, thereby changing the damping characteristics of the shims 1530. Thus, the fluid flowing along the first fluid flow path from the damper cylinder interior 35 and through the piston port area 1525 is reduced, resulting in an increased damping effect to the vehicle's motion.</p><p id="p0154" num="0154">Embodiments enable a faster reaction time in applying damping than conventional shock absorbers provide. For example, in conventional mechanical inertia valves, the inertia valve senses a pressure wave (occurring at the speed of sound) after a vehicle's tire hits a bump. The mechanical inertia valve opens in response to receiving the pressure wave. However, the vehicle rider experiences some form of response to the terrain before the mechanical inertia valve has a chance to open into a "soft" mode. In embodiments using an electronic valve attached to accelerometers, the inertia valve opens into a "soft" mode before a motion significant enough for a vehicle rider to experience it has begun. For example, when a motion occurs, such as an ROV wheel base beginning to move upward while running over a large rock, and thus experience a gross wheel movement, an acceleration occurs first and is thus measured first by embodiments. A velocity, and then a displacement follows and are also measured in some embodiments. A control signal is sent from the set of accelerometers to the control system before enough of a vehicle motion has occurred such that the vehicle rider experiences a minimal response to the terrain and certainly less than would be provided should a mechanical inertia valve be provided. It should be appreciated that one or more set of sensors may be attached to each ROV wheel base, and independently control the vehicle suspension damper to account for and respond to various rolls and other types of vehicle motion. Embodiments enable the quick response to sensed acceleration such that the acceleration may be prevented, or at least reduced.</p><p id="p0155" num="0155">In one embodiment, one or more motion sensor is provided on a forward or front part of a vehicle, and a signal or signals from the one or more motion sensor is used to control a damper mounted on a rear part of the vehicle. In use, motion information learned from the movement of the front part of the vehicle can be used to anticipate movement of the rear part of the vehicle, and adjustments made to control the damper on the rear part accordingly.</p><p id="p0156" num="0156">Thus, one embodiment enables the control of both compression and the rebound state of the vehicle suspension damper, such that acceleration as measured at each wheel base is maintained as close to zero as possible throughout off-road riding over varied terrain.

the second fluid pressure acts on a said surface of said primary valve member so that the primary valve member increases its resistance to damping fluid flow along said first fluid flow path.</claim-text></claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0015" num="0015"><claim-text>A vehicle comprising a vehicle suspension damper as claimed in any of claims 1 to 13.</claim-text></claim></claims><drawings mxw-id="PDW16671287" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --><figure id="f0001" num="1A"><img id="if0001" file="imgf0001.tif" wi="140" he="230" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --><figure id="f0002" num="1B"><img id="if0002" file="imgf0002.tif" wi="98" he="230" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --><figure id="f0003" num="2"><img id="if0003" file="imgf0003.tif" wi="165" he="210" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --><figure id="f0004" num="3"><img id="if0004" file="imgf0004.tif" wi="162" he="192" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --><figure id="f0005" num="4"><img id="if0005" file="imgf0005.tif" wi="161" he="181" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --><figure id="f0006" num="5A"><img id="if0006" file="imgf0006.tif" wi="165" he="172" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --><figure id="f0007" num="5B"><img id="if0007" file="imgf0007.tif" wi="165" he="186" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --><figure id="f0008" num="6"><img id="if0008" file="imgf0008.tif" wi="165" he="168" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --><figure id="f0009" num="7"><img id="if0009" file="imgf0009.tif" wi="165" he="168" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --><figure id="f0010" num="8A,8B"><img id="if0010" file="imgf0010.tif" wi="165" he="209" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --><figure id="f0011" num="9"><img id="if0011" file="imgf0011.tif" wi="134" he="229" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --><figure id="f0012" num="10"><img id="if0012" file="imgf0012.tif" wi="165" he="217" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="52"> --><figure id="f0013" num="11"><img id="if0013" file="imgf0013.tif" wi="165" he="214" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --><figure id="f0014" num="12"><img id="if0014" file="imgf0014.tif" wi="165" he="212" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --><figure id="f0015" num="13"><img id="if0015" file="imgf0015.tif" wi="165" he="212" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="55"> --><figure id="f0016" num="14"><img id="if0016" file="imgf0016.tif" wi="165" he="180" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="56"> --><figure id="f0017" num="15"><img id="if0017" file="imgf0017.tif" wi="165" he="208" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="57"> --><figure id="f0018" num="16A"><img id="if0018" file="imgf0018.tif" wi="165" he="208" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="58"> --><figure id="f0019" num="16B,16C"><img id="if0019" file="imgf0019.tif" wi="165" he="233" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><copyright>User acknowledges that Fairview Research LLC and its third party providers retain all right, title and interest in and to this xml under applicable copyright laws.
