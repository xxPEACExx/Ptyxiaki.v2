More particularly, the present invention to a method and apparatus for compensating coordinates of an electronic pen, particularly as when used in electronic devices touchscreens.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Description of the Related Art</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A digitizer is a device often arranged in a computer for receiving coordinates from a user in lieu of a key board or a mouse, and has been widely used in all kinds of electronic devices, such as in smartphones and tablets, etc.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In a method of detecting coordinates input by the user in the digitizer, there has been a method of using a magnetic field. The conventional method is described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The conventional method uses a digitizer 110 that includes a plurality of loop coils 112 arranged orthogonally to one another. The digitizer 110 repeatedly performs application of alternate current (AC) for producing magnetic fields and detection of a magnetic field generated by the electronic pen 120, while sequentially selecting the loop coils 112.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The electronic pen 120 inputs coordinates on the digitizer 110 includes an LC circuit 122 consisting of a coil and a capacitor. A current is induced in the coil from the magnetic field produced in the digitizer 110 and is passed to the capacitor. The capacitor is charged with the current from the coil, and the discharge current from the capacitor flows to the coil. Accordingly, a magnetic field is produced around the coil and is detected at the digitizer 110.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The coil within the electronic pen 120 is kept a distance from an end part (hereinafter, referred to as a "tip") of the electronic pen 120 that contacts the digitizer 110, and the distance, in case the coordinates are input with the electronic pen 120 being inclined, may cause an error between coordinates desired by the user and recognized by the digitizer 110.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, such a problem will be explained in more detail.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, when the user inputs coordinates in the digitizer 110 with the electronic pen 120 being inclined (which is the typical natural way to hold a pen and mark a paper, tablet, screen, etc.), an error occurs between coordinates X desired by the user and coordinates X' recognized by the digitizer 110, the error corresponding to a distance d. The reason for such an error as described above is because the coil 124 within the LC resonance circuit 122 is kept a distance away from the tip 126 of the electronic pen 120. In other words, since a magnetic field 130 produced around the coil 124 has a curved form that does not pass through the tip 126 of the electronic pen 120, the coordinates at which the magnetic field is detected in the digitizer are not the coordinates X that the user actually wants and has arranged the tip of the pen on, but the coordinates X' with the distance d from the coordinates X.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Meanwhile, to solve the problem of the error occurrence, as described above with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, there is a method of applying a set compensation value to the detected coordinates. The conventional method is described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3A</figref>, the digitizer 110 recognizes coordinate X resulting from application of the compensation value as much as the error "d" to the coordinate X' at which the magnetic field is detected. Thus, the coordinate X recognized by the digitizer 110 is the same as the coordinate X that the user actually wants to input. However, the method applies the compensation value without taking into account inclination of the electronic pen 120 and/or the inclined direction, a problem of which will be described in connection with <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref>, which have different inclinations than <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates a case where the user inputs coordinates with the electronic pen 120 being essentially perpendicular to the digitizer 110. The coordinates X at which the magnetic field is detected in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3B</figref> are the same as the coordinate X that the user wants to input. However, according to the conventional method, even in this case, the coordinate X' to which the compensation value as much as the error d is applied are recognized as the input coordinates from the user. Thus, the error d exists between the coordinate X that the user wants to input and the coordinate X' recognized by the digitizer 110.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3C</figref>, in a case where the electronic pen 120 is inclined in the opposite direction to that of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3A</figref> (for example, a common angle by a left-handed person), the digitizer 110 recognizes the coordinate X" resulting from application of the compensation value as much as the error d to the coordinate X' at which the magnetic field is detected as the input coordinates from the user. Thus, the error 2d between the coordinates X that the user wants to input and the coordinates X" recognized by the digitizer 110 rather increases.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Thus, according to the conventional method in which a coordinate of an electronic pen is recognized, a problem arises that there is an error between coordinates that a user wants to input and coordinates recognized by a digitizer. Furthermore, according to the conventional method of compensating the coordinates of the electronic pen with a set compensation value, the error between the coordinates that a user wants to input and coordinates recognized by a digitizer increases depending on inclination of the electronic pen and inclined direction, meaning that the conventional method of compensation at times introduced additional error into the system.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention provides a method and apparatus providing more accurate coordinate recognition of by determining whether or not to perform coordinate compensation based on whether the electronic pen is inclined.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The present invention also provides a method and apparatus providing more accurate coordinate recognition by performing coordinate compensation that takes into account the inclination of an electronic pen used against or near a screen.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In accordance with an exemplary aspect of the present invention, a method of compensating coordinates of an electronic pen in a digitizer includes detecting at least one magnetic field that is produced by the electronic pen and that has a different central axis each other; determining whether the electronic pen is inclined based on a number of detected magnetic fields; and determining by a controller whether to apply a compensation value for compensating coordinates of the electronic pen based on the determination of whether the electronic pen is inclined.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In accordance with another exemplary aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for compensating coordinates of an electronic pen in a digitizer preferably<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> including: a pad on which to detect at least one of the magnetic fields produced by the electronic pen; and a controller that is configured to determine whether or not the electronic pen is inclined based on a number of magnetic fields detected on the pad, and determining whether to apply a compensation value for compensating the coordinates of the electronic pen based on the determination of whether the electronic pen is inclined.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In accordance with another exemplary aspect of the present invention, an electronic pen comprises: a first resonator for receiving a magnetic field produced by a digitizer and producing a first magnetic field having the same central axis as that of the electronic pen; and N resonators for producing N magnetic fields having central axes at predetermined angles from the central axis of the first magnetic field, N being an integer quantity of two or more.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">The above and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art by describing in detail exemplary embodiments thereof with reference to the attached drawings in which:
