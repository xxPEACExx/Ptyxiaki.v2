load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to surgical devices for repairing body tissue, including fasteners capable of fastening objects to body tissue. In embodiments, the present disclosure provides a surgical fastener capable of changing its shape in vivo to secure tissue or a device; such as a surgical mesh, to tissue. Methods for using such fasteners are also provided.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A number of surgical procedures require instruments that are capable or applying a surgical fastener to tissue in order to form tissue connections or to secure objects to tissue. For example, during hernia repair it is often desirable to fasten a surgical mesh to the underlying body tissue. In certain hernias, such as direct or indirect inguinal hernias, a part of the intestine protrudes through a defect or an opening in the supporting abdominal wall to form a hernial sac. The opening can be repaired using an open surgery procedure in which a relatively large incision is made in the patient and the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> hernia is closed off outside the abdominal wall by suturing. Alternatively, a mesh may be attached with sutures over the opening to provide reinforcement.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Less invasive surgical procedures are currently available for hernia repair. In laparoscopic procedures, surgery is performed in the abdomen through a small incision, while in endoscopic procedures surgery is performed through narrow endoscopic tubes inserted through small incisions in the body. Laparoscopic and endoscopic procedures generally require long and narrow instruments capable of reaching deep within the body and configured to form a seal with the incision or tube through which they are inserted.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Currently, endoscopic techniques for hernia repair utilize fasteners, such as surgical staples or clips, to secure a mesh to tissue in order to provide reinforcement to the repair and in order to provide structure for encouragement of tissue ingrowth. These staples or clips need to be compressed against the tissue and mesh in order to secure the two together thereby requiring a tool which is positioned on each side of the mesh and tissue in order to deform the staple or clip. Another type of fastener suited for use in affixing mesh to tissue, during procedures such as hernia repair, is a coil fastener having a helically coiled body portion terminating in a tissue penetrating tip, which helical fastener is screwed into the mesh and body tissue. An example of this type of fastener is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5258000A"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 5,258,000</text></patcit>. Devices which introduce elongated wire fasteners and are capable of imparting shapes, for example annular shapes, to the wire as it is introduced into a patient's body are also known.

Shape memory polymeric materials utilized to form a fastener of the present disclosure possess a permanent shape and a temporary shape. In embodiments, the temporary shape is of a configuration which enhances the ability for the surgeon to introduce a surgical fastener into a patient's body. The permanent shape, which is assumed in vivo upon application of heat, such as body heat, is of a configuration which enhances the retention of the surgical fastener in tissue and/or adhering a device such as a mesh to tissue. In embodiments, the surgical fastener possesses a straight temporary shape which facilitates its insertion into tissue, and a permanent shape which may, in embodiments, be curved or helical to secure tissue or affix a device to tissue.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In embodiments the surgical fastener may possess a curved temporary shape and a curved permanent shape possessing greater curvature than the temporary shape. In other embodiments the surgical fastener may possess a curved temporary shape and a helical permanent shape. In some embodiments surgical fasteners of the present disclosure may possess barbs oriented on the surface thereof which permit insertion into tissue but not removal therefrom. Surgical fasteners of the present disclosure may possess any other geometry or configuration which permits insertion into tissue but resists removal therefrom. In embodiments the geometry or configuration permitting insertion may be the temporary shape, while the geometry or configuration resisting removal may be the permanent shape.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Suitable shape memory polymeric materials which may be utilized in a surgical fastener of the present disclosure include, for example, polyurethanes, poly(styrenebutadiene) block copolymers, polynorbornenes, caprolactones, dioxanones, diol esters including oligo (epsilon caprolactone) diol, lactic acid, lactide, glycolic acid, glycolide, ether-ester diols including oligo (p-dioxanone) diol, carbonates including trimethylene carbonate, combinations thereof, and the like. In embodiments, the shape memory polymer may be a copolymer of two components with different thermal characteristics, such as oligo (epsilon-caprolactone) dimethacrylates and butyl acrylates, including poly(epsilon-caprolactone) dimethacrylate-poly (n-butyl acrylate), or a diol ester and an ether-ester diol such as oligo (epsilon caprolactone) diol/oligo (p-dioxanone) diol copolymers. These multi-block oligo (epsilon-caprolactone) diol/oligo (p-dioxanone) diol copolymers possess two block segments: a "hard" segment and a "switching" segment linked together in linear chains. Such materials are disclosed, for example, in<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Lendlein, "Shape Memory Polymers-Biodegradable Sutures," Materials World, Vol. 10, no. 7, pp. 29-30 (July 2002</text></nplcit>).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In other embodiments, blends of bioabsorbable materials may be utilized including, but not limited to, urethanes blended with lactic acid and/or glycolic acid, homopolymers thereof or copolymers thereof, and acrylates blended with caprolactones such as polycaprolactone dimethacrylate poly(butyl acrylate) blends, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Other examples of suitable shape memory polymers and means for forming permanent and temporary shapes therewith are set forth in <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Lendlein et al., "Shape memory polymers as stimuli-sensitive implant materials," Clinical Hemorheology and Microcirculation, 32 (2005) 105-116</text></nplcit>, and <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Lendlein et al., "Biodegradable, Elastic Shape memory Polymers for Potential Biomedical Applications," Science, Vol. 269 (2002) 1673-1676</text></nplcit>.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In embodiments, a molding process may be utilized to produce the surgical fastener of the present disclosure. Plastic molding methods are within the purview of those skilled in the art and include, but are not limited to, melt molding, solution molding, and the like. Injection molding, extrusion molding, compression molding and other methods can also be used as the melt molding technique. Once placed in the mold with the proper dimensions and configuration, the polymeric material used to form the surgical fastener may be heated to a suitable temperature, referred to as the permanent temperature (T<sub>perm</sub>) which may, in embodiments, be the melting temperature of the shape memory polymeric material utilized to form the surgical fastener. Heating of the surgical<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> fastener may be at suitable temperatures including, for example, from about 40°C to about 180°C, in embodiments from about 80°C to about 150°C, for a period of time of from about 10 minutes to about 60 minutes, in embodiments from about 15 minutes to about 20 minutes, to obtain the permanent shape and dimensions, including its desired curvature.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In embodiments, a fastener of the present disclosure may have a helical configuration as its temporary shape, its permanent shape, or both. In other embodiments, each end of the fastener may adopt a helical or curved configuration as its permanent shape while the middle portion of the fastener may retain a straight configuration.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In other embodiments each end of a surgical fastener of the present disclosure may adopt an enlarged cross-sectional profile as its permanent shape while the middle portion of the fastener may retain a straight and, in embodiments, a narrow configuration.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">After the surgical fastener with the desired curvature has been formed, the surgical fastener may be deformed at a deforming temperature to obtain, in embodiments, a straight temporary shape. Suitable temperatures for deformation will vary depending on the shape memory polymer utilized, but generally may be above the transition temperature of the polymer (T<sub>trans</sub>), but below the T<sub>perm</sub>. In embodiments, the shape memory polymer may be cooled from its T<sub>perm</sub> to a lower temperature which remains above the T<sub>trans</sub> and deformed, in embodiments by hand, to a straight temporary shape. In other embodiments, the surgical fastener may be straightened and cooled to room temperature (about 20° C to about 25° C) to obtain its straight temporary shape, although the temperature may differ depending upon the particular polymer employed. The<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> surgical fastener may then be cooled to a temperature below the T<sub>trans</sub> of the material utilized to form the fastener, at which time the surgical fastener of the present disclosure is ready for use. As the T<sub>trans</sub> is usually greater than room temperature, in embodiments cooling to room temperature may be sufficient to form the temporary shape.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">There are no particular limitations on the manner in which the deformation can be achieved. Deformation can be achieved either by hand or by means of a suitable device selected to provide the desired temporary straightness to the surgical fastener.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In order to keep the shape of the surgical fastener in its temporary shape, the shape memory surgical fastener of the present disclosure should be stored at a temperature which will not cause plastic deformation of the polymers. In embodiments, the shape memory surgical fastener may be stored in a refrigerator.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The surgical fasteners thus prepared recover their originally memorized curved or helical shape on heating, either by placement in a patient's body, or the addition of exogenous heat at a prescribed temperature, in embodiments above the T<sub>trans</sub> of the shape memory polymer utilized. As the surgical fasteners of the present disclosure are utilized in a living body, heating with body heat (about 37° C) is possible. In such a case, the temperature for shape memorization should be as low as possible. In embodiments, recovery of the permanent shape may occur from about 1 second to about 5 seconds after insertion into tissue.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">However, in some embodiments a higher shape memory temperature may be desirable in order to make the shape recover at a slightly higher temperature than body temperature. Thus, in some cases, releasing the surgical fastener from deformation to recover the originally memorized curved or helical shape can be achieved by heating. On<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> heating at a temperature of from about 30° C to about 50° C, in embodiments from about 39° C to about 43° C, the temporary thin shape may be released and the memorized permanent curved or helical shape recovered. The higher the temperature for heating, the shorter the time for recovery of the originally memorized shape. The means for this heating is not limited. Heating can be accomplished by using a gas or liquid heating medium, heating devices, ultrasonic waves, electrical induction, and the like. Of course, in an application involving a living body, care must be taken to utilize a heating temperature which will not cause burns. Examples of liquid heating media include, physiological saline solution, alcohol, combinations thereof, and the like.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Similarly, in other embodiments, electrically active polymers, also known as electroactive polymers, which can alter their configuration upon application of electricity, may be utilized to fashion anchoring means to secure a cannula within the body. Suitable examples of electroactive polymers include poly(aniline), substituted poly(aniline)s, polycarbazoles, substituted polycarbazoles, polyindoles, poly(pyrrole)s, substituted poly(pyrrole)s, poly(thiophene)s, substituted poly(thiophene)s, poly(acetylene)s, poly(ethylene dioxythiophene)s, poly(ethylenedioxypyrrole)s, poly(p-phenylene vinylene)s, and the like, or combinations including at least one of the foregoing electroactive polymers. Blends or copolymers or composites of the foregoing electroactive polymers may also be used.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Similar to the change in shape which a shape memory material may undergo upon the application of energy, such as heat, in embodiments an electroactive polymer may undergo a change in shape upon the application of electricity from a low voltage electrical source (such as a battery). Suitable amounts of electricity which may be<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> applied to effect such change will vary with the electroactive polymer utilized, but can be from about 5 volts to about 30 volts, in embodiments from about 10 volts to about 20 volts. The application of electricity will result in the fastener constructed of the electroactive polymer changing its shape into a fastening configuration.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">While an electroactive polymer does not have the same permanent shape and temporary shape as those terms are described above with respect to shape memory polymers, as used herein the term "permanent shape" as applied to an electroactive polymer means, in embodiments, the shape the electroactive polymer adopts upon the application of electricity, and the term "temporary shape" as applied to an electroactive polymer means, in embodiments, the shape of the electroactive polymer adopts in the absence of electricity.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In embodiments, the surgical fastener of the present disclosure made of a shape memory polymeric material may be bioabsorbable. Times for absorption can vary from about 5 days to about 2 years after implantation, in embodiments from about 1 week to about 3 months after implantation, depending on the composition of the surgical fastener, its shape, and the like.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Mechanisms for introducing a fastener of the present disclosure into tissue during a surgical procedure are similar to known fastener introducers. The fastener of the present disclosure may be introduced into tissue and/or a medical device, including a mesh, by any means within the purview of those skilled in the art, including by hand or by conventional mechanical devices. In embodiments, an apparatus similar to the apparatus disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US20030236534A"><text>U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0236534</text></patcit><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> , may be utilized to introduce a fastener of the present disclosure in vivo.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">There is also disclosed a method of securing tissue, or a device such as a mesh to tissue, which includes providing the fastener of the present disclosure. The fastener may be inserted into tissue utilizing any method or means within the purview of those skilled in the art. In embodiments, a fastener may be inserted endoscopically or laparoscopically through a mesh into tissue and heated, in embodiments by body heat, in other embodiments by exogenous heat, whereupon the fastener reverts to its permanent helical shape and is able to adhere tissue together or a device, such as a mesh, to tissue. In other embodiments, where the fastener is made of an electroactive polymer, the fastening configuration of the fastener may be adopted upon the application of electricity. The number of surgical fasteners necessary to adhere tissue, or affix a device such as a mesh to tissue, will vary depending upon the configuration and length of the wound or defect, such as a hernia, to be repaired.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">For example, as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, surgical fastener 10 generally includes an elongated shaft 20. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a depiction of a surgical fastener of the present disclosure in its straight temporary shape, prior to use.

In other embodiments, proximal end 40 may also be pointed (not shown).</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">As depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, once heated, either by body heat or the application of exogenous heat, surgical fastener 10 adopts its permanent shape, in embodiments a linear shaft 20 with distal end 30 curling to form a helical protrusion 50 and proximal end 40<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> similarly curling to form helical protrusion 60. The formation of helical protrusions 50 and 60 assist in anchoring surgical fastener 10 to tissue.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Use of a fastener of the present disclosure is now described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGs. 3 and 4</figref>. Prior to use, surgical fastener 10 is of a temporary straight configuration as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. As depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 3</figref>, pointed distal end 30 of surgical fastener 10 may be advanced through a pore or similar opening in a mesh 70, or in embodiments may puncture mesh 70, which may be utilized to repair a hernia. Distal end 30 of surgical fastener 10 may then be advanced through tissue 80, so that distal end 30 and proximal end 40 of surgical fastener 10 are on opposite sides of the combination of mesh 70 and tissue 80.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The heat of the patient, or the application of heat from an exogenous source, may then be used to heat surgical fastener 10 whereby it recovers its curved or helical, permanent shape. In embodiments, the heat of the body (about 37° C), may be sufficient for the surgical fastener to return to its curved or helical, permanent shape. In other embodiments, heat may be applied to the surgical fastener, in embodiments from about 39° C to about 43° C (just above human body temperature), to enhance the return of the shape memory polymer to its permanent shape. In other embodiments where the fastener is made of an electroactive polymer, the application of electricity may cause the fastener to recover its permanent fastening shape.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">As depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 4</figref>, upon the application of heat, distal end 30 curls to form helical protrusion 50 and proximal end 40 similarly curls to form helical protrusion 60. Helical protrusion 50 remains on the tissue side of the mesh/tissue combination, while helical protrusion 60 remains on the mesh side of the mesh/tissue combination, so that<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> helical protrusion 50 and helical protrusion 60 attach mesh 70 to tissue 80. As noted above, the number of surgical fasteners necessary to affix a mesh to tissue will vary depending upon the configuration and length of the wound or defect, such as a hernia, to be repaired.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">While the figures depict surgical fasteners adopting helical configurations to attach meshes to tissue, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that surgical fasteners may adopt alternate configurations to thereby secure a mesh or similar device to tissue, as well as to affix tissue to tissue. Such configurations include, for example, annular or circular configurations, spiral or corkscrew configurations, bent configurations, and the like. In embodiments, the configuration may include any permanent shape which secures tissue or a mesh or similar device to tissue. In some embodiments, a permanent shape having a larger cross-section at the ends may be sufficient.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In addition, while the figures depict surgical fasteners which pass through tissue and a device adjacent thereto a single time, in embodiments, a surgical fastener may pass through a mesh and tissue multiple times as it reverts from its temporary shape to its permanent shape. In this embodiment, it may be advantageous for proximal end 40 of surgical fastener 10 to have a point similar to the one depicted for distal end 30. In this embodiment, similar to the application described with <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> above, the distal end of a fastener is passed through a mesh and tissue. As heat is applied to the surgical fastener in vivo, and as distal end 30 curls to adopt its helical shape, it may pass through the tissue and mesh a second time at a different location, and then pass again through the mesh and tissue a third time, in embodiments even more times, so that the resulting helix<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> formed has portions on the mesh side of the mesh/tissue combination and portions on the tissue side of the mesh/tissue combination. Similarly, while not required, where proximal end 40 is similarly pointed, upon heating, as proximal end 40 curls to adopt its helical shape, it may pass through the mesh and tissue at a different location than the one where distal end 30 passed through mesh and tissue, and proximal end 40 may then pass again through the tissue and mesh a second time so that the helix formed has portions on the mesh side of the mesh/tissue combination and portions on the tissue side of the mesh/tissue combination.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In embodiments, it may be desirable to add optional ingredients, including medicinal agents, to the shape memory polymers utilized to form surgical fasteners of the present disclosure.
