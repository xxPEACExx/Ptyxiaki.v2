Such guide channel is delimited by a lower support surface, an upper surface opposite the support surface and by two side surfaces opposite each other formed in a system of walls screwed to the support structure of the orientator and shaped to adapt to the shape of the object to be orientated. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2007116155A1"><text>WO2007/116155A1</text></patcit> describes an orientation device according to the preamble of claim 1 with an adjustable extractor side wall.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Such prior solutions, despite being structurally simple and economical, have the drawback that in the case of jamming of one or two objects, such as capsules, inside the guide channel, the latter can only be released by acting from outside on the jammed objects, for example with a screwdriver, or by dismantling the extractor to open the guide channel thereof and remove the jammed objects. This entails undesirable downtime of the orientator, as well as the risk of damage to the extractor and to the manipulated objects during such intervention. In addition, for the correct mutual<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> positioning of the guide walls after dismantling a specialised operator may need to be called in.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The purpose of the present invention is therefore to make available an orientation device of objects having characteristics such as to overcome the drawbacks mentioned with reference to the prior art.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Within such general purpose, one specific purpose is to propose an orientation device of objects having characteristics such as to reduce downtime in the case of jamming of the extractor.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A further purpose of the invention is to propose an orientation device of objects which permits the objects jammed to be liberated from the extractor without having to use tools or implements inside the guide channel.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A further purpose of the invention is to propose an orientation device of objects having characteristics such as to overcome the need to dismantle the extractor in the case of jamming and during cleaning and maintenance operations of the guide channel.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">These and other purposes are achieved by an orientation device according to claim 1 or claim 2.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The dependent claims refer to advantageous embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to the invention, the orientation device comprises:<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> -->

The handling path 6 is delimited upstream by a feed point or feed section 9 of the objects 2, downstream by a removal point 10 of the objects 2, and comprises an orientation section 11, positioned downstream of the feed point 9 with reference to the direction of movement 8.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The orientation device 1 may also comprise means of<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> expulsion 26, positioned along the orientation section 11 and configured so as to expel the objects having an orientation different from the desired orientation from the orientation seats 4.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The orientation device 1 further comprises an extractor 45 suitable for receiving the (orientated) objects 2 in a removal point 10 of the handling path 6 and distancing the objects 2 from the orientation seats 4 along an extraction path 37 defined by a guide channel 18. The guide channel 18 comprises at least one wall 25 movable in a guided manner between an open position (<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig.5</figref>) distanced from the extraction path 37 so that the guide channel 18 is open transversally to the extraction path 37 and a working position (<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig.6</figref>) approximated to the extraction path 37 so that the guide channel 18 is closed transversally to the extraction path 37, as well as releasable blocking means 27 for blocking the mobile wall 25 in the working position.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Thanks to the guided mobile wall 25 and the releasable blocking means 27, the guide channel 18 can be easily opened and closed in case of jamming of the orientated objects, cleaning of the extractor 45 or general maintenance. Downtime of the orientation device 1 is thereby shortened and the need to dismantle the extractor 45 or intervene with implements or tools in the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> guide channel 18 which may damage the extractor itself or the jammed objects, is thereby overcome. Moreover, thanks to the guided opening and closing of the mobile wall and to the blocking means, the mobile wall itself may be easily positioned and firmly held in its correct working position without any need for specialised technicians to be called in.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to the invention, the guide channel 18 comprises a bottom surface 30 which the objects 2 rest on during extraction, two lateral erect, e.g. substantially vertical, guide surfaces 47, 48 opposite to and facing each other, which prevent a lateral exit of the objects 2 from the extraction path 37, as well as an upper surface 31 opposite to and facing the bottom surface 30 and which prevents an upward exit of the objects 2 from the extraction path 37. In the working position of the mobile wall 25 and therefore with the guide channel 18 "closed", such guide channel is not necessarily a tubular and circumferentially closed channel. The guide channel 18 may be configured as a tubular and circumferentially closed channel or, alternatively, as an open channel having a longitudinal slit or groove 32, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig.6</figref>.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to one embodiment, the mobile wall 25 forms at least part of the upper surface 31 (preferably<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the entire upper surface 31) in such a way that, by displacing the mobile wall from the working position (<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig.6</figref>) to the open position (<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig.5</figref>), the upper surface 31 is distanced from the bottom surface 30 to free objects 2, e.g. capsules, stuck between the bottom 30 and upper 31 surfaces.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Additionally or alternatively, the mobile wall 25 forms at least part of one of the lateral surfaces 47, 48 (preferably one of the lateral surfaces 47, 48 is formed entirely in the mobile wall 25) in such a way that, by displacing the mobile wall 25 from the working position (<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig.6</figref>) to the open position (<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig.5</figref>), the lateral guide surfaces 47, 48 are distanced from each other. This facilitates to vacate the guide channel 18 in the case of jamming of one or more objects 2 between the two lateral guide surfaces 47, 48.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the case in which a least a part of the extraction path 37 extends in a direction approximately tangent to the (e.g. circular) handling path 6 or in all cases in which a least a part of the extraction path 37 extends laterally along the handling path 37, the lateral guide surfaces 47, 48 comprise a first lateral guide surface 47 positioned on a first side of the extraction path 37 closer to (or facing) the handling path 6 and a second lateral guide surface 48 positioned on a second<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> side of the extraction path 37 further from (or facing away from) the handling path 6. Advantageously, the mobile wall 25 forms the upper surface 31 and the first lateral guide surface 47, in such a way that the guide means and the blocking means 27 described below are positioned between the extraction path and the handling path and do not obstruct external access to the guide channel 18.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to one embodiment, the mobile wall 25 has an elongated shape with an angular transversal cross-section, in particular an overturned "L" shape with its concave side facing the inside of the guide channel 18 and having an upper horizontal portion which forms the upper guide surface 31 and a vertical portion which forms the lateral guide surface 47 or 48.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to one embodiment, the mobile wall 25 extends along a predominant portion of the guide channel 18 and is more than half the length of the guide channel 18, preferably over 3/4 of the length of the guide channel 18.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The extractor 45 further comprises a guide device with one or more guides 34, such as metal profiles, fitted to the support structure 3, a mobile support 35 (preferably a translatable plate) fitted so as to move along the guides 34 and one or more releasable connectors<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> 36 which connect the mobile wall 25 to the mobile support 35. The releasable connectors 36 comprise a first clamping group 38 connected to the mobile support 35 and having a clamping portion 39 configured to clamp the mobile wall 25 or an intermediate adaptor 41 in turn connected (for example by screws 42) to the mobile wall 25, against the mobile support 35. The clamping portion 39 is connected (preferably with the possibility of adjusting the relative position, for example by means of an adjustment screw 54) to a first releasable blocking mechanism 42, preferably an articulated quadrilateral linkage mechanism, manually operable by means of a first lever 43. This way a quick connection and rapid detachment between the mobile wall 25 and the mobile support 35 may be achieved.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Advantageously, the mobile support 35 and the mobile wall 25 or intermediate adaptor 41, have abutment surfaces 44 which act as a geometric reference for the correct reciprocal positioning of the two parts.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The mobile support 35 may in addition be pressed, for example by a counterweight or by means of an elastic spring 46 in an opposite direction to the gravitational force acting on the mobile support 35. In the case in which the guides 34 determine a vertical mobility or in any case a possibility of raising and lowering the mobile<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> support 35 and the mobile wall 25, the elastic preloading or counterweight at least partially compensates the gravitational effect and facilitates a manual movement of the mobile wall 25.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The releasable blocking means 27 comprise a second clamping group 49 connected to the support structure 3 and having a blocking portion 50 configured to abut against the mobile support 35, the intermediate adaptor 41 or against the mobile wall 25 and block them in a position such that the mobile wall 25 is held in the working position. The blocking portion 50 is connected (preferably with the possibility of adjusting the relative position, for example by means of an adjustment screw 54) to a second releasable blocking mechanism 51, preferably an articulated quadrilateral linkage mechanism, manually operable by means of a second lever 52. This way a rapid release blocking may be achieved.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Advantageously, the releasable blocking means 27 and in particular the second clamping group 49 are further configured to be able to block the mobile support 35 and the mobile wall 25 in the open position. This makes it possible to operate on the guide channel without having to hold the mobile wall in the open position manually.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Advantageously, the mobile wall 25 and a further wall of the guide channel 18 form abutment surfaces 53<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> which act as a geometric reference for the correct positioning of the mobile wall 25 in the working position.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The mobile wall 25 may be guided in a translatory and/or rotary manner in a direction generally transversal to the extraction path 37, preferably the mobile wall 25 may be raised from the working position to the open position and lowered from the open position to the working position.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The seat support 5 may be configured as a support ring 5 extending along an outer circumference of a rotating plate 12 and preferably connected thereto.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The single orientation seats 4 may be delimited by a seat bottom 13 on which the object 2 rests by means of gravity, as well as by lateral surfaces 14, 15, 16, in particular a front surface 14 delimiting the orientation seat 4 in the direction of movement 8, a rear surface 15 opposite the front surface 14 and a first lateral surface 16 delimiting the orientation seat 4 in the radially inward direction with reference to the rotation axis 21 of the rotating plate 12.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In order to delimit the orientation seats 4 on their radially outward side too, a lateral wall 17 may be envisaged extending circumferentially substantially all along the handling path 6 and connected in a stationary<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> manner to the support structure 3. A radially inner surface facing the orientation seats 4 of the lateral wall 17 is suitable for delimiting the orientation seats 4 in the opposite direction to the first lateral surface 16, that is to say on a radially outward side thereof.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The feeding of the objects 2 onto the handling path 6 preferably takes place by means of the rotating plate 12 positioned radially inside the lateral wall 17 and configured so as to form, together with such lateral wall 17, a collection space 40 to collect the loose objects 2 to be orientated. The rotating plate 12 is preferably inclined and connected to a shaft 19 of a motor 20 attached to the support structure 3. The motor 20 is suitable for making the rotating plate 12 turn together with the series of orientation seats 2 so as to feed the objects 2 into the orientation seats 4 and move the orientation seats 4 along the handling path 6.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Thanks to the inclination of the rotating plate 12, the loose objects 2 tend to accumulate in its lowermost point which forms the feed point or feed section 9 of the handling path 6 where the single objects 2 fall into the seats 4.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">A pneumatic blower 22 (also called pneumatic comb) may also be envisaged connected to the support structure 3, and configured to push the objects 2 into the seats 4,<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> as well as a plurality of guide walls 23, connected to the seat support 5 or the rotating plate 12 and positioned above the access apertures 24 of the seats 4, and suitable for guiding the objects 2, during their conveying, into the seats 4.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">As generally known, the orientation of the objects 2 is performed along the orientation section 11 of the handling path 6, which extends from the feed point 9 to the removal point 10 of the objects.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The expulsion means 26 preferably comprise one or more compressed air expulsion blowers 28, connected in a stationary manner to the support structure 3 (preferably to the circumferential wall 17) or to the seat support 5, and configured in such a way as to expel the objects 2 having an orientation other than that desired from the seats 4.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">To such purpose, the walls of the seats 4 and/or the circumferential lateral surface 17 may have access windows 29 suitable for permitting access of the jet of compressed air to the objects 2 and having a shape such that the jet of compressed air mainly expels only the objects 2 having an orientation other than that desired.
