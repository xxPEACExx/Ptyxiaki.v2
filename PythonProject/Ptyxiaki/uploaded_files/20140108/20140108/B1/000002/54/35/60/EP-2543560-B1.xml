The seat belt retractor is a wind-up machine that winds up and houses a seat belt when the seat belt device is not being used and applies a specified tensile force to the seat belt when the seat belt device is being used.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Formerly, a type of a seat belt retractor which winds up a seat belt by the force of a spring has been used; however, since, in this type of a seat belt retractor, a tensile force applied to a seat belt depends on the pull-out length of the seat belt, it has been difficult to apply a suitable tensile force to the seat belt. Thus, a seat belt retractor employing an electric motor has also recently been used. Also, a seat belt retractor has been controlled by a computer included in a seat belt device to apply a specified tensile force to a seat belt. Hereinafter, the computer that is included in the seat belt device and controls the seat belt retractor is referred to herein as a seat belt control device.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The seat belt control device is a kind of ECU (Electronic Control Unit) which is a computer that control car fittings and/or the like. Since an ECU is operated by the power of an in-vehicle battery, an in-vehicle battery voltage may be decreased to make it impossible to start an engine when an ECU continues to be operated in a non-charged state. Thus, there is the technology of shifting an ECU to a sleep mode when a vehicle is in a specified state. The sleep mode refers to the state in which the power consumption of an ECU is lower than that in a normal operation mode and specifically<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> encompasses a standby mode in which an oscillator which constitutes an ECU is stopped, a slow clock mode in which an operation is performed with a low frequency oscillator different from that in a normal operation, and an intermittent mode in which a computer is intermittently operated at specific time intervals. Currently, a method of reducing power consumption by drastically stopping the functions of a computer and executing only a minimal function (such as a function relating to wake-up) is used. In addition, once a specified wake-up signal is input into an ECU in a sleep mode state, the sleep mode of the ECU is canceled and returns to a normal operation mode.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In a motor drive device that drives the electric motor of a seat belt retractor, a function must be protected from an increase in the temperature of a transistor. Thus, there is a technology that performs motor drive limitation in order to suppress an increase in the temperature of a transistor to a specific value or less.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1671860A1"><text>EP 1 671 860 A1</text></patcit> discloses a seat belt control device according to the preamble of claim 1.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Patent Literature 1 discloses a motor control device for a seat belt retractor, which confirms, prior to driving a motor beforehand, that drive limitation is not performed during driving a motor, and drives the motor only when there are no problems. The motor control device for a seat belt retractor of Patent Literature 1 compares a counter value varying depending on variation in the temperature of a switching element with a preset threshold value and performs drive limitation when the counter value is more than the preset threshold value.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Patent Literature 2 discloses a seat belt control device which can precisely detect the overheated state of a drive circuit. Patent Literature 2 discloses the technology of interrupting power supply from a power source to protect the drive circuit from being overheated when the overheated state of the drive circuit is detected. Circuit protection means according to Patent Literature 2 is, for example, hardware such as a temperature-sensitive field effect transistor.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Patent Literature 3 discloses an occupant restraint device wherein, when a motor is in an overheated state, a physical sensation alarm (first alarm) is stopped, the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> operation of an overheat protection function is avoided even at a penalty in the physical sensation alarm, and an occupant can surely be restrained at the time of important occupant restraint (second alarm), from the viewpoint of occupant protection. The overheat protection function according to Patent Literature 3 is hardware such as a thermal protector. The thermal protector is a device for preventing burnout which occurs when the coil temperature of a motor is more than a specified heatproof temperature.</p><heading id="h0003">Prior Art Literature</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010"><ul><li>Patent Literature 1:

Also, there is a problem that a cost of realizing a function by hardware is more than when a function is realized by software.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Further, in the case of the technology of using a counter value varying depending on temperature variation, as in Patent Literature 1, it cannot be decided whether or not to set sufficient cooling time during a sleep mode since a time course<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> cannot be measured in the sleep mode, so that a counter is reset to perform initialization in the case of shift to the sleep mode. As described above, since the counter is reset in the case of the shift to the sleep mode in the technology of using a counter value varying depending on temperature variation, the temperature of a drive circuit may actually remain high even if a counter value is zero in the case of shift to a normal operation mode immediately after the shift to the sleep mode. At this time, an actual temperature may be higher than the temperature of the drive circuit predicted by the counter value. Further, since heat generation may be repeated to make it exceed the drivable upper limit temperature of the drive circuit by repeating the shift to the normal operation mode immediately after the shift to the sleep mode, it is necessary to measure the actual temperature of a motor or a motor driver.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present invention is accomplished with respect to such circumstances and is aimed at providing: a seat belt control device which is inexpensive and prevents an actual temperature of a drive circuit from being higher than the temperature predicted by a counter value; a seat belt retractor; a seat belt device; a seat belt control method; and a computer-readable recording medium storing a program.</p><heading id="h0007">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">A seat belt control device according to a first aspect of the present invention is a seat belt control device which controls a motor which winds up a seat belt, the seat belt control device including:

When the information acquirer 11 acquires at least one item of information that triggers a shift from the sleep mode to the normal operation mode (e.g., information indicating the start of an engine), the switching decider 12 decides that the shift has been made from the sleep mode to the normal operation mode. In addition, the switching decider 12 decides that a shift has been made from the normal operation mode to the sleep mode when deciding that the car C is in a specified state (e.g., a state in which an engine is stopped) based on information acquired by the information acquirer 11.

Specifically, since the transistor of the motor driver 16 generates heat by a motor driving current, a constant value (specified value) is added to the heat generation counter value whenever the motor driver 16 drives the motor 7.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> Alternatively, a specific value is added to the heat generation counter value based on a drive current value. Since temperature is decreased by heat dissipation while the motor driver 16 does not drive the motor 7, a specific value is subtracted at specific time intervals. As a result, the heat generation counter value functions as an index indicating the temperature state of the motor driver 16. The counter 13 may also make an addition to and a subtraction from the heat generation counter value stored in the storage 14, depending on the predicted temperature variation of the motor 7, or may also calculate the heat generation counter value depending on the predicted temperature variations of both of the motor driver 16 and the motor 7. In addition, even when the heat generation counter value is calculated depending on the predicted temperature variation of the motor 7, the counter 13 performs the calculation by adding a specific value to the heat generation counter value whenever the motor driver 16 drives the motor 7 or by adding a specific value to the heat generation counter value based on a drive current value.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">A value added to and subtracted from the heat generation counter value is preferably determined based on a measured value obtained by pre-measuring a variation in temperature increased whenever the motor driver 16 actually drives the motor or a variation in temperature decreased after stopping of the motor driver 16. At this time, it is preferably determined based on the value measured under a bad condition (e.g., 85 °C) like a maximum temperature at which the motor driver 16 is drivable. Actually, according to the kind of the drive mode of the motor driver 16, a drive current value varies and an increasing temperature variation also differs. Thus, a drive count table in which increasing and decreasing temperatures per unit time are measured and associated according to the drive mode are pre-generated, and the counter 13 may also calculate the heat generation counter value with reference to the drive count table. Alternatively, a value in proportion to the drive current value may also be added to the heat generation counter value. In addition, the counter 13 does not makes a subtraction from the heat generation counter value to an initial value or less.

Further, the power source controller 15 shifts the seat belt control device 1 to the normal operation mode when receiving the wake-up signal from the switching decider 12 during the sleep mode. The power source controller 15 acquires the heat generation counter value from the storage 14 when receiving the sleep signal from the switching decider 12 during the normal operation mode and shifts the seat belt control device 1 to the sleep mode when the heat generation counter value is lower than a threshold value α. On the other hand, when the heat generation counter value is higher than the threshold value α, the power source controller 15 stands by until the heat generation counter value becomes equal to the threshold value α and shifts the seat belt control device 1 to the sleep mode when the heat generation counter value becomes equal to the threshold value α.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The threshold value α is a value in expectation of a subtraction from the heat generation counter value to the initial value for time from a shift to the sleep mode to wake-up.

The threshold value α is preferably set based on data measured under a bad condition (e.g., 85 °C) like a maximum temperature at which the motor driver 16 is drivable.
