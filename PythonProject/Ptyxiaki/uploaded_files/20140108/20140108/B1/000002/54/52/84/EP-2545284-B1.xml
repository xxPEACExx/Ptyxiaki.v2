priority to <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US61312487A"><text>U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/312,487 filed March 10, 2010</text></patcit>.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">This invention relates generally to free-tipped axial-flow fans, and more particularly to free-tipped fans that may be utilized as automotive engine-cooling fans.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Engine-cooling fans are used in automotive vehicles to move air through a set of heat exchangers which typically includes a radiator to cool an internal combustion engine, an air-conditioner condenser, and perhaps additional heat exchangers. These fans are generally enclosed by a shroud which serves to reduce recirculation and to direct air between the heat exchangers and the fan.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The shroud plenum (that portion of the shroud adjacent to the heat exchangers) is generally rectangular and the inflow to the fan is not axisymmetric. The radiator typically has a fin-and-tube structure which contributes additional non-axisymmetric flow structures to the inflow. This lack of symmetry in the inflow causes unsteady blade loading, and the generation of acoustic tones. In addition there are several sources of broadband noise. In order to reduce both tonal and broadband noise, the fan blades are often skewed.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The fans are typically injection-molded in plastic, a material with limited mechanical properties. Plastic fans exhibit creep deflection when subject to rotational and aerodynamic loading at high temperature. This is particularly an issue when the fan is mounted downstream of the heat exchangers, where the fan operates in high-temperature air, and is further subject to radiant heat from various under-hood components. This deflection must be accounted for in the design process.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Although some engine-cooling fans have rotating tip bands, many are free-tipped. These fans are designed to have a tip gap, or running clearance, between the blade tips and the shroud barrel. This tip gap must be sufficient to allow for both manufacturing tolerances<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> and the maximum deflection that may occur over the service life of the fan assembly. Unfortunately, large tip gaps generally result in reduced fan efficiency and increased fan noise.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Many fan assemblies using free-tipped fans are relatively low-power assemblies. These fans do not consume a large amount of electric power, nor do they make much noise. They are often designed with large tip gaps, and minimal blade skew. The resulting decrease in performance and increase in noise may not be as important as would be the case with more powerful fan assemblies.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Other fan assemblies, however, consume considerable electric power, and make objectionable noise. These assemblies must be designed to minimize noise, and maximize efficiency. To accomplish this the tip gap should be as small as possible. There is therefore a need for a fan design which minimizes the deflection of the blade tip. A problem faced by the fan designer is that the blade skew which is desirable for noise reduction often results in increased deflection.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Free-tipped fans are often designed to have a constant-radius tip shape, and to operate in a shroud barrel which is cylindrical in the area of closest clearance with the fan blades. In this case, the radial component of tip deflection is the main component of concern. However, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6595744B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,595,744</text></patcit> describes a free-tipped engine-cooling fan where the blade tips conform to a flared shroud barrel. In this case, both axial and radial tip deflection can change the size of the tip gap. Although <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6595744B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,595,744</text></patcit> further describes a fan geometry which minimizes axial deflection of the blade tip for a given skew, it does not prescribe skew distributions which minimize radial deflection.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US2002076327A"><text>US 2002/076327</text></patcit> discloses the features of the preamble of claim 1.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">The invention serves the need for a fan which is skewed to reduce fan noise, but which experiences low radial blade tip deflection.

id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1a</figref> shows a free-tipped axial fan assembly 1 that is configured for use as an engine-cooling fan assembly mounted adjacent to a set of heat exchangers 2. This set of heat exchangers typically includes a radiator 3, which cools an internal combustion engine, but in<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> alternatively-powered vehicles could include heat exchangers to cool batteries, motors, etc. A shroud 4 guides cooling air from the radiator 3 to the fan 5. The fan 5 rotates about an axis 6 and comprises a hub 7 and generally radially-extending blades 8. One of the blades 8 is shown in a swept view, where the axial extent is plotted as a function of radius. The end of the blade 8 adjacent to the hub 7 is the blade root 9, and the outermost end of the blade 8 is blade tip 10a. The blade tips 10a are surrounded by the shroud barrel 11a. A tip gap 12a provides a running clearance between the blade tips 10a and the shroud barrel 11a.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Although most typically the fan is in a "puller" configuration and located downstream of the heat exchangers, in some cases the fan is a "pusher", and located upstream of the heat exchangers. Although <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1a</figref> represents most accurately a puller configuration, it could be interpreted as a pusher, although in that configuration the position of the radiator 3 within the set of heat exchangers 2 would be reversed.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1a</figref> shows the blade tip 10a to be at a constant radius, and the shroud barrel 11a to be cylindrical in the region of close proximity to the blade tip 10a. This example shows the entire blade tip 10a in close proximity with the shroud barrel 11a. In other cases, the blade tip 10a is allowed to protrude from the barrel 11a (e.g., extending out to the left in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1a</figref>), so that only the rearward portion of each blade tip 10a (the blade portion on the right in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1a</figref>) has a small clearance gap with the shroud barrel 11a.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1b</figref> shows a free-tipped axial fan assembly that is configured for use as an engine-cooling fan assembly where the shroud barrel 11b is flared, and the blade tip 10b conforms to the shape of the flared shroud barrel 11b. A tip gap 12b provides running clearance between the blade tips 10b and the shroud barrel 11b. As shown by the dashed line in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1b</figref>, the blade tip 10b can optionally have a locally rounded shape at the trailing edge.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 1c</figref> is a swept view of a free-tipped fan with a constant-radius blade tip. The radius of the tip is R, and the radius of the hub is R<sub>hub</sub>. If the hub has a non-cylindrical shape, R<sub>hub</sub> can be defined as the hub radius at the blade trailing edge TE. The span of the blade S is the radial distance between the hub at the blade trailing edge and the blade tip, or (R - R<sub>hub</sub>). The blade geometry can be described as a function of radial position r, often non-dimensionalized as r/R, or as a function of the spanwise position s, which is equal to (r-R<sub>hub</sub>).<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> The spanwise position can be non-dimensionalized as s/S. Both the radial position r and the spanwise position s are defined as increasing in the radially outward direction.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 1c</figref> shows the axial position of a blade leading edge LE and a blade trailing edge TE plotted as a function of radial position r. The midchord line at a radial position r is shown to be axially midway between the leading and trailing edges at that radial position r. The midchord rake of the blade X<sub>MID</sub> at a radial position r is defined to be the axial distance of the midchord line at that radial position r from the position of the midchord line at the hub radius R<sub>hub</sub>. The midchord rake angle Θ<sub>MID</sub> at a radial position r is the angle formed between a radial line and a line tangent to the midchord line at that radial position r.
