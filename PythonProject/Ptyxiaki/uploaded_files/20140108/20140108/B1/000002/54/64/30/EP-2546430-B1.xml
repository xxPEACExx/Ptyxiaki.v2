load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><u>Field of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a suspended ceiling system comprising at least one ceiling tile, at least one fixing member and at least one suspension member. The invention also relates to a method for suspending such a ceiling system.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Technical background</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Suspended ceilings can be installed in many different types of buildings for various reasons, for example to absorb sound, to reflect light, to lower the ceiling height or to conceal installations such as cable arrangements, ventilation equipment, lighting installations and other devices arranged in the space between the suspended ceiling and the ceiling structure of a building.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In some circumstances, an overall suspended ceiling in the form of a grid and a plurality of ceiling tiles can not be used due to various reasons.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Examples are premises where temperature is regulated via the joists (TABS, Thermal Activated Building Systems) or where there are large areas of glass. As an alternative to an overall suspended ceiling, free-hanging units of ceiling tiles forming ceiling islands are one way of creating acceptable acoustic environments. The ceiling tiles may have sound-absorbing and/or sound-insulation properties.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Free-hanging units can also be installed in large, noisy environments such as open-plan areas, restaurants, shopping centres etc., close to working areas or other locations where acoustical treatment is needed in order to achieve suitable conditions for communication, concentration or recovery.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Free-hanging units can also be used as a complement to an overall suspended ceiling in order to improve the acoustic environment with a reduction of the sound level and a diminishing of sound as distance increases.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The use of free-hanging units provides flexibility. Free-hanging units can be arranged in many different ways, for instance creating separate ceiling islands or ceiling islands formed of a plurality of free-hanging units arranged at different levels, overlapping each other.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Free-hanging units may be suspended to the ceiling structure of the building in different ways. One way of suspending a ceiling island is to use a grid or profiles supporting the ceiling tiles, wherein suspension members are connected to the grid or profiles. Another solution is to suspend the ceiling tiles individually by fastening a suspension member to each ceiling tile. Especially when arranging a plurality of ceiling tiles in an overlapping arrangement, the top ceiling tile have to be provided with a duct for each suspension member which is suspending the lower ceiling tiles to the ceiling structure. Consequently, a number of suspension members have to extend through the top ceiling tile. Conventionally, each ceiling tile is suspended by a number of suspension members, for example at least three suspension members. Thereby, if three ceiling tiles are arranged above each other, and each ceiling tile is suspended by four suspension members, eight suspension members are extending through the top ceiling tile, and the free-hanging unit is arranged to the ceiling structure at twelve suspension points, four for each ceiling tile.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2007017179A1"><text>US 2007/017179 A1</text></patcit> discloses a suspended ceiling system according to the preamble of claim 1.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is an object of the present invention to provide an improvement over the above described techniques and prior art.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A further object is to reduce the number of suspension members required to suspend ceiling tiles or other elements arranged below each other.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">At least some of these and other objects and advantages that will be apparent from the description have been achieved by a suspended ceiling system, comprising at least one ceiling tile having a first surface adapted to face a room and a second surface adapted to face a ceiling structure of a building, at least one fixing member being adapted to be inserted into said at least one ceiling tile and to suspend said at least one ceiling tile. Said at least one fixing member comprises a duct adapted to at least partly extend between the second and first surfaces of said at least one ceiling tile. The suspended ceiling system further comprises at least one suspension member adapted to at least partly extend in said duct and further extend from said at least one fixing member and through the first surface of said at least one ceiling tile.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The first surface may be a front surface of the ceiling tile. The second surface may be a rear surface of the ceiling tile.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The suspended ceiling system may comprise more than one ceiling tile and other elements. The ceiling tiles and elements may be arranged at the same level or beneath each other. If arranged in different levels, the ceiling tiles and elements may be arranged both concentrically or displaced in relation to each other. More than one fixing member and thereby more than one suspension member may be used to suspend an element or ceiling tile arranged below the top ceiling tile. Further, more than one fixing member may be used to suspend the top ceiling tile to the ceiling structure.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">An advantage of the invention is that the system presents a more simple solution for suspending a ceiling system, since a single fixing member is used to both to suspend the ceiling tile to the ceiling structure and to suspend any element or elements arranged below the ceiling tile.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Another advantage is that the number of suspension members and fixing members are reduced. In a conventional arrangement, a separate suspension member suspends individually the ceiling tile, or any elements arranged below the ceiling tile, to the ceiling structure, thus resulting in that a number of suspension members extends from the ceiling structure through the top ceiling tile to the elements arranged below the top ceiling tile. For example, in prior art solutions, if each ceiling tile is suspended by four suspension points, and three ceiling tiles are to be arranged at different levels, eight suspension members are extending through the top ceiling tile, in addition to the four suspension members by which the top ceiling tile is suspended. In the inventive suspended ceiling system arranged in similar manner, only four suspension members are extending through the top ceiling tile according to. In the inventive ceiling system, the fixing member both suspends the ceiling tile to the ceiling structure and suspends any element arranged below the ceiling tile.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Further, the same suspension member may be used to suspend all ceiling tiles or elements.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Another advantage of the invention is that the number of suspension points in the ceiling structure of the building is reduced. Since the ceiling tile and any elements arranged below the ceiling tile are suspended to the same suspension points, fewer suspension points are required compared to a conventional arrangement. Thereby, the time-consuming task of fixing suspension points to the ceiling structure of the building is reduced.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Further, the visual appearance of a suspended ceiling system according to the invention is improved, since the suspension of the ceiling<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> system is less noticeable. Due the reduced number of required suspension members, a floating appearance of the suspended ceiling system may be obtained.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Another advantage is that the resistance against extraction of the fixing member due to the weight of ceiling system is improved compared to prior art solutions.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Further, a suspended ceiling system according to the present invention allows a faster and easier mounting due to the reduced number of fixing members and suspension members required and due to that the system is suspended to the same suspension points in the ceiling structure.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Said at least one suspension member may be adapted to suspend said at least one fixing member to a ceiling structure of a building. Thereby, the same suspension member may be used to both suspend the ceiling tile to the ceiling structure and to suspend an element arranged below the ceiling tile. Consequently, several ceiling tiles, or elements, arranged below each other may be suspended by the same suspension member.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">An additional suspension member may be adapted to suspend said at least one fixing member to a ceiling structure of a building. In this embodiment, a first suspension member is used to suspend the ceiling tile to the ceiling structure, and a second suspension member is used to suspend the element arranged below the ceiling tile to said ceiling tile.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Said at least one fixing member may extend only partly between the second and first surfaces such that said at least one fixing member is not visible at the first surface. Thereby, when the first surface being a front surface of the ceiling tile, the visual appearance of the suspended ceiling island is further improved. Only the suspension member, for instance a wire, is visible from beneath. The visual impact of the suspension member is reduced and the impression of a floating arrangement of the suspended ceiling system is obtained.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Said at least one fixing member may be provided with threads and is adapted to be threaded into said ceiling tile from the second surface. By threading the fixing member from the second surface, the fixing member is not visible from the first surface. By using a threaded fixing member, the resistance against extraction of the fixing member is improved.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A pitch of said at least one fixing member may be at least 6 mm. A pitch of at least 6 mm is particularly favourable in order to improve resistance<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> against extraction of the fixing member out of the ceiling tile, especially when suspending ceiling tiles made of glass wool.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Said at least one suspension member may be adapted to extend from said at least one fixing member and through the first surface of said at least one ceiling tile in a duct arranged in said at least one ceiling tile. The duct is arranged in the ceiling tile to provide guidance for the suspension member.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Said at least one fixing member may comprise a flange adapted to abut the first surface of said at least one ceiling tile. The flange is adapted to form a support surface supporting the ceiling tile.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Said at least one suspension member may be adapted to suspend at least one element below said at least one ceiling tile. The element may be another ceiling tile, a sign, a lightning appliance etc. The suspension member may be adapted to support a plurality of elements arranged below each other. The elements may be arranged concentrically or be offset in relation to each other.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The suspended ceiling system may further comprise a connecting member adapted to connect the suspension member suspending said at least one fixing member to said at least one fixing member. The connecting member may be adapted to fix the position of the suspension member relative the fixing member. The connecting member may also be used to adjust the length of the suspension member.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Said at least one ceiling tile may be made of compressed mineral fibres, preferably mineral wool, and most preferably glass wool. Due to the properties of the mineral fibres, it especially difficult to find a suitable fixing member providing sufficient resistance against extraction of the fixing member. By using the fixing member of the inventive system, these difficulties are overcome.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">According to another aspect of the invention, a method for suspending a ceiling system comprising at least one ceiling tile is provided. The method comprising

The ceiling tiles 2 are free-hanging, i.e. they are suspended individually to the ceiling structure and not supported by a grid of profiles. The ceiling tiles 2 are arranged above each other in the vertical direction. The ceiling tiles 2 are concentrically arranged in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The ceiling tiles 2 may have sound-absorbing and/or sound insulating properties. The ceiling tiles 2 may be made of man-made fibres, for example compressed mineral fibres, preferably mineral wool and most preferably glass wool.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Further, the ceiling tiles 2 have a first surface 2a adapted to face a room, a second surface 2b adapted to face a ceiling structure of a building and at least one side surface. The first surface 2a is adapted to be facing a person being in the room, i.e. be facing the interior of a room. In the shown embodiment, the first surface 2a is a front surface and the second surface 2b is a rear surface. The first surface 2a is a horizontal surface of the ceiling tile 2, or a surface having at least a component extending in a horizontal direction. The second surface 2b is also a horizontal surface of the ceiling tile 2, or a surface having at least a component extending in a horizontal direction. The first surface 2a and or the second surface 2b may be provided with a surface layer. Said at least one side surface may also be provided with a surface layer. The surface layer may comprise a glass fibre web. The surface layers may be painted. The above described properties of the ceiling tiles 2 are applicable to ceiling tiles described in connection with all embodiments described in the present application.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The suspended ceiling system 1 further comprises suspension members 3 and fixing members 10. The suspension means 3 are adapted to suspend the ceiling tiles 2 to the ceiling structure of the building. In the arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1</figref>, four suspension members 3 are suspending the ceiling tiles 2. The suspension members 3 are attached to the ceiling structure at four suspension points. In a first embodiment, which will be described in more detail with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">figs. 2-3</figref>, each suspension member 3 is extending through the ceiling tiles 2 to the lowermost ceiling tile and suspends all ceiling tiles 2 to the ceiling structure. In a second embodiment, which will be described in more detail with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">figs. 4-5</figref>, a first<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> suspension member 3a is suspending the top ceiling tile 2 to the ceiling structure and a second suspension member 3b is suspending a lower ceiling tile 2 to the top ceiling tile 2. Since both the first and second suspension members 3a, 3b are attached to the fixing member 10, they extend one after the other in the same direction. Thereby, the visual appearance is similar as if one suspension member extends through all ceiling tiles 2. The fixing members 10 are inserted into the ceiling tile 2. The suspension members 3, 3a, 3b and the fixing members 10, 20 will be described in more detailed with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">figs. 2-9</figref>.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In <figref idrefs="f0001">fig.1</figref>, the ceiling tiles 2 are rectangular.

A person skilled in the art appreciates that any element may be arranged below the top ceiling tile 2. The element may be another ceiling tile, but may also be a sign, a lightning appliance, or any other type of object.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">However, common for all arrangements is that the ceiling tile 2 and elements arranged below are suspended to the ceiling structure at suspension points being common for all ceiling tile and elements. The ceiling tiles and elements 2 are not suspended individually to the ceiling structure. Thereby, the number of suspension point to the ceiling structure is reduced and the number of suspension members 3 required is reduced.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The suspended ceiling system 1 according to a first embodiment will now be described in more detail with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">figs. 2 and 3.
