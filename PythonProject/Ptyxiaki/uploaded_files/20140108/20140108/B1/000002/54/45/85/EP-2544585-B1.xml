mxw-id="PDES63960560" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for determining the extent of a localised restriction to fluid flow in a vessel such as a pipe or tube. The invention has particular, though not exclusive, application in the measurement of a stenosis in a blood vessel, and is particularly useful in determining the magnitude of a coronary stenosis in the human or animal coronary system.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002"><nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>N. Hadjiloizou et al.: "Differences in cardiac microcirculatory wave patterns between the proximal left mainstem and proximal right coronary artery", Am. J. Physiol.: Heart Circ. Physiol., 295 (18 July 2008) pp. H1198-H1205</text></nplcit>, doi: 10.1152/ajpheart.00510.2008 relates to a study of the differences in cardiac microcirculatory wave patterns between the proximal left mainstem and proximal right coronary artery. Pressure, flow and electrocardiograms were acquired for 60 s. Pressure and flow velocity signals were ensemble averaged over the entire 60 s recording period. Equations that relate to changes in pressure and velocity are disclosed which provide pressure changes due to waves originating from proximal (aortic) and distal (microcirculatory) locations. An equation to calculate the local wave speed using simultaneous pressure and Doppler measurements is disclosed. Wave intensities are calculated using the local wave speed and respective pressure changes. Measurements are taken for both the left mainstem and the right coronary artery and the wave intensities compared.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a technique widely applied in the coronary catheter laboratory in the assessment of coronary stenosis and the adequacy of stent deployment. FFR is defined as the pressure behind (or distal to) a stenosis relative to the pressure in front of (or proximal to) the stenosis. The result is a ratio, i.e. an absolute number. An FFR ratio of 0.5 indicates that a given stenosis results in a 50% drop in blood pressure across the stenosis. More generally, an FFR indicates the ratio of a maximal flow of fluid along a vessel in the presence of a restriction or constriction in the vessel compared with the maximal flow that would occur in the absence of that restriction or constriction.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The use of FFR has increased rapidly over the past few years as studies have demonstrated the limitations of visual assessment of stenoses and the harm which can arise from inappropriate angioplasty. It is conventionally performed by measuring the mean fall in pressure on either side of a coronary stenosis under conditions of maximal hyperaemia. However, under certain circumstances, e.g. following acute myocardial infarction, it can become unreliable. This could lead to inappropriate clinical decisions.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Whereas pressure in most vascular bed arises from a single input (i.e. the aortic end of the vessel), pressure in the coronary artery arises from both proximal (aortic end) and distal (microcirculatory end) contributions in approximately equal proportions. Distal pressure is determined by 2 factors:
<ol><li>(1) intrinsic (or 'passive') resistance via auto-regulation of the coronary microcirculation</li><li>(2) extrinsic (or 'active') resistance via compression of small microcirculatory vessels which run through the myocardium.</li></ol><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Current FFR assessment tries to reduce this distal pressure as much as possible by the administration of vasodilators such as adenosine to achieve 'maximal' hyperaemia. However, whilst the administration of vasodilators will reduce microcirculatory passive resistance, it cannot suppress the distal-originating microcirculatory pressure which arises from compression of the small vessels which run through the contracting myocardium.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Thus, a small inaccuracy in FFR is inherent as it is not possible to eliminate the active resistance component. Further, FFR can become more inaccurate under pathological processes when regulation of either intrinsic or extrinsic resistance is affected. Examples of passive resistance dysfunction include diabetes mellitus, acute coronary syndrome, post myocardial infarction and hibernating myocardium. Examples of active resistance dysfunction include when an artery subtends a hypokinetic or akinetic segment.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">There is much published literature detailing such errors, which may explain why the close relationship between intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and FFR in the highly regulated research laboratory is often not borne out in the clinical environment.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved and/or alternative method and apparatus for measuring the extent of a localised restriction to fluid flow in a vessel such as a pipe or tube. It is a further object of the invention to provide such a method and apparatus for use in the measurement of a stenosis in a blood vessel, and particularly though not exclusively in determining the magnitude or effects of a coronary stenosis in the human or animal coronary system.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to one aspect, the present invention provides a method for determining a measure of constriction in a vessel conveying a fluid medium, the method comprising the steps of: a) taking a succession of first pressure measurements P<sub>1</sub> and a succession of corresponding first velocity measurements U<sub>1</sub> at a first location within the vessel, the first location being on a first side of a target region; b) taking a succession of second pressure measurements P<sub>2</sub> and a succession of corresponding second velocity measurements U<sub>2</sub> at a second location within the vessel, the second location being on a second side of the target region; c) for each location, determining wave speed c in the fluid medium as a function of the square of a change in pressure dP divided by the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> square of the corresponding change in velocity dU; d) for the first location, determining a forward pressure change dP<sub>1</sub>+ as a function of the sum of the change in pressure dP<sub>1</sub> and the change in velocity dU<sub>1</sub>; e) for the second location, determining a forward pressure change dP<sub>2</sub>+ as a function of the sum of the change in pressure dP<sub>2</sub> and the change in velocity dU<sub>2</sub>; f) determining a forward separated flow reserve indicative of the pressure drop across the target region as a function of the ratio of dP<sub>2</sub>+ / dP<sub>1</sub>+.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The first side of the target region may be upstream of the target region and the second side may be downstream of the target region.

The method can be applied to a vessel in which there is a fluctuating pressure source on either side of the target region, such as in a vessel in the human or animal cardiac circulatory system. The succession of first and second pressure measurements and the succession of first and second velocity measurements may be taken over at least one complete cardiac cycle of the human or animal body.

Forward-pressure flow reserve overcomes limitations in conventional FFR by separating out the proximal and distal (or 'forward' and 'backward') components of the pressure waveform. The backward pressure component can be removed. Assessment of the coronary stenosis is simplified becoming very similar to assessment of aortic stenosis where there is a single pressure source (i.e. the left ventricle).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Coronary pressure separation has several advantages. Firstly, it does not require the administration of adenosine to vasodilate the coronary microcirculation. Secondly, it is likely to be independent of left ventricular function making it applicable in acute coronary syndromes, post myocardial infarction and hibernating myocardium, where conventional FFR is contra-indicated as an assessment technique.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In practical terms, separated pressure can be determined by measuring simultaneous pressure (P) and flow velocity (U), and calculating the pressure originating in the forward (e.g. aortic) end, P<sub>+</sub>, (Equation 1) and the pressure originating from the backward (e.g. microcirculatory) end, P_ (Equation 2). <maths id="math0001" num="(Equation 1)"><math display="block"><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">P</mi><mo>+</mo></msub><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi><mfenced separators=""><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></mfenced><mn mathvariant="normal">.</mn><mfenced separators=""><mi>dP</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">ρcdU</mi></mfenced></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="142" he="9" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> <maths id="math0002" num="(Equation 2)"><math display="block"><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">P</mi><mo>-</mo></msub><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi><mfenced separators=""><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></mfenced><mn mathvariant="normal">.</mn><mfenced separators=""><mi>dP</mi><mo>-</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">ρcdU</mi></mfenced></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="144" he="10" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> dP represents a measured pressure change; dU represents a measured velocity change; c is the wave speed; and ρ is the density of the fluid medium, e.g. blood.

A constriction 15 in the vessel 10 exemplifies a target region 16 for which it is desirable to make a measurement of the effect of that constriction on flow of fluid through the vessel. In one context, the constriction 15 may be a coronary artery stenosis and it is required to determine a measure of the drop in fluid pressure across the constriction to determine a ratio of the maximal flow through the vessel compared with the maximal flow that would occur without the constriction. Regions 5 and 6 represent first and second locations at which pressure and velocity measurements may be taken in accordance with the method to be described below.

Currently in the UK, approximately 30% of the case load is from acute admissions in patients with acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome. In this population, FFR is contra-indicated and has been found to be inconsistent at best and frequently unreliable.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Forward-pressure flow reserve overcomes or mitigates these limitations by separating out the proximal and distal components of the pressure waveform. As forward-pressure flow reserve is able to remove the backward pressure from the forward pressure component it negates the need to administer powerful vasodilators such as adenosine.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">This has several specific advantages.

In some cases, a greater than 80% reduction is observed in the proximal / distal ratio in the artery subtending severely hypokinetic territory when compared to an artery subtending myocardium contracting normally. This is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 4</figref>. Pressure and flow velocity were recorded using intra-arterial wires in the left anterior descending artery and wave<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> intensity calculated for each artery. In the ventricle with preserved function, the proximal / distal ratio was approximately 1, whereas in the artery subtending a segment of severely hypokinetic function this ratio is markedly increased. This suggests regional myocardial function differentially affects pressure originating from proximal and distal origins.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) assumes that coronary pressure originates solely from the proximal (aortic) end of the artery, and that the forces exerted on the intramural coronary vessels by the transmitted cavity pressure and contracting myocardium do not contribute to coronary artery pressure. The inventors have demonstrated that this is not the case, but instead that coronary pressure is composed of approximately 50% forward-travelling (aortic-originating) and 50% backward-travelling pressure components (see <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 4</figref>, left-hand graph). It is believed that in subjects with regional variation in myocardial contractility: (i) backward-travelling pressure is markedly reduced (as shown in the right hand graph of <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 4</figref>), and (ii) that it is not possible to determine whether a fall in FFR is due to a haemodynamically significant coronary stenosis or regional variation in myocardial contractility. Using separated-pressure components as described in this patent application allows the haemodynamic significance of coronary stenosis to be quantified independently of regional variation in myocardial contractility. This technique can be adopted routinely in clinical practice, and negates the need for routine administration of intravenous adenosine.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is increasingly used in the assessment of the physiological significance of a coronary stenosis<sup>1,2,3,4</sup> and adequacy of stent deployment<sup>5</sup> in the cardiac catheter laboratory. This technique is based on simple premise that the greater the stenosis the greater the fall in pressure between the aorta and downstream of the stenosis.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">FFR is based on the assumption that pressure changes arise purely from the aortic end of the coronary artery. However, several studies including our own have clearly demonstrated that coronary artery pressure is influenced by changes in pressure from both ends of the vessel<sup>6-9</sup>. Probably the most widely accepted models of coronary artery flow are the intra-myocardial pump<sup>6</sup> and time-varying elastance models<sup>9</sup>. Both predict the existence of retrograde coronary blood flow during systole as a result of raised intramyocardial pressure and myocardial contraction causing compression of the small<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> microcirculatory vessels<sup>6</sup>. Such retrograde flow has been confirmed by measurements in dogs in vivo using needle probe videomicroscopy<sup>10</sup> and Doppler flow probe<sup>11</sup>. This indicates the presence of a considerable backward-directed pressure gradient in systole Our work<sup>8</sup> has characterised this backward pressure gradient as a backward-travelling wave seen in the coronary arteries of humans in early systole due to compression of the coronary microvasculature. In diastole there is a corresponding 'suction' of blood into the coronary microvasculature as a result of the decompression of intramural vessels accompanying myocardial relaxation. We have recently demonstrated that this backward suction wave is depressed in left ventricular hypertrophy<sup>8</sup>. Therefore there may be a smaller backward-travelling pressure component in other circumstances which impair the lusitropic behaviour of the region of myocardium supplied by a particular coronary artery. The existence of pressure gradients generated by the contracting and relaxing myocardium will affect the measurement of FFR significantly, perhaps by 50% or more (<figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>).</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The limitations of the assumption of a unidirectional pressure gradient implicit in calculation of FFR (i.e. that there is no significant backward-travelling contribution to coronary pressure) are recognised as a potential source of error in microvascular disease and left ventricular dysfunction<sup>2,12,13</sup>. However, until recently, there has been no means of dealing with it, i.e. the absence of a technique to separate the coronary pressure waveform into its forward- and backward-travelling components in human subjects.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">We have recently developed a new technique (the single-point technique) which, in combination with wave intensity analysis, enables coronary pressure to be separated into its forward and backward components on the basis of simultaneous recordings of pressure and flow velocity<sup>14</sup> (<figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref>). Such measurements are now quite feasible using a commercially available combined pressure-flow wire designed for intra-coronary use (Combiwire, Volcano), and negate the need for administration of adenosine. Using this technique in in-vivo human studies, we have identified the waves responsible for coronary blood flow, and separated the coronary pressure waveform into its forward-(aortic originating) and backward-travelling (microcirculatory originating) components<sup>8</sup>.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">These studies have demonstrated the backward-travelling pressure component in human coronaries is of the same magnitude as the large forward-travelling pressure<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> component. Since coronary pressure is just as much a result of backward-travelling pressure compenents<sup>14</sup> as it is of forward-travelling components, if we are interested in the forward propagation of pressure it would be more appropriate to measure FFR using the isolated forward-travelling pressure component. By thus removing the backward-travelling pressure component, we can eliminate the influence of regional variation of left ventricular function, microvascular dysfunction and right atrial pressure allowing a more accurate assessment of the haemodynamic significance of a stenosis.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref> shows a set of graphs illustrating the separation of the total measured pressure into its forward and backward-travelling components as a function time. Simultaneous pressure and flow velocity were measured in the circumflex artery of a 47 year old man. Wave intensity analysis was applied to separate coronary pressure into its forward and backward-travelling components. Forward pressure appears different from aortic pressure due to the large impedance mismatch between the coronary artery and the aorta. At such sites the backward-travelling wave is re-reflected back into the coronary as an expansion (or suction) wave which reduces pressure.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><heading id="h0003">Reference List</heading><p id="p0052" num="0052"><ol><li>(1)<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text> Dawkins KD, Gershlick T, de BM et al.
