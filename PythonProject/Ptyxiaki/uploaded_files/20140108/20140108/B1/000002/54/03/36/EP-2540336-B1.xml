Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Hitherto, various guides used for guiding, for example, medical devices to target parts by being inserted into body tissues or tubes such as blood vessels, alimentary canals, or ureters, have been proposed.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Registration Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP6081547A"><text>6-81547</text></patcit> (Patent Document 1) discusses a guidewire in which a biocompatible material (gold, platinum, or fluorocarbon resin) covers a surface of a tungsten coil.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In addition, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2001152274A"><text>2001-152274</text></patcit> (Patent Document 2) discusses a tungsten material having an uneven shape and excellent secondary workability.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the guidewire discussed in Patent Document 1, wettability with respect to metal solder for joining a core shaft and a tungsten coil is improved by noble metal plating.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> However, the bonding strength between the core shaft and a coil body is not sufficient because a surface of the coil body is flat, as a result of which the coil body may separate from the core shaft.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">When a tungsten wire having recesses and protrusions and discussed in Patent Document 2 is used in a coil body of a guidewire, since a surface of the tungsten wire having poor wettability with respect to metal solder has recesses and protrusions, the surface of the tungsten wire has poorer wettability in terms of surface chemistry. As a result, the bonding strength between a core shaft and the coil body formed of the tungsten wire is considerably reduced. This may cause the coil body to separate from the core shaft.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, in view of such problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a guidewire that makes it possible to prevent a coil body from separating from a core shaft by increasing the bonding strength between the core shaft and the coil body formed of a tungsten wire. This object is solved by a guidewire according to claim 1. Preferred embodiments are subject-matter of dependent claims and/or are explained below with respect to the drawings.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the present invention, there is provided a guidewire including a core shaft, a coil body that covers<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the core shaft, and a joining portion formed of metal solder that joins the core shaft and the coil body. The coil body includes a tungsten wire and a noble metal plating layer that covers a surface of the tungsten wire. A surface of the noble metal plating layer has a first uneven shape. The noble metal plating layer may cover the surface of the tungsten wire partly or completely. Further, the term "tungsten wire" is to be understood to encompass a single tungsten wire or a plurality of tungsten wires. In case of a plurality of tungsten wires the surface of each of the tungsten wires is covered by a noble metal plating layer partly or completely.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the guidewire according to the aspect of the present invention, the coil body includes a tungsten wire and a noble metal plating layer that covers a surface of the tungsten wire, with a surface of the noble metal plating layer having a first uneven shape. Therefore, wettability between metal solder and the coil body including tungsten is considerably increased. In addition, the first uneven shape causes an anchoring effect to occur. Consequently, it is possible to increase the bonding strength between the core shaft and the coil body, and, thus, prevent the coil body from separating from the core shaft.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><p id="p0010" num="0010"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrate a structure according to a first embodiment of the present invention, with <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref> being an overall view of a guidewire and <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1B</figref> being an enlarged view of only wires of a coil body at a portion IB shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2A and 2B</figref> illustrate the structure according to the first embodiment of the present invention, with <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref> being an enlarged view of a portion II shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1B</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2B</figref> illustrating a modification of the first embodiment and being an enlarged view of the portion II shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1B</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3A and 3B</figref> illustrate a structure according to a second embodiment of the present invention, with <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3A</figref> being an overall view of a guidewire and <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3B</figref> being an enlarged view of only wires of a coil body at a portion IIIB shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3A</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4A to 4C</figref> illustrate the structure according to the second embodiment of the present invention, with <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4A</figref> being an enlarged view of a portion IVA shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3B</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4B</figref> illustrating a modification of the second embodiment and being an enlarged view of the portion IVA shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3B</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4C</figref> being an enlarged view of a portion IVC shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4B</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is an overall view of a third embodiment of the present invention.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0006">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">Guidewires according to the present invention will hereunder be described on the basis of preferred embodiments shown in the drawings.</p><heading id="h0007">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrate a structure of a guidewire 1 according to a first embodiment of the present invention, with <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref> being an overall view of the guidewire 1 and <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1B</figref> being an enlarged view of only wires of a coil body at a portion IB shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref>.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1A and 1B</figref>, for convenience of explanation, the left side is described as being a proximal end and the right side is described as being a distal end.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref>, for facilitating understanding, a lengthwise direction of the guidewire 1 is reduced, and the entire guidewire 1 is schematically illustrated, so that the dimensions of the entire guidewire 1 differ from the actual dimensions thereof.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref>, the guidewire 1 includes a core shaft 2 and a coil body 3 that covers a distal end of the core shaft 2.

That is, in transverse cross section of each coil wire, the protrusions in the second uneven shape and the protrusions in the first uneven shape are formed in correspondence with each other, and the recesses in the second uneven shape and the recesses in the first uneven shape are formed in correspondence with each other.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Depending upon the plating method of the noble metal plating layers 13b and the method of forming the coil body 13, when, for example, each protrusion in the first uneven shape is ground, there may no longer be, in transverse cross section of each coil wire, any recess in the second uneven shape whose position completely corresponds to that of a recess in the first uneven shape, or any protrusion in the second uneven shape whose position completely corresponds to that of a protrusion in the first uneven shape. However,<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> all that is required is for the position of at least one recess in the second uneven shape and the position of at least one recess in the first uneven shape to correspond to each other, or for the position of at least one protrusion in the second uneven shape and the position of at least one protrusion in the first uneven shape to correspond to each other. It is most desirable that, in transverse cross section of each coil wire, the positions of the recesses in the second uneven shape and the positions of the recesses in the first uneven shape correspond to each other over the entire length of each coil wire, and the positions of the protrusions in the second uneven shape and the positions of the protrusions in the first uneven shape correspond to each other over the entire length of each coil wire.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Accordingly, in the guidewire 11 according to the second embodiment, the surface of each tungsten wire 13a has the second uneven shape. In addition, in transverse cross section of each coil wire (tungsten wire 13a + noble metal plating layer 13b),the positions of the recesses in the first uneven shape of the noble metal plating layer 13b correspond to the positions of the recesses in the second uneven shape, and the positions of the protrusions in the first uneven shape of the noble metal plating layer 13b correspond to the positions of the protrusions in the second uneven shape. Therefore, the noble metal plating layers 13b<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> are prevented from separating from the tungsten wires 13a by the anchoring effect, and it is possible to considerably increase the bonding strength between the core shaft 2 and the coil body 13, and, thus, significantly prevent the coil body 13 from separating from the core shaft 2 because the metal solder also has an anchoring effect with respect to the noble metal plating layers 13b.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4A</figref>, the guidewire 11 according to the second embodiment is such that a line La of a lowest portion cc at a recess in the first uneven shape is positioned towards an outer side of the coil body 13 than a line Lb at a highest portion cv of a protrusion in the second uneven shape (that is, above the line Lb at the highest portion cv of the protrusion in the second uneven shape in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4A</figref>).</p><p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4B</figref> illustrates a modification of the second embodiment, and <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4C</figref> is an enlarged view of a portion IVC shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4B</figref>. As is clear from <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4B and 4C</figref>, a line La at a lowest portion cc of a recess in a first uneven shape may be positioned closer to the center of a coil wire of the coil body 13 than a line Lb at a highest portion cv of a protrusion in a second uneven shape (that is, below the line Lb at the highest portion cv of the protrusion in the second uneven shape).</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In transverse cross section of the coil wire, the lowest portion cc of the recess in the first uneven shape is<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> positioned closer to the center of the coil wire than the highest portion cv of the protrusion in the second uneven shape. Consequently, it is possible to further prevent the noble metal plating layer 13b from separating from the corresponding tungsten wire 13a, to considerably increase the bonding strength between the core shaft 2 and the coil body 13, and, thus, reliably prevent the coil body 13 from separating from the core shaft 2.</p><heading id="h0009">Third Embodiment</heading><p id="p0045" num="0045">Next, with reference to <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, a guidewire 21 according to a third embodiment will be described focusing on the differences between it and the guidewire 11 according to the second embodiment. Portions that correspond to those in the second embodiment will be given the same reference numerals in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, for facilitating understanding, a lengthwise direction of the guidewire 21 is reduced, and the entire guidewire 21 is schematically illustrated, so that the dimensions of the entire guidewire 21 differ from the actual dimensions thereof.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is an overall view of the guidewire 21. A coil body 13 includes tungsten wires 13a each having a second uneven shape and noble metal plating layers 13b covering outer peripheries of the tungsten wires 13a. An outer surface and an inner surface of the coil body 13 are coated<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> with a lubricant coating agent 8 so as to be covered by the lubricant coating agent.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Accordingly, in the guidewire 21 according to the third embodiment, the outer surface and the inner surface of the coil body 13 are coated with the lubricant coating agent 8. Therefore, even if a surface of the coil body 13 contacts a contact portion (such as the interior of a catheter or a blood vessel), the coil body 13 slides easily with respect to the contact portion. Consequently, the addition of stress to the coil body 13 in a shearing direction thereof can be reduced, so that it is possible to prevent the coil body 13 from separating from the core shaft 2. Further, since the surface of the coil body 13 has a first uneven shape, it is possible to prevent the lubricant coating agent 8, provided at the coil body 13, from separating from the surface of the coil body 13 by an anchoring effect. As a result, it is possible to maintain the lubricating ability of the lubricant coating agent 8.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">By maintaining the lubricating ability of the lubricant coating agent 8, it is possible to reduce for a long period of time friction resistance of a portion where the coil body 13 and the contact portion contact each other. Therefore, it is possible to reliably prevent the coil body 13 from separating from the core shaft 2.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, from the viewpoint of<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> protecting the coil body 13, it is desirable for the lubricant coating agent 8 to be applied to the outer surface and the inner surface of the coil body 13. However, the lubricant coating agent 8 may be applied to only the outer surface of the coil body 13.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, from the viewpoint of maximally preventing the coil body 13 from being separated from the core shaft 2, it is desirable to apply the lubricant coating agent 8 over the entire length of the coil body 13. However, the lubricant coating agent 8 may be applied to only a portion of the coil body 13 in a long-axis direction thereof (such as a distal end of the coil body 13).</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Examples of materials of the lubricant coating agent 8 include fluorocarbon resin such as polytetrafluoroethylene, silicone oil such as polydimethylsiloxane, and hydrophilic resin such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylamide, and hyaluronic acid. However, the materials are not limited thereto, so that other publicly known materials may also be used.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Various elastomer resins, such as polyamide elastomer or polyurethane elastomer, may be thinly applied to the outer periphery of the coil body 13 of the guidewire 21, and the aforementioned hydrophilic resin may be applied to the outer periphery of the elastomer resin. Even in such a case, the lubricating ability of the lubricant coating agent 8 is<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> maintained.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">When the elastomer resin is thinly applied, it is desirable that the surface of the elastomer resin after being applied to the outer periphery of the coil body 13 have a slight third uneven shape based on the first uneven shape. This allows the lubricating ability of the lubricant coating agent 8 formed of hydrophilic resin applied to the surface of the elastomer resin to be maintained for a long period of time by an anchoring effect of the third uneven shape.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments. Various modifications can be made to any of the above described embodiments and/or modifications by those skilled in the art within the technical idea of the present invention.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">For example, it is possible to apply the inclusions 4 used in the modification of the first embodiment to the coil body 13 according to the second embodiment. This makes it possible to make more complex the first uneven shape, and facilitate manufacturing of the complex uneven shape.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The heights of the protrusions and the depths of the recesses in the first uneven shape and in the second uneven shape may be made the same. However, considering the bonding strength between the tungsten wires 13a and the noble metal plating layers 13b and the bonding strength<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> between the noble metal plating layers 3b or 13b with respect to the metal solder by the anchoring effect, it is desirable that the heights of the protrusions and the depths of the recesses in the first uneven shape and in the second uneven shape differ from each other.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">In order to increase the bonding strength between the tungsten wires 3a and 13a and the respective noble metal plating layers 3b and 13b, metal plating layers formed of other metals may be provided as binders.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Further, although in the above described embodiments and modifications the coil body (3, 13) is mentioned to be formed by winding coil wires each including a tungsten wire (3a, 13a) and a noble metal plating layer (3b, 13b), the coil body may alternatively be formed by winding a single coil wire including a single tungsten wire and a single noble metal plating layer. Thus, the term "tungsten wire" used in the claims is to be understood to encompass a single tungsten wire or a plurality of tungsten wires. Further, in case of a single tungsten wire, the surface of the tungsten wire may be covered by a noble metal plating layer partly or completely. Similarly, in case of a plurality of tungsten wires the surface of each of the tungsten wires may be covered by a noble metal plating layer partly or completely.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56984450" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Führungsdraht (1, 11, 21) mit:
