For example, the movement of the main steering stem 20 can be controlled, as is known, by the steering wheel, whereas the movement of the first rod elements 17, 17' with respect to the first sleeve elements 15, 15' can be hydraulically activated by specific commands not necessarily directly connected to the rotation of the steering wheel.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">As can be seen in the examples shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">figures 1-3</figref>, the first sleeve elements 15, 15' are respectively rotatingly connected at one end to the relative wheel-holder group 13,

sleeve elements 15, 15' and another end spherically connected to relative articulated elements 18, 18'.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In particular said articulated elements 18, 18' are assembled at the opposite ends of the main steering stem 20 and form the axial translation limit of the same with respect to the main steering sleeve 21 connected to the central portion 12 of the axle.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">According to a preferred embodiment, the central portion 12 of the axle is integral with the vehicle 30 substantially along the longitudinal centre of the vehicle 30 and the structural extensions 11, 11' substantially develop from said central portion 12 of the axle orthogonally to the vehicle 30 towards the two ends with respect to which the wheel-holder groups 13, 13' rotate.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The main steering stem 20 is moveable with respect to the relative main steering cylinder 21, generally rigidly constrained to the central portion 12 of the axle, substantially parallel to the structural extensions of the axle 11, 11' and, in a known way, this movement is, as already mentioned, activated according to known mechanisms such as a rack mechanism or by hydraulic activation.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">If there is no relative movement between the first rod elements 17, 17' and the respective first sleeves 15, 15', the movement of the main steering stem 20 allows the wheel-holder group 13, 13' to be steered according to requirements, respecting the geometrical constraints imposed on the mechanism by the Ackermann geometry.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In particular, consequently, common curving maneuvers are allowed, with the object of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> invention, which can be effected with currently known steering devices.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">An example of this steering is represented in <figref idrefs="f0002">figures 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref> in which, for geometrical reasons, the instantaneous rotation centre of the vehicle 30 is outside the vehicle 30 itself.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">If, on the other hand, the main steering stem 20 is kept in a blocked position and centered with respect to the centre of the vehicle 30 and there is a telescopic movement of the two first rod elements 17, 17' with respect to the relative sleeves 15, 15' on both the right and left side of the axle, new angular positions of the wheel-holder groups 13, 13' are reached, which are suitable for obtaining geometrical constraints that are such as to impose on the vehicle 30 a rotation around a point corresponding to the centre of the rigid front axle of the vehicle 30 itself.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In particular, the instantaneous rotation centre is preferably situated in the centre of the other axle with respect to that which adopts the object of the present invention, generally the rigid front axle, or, should the vehicle 30 comprise two steering axles equipped with two steering groups 10, the vehicle 30 can effect rotations around its own centre.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">These angular positions of the wheel-holder groups<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> 13, 13' reached, thanks to the movement of the two first rod elements 17, 17' with respect to the relative sleeves 15, 15' are represented in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>, whereas <figref idrefs="f0004">figures 5 and 6</figref> show two vehicles 30 respectively in rotation around the centre of the other axle, and around its own centre depending on whether they are equipped with one or two steering groups 10.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Upon analyzing the figures, these in fact respectively show three possible different steering configurations of the wheel-holder groups 13, 13' with respect to the relative, independent, positions of the first rod elements 17, 17' and main steering stem 20.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows a steering group 10 of the wheels of a vehicle 30, object of the present invention, with a zero steering angle in which the stem 20 protrudes symmetrically from the main steering cylinder 21 and the first rod elements 17, 17' are in such a position, substantially entirely limited, with respect to the relative first sleeves 15, 15' as to impose a zero steering angle on the two wheel-holder groups 13, 13'.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> shows a steering group 10 of the wheels of a vehicle 30,

rod<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> elements 17, 17' - first sleeves 15, 15' are in an unaltered position with respect to the previous figure.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In particular, therefore, this configuration shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref> can be obtained starting from that illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> exclusively thanks to the translation of the main steering stem 20 and effects a steering of the Ackermann type shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> shows a

position as <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, whereas the first rod elements 17, 17' are brought, for example at run-end, into excursion with respect to the relative first sleeve 15, 15'.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Consequently, in particular, this configuration shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>, can be obtained starting from that shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> exclusively thanks to the movement of the first rod elements 17, 17' with respect to the relative first sleeve elements 15, 15' and allows the vehicle 30 to effect a rotation around the centre of the other axle as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 5</figref>, or to effect a rotation around the centre of the vehicle 30 if the vehicle 30 envisages both of the two steering axles equipped with the steering group 10, object of the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> present invention.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">This latter possibility is schematically shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 6</figref>.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>, the movements of the first rod elements 17, 17' with respect to the relative first sleeve 15, 15', preferably selectively driven hydraulically, allow an extra angular excursion of the wheel-holder groups to be obtained, also with the stem 20 in a blocked and centered position.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Thanks to the steering group 100 of the wheels of a vehicle 30 according to the present invention, it is advantageously possible to confer this angular position with a maximum almost transversal opening visible in <figref idrefs="f0004">figures 5, 6</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref> to the wheel-holder groups 13, 13' with respect to the relative structural extensions 11, 11'.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">This aspect is also advantageous because, as this excursion is independent of the movement of the main steering stem 20 and therefore independent of the rotation of the steering wheel on which the user acts, it allows these extra-excursion configurations to be obtained hydraulically without requiring excessive effort on the part of the user and without endangering the use of the main steering cylinder 21.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The functioning of the device, object of the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> invention, can be easily understood.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The steering group 10 of the wheels of an axle of a vehicle 30 according to the present invention is equipped with steering means 100, 100' which comprise for
