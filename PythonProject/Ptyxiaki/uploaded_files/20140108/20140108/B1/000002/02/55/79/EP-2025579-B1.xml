Unfortunately the steering mechanism currently used does not allow the limits of the turning radius imposed by the Ackermann steering geometry which prevents the rotation of the whole vehicle with respect to a point inside the ground-support quadrilateral of the same vehicle, to be exceeded.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">It is not possible, for example, for present known vehicles to rotate around the centre of their own rigid driving axle, for example the front drive, nor is it possible to effect a rotation with respect to the centre of the vehicle itself for the above-mentioned kinematic reasons of the known steering groups and also because it is not possible for current known vehicles to impose two discordant rotations on a pair of driving<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> wheels of the same axle.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">An objective of the present invention is to provide a device capable of solving the above drawbacks of the known art in an extremely simple, economical and particularly functional way.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A further objective is to provide a vehicle which enables greater steering angles to be obtained with respect to those which can currently be reached.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Another objective is to provide a vehicle which enables wide steering angles to be obtained without requiring effort on the part of the user acting on the steering wheel, thus improving the maneuverability of the vehicle in limited spaces.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Yet another objective is to provide a vehicle which allows steering around a point inside the vehicle itself such as, for example, the centre of a rigid front drive axle or with respect to the centre of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">An additional objective is to provide a vehicle capable of imposing two discordant rotations on a pair of drive wheels of the same axle.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">These objectives according to the present invention are achieved by providing a steering group of the wheels of a vehicle as specified in claim 1.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Further characteristics of the invention are indicated in the subsequent claims.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The characteristics and advantages of an improved vehicle according to the present invention will appear more evident from the following illustrative and nonlimiting description, referring to the enclosed schematic drawings, in which:

1</figref>, a<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> differential group 20, 19.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In particular, this differential group 20, 19 comprises an outer box 20, which can be activated in rotation by a crown 15 activated in rotation by a motor, and an internal box 19 in which a first and second end of two half-shafts 11, 12 converge, from facing opposite ends.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The

connected to the ends of the two half-shafts 11, 12 converging inside the inner box 19 of the differential group 20, 19.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The latter secondary toothed gears 16, 17 are in

10 also comprises selective engagement means 21 of the inner box 19 with the outer box 20, selective blocking means 24, 25, 26 of the inner box 19 with respect to the chassis, and direct selective gearing means 22, 23,<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> 27, 28 of the movement coming from the crown 15 to one of the two half-shafts 11, 12.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In particular, according to the

the direct selective gearing means 22, 23, 27, 28 are activated, an opposite rotation with respect to the other is transmitted to the same pair of driving wheels 40, 40'.</p><p id="p0032"

gearing means 22, 23, 27, 28 have been activated, i.e. blocking the inner box 19 with respect to the chassis 35 and imposing a rotation directly on one of the two half-shafts 11, 12, due to the coupling of the primary toothed gears 13, 14 and secondary toothed gears 16, 17, the two driving wheels 40, 40' are activated in rotation following two opposite rotations.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Consequently, the control group 10 described above according to a preferred embodiment allows the driving wheels 40, 40' to which it is connected to proceed<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> straight with the same angular rate and to effect common curving maneuvers with different and concordant angular rates, when the boxes 19, 20 of the differential are integral with each other and form a common

id="p0037" num="0037">Only according to the invention is it consequently possible for the vehicle 30 to effect rotations around its own centre in which the two driving wheels 40, 40' proceed with discordant angular rates of the angular half-axes 11 and 12 wherein, as in the example of <figref idrefs="f0005">figure 7</figref>, the right wheel 40 follows the instantaneous trajectory indicated in
