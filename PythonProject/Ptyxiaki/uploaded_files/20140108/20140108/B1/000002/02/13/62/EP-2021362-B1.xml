The proteins are used for e.g. labelling of biomolecules. Due to their genetically encoded fluorescence, fluorescent proteins have become most important marker molecules and tools in cell biology. Becoming spontaneously fluorescent without any requirements for cofactors, substrates or other gene products, FPs have revolutionized research in many areas of biology.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">During recent years FPs have also gathered strong appreciation as powerful tools for the drug discovery process. As fluorescent probes, FPs enable both real-time and non-invasive reporting in living cells. This ability provides a basis for cell-based monitoring of FP-linked targets upon administration of external drugs. The impact of FPs has been revolutionary; FPs have not only facilitated visualization of intricate cellular architecture but they have also acted as markers of protein dynamics and behavior in cell biology. These applications have been translated to drug discovery where fluorescence proteins have been utilized in fluorescence and confocal imaging, HTS/HCS screening assays and for in <i>vivo</i> diagnostics. FPs cannot only be used in early stage target characterization but also in retrieving non-invasive 'whole organism' data and in evaluating lead compound toxicology.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Limitations of most fluorescent proteins are generally associated with molecular brightness and/or stability. Moreover, many FPs have additional complications involving protein folding, chromophore maturation and self-association. Although FPs have vastly improved over the years, mainly by introducing mutations, they still exhibit major limitations.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">There is an interest in obtaining new fluorescent proteins with different properties compared to known fluorescent proteins.

In this example <i>Branchiostoma lanceolatum</i> were collected. Their heads were cut off and mixed with an equal volume of a neutral buffer solution (e.g., 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl). The mixture was digested with proteinase K (final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml) at 40°C over-night followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 16 000 rpm to remove any remaining debris. The supernatant was loaded on a Sephadex G-200 column (30-100 cm; equilibrated with the same buffer as used during the digestion) and gel filtrated. Fluorescent fractions were collected, pooled, and precipitated by addition of 1.8 volumes of acetone and centrifugation for 1 min at 16000 rpm. The supernatant was discharged. The<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> pellet was washed with 65% acetone, briefly dried (allowing remaining acetone to evaporate), dissolved in water, denaturated with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; final concentration of 1 %) and dithiothreitol (DTT; final concentration 100 mM) at 95°C for 3 min, and loaded on a 2.5% SDS-PAGE gel. After the completed gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining, the two bands at around 30 kDalton were cut out, eluted, and digested into fragments with trypsin. The fragments are analyzed with tandem mass spectrometry using MALDI-TOF (matrix assisted laser desorption-time of flight) to obtain their amino acid sequence. Degenerated oligonucleotide primers are designed from these amino acid sequences. These primers are used for 5'-RACE PCR (rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction) on cDNA that is prepared from purified mRNA from lancelet heads. The PCR products are size separated by agarose electrophoresis. The different bands are cut out, purified, cloned, and sequenced. Oligonucleotide primers are designed from the obtained sequences and used for 3'RACE PCR on the same cDNA to obtain the complete coding region.

These sequences were elongated by successive searches with the sequences for new matching sequences and alignments of these new sequences to these already found.

The assembled genes are analyzed by a splicing prediction software [NetGene2 software (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetGene2/)] and putative exons are converted into amino acid sequences.

Three amino acid residues were chosen as suitable candidates for mutagenesis, and three mutants with single, double and triple mutations were constructed and custom made by an external laboratory.

However, the monomeric mutant (Mut C), SEQ ID NO: 93, has lost much of the brightness of the wild-type protein, and - probably due to a maturation defect - has its major emission peak shifted to the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> orange part of the spectra. Interestingly, the mutants, including the monomeric variant, have also a new emission peak with a maximum at ∼660 nm with excitation at 590 nm. The emission peak is quite wide and although the overall intensity is low, there is a clear emission up to 750 nm, thus extending into the infrared part of the spectra (<figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref>), which is a clear benefit for <i>in vivo</i> applications.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><heading id="h0022">SEQUENCE LISTING</heading><p id="p0061" num="0061"><ul><li>&lt;110&gt; Innoventus Project AB</li><li>&lt;120&gt; Fluorescent proteins and genes encoding them</li><li>&lt;130&gt; P40600048PCT00</li><li>&lt;150&gt; <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US60811769B"><text>US 60/811,769</text></patcit><br/>
