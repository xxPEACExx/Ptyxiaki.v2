More particularly, the present invention relates to wedge-threaded components of tubular connections incorporating a metal-to-metal seal therebetween. More particularly still, the present invention relates to single-step multi-portion wedge-threaded tubular connections incorporating high-angle metal-to-metal seals.</p><heading id="h0003">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Casing joints, liners, and other oilfield tubulars are frequently used to drill, complete, and produce wells. For example, casing joints may be placed in a wellbore to stabilize and protect a formation against high wellbore pressures (<i>e.g.,</i> wellbore pressures that exceed a formation pressure) that could otherwise damage the formation. Casing joints are sections of pipe (<i>e.g.,</i> steel or titanium), which may be coupled in an end-to-end manner by threaded connections, welded connections, or any other connection mechanisms known in the art. As such, connections are usually designed so that at least one seal is formed between an interior of the coupled casing joints and the annulus formed between exterior walls of the casing joints and the interior walls of the wellbore (<i>i.e.,</i> the formation). The seals may be elastomeric (<i>e.g.,</i> an o-ring seal), thread seals, metal-to-metal seals, or any other seals known to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It should be understood that certain terms are used herein as they would be conventionally understood, particularly where threaded tubular joints are connected in a vertical position along their central axes such as when making up a pipe string for lowering into a well bore. Typically, in a male-female threaded tubular connection, the male component of the connection is referred to as a "pin" member and the female component is called a "box" member. As used herein, "make-up" refers to engaging a pin member into a box member and threading the members<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> together through torque and rotation. Further, the term "selected make-up" refers to the threading of a pin member and a box member together with a desired amount of torque or based on a relative position (axial or circumferential) of the pin member with respect to the box member. Furthermore, the term "box face" is understood to be the end of the box member facing outward from the box threads and the term "pin nose" is understood to be the end of the pin member facing outward from the threads of the connection. As such, upon make-up of a connection, the nose of the pin is stabbed or inserted into and past the face of the box.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Referring to the geometry of threads, the term "load flank" designates the side wall surface of a thread that faces away from the outer end of the respective pin or box member on which the thread is formed and supports the weight (<i>i.e.,</i> tensile load) of the lower tubular member hanging in the well bore. Similarly, the term "stab flank" designates the side wall surface of the thread that faces toward the outer end of the respective pin or box member and supports forces compressing the joints toward each other such as the weight of the upper tubular member during the initial make-up of the joint or such as a force applied to push a lower tubular member against the bottom of a bore hole (<i>i.e.,</i> compressive force).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">One type of threaded connection commonly used oil country tubular goods is a wedge thread. Referring initially to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1A and 1B</figref>, a prior art tubular connection <b>100</b> having a wedge thread is shown. As used herein, "wedge threads" are threads, regardless of a particular thread form, that increase in width (<i>i.e.,</i> axial distance between load flanks <b>225</b> and <b>226</b> and stab flanks <b>232</b> and <b>231</b>) in opposite directions on a pin member <b>101</b> and a box member <b>102.</b> The rate at which the threads change in width along the connection is defined by a variable known as the "wedge ratio." As used herein, "wedge ratio," although technically not a ratio, refers to the difference between the stab flank lead and the load flank lead, which causes the width of the threads to vary along the connection. Furthermore, as used herein, a thread "lead" refers to the differential distance between a component of a thread on consecutive threads. As such, the "stab lead" is the distance between stab flanks of consecutive thread pitches along the axial length of the connection. A detailed discussion of wedge ratios is provided in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6206436B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,206,436</text></patcit> regarded as closest prior art to the invention, issued to Mallis, assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Furthermore, wedge threads are extensively<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="USRE30647E"><text>U.S. Patent No. RE 30,647 issued to Blose</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="USRE34467E"><text>U.S. Pat. No. RE 34,467 issued to Reeves</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US4703954A"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 4,703,954 issued to Ortloff</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US5454605A"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 5,454,605 issued to Mott</text></patcit>, all assigned to the assignee of the present invention.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Referring still to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1A and 1B</figref>, a pin thread crest <b>222</b> in a wedge thread coupling is narrow towards a distal end <b>108</b> of pin member <b>101</b> while a box thread crest <b>291</b> is wide. Moving along an axis <b>105</b> (from right to left), pin thread <b>crest 222</b> widens while box thread crest <b>291</b> narrows as it approaches a distal end <b>110</b> of box member <b>102.</b> As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1A</figref>, the threads are tapered, meaning that a pin thread <b>106</b> increases in diameter from beginning to end while a box thread <b>107</b> decreases in diameter in a complimentary manner. Having a thread taper may improve the ability to stab pin member <b>101</b> into box member <b>102</b> and distribute stress throughout the connection.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Generally, thread seals are difficult to achieve in non-wedge (<i>i.e.,</i> free-running) threads. However, thread forms that are unable to form a wedge seal in a free-running configuration may create thread seals when used in a wedge thread configuration. As should be understood by one of ordinary skill, as wedge threads do not require any particular type or geometry of thread form, a variety of thread forms may be used. One example of a suitable thread form is a semi-dovetailed thread form disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US5360239A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,360,239, issued to Klementich</text></patcit> . Another thread form includes a multi-faceted load flank or stab flank, as disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US6722706B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,722,706, issued to Church</text></patcit>. Each of the above thread forms is considered to be a "trapped" thread form, meaning that at least a portion of the corresponding load flanks and/or corresponding stab flanks axially overlap. An open (<i>i.e.,</i> not trapped) thread form with a generally rectangular shape is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US6578880B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,578,880, issued to Watts</text></patcit>. As such, the above thread forms (<i>i.e.,</i> those of Klementich, Church, and Watts) are examples of thread forms that may be used with embodiments of the invention. Generally, open thread forms such as buttress or stub are not suitable for wedge threads, as they would impart a large radial force on the box member. However, a generally square thread form, such as that disclosed by Watts, or a trapped thread form, may be used, as they do not impart an outward<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> radial force on the box member. As such, those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the teachings contained herein are not limited to particular thread forms.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Referring again to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1A and 1B</figref>, in wedge threads, a thread seal may be accomplished through contact pressure caused by interference that occurs at make-up over at least a portion of connection <b>100</b> between pin load flank <b>226</b> and box load flank <b>225</b> and between pin stab flank <b>232</b> and box stab flank <b>231.</b> Close proximity or interference between roots <b>292</b> and <b>221</b> and crests <b>222</b> and <b>291</b> complete the thread seal when occurring proximate to such flank interference. Generally, higher pressures may be contained either by increasing interference between the roots and crests ("root/crest interference") on pin member <b>101</b> and box member <b>102</b> or by increasing the aforementioned flank interference.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Although various wedge thread connections exist having positive-stop torque shoulders (<i>e.g.,</i> Klementich, referenced above), wedge threads typically do not have torque shoulders, so their make-up is "indeterminate," and, as a result, the relative position of the pin member and box member may vary more during make-up for a given torque range to be applied than for connections having a positive-stop torque shoulder. For wedge threads designed to have flank interference and root/crest interference at a selected make-up, the connection is designed such that both the flank interference and root/crest interference increase as the connection is made-up (<i>i.e.,</i> an increase in torque increases flank interference and root/crest interference). For tapered wedge threads having root/crest clearance, the clearance decreases as the connection is made-up. Regardless of the design of the wedge thread, corresponding flanks come closer to each other (<i>i.e.,</i> clearance decreases or interference increases) during make-up. Indeterminate make-up allows for the flank interference and root/crest interference to be increased by increasing the make-up torque on the connection. Thus, a wedge thread may be able to thread-seal higher pressures of gas and/or liquid by designing the connection to have more flank interference and/or root/crest interference or by increasing the make-up torque on the connection. However, increased interference and make-up torque may increase stress on the connection during make-up, which may lead to premature failure of the connection.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Furthermore, as shown, connection <b>100</b> includes a metal-to-metal seal <b>112</b> created by contact between corresponding seal surfaces <b>103</b> and <b>104,</b> respectively<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> located on pin member <b>101</b> and box member <b>102.</b> Metal-to-metal seal <b>112</b> provides an additional measure of seal integrity (<i>i.e.,</i> when a wedge thread seal is not sufficient) for threaded connection <b>100,</b> and is particularly useful where connection 100 is intended to contain high-pressure gases. While the metal-to-metal seal is shown located proximate to the distal end <b>108</b> of pin member <b>102,</b> it should be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that metal-to-metal seal <b>112</b> may be positioned anywhere along the length of connection <b>100,</b> including, but not limited to, a location proximate to the distal end of box member <b>102.</b></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Nonetheless, seal surfaces <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> of metal-to-metal seal <b>112</b> are usually constructed as corresponding frusta-conical surfaces characterized by a low angle (<i>e.g.,</i> an angle less than about 4 or 5 degrees) of intersection with their corresponding remaining pin <b>101</b> and box <b>102</b> surfaces. Typically, low-angle metal-to-metal seal surfaces <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> are used in conjunction with wedge thread connections (<i>e.g.,</i> <b>100</b>) because the indeterminate make-up thereof necessitates a seal capable of less precise axial alignment. As wedge threads make-up indeterminately, the relative axial position of pin member <b>101</b> and box member <b>102</b> will vary over successive make-up and breakout cycles. However, one disadvantage of a low-angle metal-to-metal seal is that seal surfaces <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> have friction contact areas than higher-angle seals, and as such, have less resistance to galling upon make-up. Furthermore, as low-angle metal-to-metal seals engage slowly (<i>i.e.,</i> low radial displacement per revolution), the seals must be in contact for several revolutions. As such, in a wedge thread connection including a metal-to-metal seal, the seal is typically the first thing to "make-up," such that the initial engagement of the seal marks the "land tight" state of such a threaded connection. Therefore, while low-angle seals are beneficial in that they accommodate the indeterminate make-up characteristics of wedge threads, they may become ineffective over repeated make-up and break-out cycles as seal surfaces <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> are deformed and/or are cold-worked out of specification.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In contrast, free-running threads used in oilfield tubular connections typically do not form thread seals when the connection is made-up. Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, a prior art connection <b>200</b> having free-running threads is shown. The free-running threads include load flanks <b>254</b> and <b>255,</b> stab flanks <b>257</b> and <b>258,</b> crests <b>259</b> and <b>262,</b> and roots <b>260</b> and <b>261.</b> As is typical of a connection with free-running threads,<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> connection <b>200</b> relies on a positive-stop torque shoulder formed by the contact of surfaces <b>252</b> and <b>251</b> disposed on a pin member <b>201</b> and a box member <b>202,</b> respectively. The positive-stop torque shoulder shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is commonly referred to as a "pin nose shoulder." In other connections, the positive-stop torque shoulder may instead be formed by a box face <b>263</b> and a mating shoulder (not shown) on pin member <b>201.</b> The positive-stop torque shoulder also provides a seal. Unlike wedge threads (<i>e.g.,</i> those shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1B</figref>), which make-up by the wedging of the pin thread <b>106</b> and the box thread <b>107,</b> free-running threads rely on the positive-stop torque shoulder to load connection <b>200</b> during make-up. To make-up connection <b>200,</b> pin member <b>201</b> and box member <b>202</b> are screwed together until surfaces <b>251</b> and <b>252</b> are brought into abutment, at which point pin load <b>flank 254</b> and box load flank <b>255</b> are also in abutment. Additional torque is applied to pin member <b>201</b> and box member <b>202</b> to load surfaces <b>252</b> and <b>251</b> and pin load flank <b>254</b> and box load flank <b>255</b> until the desired amount of make-up torque (<i>i.e.,</i> the selected make-up) has been applied to connection <b>200.</b></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Because a large gap <b>253</b> exists between pin stab flank <b>257</b> and box stab flank <b>258,</b> connection <b>200</b> does not accomplish a thread seal. Gap <b>253</b> occurs as a result of how free-running threads with positive-stop torque shoulders are loaded. Applying torque to connection <b>200</b> during make-up against the positive-stop torque shoulder causes pin member <b>201</b> to be compressed while box member <b>202</b> is stretched in tension. Note that when a box face shoulder is used, box member <b>202</b> is compressed while pin member <b>201</b> is stretched in tension. The force between pin member <b>201</b> and box member <b>202</b> is applied through pin load flank <b>254</b> and box load flank <b>255.</b> Notably pin stab flank <b>257</b> and box stab flank <b>258</b> are not loaded during make-up. This results in contact pressure between load flanks <b>254 and 255</b> and gap 253 between stab flanks <b>257</b> and <b>258.</b> As discussed above, a wedge thread (<i>e.g.,</i> <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>) forms a thread seal in part because of the interference between load flanks <b>225</b> and <b>226</b> and stab flanks <b>232</b> and <b>231.</b> In wedge threads, this occurs near the end of the make-up of the connection because of the varying width of pin thread <b>106</b> and box thread <b>107.</b> To have similar interference between load flanks <b>254</b> and <b>255</b> and stab flanks <b>257</b> and <b>258</b> on a cylindrical (<i>i.e.,</i> non-tapered) free-running thread, the interference would exist substantially throughout the make-up of the connection because pin thread <b>206</b> and box thread <b>207</b> have a continuous width.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> Furthermore, root/crest interference, if any, would exist substantially throughout the make-up of the connection. This could lead to galling of the threads and difficulty in making-up the connection.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The variance in thread width for a wedge thread occurs as a result of the load flanks having different leads than the stab flanks. A thread lead may be quantified in inches per revolution or by the commonly used inverse term "thread pitch," (<i>i.e.,</i> threads per inch). A graph of the leads for a prior art wedge thread is shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3A</figref>. For this connection, the load lead <b>14</b> is constant over the length of the connection and greater than the stab lead <b>12,</b> which is also constant. The nominal lead is shown as item <b>10.</b> As used herein, "nominal lead" refers to the average of load lead <b>14</b> and stab lead <b>12.</b> The thread will widen with each revolution by the difference in load lead <b>14</b> and stab lead <b>12.</b> As described above, the difference in the load lead <b>14</b> and the stab lead <b>12</b> is the "wedge ratio." For a free-running thread (<i>i.e.,</i> non-wedge thread), load lead <b>14</b> and stab lead <b>12</b> would be substantially equal, thus causing the free-running thread to have a substantially constant thread width (<i>i.e.,</i> a zero wedge ratio).</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Intentional variances in thread leads have been disclosed in the prior art for the purposes of load distribution. One example of a varied thread lead for stress distribution is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US4582348A"><text>U.S, Patent No. 4,582,348 issued to Dearden</text></patcit>. Dearden discloses a connection with free-running threads that has the pin thread and box thread divided into three sections, each with different leads (note that Dearden refers to thread pitch, which is quantified as threads per inch). In <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3B</figref>, a graph of the thread leads for the box member and the pin member of Dearden is shown.

As used herein, "pipe body efficiency" is the tensile strength of the connection relative to the tensile strength of the tubular, The primary reason for needing a thicker connection is the unengaged space of the mid-step, which is required so that the threads on the large step may clear the threads on the small step during stabbing. The mid-step, due to the lack of thread engagement, does not contribute to the overall strength of the connection. The advantages of having two separate threads often makes up for the decreased pipe body efficiency, however, it is desirable to have a single-step thread that may exhibit the advantages of two-step connections.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><heading id="h0004"><b>Summary of Invention</b></heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">In one aspect, the present invention relates to a threaded connection including a pin member providing a single external wedge thread having a first external portion and a second external portion.

As shown, transition thread portion <b>602</b> begins at a slightly earlier selected axial position on box member <b>607</b> than on pin member <b>606</b>. This offset allows the threads of box member <b>607</b> to "open up" or widen slightly earlier than those of pin member <b>606</b>, resulting in a selected clearance between flanks on the transition region <b>602.</b> To return to flank interference, second portion <b>603</b> may begin at an earlier selected axial position on box member <b>607</b>, thus allowing threads of pin member <b>606</b> to "catch up." Alternatively, second portion <b>603</b> of box member <b>607</b> and pin member <b>606</b> of may begin simultaneously to further delay a selected make-up of second portion <b>603</b> following a selected make-up of first portion <b>601.</b> Thus, variations in load lead <b>614</b> and stab lead <b>616</b> over the length of the threads allows for a connection to exhibit different make-up characteristics in each portion of the connection. Those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that various combinations of portions (<i>e.g</i>., <b>601, 602, 603</b>) may be used in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0007">Figures 7A-7B</figref>, a two-portion wedge-threaded connection <b>700</b> is shown schematically. Connection <b>700</b> is distinct from connection <b>600</b> of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 6A-6B</figref> in that connection <b>700</b> does not include a transition thread portion (<i>e.g</i>., <b>602</b>) between a first portion <b>701</b> and a second portion <b>703.</b> As such, connection <b>700</b> is characterized by a wedge ratio <b>711</b> of first portion <b>701</b> that<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> instantaneously expands to a larger wedge ratio <b>713</b> of second portion <b>703.</b> Similar to the connections shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figures 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">6</figref>, the second portion of the pin thread may lag the box thread lead by an offset <b>705</b> to allow the box thread to open up or widen slightly earlier than pin thread. While change in wedge ratio from <b>711</b> to <b>713</b> is shown as a substantially instantaneous step change, a smoother graduated change may be used.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As described above, wedge threads are characterized by indeterminate make-up. However, the amount of indetenninateness of a wedge-threaded connection may be varied by changing the underlying wedge ratio. For example, wedge-threaded connections having a more conservative (<i>i.e</i>., lower) wedge ratio, make-up to a selected amount of flank interference more indeterminately than those having more aggressive wedge ratios. As such, a connection having a more conservative wedge ratio will require more rotation (and torque) to reach a selected make-up, and thus be more indeterminate than a connection having an aggressive wedge ratio. In contrast, connections exhibiting more aggressive wedge ratios will make-up more determinately, but will be less resistant to backing off than connections having conservative wedge ratios.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">As such, single-step wedge-threaded connections with at least two threaded portions at differing wedge ratios are highly beneficial in connections having a metal-to-metal seal (<i>e.g</i>., <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1A</figref>) to reduce the amount of wear and galling experienced by such seals. Particularly, a continuous, wedge-threaded connection, in which a first thread portion has a conservative wedge thread, and a second thread portion has an aggressive wedge thread, may be used to allow a more determinate engagement of such a seal.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">For example, in an embodiment in accordance with the present invention, a continuous, single-step wedge-threaded connection may be constructed having two (or more) portions, a first portion having a conventional (less aggressive) wedge ratio, and a second portion having a higher (more aggressive) wedge ratio. Because of the high wedge ratio of the second portion, the connection could include a radial metal-to-metal seal having a seal angle between about 4 and about 15 degrees. Further, in some embodiments, seal angles of about 7 degrees, about 14 degrees, or anywhere therebetween may be used. As described above, the metal-to-metal seal<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> may be a pin-nose seal, box face seal, or any other seal known to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Furthermore, for a two-portion wedge-threaded connection, the more aggressive second portion may comprise a smaller percentage of the total number of thread pitches than the more conservative first portion. For example, if a conventional standard wedge thread has ten pitches and a wedge ratio of 0.015" (0,381 mm)/pitch (<i>i.e</i>., the thread width grows by 10 pitches • 0.015" (0,381 mm)/pitch = 0.150" 3,81 mm over the length of the thread), a two-portion wedge thread of the same axial length may have two pitches at a wedge ratio of 0.030 in the second portion and the remaining eight pitches at 0.01125" (0,286 mm)/pitch wedge ratio (<i>i.e</i>., [0.150" (0,381 mm)- 2•0.030" (0,762 mm)]/ 8) in the first portion and still maintain the same growth in thread width over the length of the thread. Alternatively, the first and second portions may be of substantially equal number of pitches or length. Alternatively still, a multi-portion wedge-threaded connection may have several alternating conservative and aggressive portions, wherein each conservative/aggressive couple acts to selectively make-up the connection in parallel.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The make-up sequence for a continuous two-portion wedge-threaded connection in accordance with embodiments of the present invention may include the first portion making-up (<i>e.g</i>., a preliminary rotation) before the engagement of the metal-to-metal seal (<i>e.g.</i>, a secondary rotation) and the making-up of the second portion (<i>e.g</i>., a tertiary rotation). Preferably, the wedge ratio of the second portion could be related to the angle of the metal-to-metal seal, such that the second portion reaches its selected make-up at the same time the metal-to-metal seal becomes fully engaged. Generally, to achieve this goal, a steeper seal angle will require a higher wedge ratio in the second thread portion. For example, as the metal-to-metal seal having a seal angle of about 14 degrees will fully engage within 1/4 turn of a typical wedge thread, the axial position and wedge ratio of the second portion may be chosen such that the second portion reaches desired flank interference in about 1/4 turn, at essentially the same selected make-up that the metal-to-metal seal reaches full engagement.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">It should be understood that wedge thread connections in accordance with embodiments of the present invention are advantageous over those in the prior art in<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> that the metal-to-metal seals contained therewith may be more durable and less susceptible to damage in service and during make-up and break-out cycles.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">High-angle metal-to-metal seals in accordance with embodiments of the present invention are less susceptible to damage from eccentric contact during make-up and break-out as they are engaged after a first portion of a continuous multi-portioned wedge-threaded connection is made up. As such, make-up of the first portion prior to the engagement of the metal-to-metal seals may act to "pilot" the seal components into engagement with reduced likelihood of eccentric contact. Similarly, during break out, the seals may be disengaged prior to break-out of the first portion, thus again allowing the first portion to "pilot" the seal components apart axially, thus protecting seal surfaces from eccentric contact. Thus early engagement/late disengagement of the first portion of a continuous multi-portioned wedge-threaded connection may protect seal surfaces by piloting components of a metal-to-metal seal into and out of engagement along the an axis of the connection.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Furthermore, as described above, the reduced contact area of a high-angle seal in accordance with embodiments of the present invention translates to less metal-to-metal seal area, thereby reducing the likelihood and magnitude of galling therebetween. Furthermore, as the high-angle seals engage under less rotational displacement than low-angle seals, there is less metal-to-metal frictional displacement through that seal area.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">While the invention has been described with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art, having benefit of this disclosure, will appreciate that other embodiments can be devised which do not depart from the scope of the invention as disclosed herein.
