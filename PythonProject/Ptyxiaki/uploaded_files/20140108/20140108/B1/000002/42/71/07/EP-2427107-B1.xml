a device and a method for placing and securing sensors/electrodes on the head of an individual.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background of the invention</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Measurements of the electrical activity of the brain are, due to historical reasons, especially widespread in Europe and Russia within neurophysiologic and psychophysiologic diagnostics. Since 1960 the development regarding biofeedback treatment has for a large part been performed in the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe and Russia. As known within the field there exists both biological and technical methods for measuring and influencing different types of activities in the brain. The most common methods are: Electroencephalography (EEG), Hemoencephalography (HEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG). Within QEEG (quantitative EEG measurements) several mathematical models have been developed in order to measure discriminant functions that comprise: power-coherence, phase, IFTA pre vs. post treatment statistics, low RATE, instant coherence phase &amp; Z - score biofeedback and others. QEEG is performed as a common EEG-recording, where an operator arranges several (21+) electrodes on the head of an individual in order to register a large part of the electrical activity of the brain at the same time. The brain activity is registered during a time period and functional assignements beyond the standard, eyes open and shut, may be added. The information is often compared to the activity which is analyzed by all of the various software systems that the operator has installed. The different types of software utilises different mathematical models for diagnosis, while others use systemic models, also called protocols, for treatment. Amongst other things, it is important that the electrodes in the QEEG system are placed in a correct manner, and that the contact between the electrodes and scalp is good. This is important in order to obtain an optimal basis for comparison between two measurements, or for comparing measurements from two or several individuals. Therefore, as a standard, the electrodes are placed in accordance with the international 10 - 20 system (described by for instance Ernst Niedermeyer, Fernando Lopes da Silva, Electroencephalography: Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Related Fields, page 140). It is challenging to obtain the same result from two measurements. A more standardized<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> system, than the sum of what exists today, would be very advantageous with regard to the further development of the science and research within this field.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Most EEG and QEEG systems today are based on elastic mesh and/or caps which are adapted to the 10 - 20 system, or other less known placement-charts. These caps are made in various designs with apertures for inserting electrodes. The caps are also made in several different sizes since the distance between the electrodes must be adapted to the size of the skull in accordance to the 10 - 20 system, or other placement-charts. The problem is often that these caps are not capable of furnishing the electrodes with enough pressure against the skull, due to hair and the shape of the skull. Caps that are tightened are often uncomfortable for the individual, and especially for sensitive children.<br/>
Optimization is necessary to achieve a signal without too much background noise. Such noise will lead to less accurate measurements and information. The electrodes must also be placed manually in a correct manner with regard to the different sizes of the skull, and this is often time consuming and requires competence. Further, such manual placing of the electrodes increases the risk of placing the electrodes in an erroneously manner due to human failure.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Patent application publication <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20070106170A1"><text>US 2007/0106170 A1</text></patcit> discloses an electrode/sensor cap for use in EEG.

The device has an inner cap/layer that is constructed in a fluid-proof elastic material having a fluid-proof directly joined to an outer rigid shell/layer. The direct joining is along the circumference of the inner cap/layer enabling the homogenous expansion of said inner cap/layer. The middle layer, between the outer shell and the inner cap, comprises a fluid and/or a material that may be compressed/expanded in a uniform manner depending on the gas pressure or amount of fluid. The elastic cap/layer is slightly smaller in size than the smallest head to which it shall fit. This is due to the fact that the inner layer must be able to apply pressure to the EEG electrodes against the skull to achieve an optimal signal. A gas or fluid pump provides an<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> underpressure/vacuum to develop between the rigid outer shell and the inner elastic cap by withdrawing fluid from the middle layer. The elastic cap will then expand homogenously to a size larger than the individuals head. Then the individual puts the helmet on and fluid is released back into the middle layer by use of a means for regulating pressure, for instance a valve, so that the inner layer shrinks and provides pressure on the electrodes, pushing them against the skull. The fact that the elastic cap is expanded homogenously also causes the distances between the electrodes to increase homogenously. This device/helmet causes the distance between the electrodes to be regulated properly independent of the individuals head size, when using for example the 10-20 system. Time and use of resources may be utilized better and a more standardized system for QEEG analyzes is achieved. In addition, neither time consuming individual adaptation, nor a large number of caps of different sizes adapted to each individual, will be necessary.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The present invention is primarily developed for use together with EEG sensors, but is not limited to this use, and may without any other requirements be adapted for use with sensors like MEG and HEG, as well as other sensors developed for use in measurements of the brains activity.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>Short description of the drawings</b></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>: Cross section of a device according to the invention seen from the front, without vacuum.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>: Cross section of a device according to the invention seen from the front, with vacuum.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>: An example of the arrangement of the electrodes on the inner cap when the individual have a large sized head.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref>: An example of the arrangement of the electrodes on the inner cap when the individual have a small sized head.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>: Cross section of a device according to the invention seen from the side without vacuum.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref>: Cross section of a device according to the invention seen from the side with vacuum, after adaptation to an individual.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>Detailed description of the invention</b></heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">The present invention have many areas of use, like EEG, HEG and MEG, but it is in the following described more detailed with regards to its use in QEEG (Quantitative Electroencephalography) in order to illustrate which problems the invention solves. QEEG is a type of EEG where an operator places several (21+) electrodes on an individual's head in order to register the brains electrical activity. The brain activity is registered over a period of time, and is often presented as a topographical map. The topographical maps are often compared to normative databases (databases containing topographical maps). Therefore, it is important that the electrodes in the QEEG system are placed correctly in order to achieve a proper basis for comparison. Usually, the electrodes are therefore arranged in accordance to the international 10-20 system. It is challenging to achieve the same results in two separate measurements, and a system, more standardized than what exists today, would therefore be advantageous. Other placement charts than the 10-20 system may also be used.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> shows the distance between the electrodes/sensors 1 before the fluid is pumped out of the middle layer 2. When the fluid is pumped out, <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, the elastic inner cap 3 will expand uniformly, and the distances between the electrodes/sensors along the X-axis will increase correspondingly. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3 and 4</figref> show the distances between the electrodes/sensors along the X-and Y-axis, when an individual using the helmet has a large size head (for instance an adult, here with a head size 58, <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 3</figref>) and when an individual has a small size head (for instance a child, here with a head size 42, <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 4</figref>), respectively. In this manner the electrodes will attain a correct placing independent of the head size of the individual using the device/helmet.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">6</figref> shows one specific embodiment of the invention. Here shown as a type of helmet comprising a rigid outer shell 4 and an elastic inner cap 3, joined together by a fluid-proof joint 10. The joint 10 is preferably constructed in such a way that the elastic cap may be taken on and off in order to facilitate cleaning and repair of electrodes/sensors 5, switch type of cap 3 and so forth. The electrodes/sensors 5 are fasten on, and penetrates, the elastic cap 3 by use of a fluid-proof joint and the wires 8 belonging to said electrodes/sensors are led out through a fluid-proof joint 6. The wires 8 are connected to EEG measuring equipment 11. The fluid<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> pressure is regulated by a vacuum pump 7 connected through the outer rigid shell 4 using a valve 9. In this embodiment, the fluid used in the middle layer is air. In order for the elastic inner cap 3 to expand homogenously and unhindered it is only directly joined to the rigid outer shell 4 along the circumference of the inner cap 3, by way of the joint 10.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The material used in the cap 3 may be any suitable elastic material that is fluid-proof. These include different types of natural or synthetic rubbers and elastomers. More specific, the material may be for example latex or neoprene.

When used in medical/neuropsychological diagnostics and treatment, "wet" electrodes are preferred since these provide the best signal. With the term "wet" electrodes are meant electrodes which are used in combination with a gel/paste/liquid to provide better contact with<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the scalp. In other applications, where the demands for signal quality are not as high, dry electrodes may also be used, and in many cases be preferred since these are cheaper and more easy to use.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the shown embodiment, the wires 8 from the electrodes are led out through the outer shell. In other embodiments said wires may be bundled and connected to a transmitter/receiver incorporated on or inside the helmet/outer shell, and the signals may thereby be transmitted wireless to an external receiver.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The present invention will contribute to increase the reproducibility of EEG-measurements, make it possible to perform such and other measurements (HEG and MEG) faster due to the simplified adaptation of the electrodes/sensors and avoid the need of having sensor/electrode caps in different sizes. In addition, the invention makes it easier to integrate for instance EEG -measurements for use in activities such as controlling/steering of airplanes, robots, computer programs and games, as well as other uses of BCI (brain computer interface).</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The joining 10 can be achieved by any suitable fluid-proof means such as, for instance gluing, welding, clamps, a zipper or a clamp or clip list.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The helmet may also be equipped with a chin strap to further stabilize the position/placement on the head. Other solutions providing such an effect may be the use of bows, ear muffs or something similar.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56985350" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Vorrichtung zum Positionieren und Befestigen von Sensoren auf der Kopfhaut einer Person, umfassend eine Außenschicht (4), verbunden mit einer Innenschicht (3), und insbesondere getrennt durch eine Mittelschicht (2), wobei die Außenschicht (4) aus einem starren und flüssigkeitsfesten Material besteht, wobei:
