Services are also constantly being developed for terminal users to increase the field of usage and enhance the experience when generally consuming communication services.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">An IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) network can be used for enabling multimedia services and other communication services by initiating and controlling sessions for user terminals connected to various different access networks. The sessions are handled by specific session control nodes in the IMS network, including those referred to as CSCF (Call Session Control Function) nodes.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The signalling protocol called "SIP" (Session Initiation Protocol) is used for multimedia sessions in IMS networks and other communication services networks. IMS is mentioned in this description for illustrative purposes, without limiting the invention to IMS networks exclusively. A user and his/her communication terminal is often generally<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> referred to as a "client", which term will be used in this description.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> illustrates a conventional communication scenario involving an IMS network 100 serving a client A using a mobile terminal connected to a mobile access network 102. The IMS network 100 comprises various session control nodes, including P-CSCF (Proxy CSCF) 104 providing a point of contact for clients in network 102, S-CSCF (Serving CSCF) 106 controlling various sessions for client A, and I-CSCF 108 (Interrogating CSCF) providing an interface towards other IMS networks (not shown) and which also queries a subscriber database node HSS (Home Subscriber Server) 110 for client related information during client registration and termination. The HSS database 110 thus stores subscriber and authentication data which can be retrieved by other nodes for serving and handling different clients.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The IMS network 100 also comprises a plurality of application servers 112 configured to provide different communication services when invoked to meet service requests for clients. Each application server 112 may be configured to provide a specific service or a particular set of services. The application servers 112 are linked to the session control signalling over an interface to the S-CSCF node 106 called the ISC (IMS Service Control) interface.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The application servers 112 are further configured to execute their services according to certain predefined criteria and corresponding instructions referred to as iFC (initial Filter Criteria) which are maintained in the HSS node 110 for clients. Among other things, the iFC contains criteria for when the iFC is to be applied for an incoming service or registration request, and also instructions for how the S-CSCF node 106 should act when those criteria are<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> fulfilled, i.e. when the iFC criteria matches the request and thereby triggers. When applied, the iFC thus identifies or points to a particular application server to be used for executing one or more specific services for the requesting client. The S-CSCF node 106 then sends the request to the identified application server with that server's name added to a route header of the request.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">One or more iFC:s valid for different services can be included in a profile defined for a client. When a client not previously registered either makes a new registration request, or a request bound for the client is received for a particular service, the S-CSCF node 106 downloads the iFC:s associated to the client from HSS 110 and invokes an appropriate application server 112 accordingly to serve the client, e.g. to execute a requested service. Once downloaded from the HSS, the iFC:s are stored or cached in the S-CSCF node 106 for future use whenever other originating or terminating requests are received for the client.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to provide differentiated communication services to clients, it is necessary to store and maintain user specific service data in multiple nodes in the IMS network, such as various application servers and the above-described HSS node, as well as other nodes such as and DNS (Domain Name Server)/ENUM , and so forth. This process is referred to as "provisioning" and typically involves establishment of iFC data, service authorisation data which specifies what service(s) a client is authorised to use, and service configuration data which specifies how the service(s) should be executed for the client. The term "service data" will be used for short in this description to represent the service authorisation and configuration data above.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The service data should thus be provisioned in corresponding application servers to enable delivery of services adapted to individual clients, and the provisioning activities are performed by means of a provisioning system, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>. Furthermore, user specific service data in the HSS and application servers must be coordinated and consistent, for which the provisioning system 200 is responsible. Thus, provisioning system 200 has a so-called "northbound" interface towards an administrator 202 which could be a person and/or a network operator's Customer Administration System or the like, for adding, modifying or deleting user specific service data, e.g. in an IMS network.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The provisioning system 200 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> comprises a schematically shown provisioning logic 200a which basically processes input data from administrator 202 and creates provisioning data that is supplied over dedicated "southbound" interfaces to different nodes in the IMS network, in this case including an application server (AS) 204, an HSS node 206 and an ENUM/DNS node 208. Hence, the provisioning system 200 must handle several different interfaces and is responsible for keeping the user specific service data consistent and up-to-date in all these nodes.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">An application server can maintain such service data for users either in a local storage connected to the server or in a central storage accessible for multiple application servers, e.g. the subscriber data node HSS. The user specific data stored in HSS is sometimes referred to as transparent data or "BLOB" which is maintained and used by the application server, and non-transparent data which more generally relates to non application server specific data such as subscriber identities and other network related user data. Both transparent and non-transparent user data in HSS<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> can be accessed by the application server over the Sh interface.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The provisioning logic 200a with its multiple interfaces towards different nodes, is typically quite complex and costly to develop and maintain. It is possible to reduce the provisioning complexity by using "default" service data and policies preconfigured locally in the application servers, instead of provisioning the user specific service data. However, the service data will then be the same for all users and differentiated services in terms of service authorisation and configuration cannot be accomplished for different clients. It is thus a problem of complexity in the provisioning logic and also capacity in the provisioning system, while differentiated communication services adapted to specific clients are desirable.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2009011763A1"><text>US 2009/011763 A1</text></patcit> describes a mechanism for an application server to obtain "dynamic information" about a wireless device, such as wireless device capabilities, wireless device status, network status, network capabilities and the like, during a registration procedure and the application server uses that information during service execution.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is an object of the invention to address at least some of the issues above. In particular, it is an object to provide a solution that may be used to reduce complexity in the provisioning logic, save capacity in the provisioning system and yet be able to generally provide differentiated communication services adapted to specific clients. These objects and others may be obtained by using methods and arrangements according to the attached independent claims.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to different aspects, methods and arrangements are provided for enabling execution of a communication service adapted to a client where service data is provisioned for the client in an application server.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to one aspect, a method is provided where one or more iFC:s are configured for the client in a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> central subscriber data node by including information related to user specific service data valid for the client in the iFC:s. The user specific service data comprises service authorisation data and/or service configuration data for the client. When the iFC:s of the client are fetched from the central subscriber node to a session control node serving the client, the service data related information is extracted from an iFC of the client that matches a request related to the client that has been received at the session control node.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The received request is then forwarded from the session control node to the application server with the extracted service data related information attached. The user specific service data can then be created for the client in the application server based on the service data related information in the request, in order to apply the user specific service data when serving the client.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to another aspect, an arrangement is provided in a session control node configured to enable execution of a communication service adapted to a client by an application server. According to this arrangement, a receiving unit is adapted to receive a request for the client when non-registered. A fetching unit is adapted to fetch, from a central subscriber data node, one or more iFC:s configured for the client and including information related to user specific service data valid for the client, where the user specific service data comprises service authorisation data and/or service configuration data for the client.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Further, an extracting unit is adapted to extract the service data related information from an iFC of the client that matches the received request. Finally, a<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> forwarding unit is adapted to forward the received request to the application server with the extracted service data related information attached. The application server will then be able to create the user specific service data for the client based on the service data related information in the request, in order to apply the user specific service data when serving the client.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to another aspect, a method is provided in an application server for enabling a communication service adapted to a client. In this method, a request related to the client is received from a session control node with information attached relating to user specific service data valid for the client. The user specific service data comprises service authorisation data and/or service configuration data for the client, and the attached service data related information has been extracted from an iFC of the client that matches the request. Then, user specific service data for the client is created or modified in the application server based on the service data related information in the request, and the created or modified user specific service data is applied when serving the client.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to another aspect, an arrangement is provided in an application server for enabling a communication service adapted to a client. According to this arrangement, a request managing unit is adapted to receive, from a session control node, a request for the client with information attached relating to user specific service data valid for the client. Again, the user specific service data comprises service authorisation data and/or service configuration data for the client, and the attached service data related information has been extracted from an iFC of the client that matches the request. Further, a service data<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> unit is adapted to create or modify user specific service data for the client in the application server based on the service data related information in the request, for serving the client according to the service data.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">By implementing the invention according to any of the above aspects, the application server is able to provide differentiated communication services adapted to specific clients, even when the concerned application server is auto-provisioned without using an interface towards the provisioning system. The invention can thus combine auto-provisioning in the application server and personalised service execution. As a result, complexity in the provisioning logic can be reduced and capacity can be saved in the provisioning system. Another advantage is that the load on the application server will be spread out over time, since the provisioning is performed whenever a request is made related to a non-registered client.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The methods and arrangements above can be implemented according to different embodiments. In one embodiment, the service data related information comprises a pointer or indicator referring to a predefined document template describing the user specific service data, where the template is preconfigured and known in the application server. Alternatively, the service data related information may comprise a list of services the client is authorised to use, or a service document explicitly describing services the client is authorised to use and how these services should be configured in adaptation to the client. The above list of services may be in the form of a binary mask that can be mapped to a predefined set of service parameters to create the user specific service data for the client.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In another embodiment, if the received request is a REGISTER request, the matching iFC may have the service data related information in a Service Information field of the iFC, and in that case the service data related information can be passed to the application server from the session control node in the body of the forwarded REGISTER request.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In another embodiment, the matching iFC may have the service data related information as a parameter in an Application Server Name URL field of the iFC, which is passed to the application server from the session control node as a URI parameter in a route header of the forwarded service request.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In yet another embodiment, the session control node receives from the central subscriber data node an updated iFC configured for the client which contains corresponding new service data related information. The session control node can then forward any subsequently received service request for the client to the application server with the new service data related information attached, and the application server updates the user specific service data based on the new service data related information in the forwarded request.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Further features of the invention and its benefits will become apparent from the detailed description below.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0029" num="0029">The invention will now be described in more detail by means of exemplary embodiments and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

The<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> invention can be used to obtain certain advantages associated with auto-provisioning of application servers including elimination of the need for a provisioning interface between the provisioning system 200 and the application server 204 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>. The invention also enables differentiated communication services adapted to specific clients, even when the concerned application server is auto-provisioned without using an interface towards the provisioning system, which will be described further below.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Auto-provisioning of an application server means generally that service data is created for a not yet registered client in the application server when receiving a request related to this client. If no such service data has been stored previously for the client, the application server can assume that this is a non-registered client and use auto-provisioning procedures to generate service data for the client.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In this invention, the application server is also able to create user specific service data even without being provisioned by the provisioning system, to be further described below, and thereby adapt a requested service to the client in accordance to the user specific service data. Throughout this description, the term "non-registered client" refers to a client that has not already been registered in the network and provisioned in the application server.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">A procedure for enabling delivery of a service adapted to a client in an application server, will now be described with reference to the communication scenario shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>. A provisioning system 300 is utilised for provisioning client data and client profiles in an HSS node 302, or more generally, a central "subscriber data node".<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">A first <b>step 3:1</b> illustrates that one or more modified iFC:s 302a are configured in the HSS node 302 for a client A, the term "modified" indicating that information related to user specific service data valid for client A is now included in each iFC, in contrast to conventional iFC:s. The user specific service data comprises service authorisation data which specifies what service(s) a particular client is authorised or allowed to use, and/or service configuration data which specifies how the service(s) should be executed for that particular client.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Step 3:1 basically represents a configuring operation which can be performed manually or by using automatic mechanisms, while all subsequent steps in the figure basically represent a "run-time" operation performed automatically. One advantage of this solution is that user specific service data can be provisioned for client A in an application server during the run-time phase, i.e. when an originating or terminating request is received for the client when not already registered and provisioned, e.g. a registration request from the client. Thereby, the provisioning load on the application server will be effectively spread out in time.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">According to different possible alternatives, the service data related information may be included in the iFC:s in different ways, e.g. as implied by a brief reference or explicitly described more or less in its entirety. In one example, the service data related information is configured to comprise a reference in the form of a pointer or indicator referring to a predefined document template describing the user specific service data, the template being preconfigured and known in the application server to be invoked according to that iFC. The<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> template reference may be contained in each iFC as a parameter in an Application Server Name URL field, which will be placed in a route header of a request forwarded to the application server.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In another example, the service data related information is configured to indicate a list of services the client is authorised or allowed to use. In that case, the list of allowed services may be indicated by means of a reference to a binary mask that can be mapped to a predefined set of service parameters. The binary mask reference and list of allowed services are preconfigured and known in the application server. The invoked application server can thereby use the binary mask reference to create the user specific service data for the client A. An example of using a binary mask will be described later with reference to Fig's 9a and 9b. The binary mask reference may likewise be contained in the Application Server Name URL field of each iFC, which will be placed in a route header of a request forwarded to the application server.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In yet another example, the service data related information is configured to comprise an explicit service document describing services the client is authorised to use and how these services should be configured in adaptation to the client. The service document may then be contained in an already existing Service Information field of each iFC and attached to the body of the request when forwarded to the application server. Since there is generally more space available in the Service Information field, it can carry an extensive service document, while the Application Server Name URL field may only be able to carry a much shorter implicit reference.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0039" num="0039">At some point later, i.e. during the run-time phase, a request related to the non-registered client A is received in an S-CSCF node 304, or more generally a session control node, as shown by a next <b>step 3:2.</b> The request may be made by client A, or by another party for communication with client A. According to existing mechanisms in the S-CSCF node 304 described above, when a non-registered client makes a registration request or a request for a particular service, relevant iFC:s of that client are fetched from HSS 302. The previously configured iFC:s 302a of client A are thus fetched from HSS 302 in a next <b>step 3:3,</b> e.g. when recognising that no iFC:s are already stored in the S-CSCF node for client A.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The client's iFC:s are then compared with the received request in order to find a matching iFC which then accordingly triggers, or "fires", when criteria in that iFC are fulfilled in the request, in accordance with regular procedures.

A first <b>step 4:1</b> illustrates that the profile for client A is changed in the HSS 302 and that one or more of the previously configured iFC:s are updated by changing the service data related information therein accordingly.

Then in a following <b>step 504,</b> when recognising that no IFC:s are already stored in the session control node for the client, the session control node fetches the previously configured iFC:s of the client from the HSS node, basically corresponding to step 3:3 above.
