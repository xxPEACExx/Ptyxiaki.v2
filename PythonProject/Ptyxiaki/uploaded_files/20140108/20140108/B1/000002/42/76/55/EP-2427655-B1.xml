mxw-id="PDES63960868" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to a membrane pump according to the preamble of claim 1.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Pumps that are used for driving a fluid in a circuit are found in a large variety of forms and sizes and are used in many different applications, from large industry pumps to small pumps for medical purposes. In some application it is desired to keep the circuit strictly clean during pumping, which may imply that parts that are in contact with the fluid to be pumped have to be replaceable and/or cleanable.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In medical applications it is usually very important that all parts of the apparatus that are in contact with the fluid to be pumped are kept in a sterilized condition. Pumps are usually expensive parts and costly to exchange, and nowadays this is solved by providing the apparatus with a peristaltic pump, provided with a gear, which never is in direct contact with the fluid. Instead, the gear of the peristaltic pump engages and compresses a plastic tube which leads the fluid in a driving direction. The gear rotates while the cogs of the gear are sliding along said tube in the driving direction. Portions of the fluid in the tube are thereby transported by the sliding cogs in said direction. When parts of the apparatus that are in contact with the fluid the only thing that needs to be exchanged is the plastic tube. Since the peristaltic pump works by sliding the cogs of its gear along a plastic tube the friction created between the plastic tube and the cogs demands a relatively strong motor of the peristaltic pump, which of course means that the peristaltic pump has relatively high energy consumption. Peristaltic pumps are used for numerous medical applications and the high energy consumption may be acceptable on large apparatuses in for<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> instance hospitals, but for portable systems there is a need to significantly lower the energy consumption.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In some medical applications fluids are driven in circuits by membrane pumps. A membrane pump is relatively expensive so it is desirable to provide an arrangement in which only the parts of the membrane pump that have been in contact with the fluid are exchanged.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP0333305A2"><text>EP 0333305 A2</text></patcit> discloses a membrane pump which is provided with an exchangeable pump chamber in the form of a cassette.

The membrane, the inlet and the outlet are arranged in a first part of the pump housing, the first part being detachably connected to a second part of the pump housing, in which the actuating means is arranged. The membrane is detachably connected to the actuating means by means of a magnetic coupling, which comprises a first magnetic coupling part fixed to the membrane and a corresponding second magnetic coupling part fixed to the actuating means.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">When using the membrane pump of the invention for pumping a medium, all the parts that are in contact with the medium are arranged in the first part of the pump housing. The first part is detachable from the second part which allows the first part to be exchanged if necessary. During pumping, the membrane needs to be actuated by the actuating means in order to oscillate and thereby provide the pumping force. In the inventive membrane pump the membrane is firmly connected to the actuating means by a magnetic coupling, and this allows for the first part of the pump housing to be swiftly exchanged by detaching it from the second part of the pump housing. The membranes of small membrane pumps are usually made of relatively soft materials, such as polymers, and if the membrane of a small membrane pump is connected to the actuating means by a screwed coupling as disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="EP0333305A2"><text>EP 0333305 A2</text></patcit>, the screwing could damage the membrane or twist it into an unwanted shape. The magnetic coupling in the inventive membrane pump provides a firm connection between the membrane and the actuator without the need of screwing any part onto another part, which ensures<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> that the membrane is kept intact after mounting the first part of the pump housing to the second part of the pump housing. During pumping with a membrane pump, for instance for driving a fluid in a circuit, it is important that significant driving forces can be applied by the actuating means to the membrane in both the first and the second direction. When using a membrane pump as disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US5816779A"><text>US 5816779 A</text></patcit> the driving force is only applied in one direction, which significantly impair the pumping ability of the membrane pump.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to one embodiment of the invention one of the first and the second magnetic coupling parts comprises a permanent magnet and the other magnetic coupling part comprises a ferromagnetic material. A permanent magnet attracts a ferromagnetic material which ensures that the magnetic coupling provides a firm connection between the membrane and the actuating means.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to another embodiment of the invention the first magnetic coupling part comprises a ferromagnetic material and the second magnetic coupling part comprises a permanent magnet. A permanent magnet is usually more expensive than a ferromagnetic material and since the first part of the pump housing is the part of the pump housing to be exchanged it is advantageous if the first magnetic coupling part comprises the inexpensive ferromagnetic material and the second magnetic coupling part, which is not to be exchanged, comprises the more expensive permanent magnet.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to another embodiment of the invention one of the first and second magnetic coupling parts comprises a protrusion configured for insertion into a corresponding recess comprised in the other magnetic coupling part. If the magnetic coupling comprises a protrusion and a corresponding recess, movements of the first and second coupling parts in relation to each other<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> are significantly suppressed when they are connected to each other.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to another embodiment of the invention the actuating means comprises a shaft, which at one end is provided with said second magnetic coupling part. The actuating means is driven for instance by a spring and an electromagnet or by two electromagnets and it is advantageous to have a part of the actuating means comprising a shaft affected by said spring and/or electromagnet/electromagnets. The shaft preferably moves back and forth in its longitudinal direction during pumping and is at one end connected to the membrane by said magnetic coupling. When the shaft moves, the membrane moves in the same direction as the shaft.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to another embodiment of the invention the first part of the pump housing comprises guiding means configured for radially guiding the shaft so as to guide said protrusion into said recess. The guiding means can for instance comprise an annular opening configured for receiving the shaft of the actuating means when the first part of the pump housing is connected to the second part of the pump housing. The guiding means facilitates a correct connection of the membrane to the actuating means. This is important since pumping with the inventive pump is dependent upon a firm connection between the membrane and the actuating means. If the membrane is incorrectly connected to the actuating means there is a risk for interruption in the service during pumping.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to another embodiment of the invention the second part of the pump housing comprises guiding means configured for restricting radial movement of the shaft in said second part of the pump housing. Radial movement of the shaft in the second part of the pump housing may damage said shaft.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to another embodiment of the invention the first part of the pump housing is detachably connected to the second part of the pump housing by means of a coupling, which comprises a first coupling part fixed to the first part of the pump housing and a second coupling part fixed to the second part of the pump housing.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to another embodiment of the invention the coupling of the pump housing is a snap coupling. A snap coupling provides a quick and reliable connection between the first part and the second part of the pump housing.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to another embodiment of the invention the coupling of the pump housing is a magnetic coupling.

A permanent magnet attracts a ferromagnetic material which ensures that the magnetic coupling provides a firm connection between the first part and the second part of the pump housing. The magnetic coupling can of course instead comprise two permanent magnets, one permanent magnet comprised in the first part and one in the other part.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to another embodiment of the invention the first coupling part comprises a ferromagnetic material and the second coupling part comprises a permanent magnet.

The invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the concept of the invention to those skilled in the art.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A membrane pump 1 according to the invention is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>. In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig 1</figref> the membrane pump 1 is separated into two parts 2, 3 and in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig 2</figref> the membrane pump is shown in its assembled form in which the two separated parts shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig 1</figref> are assembled. The membrane pump 1 comprises a pump housing which comprises two parts 2,3, a first part 2 in which a membrane 4, an inlet 5 and an outlet 6 are arranged and a second part 3 in which actuating means 7 is arranged. The membrane 4 is mounted to the first part 2 of the pump housing and delimits a pump chamber 8 inside said first part 2. The inlet 5, which has a first non-return valve (not shown) connected thereto, is arranged for feeding medium into the pump chamber 8, and the outlet 6, which has a second non-return valve (not shown) connected thereto, is arranged for discharging medium from the pump chamber 8. The actuating means 7 is configured for moving the membrane 4 back and forth between a first and a second position when the membrane pump 1 is in its assembled form and in use. The membrane 4 is configured to be detachably connected to the actuating means 7 by means of a magnetic coupling, which comprises a first magnetic coupling part 9 fixed to the membrane 4 and a corresponding second magnetic coupling part 10 fixed to the actuating means 7. The magnetic coupling can be achieved by having one of the first 9 and the second 10 magnetic coupling parts comprising a permanent magnet and the other magnetic coupling part comprising a ferromagnetic material. The magnetic coupling can of course instead comprise two permanent magnets, one permanent magnet comprised in the first magnetic coupling part 9 and one in the second magnetic coupling part 10. An electromagnetic coupling is of course also possible.

The second magnetic coupling part 10 also comprises a protrusion 11 configured for insertion into a corresponding recess 12 comprised in the first magnetic coupling part 9. Of course a protrusion instead can be<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> comprised in the first magnetic coupling part 9 for insertion into a corresponding recess comprised in the second magnetic coupling part 10. The actuating means 7 comprises a shaft 13, which at one end is provided with said second magnetic coupling part 10. To move the membrane 4 back and forth the shaft 13 of the actuating means 7 is driven by a spring, preferably a flat spring 14, longitudinally in one direction and an electromagnet 15 longitudinally in the opposite direction. The spring 13 can of course be replaced by a second electromagnet.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The first part 2 of the pump housing is detachably connected to the second part 3 of the pump housing by means of a coupling, which coupling comprises a first coupling part 16 fixed to the first part 2 of the pump housing and a second coupling part 17 fixed to the second part 3 of the pump housing.

The magnetic coupling can of course instead comprise two permanent magnets, one permanent magnet comprised in the first coupling part 16 and one in the second coupling part 17. Preferably the first coupling part 16 comprises a ferromagnetic material and the second coupling part 17 comprises a permanent magnet. The coupling of the pump housing can also be a snap coupling or any other coupling suitable for the purpose of connecting the first 2 and the second 3 parts of the pump housing to each other.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The first part 2 of the pump housing is exchangeable and in order to detach it from the second part 3 of the pump housing said first part 2 is moved in the longitudinal direction of said shaft 13 away from the second part 3 of the pump housing, whereby the first magnetic coupling part 9 is detached from the second magnetic coupling part 10 and the first coupling part 16 of the pump housing is detached from the second coupling part 17 of the pump housing. If the coupling of the pump housing is a<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> snap coupling or any other coupling, other operations may be needed for detaching the first part 2 of the pump housing from the second part 3 of the pump housing. To attach the first part 2 of the pump housing to the second part 3 of the pump housing the two parts 2, 3 of the pump housing are moved towards each other so as to allow the corresponding coupling parts to come into engagement with each other.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig 3</figref> it is shown a membrane pump 1 according to another embodiment of the invention.

The guiding means 18 of the first part 2 of the pump housing has a central opening configured for receiving said shaft 13 and/or the second magnetic coupling part 10. The second part 3 of the pump housing comprises guiding means 19 configured for restricting radial movement of the shaft 13 in said second part 3 of the pump housing. The guiding means 19 of the second part 3 of the pump housing is especially important when the first part 2 of the pump housing is detached, due to the risk for damaging the shaft 13 by having it hit the electromagnet 15 if said guiding means 19 is absent. The guiding means 19 of the second part 3 of the pump housing has a central opening configured for receiving said shaft 13.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">During pumping using the membrane pumps 1 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs 1-3,</figref> in a first phase the flat spring 14 affects the shaft 13, and thereby the membrane 4, with a force pulling the membrane 4 in a direction away from the pump chamber 8, whereby the volume of the pump chamber 8 expands and the first non-return valve is opened so as to allow medium to flow into the pump chamber 8<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> through the inlet 5. During this first phase, the membrane 4 is moved under the action of the spring 14 from a first end position to a second end position. In a second phase the electromagnet 15 is activated, whereby the electromagnet 15 attracts a protruding magnetic part 20 of the shaft 13 and the shaft 13 is pulled in a direction towards the pump chamber 8, and the membrane 4 consequently also moves towards the pump chamber 8. The pump chamber 8 is thereby contracted and the medium flows out from the pump chamber 8 through the second non-return valve and the outlet 6. During this second phase, the membrane 4 is moved under the action of the electromagnet 15 and against the action of the spring 14 from the second end position to the first end position. Of course another electromagnet can replace the spring 14 and provide the force for pulling the membrane 4 away from the pump chamber 8. If the spring 14 is replaced by an electromagnet, the other electromagnet 15 can be replaced by another spring, which provides the force for pushing the membrane 4 towards the pump chamber 8.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The invention is of course not in any way limited to the embodiments described above. On the contrary, several possibilities to modifications thereof should be apparent to a person skilled in the art without departing from the basic idea of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56985344" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Membranpumpe (1) umfassend:
