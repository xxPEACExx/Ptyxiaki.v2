The secondary batteries 110 are stacked in a manner such that main surfaces of the secondary batteries 110 face each other. The charge/discharge capacity of the battery pack 100 increases in proportion to the number of the secondary batteries 110. The battery pack 100 may be used for a large apparatus such as a hybrid vehicle requiring a high battery capacity rather than a small apparatus such as a cellular phone to which power can be sufficiently supplied by using only one secondary battery 110.

Then, electrolyte is injected into the accommodation space (S) to impregnate the electrode assembly 130 with the electrolyte.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">A conductive positive terminal 135 extends form the positive electrode plate 131 of the electrode assembly 130. The positive terminal 135 is formed of a material having a resistance of about 10 mΩ or lower so that a current level required by a middle-capacity or large-capacity battery can flow through the positive terminal 135. The positive terminal 135 is connected to the conductive first lead tab 141. The positive terminal 135 and the first lead tab 141 are electrically connected through a conductive connection part 145.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As two parts of the pouch case 120 forming the sealing part 122, that is, a case lower part 123 and a case upper part 124, are sealed, the first lead tab 141 is covered by the parts 123 and 124. By sealing the two parts 123 and 124, the inner space (S) can be sealed in a state where the electrode assembly 130 and electrolyte are accommodated in the inner space (S).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The first lead tab 141 is located higher than the positive terminal 135 such that the case lower part 123 of the sealing part 122 can be elevated in a stepped shape to a level higher than the lowermost outer surface of the pouch case 120.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">A supporting member 161 is disposed between the positive terminal 135 and the pouch case 120 to support and fix the positive terminal 135 with respect to the pouch case 120. For example, the supporting member 161 may be formed of an insulating tape.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">A coupling member 162 is disposed between the first lead tab 141 and the pouch case 120 so as to couple the first lead tab 141 to the inner surface of the pouch case<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> 120. The coupling member 162 may be formed of a material having a high coupling strength such as polypropylene film or polyethylene film.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Although both the supporting member 161 and the coupling member 162 are described, only the coupling member 162 can be used if the positive terminal 135 is firmly coupled to the electrode assembly 130. If the positive terminal 135 is firmly coupled to the electrode assembly 130, when the secondary battery 110 swells, although the coupling member 162 causes the first lead tab 141 to be deformed together with the pouch case 120 in a manner such that the first lead tab 141 is spaced apart from the positive terminal 135, the supporting member 161 functions relatively less so that the supporting member 161 can be omitted.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">An adhesive member 150 such as an insulating tape may be additionally disposed between the positive terminal 135 and the first lead tab 141. Both sides of the adhesive member 150 are respectively bonded to the surfaces of the positive terminal 135 and the lead tab 140 that face each other. The surfaces (main surfaces) of the positive terminal 135 and the first lead tab 141 that face each other may be spaced a predetermined distance from each other by the adhesive member 150. Owing to the adhesive member 150, structurally firm coupling (bonding) can be made between the positive terminal 135 and the first lead tab 141. Therefore, although the secondary battery 110 receives impacts or external forces during a normal operation, the possibility of disconnection of the connection part 145 can be reduced owing to the adhesive member 150. Therefore, during a normal operation of the electrode assembly 130, stable electric connection can be ensured between the electrode assembly 130 and an external circuit.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Insulating tapes 171 and 172 may be disposed between the opposite sides of the first lead tab 141 and the sealing part 122 of the pouch case 120.

In detail, the first electrode W1 of which an end makes contact with the region 135' is aligned in a row with the second electrode W2 of which an end makes contact with the region 141', and the first and second electrodes W1 and W2 are pushed against the regions 135' and 141'. For a short time, a current is allowed to flow through the first and second electrodes W1 and W2 across the positive terminal 135 and the first lead tab 141, which generates Joule heat. Owing to this Joule heat, the mutually facing surfaces of the regions 135' and 141' of the positive terminal 135 and the first lead tab 141 are caused to fuse and adhere to each other. Then, as the adhered portions cool and harden to form the connection part 145.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">A plurality of connection parts 145 can be formed (at different positions) by repeating spot welding.

Both ends of the pouch case 120 in the length direction are mainly inflated, and particularly, the sloped surface 121 may expand most.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">If the sloped surface 121 expands outward, an end part of the first lead tab 141, which is connected to the sloped surface 121 by the coupling member 162 and is located in the inner space (S), is also bent outward. Due to this deformation, the end of the first lead tab 141 is pulled away from the positive terminal 135. Thus, if the gas pressure exceeds a certain level, the first lead tab 141 may be separated from the positive terminal 135. Due to this separation, mainly, the connection part 145 may be split into two parts 145a and 146b.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">As the two parts 145a and 145b are separated, the electric connection between the positive terminal 135 and the first lead tab 141 is structurally destroyed.

For this, the welding strength between the positive terminal 135 and the first lead tab 141 (the strength of the connection part 145) is lower than the bonding strength of the coupling member 162 to the pouch case 120 and the first lead tab 141. For example, if the former strength is 2.5 kgf or lower, the latter strength may be 3.0 kgf or higher. If the latter strength has the above-mentioned value, the coupling member 162 is not stripped although the coupling member 162 is pulled away from the pouch case 120 or the first lead tab 141 at a speed of 50 mm/min.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">If any one of the plurality of secondary batteries 110 is disconnected from an external circuit, this will be detected through the detecting device 400 (refer to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>).

If heat is transferred to the adhesive member 150 from a part such as the positive terminal 135, the temperature of the adhesive member 150 increases and the bonding ability of the adhesive member 150 decreases. Thus, after a predetermined time from the start of malfunction of the secondary battery 110, the positive terminal 135 and the first lead tab 141 are not firmly coupled by the adhesive member 150.
