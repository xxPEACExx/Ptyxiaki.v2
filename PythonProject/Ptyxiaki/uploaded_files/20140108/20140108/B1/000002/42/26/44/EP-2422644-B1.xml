The product dispenser 10 comprises a product container 14 for storing the product to be dispensed, with the container 14 defining an opening 16 through which the product 12 can exit the container 14.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In a configuration, the product container 14 terminates in a spout 18 that projects from a shoulder portion 20 of the product container 14, the spout defining the container opening 16.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the illustrated configuration, the product container 14 comprises a flexible wall container such as a tube. Alternatively, however, the product container 14 may comprise a rigid wall container fitted with a dispensing mechanism to dispense the product within the container 14.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As best shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005 f0006">4 to 9</figref>, the product dispenser 10 further comprises a product flow regulator 22 that can be secured to the product container 14, and in particular to the spout 18 of the container 14, so as to be<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> located proximate the container opening 16. With particular reference to <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005">Figures 4 to 7</figref>, the product flow regulator 22 comprises a flow passage 24 that is in communication with the product container 14. The flow passage 24 accommodates the product 12 exiting the container 14, with the product flow regulator 22 terminating in a plurality of central distribution apertures 26 for allowing the product 12 within the flow passage 24 to exit the product flow regulator 22.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In particular, the product flow regulator 22 comprises a conduit 28 that defines the flow passage 24. The conduit 28, in turn, comprises a first, open end 30 snugly fitted within the spout 18 of the product container 14 to receive product exiting the container 14, and a second end 32 in which the distribution apertures 26 are defined.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A skirt 34 extends from the conduit 28, proximate the first end 30 of the conduit 28. The skirt 34 and spout 18 comprise complementary securing snap fit formations 36 to enable the skirt 34, and thus the product flow regulator 22, to be secured to the spout 18 of the product container 14.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A rectangular bowl portion 38 extends from the conduit 28, proximate the second end 32 of the conduit 28. The bowl portion 38 defines a reservoir 40 for accommodating the product 12 exiting the product flow regulator 22 through the distribution apertures 26.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The product dispenser 10 further comprises a dispensing cover 42 that overlies the product flow regulator 22. The dispensing cover 42 defines a central elongate distribution slit 44 proximate the reservoir 40 of the product flow regulator 22. This arrangement allows an elongate product strip 12 to be dispensed, as best shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In an embodiment, the elongate distribution slit 44 is defined within an elongate recess 46 defined in the dispensing cover 42. Conveniently, the reservoir 40 is substantially elongate, and is positioned substantially parallel to the elongate distribution slit 44 of the dispensing cover 42. This arrangement allows product to flow and accumulate into the reservoir 40 in a controlled manner. In particular, the product flow regulator 22 controls the flow of product towards the slit 44, and the shape and positioning of the distribution slit 44 relative to the reservoir 40 (i.e. that they are essentially parallel to each other) further controls and regulates the dispensing of the product 12.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In particular, the pattern of product flow creates a pressure gradient in the reservoir 40, which allows the reservoir 40 to fill completely before the product is dispensed through the slit 44. As the product enters the reservoir 40, it will accumulate around the distribution apertures 26 in regions of relatively high product pressure, but eventually, as the product 12 moves to regions within the reservoir 40 of relatively lower pressure, it will distribute evenly in the reservoir 40 before exiting through the slit 44. Advantageously, in this regard, the apertures 26 face sideways or downwards towards the base of the bowl portion 38, and not upwards towards the slit 44. This arrangement ensures that the reservoir 40 is filled completely before the product is dispensed through the slit 44. The result is that the pressure becomes essentially even across the entire length of the slit 44, thereby ensuring an even flow of an essentially constant rate of product. As a user of the product dispenser 10 draws the device across the portion of the body to be treated, an elongate strip of product is hence formed. An essentially constant pressure, and hence constant flow rate along the length of the slit 44, leads to the formation of a strip 12 of essentially uniform thickness.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The thickness of the dispensed product strip 12 also depends upon the pressure applied by the user to the product container 14 (either directly in the case of the container 14 taking the form of a flexible tube or via the dispensing<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> mechanism in the case of the container 24 taking the form of a rigid wall container). A further factor affecting the thickness of the dispensed product strip 12 is the viscosity of the product 12. Thus, to summarise, the thickness of the strip 12 is defined by the speed at which the user draws the product dispenser 10 over the zone to be treated, the pressure applied by the user to the product container 14, and the viscosity of the product 12. Thus, for example, for a given applied pressure and viscosity, the slower the movement of the product dispenser 10 the thicker the strip, and <i>vice versa.</i> Similarly, for a given speed of movement and viscosity, the greater the applied pressure to the container 14, the thicker the strip, and <i>vice versa.</i> However, the strip width is defined by the geometry of the slit 44, which remains constant irrespective of the pressure applied or the speed of movement defined by the user.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In a configuration, the dispensing cover 42 and the skirt 34 comprise complementary securing snap fit formations 48 to enable the dispensing cover 42 to be secured to the product flow regulator 22.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Proximate the elongate distribution slit 44, the dispensing cover 42 comprises a rectangular guide wall 50 that can be snugly accommodated within the rectangular bowl portion 38 of the product flow regulator 22, as best shown in <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Figures 6 to 9</figref>, thereby guiding the flow of product 12 from the reservoir 40 through the elongate distribution slit 44.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">A cap 52 may be provided that is releasably fittable to the dispensing cover 42, again typically using snap fit formations 54.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In a configuration, the product dispenser 10 is arranged to dispense an elongate product strip 12 having a length of approximately between 2.5 and 3 cm, with the product typically having a viscosity of between 83 100 to 155 700 mPA.s and a restitution rate of between 90%-96% (but this does depend on the product's viscosity).<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Turning now to <figref idrefs="f0007 f0008 f0009">Figures 10 to 16</figref>, with alternative configurations of the product dispenser of the invention. For example, the elongate distribution slit 44 may be relatively wide (as indicated by numeral 44.1 in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 10</figref>) or relatively narrow (as indicated by numeral 44.2 in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 11</figref>). In one version, the distribution slit 44, although elongate, may be wavy, as indicated by numeral 44.3 in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 12</figref>.
