This patent document describes load-handling arms that can be operated by two oppositely directed and hydraulic actuated piston cylinders. Said arms can be moved to and from each other for engaging a load to be transported. It is important to have each load-handling arm moveably supported by one guide of each pair for providing maximum strength to load-handling arms of the load-handling apparatus.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The load-handling apparatus known from <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP0628511A"><text>EP-0.628.511</text></patcit> further comprises a frame (<figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, reference sign 14) to be connected to an elevatable lift carriage of a lift truck by means of hooks (16) attached to the back side of said frame. The frame connects the back sides of the first upper and second lower pair of guides in such way that the depth dimension of said load-handling apparatus increases.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Therefore, a drawback of such load-handling apparatus known is that it is not compact. In addition said load-handling apparatus has a relatively high weight.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a compact dimensioned load-handling apparatus in a manner compatible with maximum strength.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">This object is accomplished with the load-handling apparatus<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">By means of these connection elements only the vertical height of the load-handling apparatus is being influenced, whereas the depth and width of the load-handling apparatus are not changed by said connection. The maximum depth of these connection elements being determined by the depth of the guides, wherein said depth dimension of the connection elements may maximally be dimensioned identical to the depth of the guides, as the connection elements are not allowed to protrude with respect to said guides. The depth dimension of the load-handling apparatus Without the load-handling arms is mainly defined by the depth of the guides, whereas the width dimension of the load-handling apparatus is determined by the longitudinally extending guides with the piston cylinders connected to load handling arms. In this way a maximally compact dimensioned load handling apparatus is provided.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The width of said connection elements does preferably not exceed the depth dimension of the guides such that an optimal viewing window and also viewing spaces are provided on a side of the connection elements opposite of the viewing window. Preferably, the width of the connection elements substantially corresponds to the depth of the connection elements such that pillar or bar shaped connection elements are provided. These pillar or bar shaped connections elements provide maximum strength and occupy minimally space to provide maximum viewability for an operator of the lift truck to view load engaging ends of the load-handling arms in any position.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Further, the weight of the load handling apparatus is drastically reduced by means of the connection elements compared to a frame known from the prior art as these connection elements only need to extend between the first upper and second lower pair of guides. Such weight savings have a positive influence on the load carrying capacity of the lift truck and save energy as the weight of the load-handling<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> apparatus needs always to be carried and moved by the lift truck. The reduced depth of the load handling apparatus also improves the residual capacity of the lift-truck and reduces the turning radius of the lift-truck.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">One embodiment of the load handling apparatus according to the present invention is characterised in that each pair comprises at least one hydraulic actuated piston cylinder for actively moving at least one load-handling arm.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In this way in the simplest construction each arm is at least supported and moveable by one hydraulic actuated piston cylinder disposed in one of the guides of the first pair, whereas the same arm is only supported by a guide of the second pair. In a more advanced construction each arm is being movably supported by a first piston cylinder in one of the guides of the first pair and by a second piston cylinder in one of the guides of the second pair. In particular for clamping loads two piston cylinders for each arm may be needed.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Further, it is possible that at least one pair of parallel guides comprises two oppositely directed and hydraulic actuated piston cylinders for actively moving at least two load-handling arms.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In this way each pair can be provided with hydraulic actuated piston cylinders. Further, only one pair can be provided with hydraulic actuated piston cylinders, whereas the other pair only moveably supports these load-handling arms e.g. by means of cylindrical supports.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A preferred embodiment of the load handling apparatus according to the present invention is characterised in that an outer shape of the hydraulic actuated piston cylinder is cylindrical such that an inner sliding surface of the guide is shaped cylindrical, whereas the other sides of at least one guide in at least one pair comprises at least one a flat contact surface to be connected with the elevatable lift carriage of a lift truck.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As no frame is available for mounting said load-handling apparatus to be connected to the elevatable lift carriage of a lift truck, at least one flat contact surface needs to be provided such that the load handling apparatus can be connected to the elevatable lift carriage of a lift truck with maximum strength.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Preferably, all guides are dimensioned substantially identical, wherein in a preferred embodiment each guide comprises at least two flat contact surfaces, i.e. one contact surface of each guide to connect two guides to each other<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> e.g. by welding to provide a pair, whereas the outer back contact surface is used to connect said guide to the elevatable lift carriage of a lift truck. However, it is also possible that two guides of one pair are molded from one piece.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The first and/or the second pair comprise couplings for mounting said load-handling apparatus to the elevatable lift carriage of a lift truck, or, if a lift truck is only used for one purpose and no easy interchangeable load-handling apparatus is needed, the first and the second pair are directly secured to the elevatable lift carriage of a lift truck, e.g. by welding or bolting at least one guide of at least one pair to said lift carriage, more preferably welding each guide to said lift carriage.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">By means of couplings, e.g. hooks directly secured to the first and/or the second pair an interchangeable load-handling apparatus is provided. If there are different kind of applications to be performed with one lift truck interchangeable load-handling apparatus can be desired. Further, during maintenance of the lift truck, the load-handling apparatus can still be used by another lift truck or vice versa during maintenance of the load-handling apparatus, the lift truck is available to be used for other purposes.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Another preferred embodiment of the load handling apparatus according to the present invention is characterised in that the connection elements between the first and the second pair are spaced relatively to each other with a distance corresponding to a horizontal distance between vertically extending lift masts of the lift truck for optimizing visibility through said viewing window.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The distance between lift masts of a lift truck is in general standard, so by adapting the distance between two connection elements to said standard distance between lift masts an optimal viewing window is being provided.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A preferred embodiment of the load handling apparatus according to the present invention is characterised in that the first and/or the second pair comprise a hydraulic fluid discharge and supply unit for the hydraulic actuated piston cylinders which is positioned on a side facing the load-handling arms, preferably said discharge and supply unit is centrally arranged with regard to the longitudinally extending guides.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Such a hydraulic fluid discharge and supply unit influences the viewability through the viewing window minimally.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Another embodiment of the load handling apparatus according to the present invention is characterised in that each piston cylinder being slidably and non-rotatably disposed in one of the guides, wherein each piston cylinder comprises a stationary piston element and a stationary piston rod secured with one end to said piston element, and pivotally secured at its opposite end to said guide.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">By pivotally securing the stationary rod to said guide a flexible connection is provided for absorbing forces in use of the load handling apparatus such that maintenance for this connection is reduced drastically compared to a load-handling apparatus having a rigid connection.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A further embodiment of the load handling apparatus according to the present invention is characterised in that each load handling arm comprises at least one recess suited for at least partly receiving a connection plate to be connected to one of the piston cylinders.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">By means of this connection plate again the depth dimension of the load handling apparatus is kept minimal. Preferably, these plates are being used for securing the arms to the cylinders by means of fastening means providing a detachable connection if a cylinder needs to be replaced.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Another embodiment of the load handling apparatus according to the present invention is characterised in that each guide comprises a slot on side facing the load-handling arms, which slot extends from one end of the guide to another longitudinally opposing end of the guide.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">By means of such a slot the movability of the load-handling arms is maximal</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A further embodiment of the load handling apparatus according to the present invention is characterised the maximum and minimum distance between load-handling arms is determined by the length of a cylinder of the piston cylinder which cylinder length is at least 50 % of the length of the guide.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The load handling arms can be moved from a substantially abutting relation to each other in a first position to a second position in which the distance between the load handling arms corresponds maximally with at least two times the length of the guides.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The invention will now be explained in more detail with reference to an exemplary embodiment shown in the appended figures, in which:
