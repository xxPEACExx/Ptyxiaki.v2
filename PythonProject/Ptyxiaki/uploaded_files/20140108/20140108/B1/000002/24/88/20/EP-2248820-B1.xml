load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to supports used in DNA and RNA synthesis. The supports according to the invention do not include a pre-attached nucleoside, and therefore can be used universally for any DNA or RNA synthesis, irrespective of the desired terminal nucleoside. Moreover, the supports according to the invention allow fast cleavage and dephosphorylation at relatively low temperatures and under relatively mild reaction conditions.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A vast majority of oligonucleotide syntheses are carried out on supports to which a first nucleoside has been pre-attached (e.g., by a succinate or hydroquinone-O,O'-diacetate linker). After routine cleavage and deprotection steps, this nucleoside becomes the 3' terminal nucleoside of the target oligonucleotide. For standard DNA and RNA synthesis, this requires an inventory of four deoxynucleoside and four ribonucleoside supports, <i>i.e.,</i> a different support depending on the desired terminal nucleoside.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A "universal" solid support (<i>i.e</i>., a support without the first nucleoside attached) for DNA and RNA synthesis that permitted direct coupling of any residue and elimination of the terminal phosphodiester linkage at the same time as the deprotection step would offer several advantages. For example, such a universal support would: (a) eliminate the need for an inventory of several different nucleoside supports; (b) minimize the possibility of error in the selection of the correct support<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> type; (c) reduce the time and eliminate errors in the generation of an array of nucleoside supports in 96 well synthesizers; and (d) allow the preparation of oligonucleotides containing a 3'-terminal nucleoside which is not available as a support.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In spite of these major potential benefits of universal supports, at the present time, the use of universal supports for DNA and RNA synthesis has not been favored. One major hurdle to overcome relates to finding conditions to eliminate the terminal phosphate, produced from the first nucleoside phosphoramidite addition cycle to the required terminal hydroxyl group. This problem is considered in more detail below.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Certain known universal supports based on the ribonucleoside elimination model are known as "McLean supports." See <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>S. Scott, P. Hardy, R.C. Sheppard, and M.J. McLean, "A Universal Support for Oligonucleotide Synthesis," Innovation and Perspectives in Solid Phase Synthesis, 3rd International Symposium, 1994, pp. 115-124</text></nplcit>, which document is entirely incorporated herein by reference. McLean supports also are described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5681945A"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 5,681,945</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5886193A"><text>5,886,193</text></patcit>, which patents are entirely incorporated herein by reference. A McLean support also is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1a</figref>. This solid support allows the detritylation, the addition of the first nucleoside monomer, and the remainder of the oligomer preparation to proceed without any changes from standard protocols. Elimination of the terminal phosphodiester group utilizes the same reagents needed for routine deprotection of oligonucleotides, but requires more aggressive and lengthy treatment conditions (e.g., concentrated ammonium hydroxide/80°C/17 hours as compared to the standard oligomer deprotection conditions of ammonium hydroxide/55°C/5-6 hours). While these more aggressive conditions are suitable for the preparation of unmodified oligonucleotides, they are not compatible with base-labile nucleoside analogues. Furthermore, prolonged treatment with basic volatile reagents or the need to employ a desalting step in the case of sodium hydroxide make this solid support unattractive for use in industrial multi-well synthesizers.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The instability of RNA to strongly basic conditions is caused by the proximity of the 2'-OH group to the phosphodiester group. Attack of the 2'-OH on the adjacent phosphorus gives rise to an energetically favorable 5-membered transition state, which can open up again to form a mixture of 2'- and 3'-phosphodiester internucleotide linkages, or can lead to chain scission by elimination of the 3'- or 5'-hydroxyl group. In the case of a McLean universal support of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1a</figref>, cleavage from the support by hydrolysis of a succinate or, better, a hydroquinone-O,O'-diacetate (Q) linkage, generates a hydroxyl group adjacent to the terminal phosphodiester linkage. Additional base treatment leads to the elimination of the terminal phosphate group and formation of the desired 3'-OH. Wengel and coworkers described a similar strategy using a neighboring hydroxyl group to facilitate elimination. See <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>C. Scheuer-Larsen, C. Rosenbohm, T.J.D. Jorgensen, and J. Wengel, "Introduction of a Universal Solid Support for Oligonucleotide Synthesis," Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides, 1997, Vol. 16, pp. 67-80</text></nplcit>, which article is entirely incorporated herein by reference. Lyttle and a group at Biosearch Technologies described a variation of the Wengel procedure. The Lyttle procedure used a linkage to a polymeric support that is not hydrolyzed by base, so that extended base treatment releases the dephosphorylated oligo, while leaving any undesired by-product still attached to the support. See<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text> M.H. Lyttle, D.J. Dick, D. Hudson, and R.M. Cook, "A Phosphate Bound Universal Linker for DNA Synthesis," Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides, 1999, Vol. 18, pp. 1809-1824</text></nplcit>, which article is entirely incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The main impediment to adoption of a universal support has been the aggressively basic conditions required to complete the elimination reaction to release the terminal hydroxyl group. The standard reagents used in oligonucleotide deprotection are ammonium hydroxide and aqueous methylamine, which are popular because they are readily available and completely volatile. Using these reagents to carry out the elimination reaction, however, requires either high temperature, with attendant high pressure, or extended reaction times. The situation can be improved by adding metal ions to the mix (such as Li+, Na+, and Zn2+), to speed up the elimination reaction, presumably by stabilizing the 5-membered transition state.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> However, the speed and simplicity of evaporation of the deprotection solution to give the crude oligonucleotide without desalting is not possible when these ionic additives are used.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Other known universal supports that use neighboring aminomethyl or diamino-ethyl groups to assist the elimination reaction have been described by Azhayev. See <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>A.V. Azhayev, "A New Universal Solid Support for Oligonucleotide Synthesis," Tetrahedron, 1999, Vol. 55, pp. 787-800</text></nplcit>, which article is entirely incorporated herein by reference. These supports, which are illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1b, 1c, and 1d</figref>, are not only compatible with the preparation of all common types of oligonucleotides, but they also function well for oligomers with unusual base labile nucleoside units. Using volatile ammonium hydroxide or aqueous methylamine with these supports (<i>e.g</i>., concentrated ammonium hydroxide/80°C/2-8 hours), 3'-terminal dephosphorylation was significantly speeded up, and dephosphorylation could be achieved under neutral conditions using aqueous zinc chloride or water. In these supports, the neighboring aminomethyl- or diaminoethyl-groups assist for the elimination of the terminal phosphodiester to generate termini with 3'-hydroxyl.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">While the universal supports of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1b-1d</figref> offer genuine advantages, especially if the oligonucleotides contain base-labile components, they still are not ideal for mainstream applications. These supports still require relatively long treatment times with basic volatile reagents at elevated temperatures. These features make these supports somewhat unattractive for industrial applications.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Urata and Akagi (See <nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>H. Urata and M.

However, this does not allow the generation of oligonucleotides which on cleavage from the support have a biologically active 3'OH.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a universal support suitable for DNA and RNA synthesis that eliminates the drawbacks mentioned above. A desirable universal support would allow fast cleavage and dephosphorylation at relatively low temperatures (e.g., in 20 minutes at room temperature), and under relatively mild reaction conditions (e.g., using a 2M ammonia in methanol cleavage reagent). Moreover, the desired universal support would be compatible for use under ultra-mild, normal, and ultra-fast deprotection conditions. Finally, the desired universal<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> support product will be cost-effective (<i>e.g</i>., comparable in price to regular 2'-deoxynucleoside supports).</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention relates to universal supports for oligonucleotide, DNA, and RNA synthesis, as well as to methods of making and using the supports.

For example, the solid supports described in the patent and literature identified in the "Background" section of this document can be used in conjunction with the invention. The solid supports can be beads, particles, sheets, dipsticks, rods, membranes, filters, fibers (<i>e.g</i>., optical or glass), or in any other suitable form. The material composition of the solid support materials may be any suitable materials, such as polymeric or silica based support materials. Specific examples, include plastic, nylon, glass, silica, metal, metal alloy, polyacrylamide, polyacrylate, polystyrene, cross-linked dextran, and combinations thereof. The term "silica base material" or "silica support material," as used in the present specification and claims, includes glass materials, unless it is specifically indicated that glass materials are not included.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The following definitions apply to the specification and claims, unless another definition is clearly provided.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The term "alkyl," as used herein, refers to substituted or unsubstituted, straight or branched chain groups, preferably, having one to twelve, more preferably having one to six, and most preferably having from one to four carbon atoms. Illustrative examples of alkyl groups include, but are not limited to: methyl, trifluoromethyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, and the like.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The term "aryl," as used herein, refers to an aromatic, monovalent monocyclic, bicyclic, or tricyclic radical containing 6, 10, 14, or 18 carbon ring atoms, which may be unsubstituted or substituted, and to which may be fused one or more cycloalkyl<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> groups, heterocycloalkyl groups, or heteroaryl groups, which themselves may be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more suitable substituents.

The patent and other literature identified in the "Background" section of this document illustrate the meaning of this term. One suitable definition, although not necessarily exclusive or exhaustive, is as follows: the term "oligonucleotide" is generic to polydeoxynucleotides (containing 2-deoxy-D-ribose), to polyribonucleotides (containing D-ribose), to any other type of polynucleotide which is an N-glycoside of a purine or pyrimidine base, and to other polymers containing nonnucleotidic backbones, providing that the polymers contain nucleobases in a configuration which allows for base pairing and base stacking, such as is found in DNA and RNA.

DISCUSSION OF OLIGOMER SYNTHESIS AND DEPHOSPHORYLATION</b></heading><p id="p0071" num="0071">Without limiting this specification or limiting the invention to any particular theory or mechanism of operation, it is believed that the universal supports according to the invention use a mechanism wherein neighboring groups assist in the elimination of the terminal phosphodiester, to thereby generate termini with 3'-hydroxyls. Amides of carboxylic acids may be regarded as weak N-H acids. The amide<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> functional groups will give rise to amide anions in, for example, methanolic ammonia (aqueous methylamine) or ammonium hydroxide. These amide anions, in turn, display basic properties. Therefore, it was believed that, in a basic solution, a vicinal amide group of a 3-acylamido-1,2-propanediol tether could enhance the elimination of terminal phosphodiester along with the linker, which was originally linked to a solid support.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">In order to investigate the usefulness of the <i>A<sub>Q</sub></i> solid supports in the preparation of oligodeoxynucleotides, the short sequence <b>oligo-T<sub>6</sub></b> was assembled on a synthesizer in a conventional manner, using standard phosphoramidite chemistry and recommended protocols. No differences in coupling efficiency (&gt;98% as determined from trityl assay) were detected between the <b><i>A<sub>Q</sub></i></b>-supports and a commercial T-derivatized support. Thus, the <b><i>A<sub>Q</sub></i></b>-supports were found to be compatible with standard oligomer assembly steps. <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> illustrates the nucleotide addition to the <b><i>A<sub>Q</sub></i></b>-support material.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">After completion of the oligonucleotide synthesis, addition of ammonia in methanol and toluene rapidly cleaves the hydroquinone-<i>O,O'</i>-diacetate linker and releases the oligomer with a cyanoethyl protected phosphotriester function linked to the 1-hydroxyl of (±)-3-acylamido-1,2-propanediol (<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>).

achieved using the <b>A<sub>Q</sub>-I</b> solid support, incorporating trifluoroacetamido function, and using 2-9 M ammonia in methanol-toluene or methanol-dioxane for cleavage/dephosphorylation. Also, it is noteworthy that under the conditions of ammonium hydroxide cleavage/dephosphorylation, 43% of <b>oligo-T<sub>6</sub></b> was obtained using support <b>A<sub>Q</sub>-I.</b> While the inventors do not wish to be bound by any particular theory or mechanism, it appears that the presence of water facilitates the competing reaction of β-cyanoethanol elimination (or β-elimination of 2-cyanoethylene), making the use of aqueous ammonia for oligonucleotide cleavage/deprotection less efficient. See <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, the labeled "minor" product.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">From experiments described above, it was concluded that the structure of acylamido function incorporated in the <b>A<sub>Q</sub></b> support does not significantly influence the yield of desired <b>oligo-T<sub>6</sub>.</b> It was believed that any acylamide anion would assist the vicinal 2-hydroxyl group in attacking the phosphorus. On the other hand, it was concluded that the structure of the linker at the 2-hydroxy group appeared to be important. The cleavage of hydroquinone-<i>O,O'</i>-diacetate group proceeds much faster than the β-elimination of cyanoethyl protecting group. Therefore, the attack of phosphotriester function by the 2-hydroxyl group of 3-acylamido-1,2-propanediol tether takes place, and the desired oligonucleotide was 3'-dephosphorylated.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">It was concluded that in a basic solution, the diamide of any dicarboxylic acid (<i>e.g</i>., succinic acid) linking the IcaaCPG and 3-amino-1,2-propanediol tether, should also be capable of assisting the similar attack of 2-hydroxyl group on the phosphorus, provided that this 2-hydroxy function is instantly deprotected with ammonia prior to phosphate deprotection. This attack would then lead to the elimination of the desired oligonucleotide <b>oligo-T<sub>6</sub>,</b> and the competing reaction would lead to the formation of an IcaaCPG bound oligonucleotide with a phosphodiester group at the 3'-terminus. Considering this reasoning, the two universal <b>A</b>-supports illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> were designed and synthesized. In these supports, the succinyl group bridges the IcaaCPG<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> and 3-amino-1-(4,4'-dimethoxytriphenylmethyl)-2-propanediol via amide bonds, and the 2-hydroxyl function is either formylated (<b>A<sub>f</sub></b>) or phenoxyacetylated (<b>A<sub>p</sub></b>).</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">As in the case of the <b>A<sub>Q</sub></b>-supports described above, the short sequence <b>oligo-T<sub>6</sub></b> was assembled on supports <b>A<sub>f</sub></b> and <b>Ap,</b> using standard phosphoramidite chemistry and recommended protocols. No differences in coupling efficiency (&gt;98% as determined from trityl assay) were detected between these <b>A</b>-supports and commercial <b>T</b> derivatized supports, which indicated that these <b>A-</b>supports were compatible with standard assembly steps. After completion of the synthesis, addition of ammonia rapidly cleaved the formyl or phenoxyacetyl group and gave the support bound hexamer with a cyanoethyl protected phosphotriester function linked to the 1-hydroxyl of (±)-3-acylamido-1,2-propanediol (see <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, the "major" product). During the subsequent ammonia treatment, the succindiamido fragment (in the form of a succindiamide anion) assisted the free vicinal 2-hydroxyl group in attacking the phosphorus, thereby releasing the desired <b>oligo-T<sub>6</sub></b> into solution. Unlike the <b>A<sub>Q</sub></b> supports described above, the competing reaction in the case of the <b>A<sub>f</sub></b> and <b>Ap</b> supports led to the formation of IcaaCPG bound oligomer with a phosphodiester group at the 3'-terminus (see the "minor" product branch in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>). Thus, using the <b>A<sub>f</sub></b> and <b>Ap</b> supports according to the invention, the only oligonucleotide product in the solution appears to be the desired oligonucleotide, along with a small amount of truncated sequences resulting from the non-quantitative coupling steps in the process of oligonucleotide assembly.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">The properties of the <b>A<sub>f</sub></b> and <b>Ap</b> supports were investigated under various reaction conditions. First, an assembled <b>oligo-T<sub>6</sub></b> sequence was cleaved from the <b>A-</b>support with ammonia in methanol, and the extent of dephosphorylation/cleavage from the CPG was investigated, using ion exchange HPLC. The optimal conditions of recovery of <b>oligo-T<sub>6</sub></b> from the <b>A<sub>f</sub></b> and <b>Ap</b> supports was assessed from ion exchange HPLC by integration of peaks, corresponding to <b>oligo-T<sub>6</sub></b> (260 nm) derived from 1 µmol of initial solid support.
