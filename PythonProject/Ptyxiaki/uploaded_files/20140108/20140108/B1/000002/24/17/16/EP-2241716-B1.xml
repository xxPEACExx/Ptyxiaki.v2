A first edge of the insert part 61 is fitted into the coupling part 13, that is, into a space defined by the horizontal coupling surface 13a and the vertical coupling surface 13b. As seen in the cross-section, the first edge of the insert part 61 also has a thickness greater than that of other portions thereof, in the same manner as that of the vertical coupling surface 13b. Thereby, the insert part 61 of the screen holding frame 60 is coupled to the coupling part 13 by a force-fitting method. In detail, a distance between the edge of the vertical coupling surface 13b of the coupling part 13 and the front or rear surface of<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the mounting frame 10 is less than the thickness of the first edge of the insert part 61. Therefore, to fit the insert part 61 into the coupling part 13, a worker must apply external force to them such that the vertical coupling surface 13b of the coupling part 13 is elastically moved away from the front or rear surface of the mounting frame 10 due to the thickness of the first edge of the insert part 61 and then the insert part 61 is inserted into the coupling part 13.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The contact support part 62 extends downwards from a second edge of the insert part 61 and comes into surface contact with the outer surface of the vertical coupling surface 13b of the coupling part 13 when the screen holding frame 60 is mounted to the mounting frame 10.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The seating part 63 extends from the edge of the contact support part 62 in the horizontal direction.
