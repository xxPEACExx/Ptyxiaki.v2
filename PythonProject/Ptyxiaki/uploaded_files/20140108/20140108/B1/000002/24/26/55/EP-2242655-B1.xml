Each of the individual sheets are then able to be used by a user for a variety of purposes and can be readily detached or separated from the pad of sheets where required. The size of the notepad and the sheets contained therein may vary depending upon the specific use of the notepad.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the formation and manufacture of documents, such as notepads, individual sheets or pages of the document are typically processed by a production line or facility. The sheets are typically initially fed into the production line where they are transported to a collation device that firstly collates the sheets into an ordered stack. The ordered stack of sheets are then transported to a cropping or cutting station that typically crops or cuts the sheets into the desired size. The cropped sheets are then delivered to a binding station where they are bound together along a common edge to form a volume of sheets. Depending upon the nature of the document or notepad, the volume of sheets may be further processed, such as by covering or the like, for distribution and sale. It will be appreciated that the cutting steps and the binding steps may be performed in any order.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Traditional document binding processes vary depending upon the final desired form of the document. Mechanical binding means, typically involve the use of a mechanical means, such as a wire or plastic coil, which is threaded through a plurality of perforations formed along a common edge of the sheets of the document. The coil acts to retain the individual sheets together in an ordered manner. In other forms, chemical binding means, such as adhesives, may be employed to bind the pages of a document together. Following collation or individual pages into a stack and cropping the stack, an applicator is typically employed to apply a layer of binding adhesive along an edge of the stack of pages. A press may also be employed by the production line to apply a pressing force to the edge of the stack of sheets to facilitate a bond between the adjacent sheets.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It will be appreciated that such traditional processes of forming a document, such as a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> notepad, require a dedicated manufacturing facility comprising a number of distinct stations provided along the production line for performing separate tasks associated with processing individual sheets and binding them into a finished document. Such assembly lines do not easily and economically provide for manufacturing documents in small runs or batches, and do not readily provide for simple customisation of the manufactured document to variable sizes and the like.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">One particular type of notepad that is in common use is the Post-It™ note pads that are marketed under the trademark "Post-it" by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, St. Paul, Minnesota. These notepads typically comprise varying sized stacks of sheets of paper joined along a common edge by adhesive. The notepad comprises a stack of sheets of paper, each having a narrow strip or band of generally low-tack, pressure-sensitive adhesive aligned along an edge on its rear side by which the sheets can be temporarily adhered together. The sheets can be separated from the stack by breaking the low-tack adhesive bond between that sheet and an adjacent sheet in the stack such that the separated sheet can be further adhered to substrates such as documents, computer screens or other articles, generally for leaving a message or reminder. The strip of adhesive allows the sheets to be adhered together in the stack, and when a sheet is removed from the stack, the adhesive remains in position to enable the sheet to be further adhered to another surface. Such notepads are typically made from clean sheets of paper to enable a user to write on or otherwise use the sheet, whereby it can be repositioned. It will he appreciated that the manufacture of such sheets also comprises a dedicated assembly line to process the sheets and bond the individual sheets together.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Thus, there is a need to provide a method and device for forming a notepad in a home, work or office environment that can he performed simply and economically by a dedicated unit that provides customisation by the user specific to their own needs.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further, it is well established that offices and homes throughout the world generate masses of paper where the sheets are printed on only one side. Best office practice may include re-using the clean or reverse side of the sheet as rough note paper or, where a printer or photocopier can reuse second hand paper by printing on the reverse side without jamming, re-using the paper in such machines. One-sided paper may otherwise be shredded for pulping and recycling as cardboard, newspaper, toilet paper, recycled office paper or paper towelling. However, such recycling, although useful to preserve wood resources and preferred to delivering one-sided paper to landfill, may be energy intensive and environmentally undesirable.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Thus, there is also a need to provide a method and device for forming a notepad in a home, work or office environment that can process one-sided paper generated in the home, work or office environment to form notepads that can utilise the clean or reverse side of the sheet for further use.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The above references to and descriptions of prior proposals or products are not intended to be, and are not to he construed as, statements or admissions of common general knowledge in the art. In particular, the following prior art discussion docs not relate to what is commonly or<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> well known by the person skilled in the art, but assists in the understanding of the inventive step of the present invention of which the identification of pertinent prior art proposals is but one part.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Document <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP1531061A"><text>EP 1 531 061</text></patcit> describes a notepad forming device according to the preamble of claim 1.</p><heading id="h0004">STATEMENT OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">Accordingly, in one aspect of the invention provides a device for manufacturing a notepad according to claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The sheets may be made from any suitable material to which indicia may be applied, for example by printing or inscribing thereon. The sheets may be made from suitable polymeric material, from cellulosic material such as paper, or a combination or blend thereof. The sheets may be paper sheets, The sheets may be used or unused, recycled or virgin. The sheets may be pre-used sheets on which one side has had indicia printed thereon. The sheets may be re-used office paper. The loose sheets are preferably of uniform dimensions. However, the device may be adjustable to accommodate loose stacks of sheets of di fferent dimensions.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The notepad may comprise a plurality of sheets of fibrous material grouped together. The purpose of the notepad may be for writing on, or may include pre-printed material such as photogratphs or information, that can be used for a variety of purpose such as advertising or decoration. In one form, the notepad preferably comprises a stack of sheets derived from office paper whereby the plan dimensions of the notepad are smaller than the plan dimensions of an office sheet or paper. Typically, the different dimensions of an office sheet of paper will correspond to that of Λ4, letter, legal, executive and other standard office paper sizes.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The notepad formed by the present invention may assume a variety of different sizes. In one form the notepad may have a size equivalent to standard Λ3, foolscap, A4, letter, legal, executive and other standard office paper sizes. In another form the notepad may have dimensions of between 20 100 mm * 20 100 mm and may be rectangular or square in configuration. In a preferred form the notepad may have a substantially square configuration of 75 mm * 75 mm. In another form the notepad may have a substantially rectangular dimension of 40 mm * 50mm. It will be appreciated that the dimensions of the notepad may vary depending upon the needs of the user of the present invention.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In determining which face of a sheet will be the first side and which will be the reverse face, this may be decided by an operator. Where the sheets are pre-printed with specifically intended printed material, then the non-printed side may be the first side to which adhesive is to be applied. If the sheet is pre-used with unwanted inscriptions or printed matter, this side may be the first side and the other (presumably clean) face will be the reverse face. Where the sheet is virgin and both faces arc clean, the operator may determine which side, if any, is preferred as the first (adhesive receiving) side. Typically, the first side will face downwards and the reverse face will face upwards; although alternative arrangements arc fully within the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The adhesive may be a re-positional adhesive. The re-positional adhesive may be a low tack or pressure-sensitive adhesive such as that used in the 3M Post-It<sup>™</sup> notepad product<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> referred to above. However, other low-tack adhesives arc contemplated as being within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Alternatively, the adhesive may be a high strength, permanent glue and the portion bearing the adhesive may be separated from the rest of the cut sheet by a weakened line, for example, a perforated line. The printable, printed, inscribed or inscribable section of the cut sheet may therefore be removed by tearing along the weakened line for use as a non-adhesive bearing sheet.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The device of the present invention may be a stand alone device or may be incorporated in any one of a range of office equipment, such as a printer, photocopier, scanner, fax machine, multifunction device or the like.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The sheets are preferably shifted from one zone to another within the device by means of a combination of driven and free wheeling rollers. The driven rollers may be rubber-surfaced to provide suitable grip to the sheet surface. The rollers may be driven by one or more stepper motors. Each driven roller may be separately driven by a separate stepper motor. The positioning and movement of the sheets may be defected and controlled by photosensitive means feeding back sheet position data to the drive motors, all of which is preferably controlled by a central processing unit (CPU). The photosensitive means may be in the form of photodiodes. The photosensitive means may be in the form of one or more linear photodiode arrays. For example, if the fed sheet is skewed, the photosensitive means may detect the mal-aligned sheet and feedback the CPU. The CPU may then command the roller drive motor to adjust its rate by speeding up or slowing down to effect a correction in the alignment of the sheet.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The cutting means that may be a static knife or blade suitably positioned to cut the sheet as it proceeds through a cutting zone. The cutting means may be in the form of a guillotine that periodically drops to effect a cut in the sheet at predetermined intervals. The cutting means may include any other suitable cutting device, and includes non-physical devices such as laser or hot melt devices which may he suitable for polymeric sheet material. Of course, the various operations in the series of processes performed by the notepad forming device can be interchanged and varied in order or performed simultaneously, depending on their nature. For example, the transverse cutting process may be performed before or after the longitudinal cutting operation, or at the same time (for example by a punch or stamp knife with longitudinal and transverse blades). Irregular cuts using stamp knifes or arrays of knives may thus be performed to produce novelty shape pads, such as geometric, animal, building or vehicle shapes. For office applications, the typical shaped pad produced will be rectangular, including square.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The adhesive applicator includes any suitable means for applying a layer, strip or band of adhesive material to a portion or portions of the sheet surface. Where the adhesive is applied in portions, the portions may be randomly or regularly spaced. The adhesive applicator may include a reciprocating stamp means, a roller with an adhesive application zone on its surface, optionally protruding therefrom or may involve the use of adhesive transfer tape applied by driven or free-wheeling rollers. The adhesive applicator may include an adhesive storage vessel with one or<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> more applicators. The applicator(s) may be, for example, located on a drum or may be mounted on a reciprocating frame. The applicator(s) may <i>inter alia</i> include brush material, tabs, glue absorbent stubs or non-absorbent stubs.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The cutting means may include a support guide and rollers to stiffen the sheet preparatory to cutting.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The stacking means may include any suitable device adapted to collect cut sheets of similar dimensions and to order their stacking, one on top of the other. The stacking means preferably ensures that the respective adhesive-bearing surfaces of the cut sheets are facing in the same direction and that the edges or the sheets in the stack are aligned in registration with one another.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The pressing means may include a plunger. The plunger may move relative to the stacking means. That is, in one embodiment, the plunger may be stationary and the stacking means may be movable relative thereto. The plunger may push up or press down on the stacked cut sheets against an upper or lower panel in the stacking means whereby to enable the cut sheets to be pressed together to form the notepad.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In still yet another aspect, the present invention provides an adhesive applicator cartridge for a sheet processing device including:
<ul><li>a body mountable to the sheet processing device so as to be positioned adjacent a sheet being processed by said sheet processing device, said body having:
<ul><li>an adhesive receptacle for receiving a supply of adhesive; and</li><li>an adhesive applicator for applying said adhesive to a surface of the sheet being processed by said device.</li></ul></li></ul></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In one embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the body is mountable within a recess provided in the sheet processing device. In one form, the sheet processing device may be a sheet binding device for binding together sheets into a bound volume. In another form, the sheet binding device may be a notepad forming device as described in relation to any of the above described aspects of the invention.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In a first embodiment, the adhesive receptacle is a bore formed in the body. A tubular cylinder may be provided within the bore to receive the adhesive therein.

It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that throughout the present application the term "notepad" will be assumed to broadly mean any form of document comprising a plurality of sheets of fibrous material grouped together.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Referring firstly to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, there is shown a notepad forming device 10 comprising a feeder mechanism 20, alignment correction means 30 (refer to <figref idrefs="f0013">Fig. 3</figref>), longitudinal cutting means 40, adhesive applicator 60, lateral cutting means 80, stacking means 100 and forming means 120. In a preferrerd form, the forming means 120 is a pressing means, particularly where the adhesive used by the adhesive applicator 60 is a pressure sensitive adhesive.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 1a</figref>, in a paper processing device 10a, a paper sheet 24 is moved and controlled through the use of feeder rollers 23 onto the planar panel or main body 26. A shearing cutting wheel 43b is located substantially above the plantar panel. The shearing cutting wheel 43b has a cutting edge penetrating the paper 24 through the plane of the upper surface of the planar panel 26. The cutting wheel 43b is mounted for rotation about an axis above the planar panel 26, parallel to the planar panel upper surface and normal to the direction of travel of the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> paper 24. The cutting wheel 43b counter rotates with a complimentary shearing edge wheel 44b located substantially below the planar panel 26. The shearing action of wheels 43b, 44b creates one or more longitudinal slits in the paper 24, whereby to determine the width of longitudinally cut paper 24b. In this specification, reference to longitudinal means in the direction of travel of the sheet 24 over the planar panel 26, whereas transverse or lateral means across the line of travel of the paper 24.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The paper 24 may then be cut transversely to a predetermined length by a transverse cutting module including a transverse cutting wheel 80 mounted on a rail/linear bearing 187. Of course, the various operations in the series of processes performed by the devices 10-10f can be interchanged and varied in order or performed simultaneously, depending on their nature. However, typically the preferred order of cutting will be longitudinal as the sheet 24 is conveyed from the feeder mechanism 20 to the stacking mechanism 120, followed directly or indirectly by transverse cutting. The adhesive, printing or indicia stamping operations, particularly where the operation applies something to the paper 24 parallel to the direction of paper 24 travel, arc preferably performed as the paper 24 travels over the panel 26.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The transverse cutting module 180 may include a cutting wheel 87 and a shearing edge 84. The transverse cutting module 180 also includes all adhesive tape applicator 181 whereby adhesive is applied to each sheet of cut paper 24b. The paper 24b is stacked on a retractable shelf 103 that linearly vertically reciprocates by the operation of a scissor lift 122. Each time that the roller 181 for the tape/glue passes over the stack 121 of cut paper 24b, the retractable shelf 103 compresses the stack 121 and the cut sheets 24b are glued together.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 1b</figref> shows part of the arrangement of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 1a</figref> in plan view. The sheet of paper 24 is fed from the feeder mechanism 20 (not shown) through to the longitudinal cutting means 40 comprising a triplet of longitudinal cutting wheels 43. The longitudinal cutting wheels 43 may be variously spaced along a single shall 40a, but are preferably equispaced. Multiple, optionally employable, shafts that are vertically retractable may be employed to effect a variety of longitudinal slit combinations. The transverse cutting - adhesive transfer tape head 180 is shown mounted on a linear rail 183 and is mounted for reciprocal linear motion along the rail 183 as indicated by the arrows 183a,b.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 1c</figref> is a perspective view of the device 10a shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 1a</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0003">b</figref> and schematically shows the paper 24 fed in direction x. The paper 24 is longitudinally cut by the longitudinal cutting wheels 43 to produce four (4) strips of paper 24a of equal width. The four strips 24a are transversely cut by the transverse cutting wheel 180 reciprocally travelling along the rail 183.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 1d</figref>, a paper processing device 10d provides a series of pairs of counter rotating rollers 82a,b operable to hold the sheet 24 firmly against the panel/body 26 and under tension to achieve a clean, linear, longitudinal cut by the longitudinal cutting wheel 43 counter rotated against a complementary shearing edge wheel 44. The paper 21 is then cut again by a transverse bade 87 cutting against a shearing edge 84 and then fed onto a stack 121 and compressed by<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> another roller 186. Adhesive paper or glue may be applied before, during or after the longitudinal cut effected by the wheels 43, 44.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 1c</figref>, a device 10ba having a different type of feeder mechanism 220 is shown comprising a horizontal stack feeder 221. Paper 24 is picked up off the stack 21 by a roller 23 and fed through the apparatus 10b by further rollers 82a, 82b counter rotated with complementary rollers substantially below the line of the planar panel 26. The paper 24 is longitudinally cut by a longitudinal cutting wheel 43 counter rotated against a shearing edge wheel 44 beneath the planar body 26. A transverse cutting punch 190 cuts the longitudinally cut paper 24a to length. The longitudinally cut paper 24a is thus controlled onto a stack 121. The cut paper stack 121 is then compressed by a platform 206 that extends through an opening 230 in the stack holder 209. The platform 206 is vertically reciprocally mounted on a scissor lift mechanism 122.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Above the stack 121 and opposed to the platform is a floating floor 207. When a predetermined amount of paper 24a has accumulated on stack 121, the platform 206 is pushed against the bias or compression springs 208 from which the floating floor 207 is suspended. This compression of the stack 121 presses the adhesive and forms a pad from the stacked sheets 121. An adhesive tape applicator 60 is provided to apply adhesive to the paper 24 in longitudinal strips. An adhesive applicator can be included at various alternative spots in the series of operations performed by the device 10b, for example, before or after the longitudinal cutting means 43 at positions 160a,b as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 1f</figref>.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">A different arrangement is shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 1g</figref> in which a device 10c comprises a sticker or stamp applicator 170. The application of stickers or stamps, for example to memo pads, may be advantageous. In this case, the stamp applicator 170 includes a free running wheel 171 above the sheet 24 and the planar panel 26, immediately following the feeder mechanism 20 and prior to the longitudinal cutting means 43 in the series or operations performed by the device 10e. However, the skilled person will appreciate that the stamp/sticker applicator 170 can be incorporated in or on the device, 10c at a variety of positions, for example, before or after the longitudinal cutting means 43, and may or may not be used in series with a glue/tape applicator of the type described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 1e</figref>.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Turning to <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 1h</figref>, an arrangement 10d is shown that is similar to device 10c shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 1g</figref>, but includes a printer head 172 before or after the longitudinal cutting means 43 to apply graphics such as headings or images to the paper 24. The printer head 172 can be used in series with an adhesive tape applicator 60 (see <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 1 e)</figref>, or can be used in its own right, i.e. merely to apply printed indicia or images to sheets 24 preparatory to forming cut sheets 24a in the form of a pad.

This portion of the feeder mechanism is not expressly shown in the drawing of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, but is located between the rollers 23a,b of feeder mechanism 20 and the longitudinal cutting means 40. The alignment mechanism 30 comprises a pair of coaxially aligned feed rollers 32a,b separately driven by respective stepper motors 33a,b. The alignment mechanism 30 draws sheet 24 from the feeder mechanism 20.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The pair of rollers 23a,b act upon the top sheet of paper 24 in the stack 21 to draw it from the sheets below and to feed it into the alignment/position detection zone of the alignment mechanism. 30 shown in <figref idrefs="f0013">figure 3</figref>. The sheet alignment detection means 30 involves feeding the sheet of paper 24 across the main body 26 of the machine 10. A pair of sensor arrays 31a,b, labeled respectively array A and array B, each comprise a linear array of photodiodes.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">As the sheet 24 passes over the sensor arrays 31 a,b, the sensor arrays issue to a CPU a signal corresponding to the leading edge 27 of the sheet 24 as it passes over the arrays 31a,b. The position of the edge 27 is determined for each sensor array 31a,b and compared by the CPU software. If both sensor arrays 31a,b show the position of the edge 27 to be substantially the same (in time and space), then this indicates to the CPU that the sheet of paper 24 is being fed in correct alignment relative to the body 26.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">However, if the edge 27 position is different for the two sensor arrays 31a,b, then it is an indication that the sheet 24 is not correctly aligned. If this occurs, the CPU through an operator display may flag an error situation and halt, or the alignment mechanism 30 may be equipped to straighten the sheet 24 as an optional additional feature of the device 10. Prior to the sheet 24 passing over the sensor arrays 31a,b, the sheet 24 will pass under a roller 32a,b on each side of the sheet 24. Each roller 32a,b is independently driven by its own stepper motor 33a,b. If the sheet 24 is determined to be incorrectly aligned, this situation can be corrected by advancing one motor (for example stepper motor 33a) and or retreating the other motor (for example stepper motor 33b) or holding the other motor (33b, 33a respectively) stationary. In this manner, the sheet 24 may be adjusted into square alignment, using the pair of sensor arrays 31a,b to check the sheets 24 position in real time.
