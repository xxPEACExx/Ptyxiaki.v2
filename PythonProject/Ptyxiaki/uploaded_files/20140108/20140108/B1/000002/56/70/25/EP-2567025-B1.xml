More particularly, this invention is concerned with papermaking belts comprising a patterned framework having deflection conduits, random pores, and a reinforcing structure and the high caliper/low density paper products produced thereby.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Cellulosic fibrous structures, such as paper towels, facial tissues, napkins and toilet tissues, are a staple of every day life. The large demand for and constant usage of such consumer products has created a demand for improved versions of these products and, likewise, improvement in the methods and speed of their manufacture. Such cellulosic fibrous structures are manufactured by depositing an aqueous cellulosic slurry from a headbox onto a Fourdrinier wire or a twin wire paper machine. Either such forming wire is provided as an endless belt through which initial dewatering occurs and fiber rearrangement takes place.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Processes for the manufacture of paper products generally involve the preparation of an aqueous slurry of cellulosic fibers and subsequent removal of water from the slurry while contemporaneously rearranging the fibers to form an embryonic web. Various types of machinery can be employed to assist in the dewatering process. A typical manufacturing process employs the aforementioned Fourdrinier wire papermaking machine where a paper slurry is fed onto a surface of a traveling endless wire where the initial dewatering occurs. In a conventional wet press process, the fibers are transferred directly to a capillary de-watering belt where additional de-watering occurs. In a structured web process, the fibrous web is subsequently transferred to a papermaking belt where rearrangement of the fibers is carried out.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A preferred papermaking belt in a structured process has a foraminous woven member surrounded by a hardened photosensitive resin framework. The resin framework can be provided with a plurality of discrete, isolated channels known as deflection conduits. Such a papermaking belt can be termed a deflection member because the papermaking fibers deflected into the conduits become rearranged upon the application of a differential fluid pressure. The utilization of the belt in the papermaking process provides the possibility of creating paper having certain<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> desired characteristics of strength, absorption, and softness. Such a papermaking belt is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4529480A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,529,480</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Deflection conduits can provide a means for producing a Z-direction fiber orientation by enabling the fibers to deflect along the periphery of the deflection conduits as water is removed from the aqueous slurry of cellulosic fibers. The total fiber deflection is dependent on the size and shape of the deflection conduits relative to the fiber length. Large conduits allow smaller fibers to accumulate in the bottom of the conduit which in turn limits the deflection of subsequent fibers depositing therein. Conversely, small conduits allow large fibers to bridge across the conduit opening with minimal fiber deflection. Deflection conduits defined by a periphery forming sharp comers or small radii increase the potential for fiber bridging which minimizes fiber deflection. Examples of various conduit shapes that can effect fiber bridging are described in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5679222A"><text>US Patent No. 5,679,222</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As the cellulosic fibrous web is formed, the fibers are predominantly oriented in the X-Y plane of the web thereby providing negligible Z-direction structural rigidity. In a wet press process, as the fibers oriented in the X-Y plane are compacted by mechanical pressure, the fibers are pressed together increasing the density of the paper web while decreasing the thickness. In contrast, in a structured process, the orientation of fibers in the Z-direction of the web enhances the web's Z-direction structural rigidity and its corresponding resistance to mechanical pressure. Accordingly, maximizing fiber orientation in the Z-direction maximizes caliper.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A paper produced according to a structured web process can be characterized by having two physically distinct regions distributed across its surfaces. One region is a continuous network region which has a relatively high density and high intrinsic strength. The other region is one which is comprised of a plurality of domes which are completely encircled by the network region. The domes in the latter region have relatively low densities and relatively low intrinsic strength compared to the network region.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The domes are produced as fibers fill the deflection conduits of the papermaking belt during the papermaking process. The deflection conduits prevent the fibers deposited therein from being compacted as the paper web is compressed during a drying process. As a result, the domes are thicker having a lower density and intrinsic strength compared to the compacted regions of the web. Consequently, the caliper of the paper web is limited by the intrinsic strength of the domes. Such a formed paper is described in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US4637859A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,637,859</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">After the initial formation of the web, which later becomes the cellulosic fibrous structure, the papermaking machine transports the web to the dry end of the machine. In the dry<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> end of a conventional machine, a press felt compacts the web into a single region of cellulosic fibrous structure having uniform density and basis weight prior to final drying. The final drying can be accomplished by a heated drum, such as a Yankee drying drum, or by a conventional de-watering press. Through air drying can yield significant improvements in consumer products. In a through-air-drying process, the formed web is transferred to an air pervious through-air-drying belt. This "wet transfer" typically occurs at a pick-up shoe, at which point the web may be first molded to the topography of the through air drying belt. In other words, during the drying process, the embryonic web takes on a specific pattern or shape caused by the arrangement and deflection of cellulosic fibers. A through air drying process can yield a structured paper having regions of different densities. This type of paper has been used in commercially successful products, such as Bounty® paper towels and Charmin® bath tissue. Traditional conventional felt drying does not produce a structured paper having these advantages. However, it would be desirable to produce a structured paper using conventional drying at speeds equivalent to, or greater than, a through air dried process.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Once the drying phase of the papermaking process is finished, the arrangement and deflection of fibers is complete. However, depending on the type of the finished product, paper may go through additional processes such as calendering, softener application, and converting. These processes tend to compact the dome regions of the paper and reduce the overall thickness. Thus, producing high caliper finished paper products having two physically distinct regions requires forming cellulosic fibrous structures in the domes having a resistance to mechanical pressure.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">To sufficiently dewater a paper web, such systems must operate at undesirable, low speeds. Thus, the present invention provides a deflection member that has higher porosity and better dewatering. The present invention provides a web patterning apparatus suitable for making structured paper on conventional papermaking equipment without the need for an additional dewatering felt or compression nip. The present invention also provides a paper web having an essentially continuous, essentially, macroscopically mono-planar network region and a plurality of discrete domes dispersed throughout. The domes are sized and shaped to yield optimum caliper. Additionally, the present invention provides a papermaking belt having a continuous network region and a plurality of discrete deflection conduits which are sized and shaped to optimize fiber deflection and corresponding Z-direction fiber orientation. The present invention also provides the papermaking belt with increased de-watering capability by providing randomly created pores within the continuous network region.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">One embodiment of the present disclosure provides for a papermaking belt having an embryonic web contacting surface for carrying an embryonic web of paper fibers and a non-embryonic web contacting surface opposite said embryonic web contacting surface is disclosed.

The cellulosic webs preferably have sufficient tensile strength to prevent the structures from tearing or shredding during ordinary use or when relatively small tensile forces are applied. The cellulosic webs are preferably absorbent, so that liquids may be quickly absorbed and fully retained by the fibrous structure. Further, the web preferably exhibits softness, so that it is tactilely pleasant and not harsh during use. Softness is the ability of the cellulosic fibrous web to impart a particularly desirable tactile sensation to the user's skin. Softness is universally proportional to the ability of the cellulosic fibrous web to resist Z-direction deformation.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Absolute Void Volume (VV<sub>Absolute</sub>) is the volumetric measure of VV per unit area in cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Absorbency is the property of the cellulosic fibrous web which allows it to attract and retain contacted fluids. Absorbency is influenced by the density of the cellulosic fibrous web. If<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the web is too dense, the interstices between fibers may be too small and the rate of absorption may not be great enough for the intended use. If the interstices are too large, capillary attraction of contacted fluids is minimized preventing fluids from being retained by the cellulosic fibrous web due to surface tension limitations.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Aspect Ratio is the ratio of the major axis length to the minor axis length.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Basis weight (BW) is the mass of cellulosic fibers per unit area (g/cm<sup>2</sup>) of a cellulosic web.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Caliper is the apparent thickness of a cellulosic fibrous web measured under a certain mechanical pressure and is a function of basis weight and web structure.

The papermaking belt 10 has an embryonic web contacting side 11 (also referred to herein as the "embryonic web contacting surface 11 ") and a backside 12 (also referred to herein as the "non-embryonic web contacting side 12" or the "non-embryonic web contacting surface 12") opposite the embryonic web contacting side 11. The papermaking belt 10 can carry and support a web of papermaking fibers (or "fiber web" and/or "fibrous web") in various stages of its formation (an embryonic web 17 and/or an intermediate web 19).

The papermaking belt 10a carries the embryonic web 17a to a nip 38 formed between two coaxial rolls. The first roll can be heated roll such as a Yankee drying drum 28. The impression nip roll 16a can be a pressure roll having a periphery with a capillary dewatering member 60 disposed thereon.

The resinous knuckle pattern 42 can be substantially coincident (or even coincident) with the elevation of the reinforcing structure 44. By having the resinous knuckle pattern 42 extending outwardly such a short distance from the reinforcing structure 44, a softer product may be produced. Specifically, the short distance provides for the absence of deflection or molding of the paper into the imprinting surface of the imprinting fabric as occurs in the prior art. Thus, the resulting paper can be provided with a smoother surface and less tactile roughness.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">Furthermore, by having the resinous knuckle pattern 42 extend outwardly from the reinforcing structure 44 such a short distance, the reinforcing structure 44 can contact the embryonic web 17 at the top surface of the knuckles disposed within the deflection conduits 46. This arrangement can further compact the embryonic web 17a at the points coincident the embryonic web contacting side 11 of the resinous knuckle pattern 42 against the Yankee drying drum 28 thus decreasing the MD/CD spacing between compacted regions. More frequent and closely spaced contact between the embryonic web 17a and the Yankee drying drum 28 may occur. One of the benefits of the present invention is that the imprinting of the embryonic web 17a and transfer to a Yankee drying drum 28 may occur nearly simultaneously, eliminating the multi-operational steps involving separate compression nips of the prior art. Also, by transferring substantially full contact of the embryonic web 17a to the Yankee drying drum 28 -rather than just the imprinted region as occurs in the prior art-full contact drying can be obtained.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">Fibers making up the embryonic web 17a are typically oriented in the MD/CD plane and provide minimal structural support in the Z-direction. Thus, as the embryonic web 17a is compressed by the papermaking belt 10a, the embryonic web 17a is compacted creating a<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> patterned, high density region that is reduced in thickness. Conversely, portions of the embryonic web 17a covering the deflection conduits 46 are not compacted and as a result, thicker, low density regions are produced. These low density regions, (i.e., domes) can give the embryonic web 17a an apparent thickness. However, the domes may be susceptible to deformation and reduced thickness during subsequent papermaking operations. Thus, the caliper of the embryonic web 17a may be limited by the domes' ability to withstand a mechanical pressure.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">Additionally, the physical properties of an embryonic paper web 17a can be influenced by the orientation of fibers in the MD/CD plane. For instance, a web 27 having a fiber orientation which favors MD, has a higher tensile strength in MD than in CD, a higher stretch in CD than in MD, and a higher bending stiffness in MD than in CD. The web tensile strength is also proportional to the corresponding lengths of fibers oriented in a particular direction in the X-Y plane. Web tensile strength in the MD/CD is proportional to the mean fiber lengths in the MD/CD. Fibers 50 accumulating at a resin/deflection conduit interface can have a Z-direction component that enables them to provide the support structure capable to withstand external compressive forces. Fibers oriented parallel to the Z-direction at the interface can provide maximum support.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 7</figref>, deflection conduits 46 and random pores 40 can provide a means for deflecting fibers in the Z-direction. Fiber deflection produces a fiber orientation which includes a Z-direction component. Such fiber orientation not only creates an apparent web thickness but can also provide Z-direction structural rigidity which can assist the embryonic paper web 17a to maintain thickness throughout processing. Accordingly, for the present invention, deflection conduits 46 are preferably sized and shaped to maximize fiber deflection.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 8</figref>, water removal from the embryonic web 17a begins as fibers 50 are deflected into the deflection conduits 46 and conform to the surface of resinous knuckle pattern 42. It is believed that providing random pores 40 within the resinous knuckle pattern 42 can provide additional capillary action to increase water removal from the embryonic web 17a in regions distal from deflection conduits 46 by decreasing the path distance between the paper-contacting side 11 and backside 12 of the papermaking belt 10a. This facilitates regions of the resinous knuckle pattern 42 distal from a deflection conduit 46 to thermodynamically compete in the removal of water from embryonic web 17 or intermediate web 19 by increasing the surface area to volume of the resinous knuckle pattern 42. It is also believed that enhanced water removal can result in decreased fiber mobility which may 'fix' the fibers in place after deflection and rearrangement.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Deflection of the fibers into the deflection conduits 34 and conformation to the surface of resinous knuckle pattern 42 can be induced by the application of differential fluid pressure to the embryonic web 17a. One preferred method of applying differential pressure is by exposing the embryonic web 17a to a vacuum through both deflection conduits 46 and pores 40.</p><heading id="h0012">Capillary Dewatering Member</heading><p id="p0079" num="0079">The capillary dewatering member 60 can be a dewatering felt.

The layers of felt are formed to promote transport of water received from the web contacting surface of the papermaking belt 17a away from a first felt surface and toward a second felt surface. The felt layer can have a relatively high density and relatively small pore size adjacent the felt surface in contact with the backside 12 of the papermaking belt 10a as compared to the density and pore size of the felt layer adjacent the felt surface in contact with the impression nip roll 16a.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">The dewatering felt can have an air permeability of between about 5 and about 300 cubic feet per minute (cfm) (0.002 m<sup>3</sup>/sec-0.142 m<sup>3</sup>/sec) with an air permeability of less than 50 cfm (0.24 m<sup>3</sup>/sec) being preferred for use with the present invention. Air permeability in cfm is a measure of the number of cubic feet of air per minute that pass through a one square foot area of a felt layer, at a pressure differential across the dewatering felt thickness of about 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) of water. The air permeability is measured using a Valmet permeability measuring device (Model Wigo Taifun Type 1000) available from the Valmet Corp. of Helsinki, Finland.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">If desired, other capillary dewatering members may be used in place of the felt described above.
