<ul><li>(1) Fill up the water: before brewing the tea, the user is able to open up the container lid 31 and remove the tea basket 4 from the tea infusing container 3. Therefore, the user is able to fill a predetermined amount of water into the tea infusing container 3.</li><li>(2) Place the tea leaves: the user is able to place the tea leaves in the tea basket 4 by opening up the basket lid 41. Once the tea leaves are properly placed in the tea basket 4, the user is able to close the tea basket 4 by the basket lid 41 and to dispose the tea basket 4 in the tea infusing container 3.</li><li>(3) Heat up the water: Once the power is on, the user to able to press the "boil water" button on the control panel. Therefore, the heater unit 5 is automatically activated for heating up the water in the tea infusing container 3. When the temperature sensor detects the water temperature reaching a preset threshold, the control circuit will activate a buzzer for generating an audio notification.</li><li>(4) Drop down the tea basket 4: the user is able to set the brewing time on the control panel. The user is able to apply a downward force at the actuator 22 to drive the sliding frame 2 moving downward along the vertical support 12. At the same time, the first permanent magnet 23 is correspondingly driven downward along the first guiding groove 32. Due to the magnetically attraction, the second permanent magnet 42 will be slidably moved down along the second guiding groove 33 by the first permanent magnet 23 so as to drop down the tea basket 4. In other words, the movement of the tea basket 4 is driven to move by means of magnetic means. Once the tea basket 4 is dropped down at the lowest position, the hanger 11 is magnetically attracted by the electromagnet 11 I so as to retain the tea basket 4 in position.</li><li>(5) Rinse the tea leave: (a) the tea basket 4 is retained in the boiling water for brewing process. (b) after a predetermined of time, such as 5 seconds, the coil of the electromagnet 11 is de-energized, such that the compressed resilient element 121 will bound to its original form to generate an upward pushing force along the vertical support 12. As a result, the first permanent magnet 23 is correspondingly driven upward along the first<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> guiding groove 32 by the resilient element 121. Due to the magnetically attraction, the second permanent magnet 42 will be slidably moved up along the second guiding groove 33 by the first permanent magnet 23 so as to lift up the tea basket 4. It is worth mentioning that the tea basket 4 is lifted up at a position above the water level of the boiling water in the tea infusing container 3. (c) The water in the tea infusing container 3 is drained via the tea discharging outlet 34. It is worth mentioning that the user is able to actuate a "discharge" switch on the control panel to drain the water out of the tea infusing container 3, wherein the water is used for rinsing the tea leaves as the tea rinsing water.</li><li>(6) Fill up the water again: the user is able to open up the container lid 31 and remove the tea basket 4 from the tea infusing container 3. Therefore, the user is able to fill a predetermined amount of water into the tea infusing container 3. Once the tea basket 4 is disposed in the tea infusing container 3, the user is able to cover the top opening of the tea basket 4 by the basket lid 41.</li><li>(7) Boil the water: the user is able to select which type of tea leave to brew the tea by selectively pressing a corresponding "tea type" button on the control panel. Once the "tea type" button is pressed, the brewing time and temperature will be automatically set to brew the tea. The heater unit 5 is also automatically activated for heating up the water in the tea infusing container 3.</li><li>(8) Drop down the tea basket 4: when the water temperature reaches the preset threshold, the control circuit will activate the buzzer for generating an audio notification. The user is able to apply the downward force at the actuator 22 to drive the sliding frame 2 moving downward along the vertical support 12. At the same time, the first permanent magnet 23 is correspondingly driven downward along the first guiding groove 32. Due to the magnetically attraction, the second permanent magnet 42 will be slidably moved down along the second guiding groove 33 by the first permanent magnet 23 so as to drop down the tea basket 4.
