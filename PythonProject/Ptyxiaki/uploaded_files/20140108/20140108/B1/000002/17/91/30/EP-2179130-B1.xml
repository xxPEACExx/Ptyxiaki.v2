mxw-id="PDES63960671" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method of monitoring the water surrounding an offshore hydrocarbon well in order to detect contamination deriving from that well, and additionally to apparatus for use in such a method.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In offshore drilling and hydrocarbon recovery there are risks that materials released into the water surrounding the wellhead or the drilling and/or production platform may reach levels at which marine life in the vicinity is endangered. Discharges may be operational or accidental. Thus examples of operational discharges include produced water during the production stage and drilling fluids and cuttings during the .drilling stage. Examples of accidental discharges include hydrocarbons, hydraulic fluids, drilling fluids, cuttings and other chemicals. It is important that such discharges do not cause unacceptable water contamination or other environmental effects and so, when unacceptable discharges occur, it is important for the well operator to take action to reduce or stop contaminant release.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Such actions may include shutting down drilling operations, stopping hydrocarbon recovery, replacing or repairing equipment, and so on, all of which are expensive. It is therefore important for the well operator to be able to determine not only that contamination has occurred but also the source, nature and severity of the contamination: thus for example if contamination is as a result of leakage from passing shipping, corrective action by the well operator would be ineffective, and if contamination is below threshold values for severity then corrective action may as yet not be required.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Monitoring of contamination of water masses is well-known; however the prior art is mostly concerned with downstream monitoring of flowing fresh water,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> monitoring of effluent discharges from factories, and general monitoring of offshore waters. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US3770052A"><text>US 3 770 052 A</text></patcit>, which discloses the features in the preamble of claim 1, relates to the effective monitoring of seawater immediately above offshore hydrocarbon wells in order to detect contamination by the well rather than contamination in the vicinity of the well. There is however still a need for monitoring systems useful in this regard.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">We have found that monitoring of seawater contamination by offshore hydrocarbon wells is best effected by a combination of chemical, physical and biological sensors arranged around the well at the sea bed and, where a sea surface platform is present, a further such combination arranged around the surface structure, submerged but near the water surface. For certain specific operational discharges, it is also desirable to place such sensors at depths appropriate to monitor the expected discharge plume within the water mass.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Viewed from one aspect therefore the invention provides a method of detecting seawater contamination from an offshore hydrocarbon well facility comprising a plurality of seabed wellheads connected by hydrocarbon conduits to a seabed pipeline head (e.g. a PLEM) from which a hydrocarbon pipeline leads to a remote hydrocarbon receiving facility, each said wellhead being provided with a protective cover (eg an over-trawlable wellhead protection structure - WHPS) to which is removably attached a sensor unit, each said sensor unit comprising a biological sensor and a data transmitter coupled by a data transmission line to said remote facility, said well facility further comprising a seawater velocity sensor, a seawater conductivity sensor and a temperature sensor also coupled by a data transmission line to said remote facility, wherein data from said data transmission line is analysed to determine indicia of seawater contamination at said well facility and of the seawater flow at said well facility<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> and thereby to provide a signal indicative of seawater contamination above a preselected limit deriving from said well facility.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Viewed from a further aspect the invention provides apparatus for detecting seawater contamination from an offshore hydrocarbon well facility, said apparatus comprising a plurality of removably attached sensor units each attached at the protective cover of a wellhead of said offshore hydrocarbon well facility and each comprising a biological sensor and a data transmitter coupled by a data transmission line to a remote data analysis facility (eg part of a hydrocarbon receiving facility coupled via a hydrocarbon pipeline to a seabed pipeline head (eg a PLEM) at said offshore hydrocarbon well facility), said apparatus further comprising at said offshore hydrocarbon well facility a seawater velocity sensor, a seawater conductivity sensor and a temperature sensor also coupled by a data transmission line to said remote facility, said apparatus optionally and preferably further comprising a computer arranged to analyse data from said data transmission line to determine indicia of seawater contamination at said well facility and of the seawater flow at said well facility and thereby to provide a signal indicative of seawater contamination above a preselected limit deriving from said well facility.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is particularly preferred that the well facility also comprise a submerged sediment trap.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, each sensor unit comprises a said seawater velocity sensor, a seawater conductivity sensor and a temperature sensor also coupled by a data transmission line to said remote facility.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In an especially preferred embodiment a further such sensor unit is removably attached at the seabed pipeline head module (i.e. the PLEM).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one further sensor unit is placed at<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> a seabed location remote from the well facility, e.g. at a distance of 500 to 1000 m from any wellhead, PLEM or pipeline, especially at a distance of 800 to 2000 m. Such "outlier" sensor units may serve to determine a "background" or "control" value for contamination and are desirably placed around the well facility (where at least three outliers are present) or upstream of the well facility in the sense of the normally prevailing seabed current. Data transmission from outliers may be via a data transmission line or more preferably by acoustic transmission from a transmitter at the outlier through the seawater to a receiver coupled to the main data transmission line leading from the PLEM, optionally via an intermediately positioned seabed transceiver. Acoustic transmissions in the method of the invention are preferably non-continuous, e.g. occurring at time intervals of at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours, and preferably are at frequencies in a wavelength band which has little or no effect on whales, in particular frequencies outside the 17 to 43 kHz band, particularly outside the 1 to 100 kHz band.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The biosensors in the sensor units are preferably raised relative to the seabed to reduce the influence of normal dirt-raising seabed currents, e.g. at a minimum height of 1 to 10 m, especially 2 to 5 m above the surrounding seabed. The bottom of the biosensor for these purposes maybe considered to be the lowest portion of the biosensor in which the species being monitored (the "sentinel" species) is contained.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The well facility sensor units may optionally and preferably also include sensors selected from the following:
<ul><li>acoustic sensors (e.g. hydrophones);</li><li>mass spectrometers;</li><li>NMR spectrometers;</li><li>Heart rhythm sensors;</li><li>pH sensors;</li><li>seawater pressure sensors;<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></li><li>turbidity sensors;</li><li>dissolved oxygen sensors;</li><li>passive sampling devices;</li><li>chlorophyll sensors; and</li><li>sediment traps;</li><li>in particular one or more of the latter five such sensors.</li></ul></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Passive sampling sensors may be used to detect organic compound contaminants, e.g. aromatic compounds, and generally operate by the use of a semi-permeable membrane which separates the seawater from a solvent in which the organic compounds are soluble. The solvent may be recovered and analysed when the sensors are periodically replaced or, more preferably, a spectrometric device is included which can analyse the solvent for organic compound content <i>in situ,</i> e.g. an infra-red spectrophotometer.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The chlorophyll sensor may be a spectrofluorometer and serves to detect changes in the flora of the body of water surrounding the sensor, e.g. changes in algal content.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The biosensor may be one or more of the many known biosensors which operate by detecting the effect of changes in the seawater on a selected living species, the sentinel species, usually fish or macroinvertebrates (eg shellfish, crustaceans, sea urchins (eg echinodermata), molluscs and fish, especially filter feeding species, and in particular mussels, clams and scallops), for example changes in respiration, pulse (or heart rhythm), gill movement, population density, growth rate, siphon operation, shell movement (e.g. closure and opening), etc. For this purpose, the biosensors will generally include optical recording apparatus, e.g. a camera, and optionally also light sources, e.g. lasers. Such effects are known to be correlatable to changes in chemical and physical environment.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The sentinel species is preferably one suited to the normal (i.e. non-contaminated) environment at the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> location at which the biosensor is to be deployed, taking into account parameters including depth, temperature, salinity, biomass content of the surrounding water, etc, and one which is responsive to the types of contamination possible in the event of malfunction of the well facility. Typical examples include macroinvertebrate filterfeeders such as mussels, clams, scallops and oysters. The use of such sentinel species in biomonitoring is discussed for example in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6119630A"><text>US-A-6119630 (Lobsiger</text></patcit>), <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6058763A"><text>US-A-6058763 (Shedd</text></patcit>), <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5798222A"><text>US-A-5798222 (Goix</text></patcit>), and <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="FR2713778A"><text>FR-A-2713778 (Pennec</text></patcit>) and by <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Al-Arabi et al in Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry 24:1968-1978 (2005</text></nplcit>) and <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Gruber et al in Water</text></nplcit>, <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Air and Soil Pollution 15:421-481 (1981</text></nplcit>).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the performance of the present invention the use of bivalves, and in particular mussels, clams and scallops, is preferred.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The sentinel species is housed within the biosensor in such a way that it contacts the seawater at the sensor location but is retained within the sensor, e.g. by the use of a cage with a perforated or mesh wall.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Monitoring will typically be to detect movement of the sentinel species within the sensor (e.g. opening or closing of bivalve shells), or localized variations of movement of water within the sensor, or localized changes in water turbidity, or light or sound emissions or reflections by the sentinel species.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">All such measurements may be calibrated against equivalent measurements for the same sentinel species under a range of physico-chemical conditions (e.g. temperature, pressure, salinity, microbe content, sediment content, light intensity, etc.) at a series of different pollutant contents and pollutant exposure periods. In this way, the signals from the biosensors may be analysed to determine whether the presence of particular pollutants is likely and whether it is at unacceptably high levels. Setting up a calibration is<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> facilitated by multivariate or principal component analysis which may be used to produce a prediction matrix which can be applied to the data provided by the sensor units.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Certain of the monitored parameters of the sentinel species, e.g. growth, valve gap, heart rate, etc, can be used in existing environmental models such as DREAM (dose-related environmental risk assessment) which are already in use by the oil and gas industry. Data input from the methods of the invention may thus be used to enhance the reliability and accuracy of the results from such models.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">While continuous real-time monitoring is possible according to the invention, it will not always be necessary and data sampling may be effected instead at intervals, e.g. of 1 to 48 hours, optionally with data being collected and averaged between sampling times. Desirably however, the sensor units will be arranged to override any temporally spaced sampling should the detected values of the parameters under study fall outside a "normal operating window", i.e. so that leakages may be detected and dealt with promptly.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The data from the sensor units may thus be used to calculate an indication of contamination from the biosensors, and to determine whether the cause is external to the well facility (e.g. by comparison with outliers and comparison between the biosensors taking into account the seawater velocity (i.e. speed and direction in the horizontal plane) and by correction for influence of temperature, pressure, salinity (itself determinable from the detected conductivity), transient biomass (determinable from the detected chlorophyll concentration), and transient turbidity (e.g. due to unduly high seabed turbulence)).</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Where external factors cannot be ruled out, data from the passive sampling sensors may be used to increase the degree of confidence in the contamination indication, and if necessary the biosensors may be<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> retrieved, e.g. using submarines such as AUVs and ROVs, so that autopsies, biopsies or other analyses may be performed. Together this can give rapid confirmation that contamination above a preset threshold has occurred or is occurring and as to whether this is attributable to the operation of the well facility. This enables the well operator to take corrective action with a minimum of delay, e.g. by stopping or slowing hydrocarbon production at one or more of the wellheads, by repairing the wellhead equipment responsible for leakage, etc.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In an alternative form, not claimed, the method is also suitable for monitoring the operation of an offshore hydrocarbon well facility which includes a surface (i.e. sea-surface) platform, e.g. a floating or static drilling and/or production platform.

The units are submerged, that is to say no part, including any other connected parts, is at or above the sea surface except in storm conditions, e.g. a storm force of 8 or above on the Beaufort scale. Typically anchoring will be such that under calm conditions all<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> parts are at least 15 m below the sea surface and the base of the biosensor is no more than 50m below sea surface.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The sensor units of the second array are preferably located such that the biosensors are at a height of 1 to 10 m, especially 2 to 5 m, above the surrounding seabed. They may be fixed, e.g. mounted on rigid supports, or alternatively they too may be buoyed or buoyant and tethered to a seated anchoring device. These sensor units are preferably located between 50 and 500 m from the nearest platform support, wellhead or seabed pipeline. Further seabed sensor units, "inliers", may if desired be placed between wellheads or within the area defined by three or more wellheads.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The two arrays preferably each comprise at least 4, especially at least 6, e.g. up to 30, sensor units spaced apart by no more than 100° from a central vertical axis, e.g. an axis through the platform, wellhead or wellhead cluster.

These again may be around the platform or wellhead(s) or upstream as discussed earlier.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Still further sensor units, "platform sensor units", may if desired be placed on the seabed-to-platform supports of a fixed platform. In this case such platform sensor units may contain physical and/or chemical sensors only, e.g. seawater velocity sensors. Again velocity in this instance may be approximated by horizontal flow rates and velocities.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Where seabed sensor units can be attached to or located within existing subsea structures, this will generally be preferred as such sensors need not then be provided with trawl protection structures.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">It is preferred that the submerged but near surface sensor units comprise seawater velocity, seawater conductivity and temperature sensors and optionally but preferably one or both of pressure and chlorophyll sensors.

In a preferred embodiment, however, data transmission from such sensor units is by acoustic transmission as discussed above, optionally via intermediate transceivers (again subsurface and for example on buoys tethered to the seabed). The use of acoustic data transmission in this way transforms the sensor unit/tether array from being a potential obstacle for anchor handling and other maintenance activity around the platform or sub-sea installation into a useful grid location system, eg for vehicles such as ROVs and AUVs used in these activities.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Data transmission from the second array of sensor units and the seabed inliers and outliers may again be via a data transmission line or may be by acoustic transmission as described earlier.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Data transmission from platform-mounted sensor units is preferably via a data transmission line to the platform.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">It will generally be preferable, wherever possible, to use (e.g. piggy-back upon) communication<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> infrastructure that is already in place for data transmission from the sensor units, especially the seabed units, for example optical fibres or power transmission lines.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Transmitted data is preferably collected at the platform for analysis there or for transmission, e.g. by radio, to a remote computer, e.g. at an onshore facility.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The sensor units are preferably wholly or partially dismountable, e.g. using ROVs or AUVs, for replacement of sensors, e.g. for analysis at remote locations as discussed above.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Data analysis and signal/indicia generation may be effected analogously to data analysis for the surface-platform-free well facilities discussed above.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The sensor units, as mentioned above, may include acoustic sensors such as hydrophones.

Likewise, if monitoring according to the invention is for a limited period only, e.g. during a high risk operation, determination of contamination levels before and after the monitoring period may more effectively pinpoint contamination events occurring during monitoring. Such contamination determination may<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> of course be effected with sentinel species and/or by chemical analysis in situ or at a remote location (e.g. a laboratory) and/or by determination of biological effect at such a remote location.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Desirably the data collected by the methods of the invention are correlated to the same time-line so as to improve the cause/effect analysis.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">By well facility, it should be noted, is meant herein a facility having a hydrocarbon well in preparation, in operation, or in shutdown mode.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In an especially preferred embodiment, the data set for analysis according to the invention includes weather data and vessel movement data, e.g. data supplied to the analyser by an external source such as a weather bureau or a shipping monitoring bureau, or data collected at the offshore installation using conventional weather monitoring devices (for example for wind speed, air temperature, air pressure, humidity, visibility, light intensity, etc) or vessel detection apparatus, e.g. radar. In this way, causes of variation in the sensor signals which are extraneous to the operation of the offshore installation may more easily be identified and the frequency of "false positive" alerts reduced.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described by reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
