mxw-id="PDES63960681" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b><u>BACKGROUND</u></b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">Adhesives are used in many applications, including consumer, industrial, and medical applications. Although some adhesives are intended to form a permanent or semi-permanent bond with the items to which they are applied, many adhesives are used in less permanent applications. The latter type of adhesives are often used in applications in which an article is to be affixed to something else and later removed. An example is the common adhesive bandage strip, which is intended to stick to the skin until the wearer wishes to remove the bandage strip.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">A problem with the adhesives that are used in temporary applications is that the adhesive may still adhere well to an object to which it has been applied when the time for removal has arrived. For example, in the case of an adhesive bandage strip, such<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> adhesion can make it more difficult to remove the bandage strip and therefore may cause discomfort to the wearer. Although such discomfort may be relatively mild, the discomfort from removal of other types of bandages can be much greater. For example, removal of medical tape that secures dressings to the skin of a burn patient can not only cause the patient a great deal of pain, but further cause tissue damage.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">The disclosed adhesives can be better understood with reference to the following drawings.

Moreover, in cases in which the article is a bandage and the object is a patient, pain and/or tissue damage can occur from such removal. Described in the following are adhesives that lose much of their adhesive strength when a solvent is applied. Therefore, such adhesives can be used in applications in which selective release of the adhesive or an article to which the adhesive is applied is desired. In some embodiments, the adhesive comprises poly(glycerol-sebacate) and the solvent comprises an alcohol. Example applications for the adhesives include use in glues and adhesive tapes or bandages.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the following, various embodiments of adhesives and articles that incorporate adhesives are described. Although specific embodiments are presented, those embodiments are mere exemplary implementations and, therefore, other embodiments<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> are possible. All such embodiments are intended to fall within the scope of this disclosure.</p><heading id="h0004"><i><u>Adhesive Compound Synthesis and Characteristics</u></i></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Referring now to the figures, in which like reference numerals identify corresponding features, <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates an adhesive compound or polymer 10, referred to herein simply as "adhesive." As indicated in that figure, the adhesive 10 includes a polymer backbone 12 and a plurality of chemical bonds including hydrogen bonds 14 and covalent bonds 16. As is apparent from <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, there are a relatively large number of hydrogen bonds 14 as compared to covalent bonds 16.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In some embodiments, the adhesive 10 comprises a copolymer formed from a multifunctional alcohol and a multifunctional carboxylic acid. As used herein, the term "multifunctional alcohol" refers to any alcohol that has two or more hydroxyl (-OH) groups, and the term "multifunctional carboxylic acid" refers to any carboxylic acid that has two or more acid (-COOH) groups. Example multifunctional alcohols include glycerol, monomeric carbohydrates such as glucose and mannose, and small polyols such as oligo (vinyl alcohol). Example multifunctional carboxylic acids include diacids such as sebacic acid, succinic acid, oxylic acid, and malic acid, and triacids such as citric acid. One example of such a copolymer is poly(glycerol-sebacate) or "PGS." An example of synthesis of PGS is described in the following several paragraphs.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The sebacic acid used to prepare the PGS can be rigorously purified prior to synthesis of the PGS to improve the quality of the resultant polymer. Such purification can be performed by combining a relatively small amount of sebacic acid with a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> relatively large amount of ethanol and heating the mixture until the sebacic acid completely dissolves. Once the sebacic acid has dissolved, the hot sebacic acid solution can be filtered under a vacuum and the filtrate can be refrigerated for several hours to enable crystallization. The sebacic acid crystals are then collected and intermittently filtered under vacuum to collect the crystals. After the completion of the filtration, the above process (dissolution, crystallization, and filtration) can be repeated multiple times (e.g., 3-4 times) to ensure a high level of purification. Thereafter, the air-dried sebacic acid crystals can be heated under a vacuum to remove any residual ethanol or moisture.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Once the sebacic acid has been purified, it can be used to synthesize PGS. Such synthesis can be accomplished through melt polycondensation of an approximately 0.5:1.0 to 1.5:1.0 molar ratio of glycerol to purified sebacic acid at an elevated temperature, such as approximately 120°C. In some embodiments, an equimolar amount (i.e., a 1.0:1.0 ratio) of glycerol and sebacic acid may be used. The reaction can, for example, be carried out under nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>) flow. The mixture can be stirred and water distilled from the reaction can be trapped and removed. The compound that results is a prepolymer of glycerol and sebacic acid, i.e., PGS prepolymer. As used herein, the term "prepolymer" describes the polymer prior to curing. Accordingly, the prepolymer exhibits no crosslinking. -</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">After the PGS prepolymer has been synthesized, it can be transformed into the PGS polymer using a curing process. In some embodiments, the prepolymer is first mixed with solvent to form a solution that can be sprayed on a suitable non-stick substrate. Once the solvent evaporates, a film of PGS prepolymer remains on the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> substrate that can be cured in an oven over a period of several hours. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the chemical structure of an embodiment of a resultant PGS polymer 18, and the hydrogen bonding that occurs between chains of the polymer.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The duration of time over which the prepolymer is cured (i.e., the cure time) directly affects the physical characteristics of the resultant polymer, including its adhesive strength. This is apparent from the graph of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>. As indicated in that graph, maximum adhesive strength was achieved for a preparation of PGS synthesized in the manner described above after approximately 9 hours of curing at approximately 120°C and 100 milliTorr (mTorr). Specifically, testing of PGS adhesive tape (i.e., a substrate comprising a layer PGS) in accordance with ASTM D3330-78 PSTC-1 (using a reduced peel speed of 3.8 millimeters per second (mm/s)) revealed that the greatest peel strength occurred when the PGS adhesive was cured for approximately 9 hours at approximately 120°C and 100 mTorr.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Unexpectedly, the strength of the adhesive, as exhibited by the peel strength, increases as the adhesive is cured, at least until the 9 hour mark, suggesting that the strongest adhesive is obtained when some, but relatively little, crosslinking occurs. This may be due to the fact that crosslinking increases the cohesiveness of the adhesive, which reduces separation of the adhesive from itself and, to a point, increases adhesive strength. In view of this, a cure time at or near 9 hours at a temperature of 120°C and a pressure of approximately 100 mTorr may be preferable for some applications. Notably, that cure time is significantly smaller and that vacuum is significantly weaker than that used to form other PGS polymers, such as the "bio-rubber" disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20030118692A"><text>U.S. Patent Publication Number 2003/0118692 of Wang et al.</text></patcit> In<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> that patent application, a non-adhesive elastomer is described as being formed by curing a PGS prepolymer for 48 hours at 40 mTorr and 120°C.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In addition to affecting adhesive strength, the shorter curing time and weaker vacuum also affect the chemical structure of the resulting polymer. For example, when the PGS prepolymer is cured for a relatively short period of time, such 20 hours or less, the resulting PGS polymer has a relatively large number of hydrogen bonds, which are particularly beneficial to obtaining good adhesion of human skin. Furthermore, as mentioned above, cure time affects the degree of crosslinking that results.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The crosslink density of PGS polymer was quantified using two different approaches. In a first "equilibrium swelling" approach, PGS samples were mixed with tetrahydofuran (THF). The samples were placed into sealed vials to minimize solvent evaporation. Each day, the excess THF on the surfaces of the samples was removed and the samples were weighed to gauge the extent of the swelling until no significant weight increase was observed, typically after about 3 days. At the end of that time period, the samples were blotted using filter paper and again weighed to determine for each sample the mass of the swollen network at equilibrium, <i>m<sub>eq</sub>.</i> The samples were then dried in a vacuum oven at 25°C for 1 week to determine the mass of the dried network after extraction of the solvent, <i>m<sub>d</sub>.</i> Swelling was then calculated as a swelling percentage using the following relation: <maths id="math0001" num="[Equation 1]"><math display="block"><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>m</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">eq</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>m</mi><mi>d</mi></msub></mrow><msub><mi>m</mi><mi>d</mi></msub></mfrac></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="154" he="16" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The crosslink density was then calculated using the Flory-Rehner expression for tetra-functional affine network as expressed by: <maths id="math0002" num="[Equation 2]"><math display="block"><mi>υ</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>ln</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mfenced separators=""><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>υ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mfenced><mo>+</mo><mi>υ</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>χ</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msubsup><mi mathvariant="normal">ν</mi><mn>2</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow><mrow><msub><mi>υ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mfenced separators=""><mfenced separators=""><msub><mi>υ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mfenced><mo>-</mo><msubsup><mi>υ</mi><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msubsup></mfenced></mrow></mfrac></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="154" he="26" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>

where υ is the strand density, υ<sub>1</sub> is the molar volume of the solvent, υ<sub>2</sub> is the volume fraction of the polymer at equilibrium swelling, χ is the polymer-solvent interaction parameter (i.e., the Flory-Huggins parameter, χ = 0.42), ρ<i><sub>1</sub></i> is the density of the polymer (i.e., 1.15 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), and ρ<i><sub>2</sub></i> is the density of the solvent (i.e., 0.889 g/cm<sup>3</sup>).

As is apparent from <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, cure times in the range of approximately 6 to 12 hours yield polymers having the greatest adhesive strength, with the maximum adhesive strength being exhibited for cure times of approximately 8 to 10 hours (e.g., 9 hours). Adhesives cured within those ranges of time may possess crosslink densities of approximately 0 to 0.5 moles per liter (mol/L) and/or approximately 0 to 4 percent. Maximum adhesive strength may be achieved with adhesives having crosslink densities of approximately 0.01 to 0.04 mol/L and/or approximately 1 to 3 percent. While particular cure times have been identified, it is noted that cure time is dependent upon other parameters, such as temperature, pressure, and sample size. Therefore, equivalent degrees of curing may be achieved in greater or lesser time depending upon those other parameters when curing is performed.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As mentioned above, the adhesive strength of the disclosed adhesive can be selectively reduced through the application of a solvent. Suitable solvents include alcohols, such as ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, and 1-butanol; ketones, such as acetone, and methyl ethyl ketone; ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether;<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> amides, such as N,N-dimethyl foramide; sulfoxides, such as dimethyl sulfoxide; and esters, such as ethyl acetate. The effectiveness of ethanol, 2-propanol, acetone, and methyl ethyl ketone are exhibited in the graph of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>. The results from that graph were obtained using the same ASTM procedure identified above 10 seconds after the various solvents were sprayed onto PGS tape samples. As can be appreciated from <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>, a 70/30 solution of ethanol and water and a 70/30 solution of 2-propanol and water both reduce the peel strength of PGS tape by more than 95%, while acetone and methyl ethyl ketone reduce the peel strength by more than 98%. Therefore, application of an appropriate solvent dramatically reduces the adhesiveness of the adhesive so that it possesses very little adhesive strength. Notably, the loss in adhesive strength occurs rapidly typically example within a few seconds. As a consequence of characteristics, the adhesive or an article to which the adhesive has been applied, such as medical tape or a bandage strip, can be removed with very little force, and therefore very little discomfort and/or tissue damage, once the solvent has been applied.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A mechanism with which release of the adhesive may be achieved is depicted in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGs. 5A and 5B. FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates bonding of the adhesive 18 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> to skin 20 prior to application of a solvent. As indicated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5A</figref>, hydrogen bonding interactions occur between the adhesive 18 and the skin 20. <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates the adhesive 18 and the skin 20 after the introduction of ethanol. As indicated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5B</figref>, ethanol molecules 22 swell the adhesive 18 and form hydrogen bonds with both the adhesive and the skin 20, thereby interfering with bonding of the adhesive to the skin. In addition, the swelling of the adhesive 18 reduces the cohesiveness of the polymer and results in easier removal of the adhesive from the skin.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In at least some embodiments, the adhesive strength of the selectively-releasable adhesive is recoverable. Specifically, the original adhesive strength of the adhesive returns after the applied solvent evaporates. Such results are shown in the graph of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6</figref>, which illustrates peel strength of PGS tape both before application of a 70% ethanol solution (i.e., time = 0) and multiple times thereafter. As can be appreciated from <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6</figref>, although peel strength is dramatically reduced 5 minutes after application of the ethanol solution, the peel strength nearly returns to initial levels after 30 minutes.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In some embodiments, the adhesiveness of the selectively-releasable adhesive naturally degrades over time while exposed to moisture. Such degradation can be avoided or reduced by either storing the adhesive in a moisture-free environment, such as in a vacuum or in a water-free gas. For example, testing has shown that when PGS tape is stored in a weak vacuum of approximately 12 Torr or stored in N<sub>2</sub>, the tape exhibited no reduction in peel strength for at least 60 days. Therefore, it may be desirable to store articles to which the selectively-releasable adhesive is applied in sealed packages under vacuum and/or that contain an inert gas until the time of use. Once exposed, the adhesive maintains much of its adhesive strength for at least a week.</p><heading id="h0005"><i><u>Example of Adhesive Synthesis</u></i></heading><p id="p0024" num="0024">Samples of PGS adhesive were synthesized in a laboratory by adding 100 grams (g) of sebacic acid to a 2 L round bottom flask along with 1 L of 95/5 blend of ethanol and water. The flask was heated in a 55°C water bath until the sebacic acid completely<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> dissolved.

The next day, sebacic acid crystals were collected with a 0.22 µm filtration setup under a vacuum. The crystals were maintained under the vacuum and intermittently stirred for 3 to 4 days until the ethanol evaporated.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The above process was then repeated multiple times and the air-dried sebacic acid crystals were transferred to a 2 L glass beaker that was placed in a vacuum oven. A vacuum was applied until the oven reached a full vacuum of 90 to 100 mTorr, and then the oven was set to temperature to 60°C, which was arrived at in 1°C/min steps. The sebacic acid crystals were then maintained at 60°C for a period of 16 hours.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Once the sebacic acid was purified in the manner described above, it was used to synthesize the PGS by melt polycondensation. Equimolar amounts of glycerol (34.45 g) and purified sebacic acid (75 g) were heated to approximately 120°C in a 500 milliliter (ml) three-neck flask equipped with a Dean-Stark trap under N<sub>2</sub> flow. The mixture was stirred at atmospheric pressure with a 1 1/4 inch x 5/8 inch, egg-shaped stir bar having a weight of 15.5 g at stir rate of approximately 500 revolutions per minute (rpm). Water was collected in the trap during the stirring. Once no more water collected in the trap, a vacuum was gradually applied over approximately one hour until the pressure stabilized at approximately 100 mTorr to 150 mTorr. The reaction was permitted to progress until the maximum stir rate was reduced to approximately 10 rpm (after approximately 72-90 hours). At that point, the mixture was a PGS prepolymer.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The PGS prepolymer was then was dissolved in THF to form a 30% PGS solution and the solution was sprayed onto wax paper.
