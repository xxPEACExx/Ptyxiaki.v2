In a cellular system, radio coverage is provided to user equipment, for example, mobile telephones, by areas known as cells. A base station is located in each cell to provide the radio coverage. User equipment in each cell receives information and data from the base station and transmits information and data to the base station.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Information and data transmitted by the base station to the user equipment occurs on channels of radio carriers known as downlink carriers. Information and data transmitted by user equipment to the base station occurs on uplink data channels of radio carriers known as uplink carriers.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In known single uplink carrier wireless telecommunications systems, user equipment transmits data to the base station in packets.

<ul><li>determining power allocatable between each of said carriers;</li><li>for each carrier:
<ul><li>receiving an indication representative of an estimated power requirement associated with sending data on said data channel of that carrier;</li><li>receiving an indication representative of an estimated data throughput associated with sending data on said data channel of that carrier;</li><li>generating, from a ratio of the estimated data throughput to the estimated power requirement, a value, for said data channel of that carrier, representative of an estimated potential throughput of data per unit of power allocated to said data channel of that carrier; and</li><li>allocating power to the data channel of each carrier in accordance with a scheduled carrier fill order determined based on a comparison of the generated values, the carrier having the largest generated value being scheduled to be filled first, the carrier having the smallest generated value being scheduled to be filled last, until all power has been allocated.</li></ul></li></ul></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The first aspect recognises that in a wireless telecommunications network it is possible to increase uplink data throughput by allowing user equipment to transmit in two or more carriers. A wireless telecommunications network allowing for user equipment to transmit on two or more carriers is known as a "multi-carrier" network. In such a multi-carrier wireless telecommunications network it is likely that user equipment will be required to share a single power source between the two or more carriers.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Such multi carrier wireless telecommunications networks may provide two carriers, and may be referred to as a 'Dual Cell High Speed Uplink Packet Access' (DC-HSUPA) network. Networks having more than two carriers may be referred to as 'Multi Cell High Speed Uplink Packet Access' (MC-HSUPA) networks. The term 'multi carrier network' used herein is envisaged to cover both DC-HSUPA and MC-HSUPA networks.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Typically each carrier in a multi carrier network will be independently power controlled. Furthermore, each carrier will typically experience different radio condition and will have different resources scheduled by a base station. The radio condition experienced by a carrier tends to be indicative of any environmental advantages being experienced by a radio signal having that particular carrier frequency. Resources<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> scheduled by a base station to a particular carrier offer some indication of the status of broader conditions being experienced by the wireless telecommunications network on that carrier in a particular cell.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In order for a multi-carrier wireless telecommunications network to function efficiently, it is necessary to consider how best to allocate limited available transmit power amongst carriers. As described previously, the available user equipment transmit power is typically limited.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In particular, it is necessary to try to ensure efficient data throughput from user equipment to the base station is achieved. In arrangements where limited power is available and power demands of all available carriers provided on a piece of user equipment cannot be met, it will be necessary to determine how best to allocate the limited available transmit power between the carriers to achieve efficient data throughput to the base station.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The first aspect is particularly relevant to allocation of available transmit power to physical data uplink channels in a multi carrier wireless telecommunications network.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Allocation of available power in accordance with the method of the first aspect aims to ensure that power is allocated to a carrier in accordance with an estimate of potential throughput of data per unit of power allocated to said data channel of that carrier. Such an approach can improve total data throughput achieved in a cell, or a sector by a base station.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">It is possible to allocate available power to each carrier in accordance with a carrier fill order based only on an indication representative of an estimated power requirement associated with sending data on said data channel of that carrier. Such a method assumes that, because the power "cost" of sending data on a data channel of that carrier is low, it is likely to be the best choice of carrier on which to send data to a base station. Such an approach may work well in multi-carrier wireless communication networks in which data traffic is equally balanced across all carriers, but in the event that the network is unbalanced, may lead to an overall drop in data throughput. An unbalanced network is one in which the majority of data traffic in a network cell served by a base station occurs on one carrier. In such a case, many items of user equipment all transmit data to the base station on the data channel of one carrier. As a result, signal to noise ratio on that heavily loaded carrier is likely to drop across the network<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> cell and the potential data throughput associated with sending data to the base station on said data channel of that carrier also drops.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In other words, using a "cost" method does not work well in an unbalanced network because in an unbalanced network, a carrier having the lowest Target Noise Rise (or noise level tolerance) would result in all user equipment needing a low power on that carrier to overcome the noise level. Given a pilot channel (also known as a 'Dedicated Physical Control Channel' or DPCCH) is power controlled to a target Signal to Noise Ratio, and the noise level is low in this carrier, the pilot would need less power for it to get through to a base station. For a carrier with high Target Noise Rise, a pilot needs to transmit at a higher power to get through to the base station. Since the "cost" based method selects the carrier with the lowest pilot power, this carrier (with the lowest Target Noise Rise) will more likely to be selected to be filled first than the other carriers. Giving as much power as possible to first chosen carrier results in that carrier (the one with the lowest Target Noise Rise) being allocated lots of available transmit power. If this is done by all user equipment this would lead to high noise rise at the base station. In order to maintain a low target Noise Rise the base station reduces the "grants" to each user equipment. The "Serving Grant" to each user equipment reduces in order for the base station to maintain its low target Noise Rise. Since "serving grant" represents the throughput, reducing "serving grant" reduces overall cell throughput. Since, in this method, most power is given to the lowest transmit pilot carrier (i.e. likely the one with the lowest target Noise Rise), the other carriers are allocated less power even though they may have a high "serving grant". This results in overall drop in sector throughput</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In contrast, an allocation method in accordance with the first aspect recognises that receiving an indication representative of an estimated power requirement associated with sending data on said data channel of that carrier; and receiving an indication representative of an estimated data throughput associated with sending data on said data channel of that carrier; allows the generation of a value, for said data channel of that carrier, representative of an estimated potential throughput of data per unit of power allocated to said data channel of that carrier. That generated value takes into account both power "cost" and the potential data throughput possible on a data channel of a carrier, thereby offering an indication of "value" that may be achieved in allocating some or all of the available power to a particular carrier.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In receiving an indication representative of an estimated power requirement associated with sending data on said data channel of that carrier, it may be that the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> indication is determined from information previously known, derived, determined or received.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">It will be appreciated that the power allocatable between the carriers may not be sufficient to meet the needs of all of the carriers. Taking into account the estimated potential throughput of data per unit of power allocated to the data channel of each carrier aims to ensure that the limited available power is allocated in a way that aims to maximise data throughput.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In one embodiment, each carrier further comprises a pilot channel and the indication representative of an estimated power requirement associated with sending data on the data channel of that carrier is determined from a power level pre-allocated to the pilot channel.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A pilot channel is also known as a 'dedicated physical control channel' or 'DPCCH'. The channels on which data is transmitted are known as 'Enhanced Dedicated Physical Data Channels' or 'E-DPDCH'.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The general operation of the carriers of user equipment are typically controlled by the user equipment based upon information and signals received from a base station. The pilot channel of a carrier acts as a dedicated physical control channel and is necessary to maintain contact between user equipment and a base station. The power allocated to the pilot channel is determined by the user equipment based on information received from the base station. The overall power control between user equipment and a base station to set the pilot channel of a carrier is known as "inner loop" power control. The inner loop power control process determines and pre-allocates a power level, from a user equipment power source, to each carrier independently.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">If user equipment is close to the base station, or a carrier is experiencing a particularly advantageous radio transmission environment, the power pre-allocated to the pilot channel of that carrier will typically be relatively low. The power allocated to other channels provided on a carrier are typically controlled in relation to the pilot channel. It will thus be understood that the power level pre-allocated to the pilot channel by the inner loop power control process is likely to be representative of an estimated power requirement associated with sending data on the data channel of that carrier. That is to say, if a low power has been pre-allocated to the pilot channel of a carrier, a low power is required to maintain contact between that carrier and a base station. As a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> consequence, it is likely that carrier is experiencing an advantageous radio transmission environment and therefore that the power required to send data on that carrier will also be low.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In one embodiment, the indication representative of an estimated data throughput associated with sending data on the data channel of that carrier comprises an indication of a potential data transport block size transmittable on the data channel.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">A rate at which a data channel is allowed to send packets of data to a base station from user equipment is typically pre-set in a wireless telecommunications network. A large potential data transport block size is thus indicative of a large data throughput from user equipment to the base station.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In one embodiment, the indication representative of an estimated data throughput associated with sending data on the data channel of that carrier comprises an indication of signal to noise ratio experienced on that carrier by the wireless telecommunications network.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The signal to noise ratio being experienced by a carrier is indicative of a potential data loss rate on a data channel of that carrier. A large signal to noise ratio indicates that the potential data loss rate on a carrier is low. It is therefore likely that the data throughput on a data channel of that carrier will be high.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In one embodiment, the step of receiving an indication of a potential data transport block size transmittable on the data channel comprises the step of:
<ul><li>receiving an indication of maximum potential data throughput associated with sending data on the data channel of that carrier.</li></ul></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In a wireless telecommunications network a base station typically communicates with user equipment. The base station transmits an indication of the resource scheduled to each carrier of user equipment. Scheduled resource is usually expressed as a "grant" or "serving grant" for each carrier. A serving grant is calculated as a ratio of maximum allowed transmit power on a data channel of a carrier to the power level pre-allocated to the pilot channel of that carrier by the inner loop power control process. The serving grant therefore offers an indication of maximum potential data throughput associated with sending data on the data channel of a carrier. By multiplying the serving grant by the pre-allocated power level to the pilot channel of that channel it is possible to<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> calculate the power allocation required to meet the maximum potential data throughput on the data channel of that carrier.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In one embodiment, the step of receiving an indication of a potential data transport block size transmittable on the data channel comprises the steps of:
<ul><li>receiving an indication of maximum potential data throughput associated with sending data on the data channel of that carrier;</li><li>calculating an estimated power allocation required to meet the estimated maximum potential data throughput on the data channel of that carrier; and</li><li>determining the extent to which the calculated estimated power allocation required to meet the estimated maximum potential data throughput can be filled by the power allocatable between each of the carriers.</li></ul></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As described above, in a wireless telecommunications network it is possible to calculate an indication of power required to meet the maximum potential data throughput associated with sending data on the data channel of each carrier from information regarding the serving grant issued to user equipment by a base station. Since the allocatable power of user equipment is limited, it may be that the allocatable power cannot meet the power required to meet the maximum potential data throughput on a data channel of a particular carrier, even if no further carriers were present. Calculation of the extent to which the calculated estimated power allocation required to meet the estimated maximum potential data throughput can be filled by the power allocatable between each of the carriers allows a more realistic indication representative of an estimated data throughput associated with sending data on said data channel of that carrier to be calculated. In turn, this allows a more realistic representation of estimated potential throughput of data per unit of power allocated to a data channel of that carrier to be generated.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In one embodiment, allocation of power to the data channel of each carrier in accordance with a scheduled carrier fill order is pseudorandom between those carriers for which the generated values are identical.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Arranging for the carrier fill order to be pseudorandom in the instance that generated values are identical can help to ensure that one carrier of the carriers provided in a wireless telecommunication network does not become unnecessarily loaded.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In one embodiment, the steps of the method of the first aspect are periodically repeated.

User equipment 44 roam through the wireless communication system 10. Base stations 22 are provided which support respective macro cells 24. A number of such base stations are provided, which are distributed geographically in order to provide a wide area of coverage to the user equipment 44. When user equipment 44 is within a macro cell 24 supported by the base station 22 then communications may be established between the user equipment 44 and the base station 22 over an associated radio link.

The user equipment 44 comprises generally: controller logic 100; four carriers 110, 120, 130 and 140; a data store 150; and a power source 180. The controller logic 100 is described in more detail below in relation to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Each carrier 110, 120, 130, 140 comprises a number of channels including a pilot channel and a physical data channel. The physical data channel of each carrier is used to transmit data to the base station 22.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0062" num="0062">The data store 150 contains data to be sent to the base station 22 on the physical data channels of each of the carriers. The power source 180 supplies power to allow the user equipment 44 to function. A portion of power available from the power source 180 is allocatable to the carriers for transmission of data on their data channels. Uplink data channels 210, 220, 230, 240 allow data to be transmitted from user equipment 44 to the base station 22.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">As described. above, the radio network controller 170 controls the operation of the wireless communications system 10 by communicating with the base station 22 over a backhaul communications link 160. The network controller 170 also communicates indirectly with the user equipment 44 via a radio link 200 from the base station 22. The base station thus cooperates with the network controller and user equipment in order to efficiently manage the wireless communication system 10.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The general, operation of the carriers 110, 120, 130, 140 of user equipment 44 is controlled by the user equipment controller logic 100 based upon information and signals received from base station 22. The pilot channel of each carrier acts as a dedicated physical control channel and is necessary to maintain contact between user equipment 44 and base station 22. The power allocated to the pilot channel of each carrier is determined by the user equipment controller logic 100 based on information received from the base station via radio link 200. The control process between user equipment 44 and a base station 22 sets the level of overall power allocated to the pilot channel of each carrier is known as "inner loop" power control. The inner loop power control pre-allocates power from power source 180 to each carrier. The power level pre-allocated to each carrier occurs independently. That is to say, the power pre-allocated to each carrier is independent from the power pre-allocated to each other carrier.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">"Outer Loop" power control operates at the RNC 170 and acts to set a target Signal to Noise Ratio. The inner loop power control tries to maintain the target Signal to Noise Ratio set by the outer loop power control.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">If user equipment 44 is close to the base station, or a carrier is experiencing a particularly advantageous radio transmission environment, the power pre-allocated to the pilot channel of that carrier will typically be quite low. The power allocated to all other channels provided on a carrier, including the uplink data channel are typically controlled in relation to the pilot channel. If a low power has been pre-allocated to the pilot channel of a carrier, a low power is required to maintain contact between that<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> carrier and a base station. It will thus be understood that the power level pre-allocated to the pilot channel by the inner loop power control process is likely to be representative of an estimated power requirement associated with sending data on the data channel of that carrier.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The base station 22 also communicates with user equipment 44 to indicate how much resource is scheduled to each carrier. The base station 22 transmits, over radio link 200, a signal indicative of the resource scheduled to each carrier of the user equipment. That signal is received and processed by controller logic 100. Scheduled resource is usually expressed as a "serving grant" for each carrier. A serving grant is calculated as a ratio of maximum allowed transmit power on a data channel of a carrier to the power level pre-allocated to the pilot channel of that carrier by the inner loop power control process. The serving grant therefore offers an indication of maximum potential data throughput associated with sending data on the data channel of a carrier. By multiplying the serving grant of a channel by the pre-allocated power level to the pilot channel of that channel it is possible to calculate the power allocation required to meet the maximum potential data throughput on the data channel of that carrier.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">It can be seen from <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> that the controller logic 100 receives signals from base station 22, data store 150 and power source 180. The controller logic processes the information received from those sources and controls operation of each of the carriers 110, 120, 130, 140 in accordance with that information. In particular, the controller logic 100 is operable to allocate power to the data channels of the carriers in accordance with a method in accordance with a first aspect such that power can be allocated to transmit data on uplink data channels 210, 220, 230, 240.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> is a flowchart showing schematically the main processing steps 300 for allocating power to a data channel in a multi-carrier wireless telecommunications network in accordance with one aspect.

The first signal can be used to generate a value A, which comprises an indication an representative of an estimated power requirement associated with sending data on a data channel of that carrier.
