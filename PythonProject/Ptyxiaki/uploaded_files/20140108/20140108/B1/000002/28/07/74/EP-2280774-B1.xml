mxw-id="PDES63960381" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a fluid treatment apparatus, and in particular, but not exclusively, to an apparatus for treating water produced from a subterranean hydrocarbon bearing formation. The present invention also relates to a method of treating a fluid.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The fluids produced from subterranean reservoirs are typically a mixture of oil, water, gas, normally with a quantity of sand. In the early stages of production the fluids may be "dry", i.e., containing little or no water, but as production continues it is normal for greater quantities of water to be produced. In mature fields the proportion of water in the produced fluids can reach 90% and possibly around 95%. Reservoirs do not always produce large quantities of sand but when they do the sand production generally increases as the water production increases. The water produced from the reservoir is termed "produced water".</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The produced water may be injected back into the formation or it may be discharged into the environment; for example, in off-shore production areas the water may be discharged into the sea. However, the produced water must be thoroughly treated in order to remove substantially all traces of oil and gas prior to being discharged into the environment in order to meet extremely strict environmental regulations.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In conventional production operations the produced fluid from the reservoir is initially treated to separate the saleable oil and gas from the un-saleable water and sand. However, the separated water will typically still contain unacceptable quantities of oil and gas and as such is normally subject to a secondary treatment to further reduce the concentration of hydrocarbons to acceptable levels for discharge to the environment or injection back into the formation.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A process known as "flotation" in commonly used to assist in the removal of oil and other contaminants from water. The principle of flotation is that bubbles of gas are introduced into (e.g., Induced Gas Floatation) or are established in (e.g., Dissolved Gas Floatation) a vessel containing a contaminated water, in which the bubbles will to a greater or lesser degree attach to the contaminants, such as oil droplets, and drag them to the surface of the water, leaving the bulk of the water depleted of contaminants, and the upper layers of the water enriched with contaminants. In subsequent discussions, each volume of water to which gas<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> bubbles are added or are created to separate contaminants may be referred to as a "cell" or "flotation cell".</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Flotation is usually operated as a continuous process, where there is a continuous inflow of contaminated water into the cell and a continual outflow of contaminant enriched water drawn from the surface layers of the cell and a continual outflow of the contaminant depleted water from the cell at a rate so as to maintain an essentially constant level in the vessel.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is usual for the contaminants floated to the surface of the water to be retained in a froth which is either formed naturally when the contaminants are present at the higher concentrations found at the water surface, or with the assistance of chemicals which are added to the inflowing liquid. Buoyant contaminants, for example droplets of oil, may not need to be frothed to keep them at the surface.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The contaminants on the water surface may be removed by a variety of means, the two most common being weirs set slightly below the water surface so that the contaminant enriched surface layer preferentially flows over them, or paddles which sweep the contaminant enriched surface layer over a weir which is normally set slightly above the water surface. A number of designs of floating skimming devices are also known which have the advantage that they can tolerate a wider variation in operating liquid level than either of the aforementioned fixed weir methods can accommodate.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In Induced Gas Floatation (IGF) methods, gas bubbles are typically added to the contaminated water by eductors or mechanical mixers. An IGF cell must be mixed to bring the gas bubbles into intimate contact with the contaminants, such as oil droplets, so that they can be separated by them, but this mixing has the side effects of making it more difficult for the bubbles to rise to the surface, and causing variation in the residence time of parcels of water within the cell. While the average residence time in the cell can be determined by the volume of the cell and the water flowrate, the mixing can mean that some parcels of water pass through the cell in a much shorter time than is required for good separation, and conversely some parcels of water may reside in the cell much longer than the average residence time.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The necessity to have mixing in the cell to contact the gas bubbles and contaminants reduces the efficiency of separation in the cell. For this reason IGF vessels are commonly horizontal vessels which contain a plurality of IGF cells in series, typically four, so that the overall efficiency of the separation is increased. Examples of known IGF systems of this type are shown in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4564457A"><text>US 4,564,457</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20060213840A"><text>US 2006/0213840</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US3972815A"><text>US 3,972,815</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US3647069A"><text>US 3,647,069</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US5348648A"><text>US 5,348,648</text></patcit>.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Nevertheless, in some applications vertical single stage cell flotation units are known, which have a single IGF cell which typically has a cell volume, and hence residence time, somewhat larger than would be found in the four cells of a tyicall horizontal IGF unit. Examples of such IGF arrangements are shown in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO2004112936A"><text>WO 2004/112936</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US5011597A"><text>US 5,011,597</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">It is understood that an IGF unit requires the fluid to reside within the vessel for a period sufficient to allow floatation of the oil and separation of the gas. However, increasing residence time will directly reduce the maximum fluid treatment rate which can be achieved. It may be possible to address this issue by increasing the size of the IGF unit but this is not desired due to the restricted available space in conventional production environments.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">It is desirable to reduce the space occupied by, and weight of, equipment installed on offshore platforms, and for this reason compact floatation units have been proposed in the art for treating produced water with minimal plant footprint. For example, prior art reference <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="WO0241965A"><text>WO 02/41965</text></patcit> discloses a vertically arranged vessel which receives fluid to be treated via a tangentially arranged fluid inlet. Arranging the fluid inlet in this manner establishes rotation of the fluid within the vessel which is alleged to assist coalescence of oil and gas bubbles and floatation to the surface. The vessel may incorporate a spiralling guide vane to enhance fluid rotation.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="WO0241965A"><text>WO 02/41965</text></patcit> the vessel is operated at a low pressure to permit dissolved gas to evolve from the water phase and create gas bubbles in the zone adjacent the fluid inlet to mimic the effect of IGF units. However, if an insufficient volume of gas is present in the fluid then additional gas may be added to the fluid.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="EP1400492A"><text>EP 1 400 492</text></patcit> also discloses a compact floatation unit which comprises a vertically arranged vessel with one or more tangential fluid inlets to encourage fluid rotation. In <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="EP1400492A"><text>EP 1 400 492</text></patcit> the vessel also includes tangentially arranged fluid/sparge gas inlets. These inlets communicate gassined water into the vessel.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Other techniques for treating fluids by the use of gas bubbles include cascade floatation techniques, in which fluid to be treated is passed through eductors into containers, in a cascading fashion. Examples of such techniques are disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="US1311919A"><text>US 1,311,919</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="US1380665A"><text>US 1,380,665</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0014" dnum="US4406782A"><text>US 4,406,782</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><patcit id="pcit0015" dnum="US4986903A"><text>US 4,986,903</text></patcit> discloses a floatation apparatus for separating oil from water. The disclosed apparatus includes separate gasification and degasification chambers. Gasified water is introduced into the gasification chamber via a gas eductor. Recirculation of fluid to be gasified is possible between the degasification chamber and the gasification chamber through recirculation line 70 and the gas eductor 40.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">It is among objects of the present invention to obviate or mitigate one or more problems in the prior art.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a fluid treatment apparatus comprising:
<ul><li>a fluid vessel;</li><li>first and second fluid chambers defined within the fluid vessel;</li><li>a fluid inlet for delivering a fluid to be treated into the first fluid chamber; and</li><li>at least one nozzle assembly for providing fluid communication from the first fluid chamber to the second fluid chamber, wherein said nozzle assembly is adapted to facilitate mixing of a gas with said fluid.</li></ul></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The at least one nozzle assembly may facilitate entrainment of a gas into said fluid. Alternatively, or additionally, the at least one nozzle assembly may facilitate injection, commingling or delivery of a gas into said fluid. However, for brevity of the present summary of the invention, the general concept of mixing gas with or delivery of a gas into the fluid being treated shall generally be referred to as entrainment.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The apparatus may be adapted to treat a fluid containing multiple components, which components may comprise any one or a combination of liquids, gases and solids. For example, the fluid may comprise a water/oil mixture, water/oil/gas mixture or the like.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The first fluid chamber may be adapted to receive the fluid to be treated and distribute this fluid into the second fluid chamber, with entrained gas, to be treated therein. The first fluid chamber may therefore define a distribution chamber and the second chamber may define a treatment chamber.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The second fluid chamber may be adapted to accommodate a separation treatment of the fluid therein. The separation treatment may be adapted to effect separation of components of the fluid, such as components of different densities, chemistries, phases or the like. Advantageously, the gas entrained into the fluid entering the second chamber may enhance fluid separation. The separation treatment may comprise a floatation separation treatment.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In one embodiment the second fluid chamber may be adapted to accommodate a separation treatment to effect the separation of mineral oil and optionally gas from water, such as water produced from a subterranean hydrocarbon reservoir. In this arrangement the entrainment of gas into the fluid communicated from the first fluid chamber may assist floatation of the oil. The oil may be skimmed<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> or otherwise collected from the surface of the water within the second fluid chamber. Additionally, gas released from the water may be collected.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Advantageously, providing the at least one nozzle assembly to facilitate entrainment of gas into the fluid being treated may eliminate the requirement to provide external plant equipment, such as gassifiers, mixers, pumps, compressors and the like, associated with prior art arrangements. However, in embodiments of the present invention it may be desirable to utilise such external or additional equipment. Furthermore, the at least one nozzle assembly may be adapted to communicate fluid which has already been mixed with a gas into the second fluid chamber. Thus, the residence time of the fluid within the second chamber may be used substantially entirely for treatment of the fluid, such as separation of components of the fluid. This therefore differs from prior art arrangements in which the residence time must also accommodate sufficient gas/fluid mixing.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The fluid vessel may be arranged vertically. This arrangement may assist to minimise the footprint of the fluid treatment apparatus which is advantageous, particularly in offshore applications. Alternatively, the fluid vessel may be arranged horizontally. Alternatively further, the fluid vessel may be arranged to incline.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The first and second fluid chambers may be arranged to be adjacent each other within the vessel. Alternatively, the first and second chambers may be separately arranged within the vessel. The first and second fluid chambers may be vertically arranged within the vessel. That is, one chamber may be at least partially arranged above the other chamber. In one embodiment the first chamber may be at least partially arranged above a portion of the second chamber. This may facilitate a gravity feed of fluid between the chambers.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Alternatively, or additionally, the first and second chambers may be horizontally arranged within the vessel. That is, one chamber may be at least partially arranged beside the other chamber.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The apparatus may comprise a partition adapted to at least partially separate the first and second fluid chambers. The partition may divide the vessel into at least the first and second fluid chambers.

The fluid port may be provided in the base region of the first fluid chamber. Alternatively, the fluid port may be provided at a raised location relative to a base region of the first fluid chamber. In this arrangement the raised location of the fluid port may permit the nozzle assembly to be operational only when a predefined head of fluid to be treated is present in the first fluid chamber.

In this arrangement, turbulence and mixing in the discharge pipe may configure the gas into small bubbles and cause these bubbles to intimately mix with the fluid from the first<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> chamber.

This arrangement may assist to establish a preferred fluid motion within the second fluid chamber. In one embodiment the discharge pipe may be arranged to establish rotational flow within the second chamber. Rotational flow may be established relative to a central axis of the second chamber. Rotational flow within the second fluid chamber may assist fluid treatment therein. For example, the rotating flow may assist preferential movement of gas bubbles within the fluid being treated, preferential motion of components of the fluid to discharge regions of the second chamber and the like. The rotating flow may suppress forward mixing of the treated fluid towards an outlet (i.e., premature discharge of the fluid being treated), and may modify the residence time distribution.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The discharge pipe may be obliquely (i.e., non-parallel) arranged relative to a central axis of the second chamber.

For example, each nozzle assembly may comprise a fluid port adapted to permit communication with fluid contained within the first fluid chamber, wherein the fluid ports may be arranged at substantially the same height relative to a base region of the first fluid chamber. Accordingly, when the head, i.e., fluid level, within the first fluid chamber drops below the level of the fluid ports, all of the nozzle assemblies will be rendered ineffective, until a sufficient head is re-established.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Alternatively, at least one of the plurality of nozzle assemblies may be adapted to be operational at a different head of fluid within the first fluid chamber than at least one other of the plurality of nozzle assemblies. For example, at least two of the nozzle assemblies may comprise respective fluid ports adapted to permit communication with fluid contained within the first fluid chamber, wherein the fluid ports may be arranged at different respective heights relative to a base region of the first fluid chamber. Accordingly, in this arrangement, if the fluid head within the first fluid chamber begins to drop, for example as a result of a reduced flow rate through the inlet, the nozzle assemblies will sequentially be rendered ineffective in accordance with the heights of the respective fluid ports. This arrangement may therefore be utilised to maintain a preferred velocity range of the fluid entering the second fluid chamber through the nozzle assemblies. The preferred velocity range may be selected in accordance with the required flow within the second fluid chamber. In this arrangement, providing a degree of control over the velocity range may assist to maintain a preferential flow pattern (e.g., rotational) in the second chamber, reducing the effect of variations in the flow through the inlet to the first chamber.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The preferred velocity range may also be selected to maintain the proportion of gas entrained within the fluid and the mixing between them which occurs in the discharge pipe within predefined values.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The apparatus may optionally comprise a deflector arrangement located within the second chamber.

The apparatus 10 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> in longitudinal cross-section, and in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> in lateral cross-section. The fluid treatment apparatus 10 may be used in many applications. However, in the present embodiment the apparatus 10 is utilised to treat water produced from a subterranean reservoir which comprises quantities of oil and gas. As will be described in further detail below, the apparatus 10 is adapted to separate the oil and gas from the produced water by floatation separation. The apparatus 10 may therefore be described as a Compact Floatation Unit (CFU).</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The apparatus 10 comprises a vertically arranged generally cylindrical vessel 12 which defines therein a first or upper fluid chamber 14 and a second or lower fluid chamber 16. The upper and lower fluid chambers are separated by a partition 18 secured to an inner wall surface of the vessel 12. The partition defines a base of the upper chamber 14 and a ceiling of the lower chamber 16.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0080" num="0080">A fluid passage 20 extends between the upper and lower chambers 14, 16 and is defined by a wall portion 22 upstanding from the partition 18. The wall portion 22 in combination with the inner wall surface of the vessel 12 defines a generally annular region or channel 24 within the upper chamber 14. As will be described in further detail below, the fluid passage 20 permits communication of gas between the upper and lower chambers 14, 16.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">A fluid inlet 26 is formed in a side wall of the vessel 12 and in use communicates produced water to be treated into the upper fluid chamber 14, and specifically into the annular region 24. A distributor assembly 28 is provided within the upper chamber 14 and is arranged to initially receive the produced water entering via the inlet 26. The distributor assembly 28, which is most clearly shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> and in the enlarged view in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>, is in the form of a box defined by the partition 18, the wall portion 22, an inner wall portion of the vessel 12, perforated side plates 30 and a solid lid 32 (shown only in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>). Thus, produced water entering the upper chamber 14 via the inlet 26 will be first received into the distributor assembly 28 and then distributed into the annular region 24 through the perforated side plates 30. The distributor assembly 28 functions to dissipate the momentum of the incoming produced water and to distribute this into the annular region 24 with minimum turbulence, preventing or minimising the risk of inadvertent splashing or leakage of the water into the lower chamber 16 through the passage 20.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">The apparatus 10 further comprises a plurality of nozzle assemblies or eductors 34 which provide fluid communication of the produced water from the annular region 24 of the upper chamber 14 into the lower chamber 16. Thus, the upper chamber 14 receives produced water via the fluid inlet 26, and subsequently distributes this into the lower chamber 16 through the nozzle assemblies 34. The produced water is then subject to a flotation treatment within the lower chamber 16. Accordingly, the upper fluid chamber 14 may define a distribution chamber and the lower fluid chamber 16 may define a treatment chamber.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">Each nozzle assembly 34 facilitates entrainment of a gas into the produced water flowing therethrough. The gas is entrained from a header region 36 of the upper chamber 14 and turbulence and mixing within each nozzle assembly 34 configures the entrained gas into small bubbles and causes these to intimately mix with the produced water before being discharged into the lower chamber 16. Thus, the nozzle assemblies 34 deliver the produced water into the lower chamber 16 with a favourable distribution of gas bubbles for subsequent fluid treatment therein. This is particularly advantageous in that the subsequent residence time of the water within the lower chamber 16 may be utilised exclusively for the floatation treatment and<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> separation of the oil and gas from the water. This significantly differs from prior art arrangements in which the mixing of gas takes place within a floatation chamber and thus the residence time must accommodate both gas mixing and floatation separation.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">The form of the nozzle assemblies 34 will be described in further detail below.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">Once the produced water enters the lower chamber 16, the water and oil will naturally begin to separate with the oil tending to float to the surface of the water. The presence of well distributed gas bubbles within the produced water augments this separation effect in that the bubbles adhere to oil droplets within the water and assist coalescence and floatation of the oil. Upon reaching the surface of the water the gas bubbles will be released into an upper region 90 of the lower chamber 16, and will subsequently flow into the header region 36 of the upper chamber 14 through the passage 20. Accordingly, gas released from the produced water may replenish the header region 36 to maintain a sufficient volume of gas for entrainment into incoming produced water by the nozzle assemblies 34.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">The apparatus 10 further comprises a first outlet 38 formed in a lower region of the lower chamber 16 and adapted to facilitate discharge of treated water. A baffle 40 and vortex breaker 42 are also present within the lower region of the lower chamber 16 and are adapted to prevent gas bubbles from being discharged through the first outlet 38 with the treated water. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the baffle 40 is positioned concentrically of the vessel 12 and has a diameter which may be approximately 80 to 95% of the inner diameter of the vessel 12.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">A skimming apparatus 44 is provided in an upper region of the lower chamber 16 and is adapted to skim oil from the surface of the water. The skimmed oil is discharged through a pipe 46 and ultimately through a second outlet 48 formed in a side of the vessel 12 above the location of the partition 18. The vessel 12 is advantageously maintained at a pressure slightly above atmospheric to drive the skimmed oil upwardly through the pipe 46 towards the second outlet 48. The oil may then be collected and processed as required. In an alternative arrangement, the pipe 46 may extend downwardly from the skimming apparatus 44 and discharge through an outlet in a lower region of the vessel 12, for example from a bottom region, below the baffle 40.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">The skimming apparatus 44 is self levelling such that an upper skimming region 50 is maintained at a predefined position relative to the surface of the water/oil within the lower chamber 16 to preserve efficient skimming of the oil.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">A third outlet 52 is provided in the upper region of the upper chamber 14 and permits gas within the header region 36 to be discharged from the vessel 12. The<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> gas may be collected, flared, recycled or the like. The outlet 52 may also function as an inlet to permit gas to be supplied into the vessel 12.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">In the present embodiment the nozzle assemblies 34 comprise discharge pipes 54 which are partially immersed within the produced water in the lower chamber 16 and are arranged in a common direction to discharge the produced water downwardly and circumferentially relative to the vessel 12. This arrangement effects rotation of the water within the lower chamber 16 which advantageously assists fluid treatment therein and provides preferential movement of gas bubbles within the fluid and floating oil towards the skimming assembly 44. Also, the rotation of the produced water assists to suppress water from passing through the lower chamber 16 without allowing sufficient time for the gas bubbles and oil droplets to separate from the water.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">A deflector arrangement in the form of an annular baffle 55 may optionally be secured or integrally formed with the wall of the lower chamber 16 in a region below the discharge pipes 54 of the nozzle assemblies 34.

A longitudinal circulation loop 66 (loop 2) is driven by radially inward flow in the liquid boundary layer 68 on the baffle 40. Circulation loop 66 captures the small gas bubbles 70 which have downward trajectories out of the main water flow and carries these towards the centre and then upwardly towards the surface, to be captured by<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> circulation loop 60.

A lower end of the second conduit 80 is open in the region of the discharge pipe 54.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">Thus, in use, water flowing through the first fluid conduit 72 will cause gas to be entrained from the second fluid conduit 80 from the header region 36 and subsequently mixed within the discharge pipe 54, thus established a good distribution of gas bubbles within the water prior to being discharged through an outlet 84 into the lower chamber 16.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">The height of the fluid port 74 of the first fluid conduit will dictate the head of fluid within the annular region 24 which is required for the nozzle assembly 34 to operate. This operational head may be varied and pre-selected by the provision of an extension pipe 86 of a required length secured or integrally formed with the first fluid conduit 72. The operational head of the nozzle assemblies 34 may be in the region of 400-500mm, for example.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">In one embodiment of aspects of the present invention, the operational head may be equivalent for all nozzle assemblies 34 provided within the apparatus. However, in alternative embodiments two or more nozzle assemblies 34 may be provided with different operational heads by arranging the respective fluid ports 74 at different heights. Accordingly, in this arrangement, if the fluid head or level within the annular region 24 of the upper chamber 14 begins to drop, for example as a result of a reduced flow rate through the inlet 26, the nozzle assemblies 34 will sequentially be rendered ineffective in accordance with the heights of the respective fluid ports 74 until the flow passing through the reduced number of operating nozzle assemblies 34 into the second chamber 16 matches the flow entering the annular region 24 from the inlet 26. This arrangement may therefore be utilised to maintain a preferred velocity<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> range of the fluid being discharged through the outlets 84 of the discharge pipes 54 into the second fluid chamber 16. The preferred velocity range may be selected in accordance with the required flow within the second fluid chamber 16. For example, a range of fluid discharge velocities may be required to establish and maintain rotational flow within the lower chamber. The preferred velocity range may also be selected to maintain the proportion of gas entrained within the fluid and the mixing between them which occurs in the discharge pipe within preferred values.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">An alternative embodiment of a nozzle assembly 34a which may be utilised in the apparatus 10 first shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref>, reference to which is now made. The assembly 34a of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref> is similar to the assembly 34 in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref> and as such like components share like reference numerals, followed by letter "a". As noted, nozzle assembly 34a is similar to assembly 34 and as such comprises a first fluid conduit 72a defining a fluid port 74a, and a second fluid conduit 80a defining a fluid port 82a. However, in this embodiment the fluid port 82a of the second fluid conduit 80a opens into a header region 90 (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>) of the lower chamber 16. Thus, gas from the header region 90 may be entrained and mixed with produced water within a discharge pipe 54a prior to being discharged via an outlet 84a into the lower chamber 16. Although not illustrated, the nozzle assembly 34a may include an extension pipe, similar to pipe 86 of the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">A fluid treatment apparatus according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 7</figref>. The fluid treatment apparatus, generally identified by reference numeral 110, is similar to the apparatus 10 first shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> and as such like features share like reference numerals, incremented by 100.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">The apparatus 110 therefore comprises a vessel 112, which in this case is horizontally arranged. First and second fluid chambers 114, 116 separated by a partition 111a are defined within the vessel 12. A fluid passage 120 is provided between the first and second chambers 114, 116 to permit passage of gas therebetween. A fluid inlet 126 communicates produced water into the first chamber 114, and a plurality of nozzle assemblies 134 are provided to permit communication of the produced water from the first chamber 114 and into the second chamber 116. The nozzle assemblies 134 facilitate entrainment of a gas within a header region 136 of the first chamber 114, or a header region 190 of the second chamber 116, into the produced water. This arrangement therefore provides a good mix and distribution of gas bubbles within the produced fluid prior to being discharged into the second chamber 116.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p id="p0103" num="0103">The produced fluid may then reside for a period of time within the second chamber 116 such that the gas and oil within the water may float to the surface thereof, while the water moves in a generally left-to-right direction. Perforated baffles 92, preferably at least two, are provided within the second chamber 116 to suppress backmixing of the water.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">The treated water with significantly reduced gas and oil content may be discharged via a first outlet 138. The floating oil may be skimmed from the surface of the water by a skimming assembly 144 and subsequently discharged via a second outlet 148. The gas released from the water may be discharged via a third outlet 152.</p><p id="p0105" num="0105">It should be understood that the embodiments described herein are exemplary and that various modifications may be made thereto without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, features of the present invention described above may be utilised in circumstances where the first and second chambers are provided in separate vessels. In this arrangement, the benefits of the present invention may still be achieved by virtue of passing the produced water to be treated through the nozzle assemblies such that a good mix and distribution of bubbles within the water is achieved before being discharged into the second fluid chamber for treatment. In other embodiments the first chamber may be dispensed with and fluid from a source may be directly supplied to at least one nozzle assembly to be discharged into a fluid treatment chamber.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">Furthermore, in the embodiments described various conduits and passages are provided and located internally of the vessel. However, such conduits and passages may extend entirely or at least partially externally of the vessel.</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">Additionally, the apparatus may comprise a third fluid chamber adapted to receive fluid from the second fluid chamber for further treatment. Fluid communicated from the second fluid chamber into the third fluid chamber may be provided via at least one nozzle assembly.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">Further, the gas to be entrained into the fluid being treated may be supplied from an external source.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">The vessel may be opened to atmosphere.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">Although the nozzle assemblies are arranged to entrain gas into the fluid being treated, in alternative arrangements at least one of the nozzle assemblies may be adapted to permit gas to be injected or otherwise delivered into the fluid being treated.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56983880" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Fluidbehandlungsvorrichtung (10, 110), die aufweist:
