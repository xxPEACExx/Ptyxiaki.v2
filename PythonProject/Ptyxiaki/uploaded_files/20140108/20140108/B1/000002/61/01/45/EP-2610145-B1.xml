load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a front pillar for an automobile and, more particularly, to an automobile front pillar having a hollow member provided with an outer panel.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Left and right front pillars in an automobile are located in a front section of the automobile, and are provided in order to attach a windshield (i.e., a windscreen). Commonly, a front pillar is made as a member having a closed cross section by welding together an outer panel and an inner panel in an overlapping manner. A front pillar of such description is known from Patent Literature 1. Each of the outer panel and the inner panel requires a flange for joining the other. The flange projects outwards from the front pillar. Therefore, the size of the flange increases.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In response, front pillar development has been in progress in recent years. A front pillar using a hollow member integrally formed by hydroforming is known from Patent Literature 2. The front pillar known from Patent Literature 2 comprises the hollow member and an outer panel. The hollow member comprises a pipe formed by hydroforming. The outer panel is provided so as to cover a surface of the hollow member on the outside in the vehicle width direction, and joined. The front pillar known from Patent Literature is smaller than a common front pillar described further above. The visibility range forward of a vehicle body from a passenger compartment (i.e., the visual field) is accordingly larger.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Depending on the model of the automobile, a front pillar may have a curved shape, the entirety of which projects to an outside of a vehicle body, from the viewpoint of design. Even in an instance in which a curved front pillar is used, it is preferable that the pillar exhibits a stiffness equivalent to an instance in which a linear front pillar is used. Increasing the wall thickness or the diameter of the hollow member is one possible method for achieving this. However, there remains the possibility that the weight of the front pillar will increase. There is also a possibility that an increase in the diameter of the hollow member will result in a correspondingly narrower field of view from the passenger compartment.</p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART REFERENCES</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT LITERATURE</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005"><ul><li>Patent Literature 1: Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPH0344051B"><text>H03-44051</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2006182079A"><text>2006-182079</text></patcit></li></ul></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Another prior art reference documents represented by <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US20020190544A"><text>US 2002/0190544</text></patcit> which covers the preamble features of claim 1.</p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">PROBLEM SOUGHT TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide a technique for increasing the stiffness of a front pillar while minimizing the weight of the front pillar.</p><heading id="h0007">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the present invention, there is provided a front pillar for an automobile, which front pillar comprises: a hollow member; an outer panel; and an inner panel, wherein the hollow member has a curved shape protruding in its entirety to outside of a vehicle body, the outer panel is provided to a wall section of the hollow member, the wall section being on a vehicle exterior side, and the inner panel is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> formed so as to lie along a wall section of the hollow member, the wall section being on a passenger compartment side, and the inner panel is provided to the wall section on the passenger compartment side.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Preferably, the inner panel has a restricting concave section, and the restricting concave section fits onto a part of the hollow member, thereby restricting a relative displacement of the hollow member in a vehicle width direction relative to the inner panel.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Preferably, each of the outer panel and the inner panel has a first flange for overlapping the other. Each of the first flanges in a state of overlapping the other also functions as a seal attachment section for attaching a sealing material. The sealing material is a member capable of sealing a side door when the side door is in a state of being closed on the vehicle body.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Preferably, each of the outer panel and the inner panel has a second flange provided to a portion opposite each of the respective first flanges in relation to the hollow member. The second flange of the outer panel and the second flange of the inner panel are provided separately to the hollow member.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Preferably, the first flange of the outer panel and the first flange of the inner panel overlap each other so that joining using direct spot welding is possible; the second flange of the outer panel overlaps the hollow member so that joining using indirect spot welding from an outer panel side is possible; and the second flange of the inner panel overlaps the hollow member so that joining using MIG welding (metal inert gas welding) is possible.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Preferably, an intermediate portion of the inner panel between the first flange and the second flange overlaps the hollow member so that joining using MIG welding is possible.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Preferably, the outer panel has a roof-joining outer flange section that protrudes further towards a passenger compartment relative to the hollow member; the hollow member has a roof-joining extended flange section that protrudes towards the passenger compartment along the roof-joining outer flange section; and the roof-joining extended flange section and the roof-joining outer flange section overlap a flange section of a roof so that joining by direct spot welding is possible.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">More preferably, each of the inner panel and the outer panel has a flange overlapping and joined by direct spot welding to a portion of the hollow member that is located opposite the roof.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">More preferably, the front pillar further comprises a nut into which a bolt can be screwed from the passenger compartment side, the nut positioned between the hollow member and the inner panel.

Each of the respective second flanges is joined separately to the hollow member. Each of the first flanges is positioned so as to face the other. A reinforcing member is sandwiched between and joined to the first flanges in a front end section and a rear end section of the front pillar. Between the front end section and the rear end section, each of the first flanges is overlapped with the other so that a sealing material for sealing the side door can be attached, the first flanges are partially provided with a gap therebetween, and each of the first flanges is joined to the other<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> at a portion where the gap is not present, wherein the gap is in communication with a closed void section enclosed by the hollow member, the outer panel, and the inner panel.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">More preferably, the gap comprises a concave section formed on a flange surface of at least one of the first flanges.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">More preferably, each of the front and rear reinforcing members is also joined to the hollow member within the void section.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">More preferably, the outer panel has a glass attachment flange section that is overlapped with and joined to an upper surface of the hollow member. The glass attachment flange section is formed in a flat plate shape on which a windshield can be attached. A terminal section of the hollow member in the longitudinal direction is reinforced by a reinforcing member. The reinforcing member has a joint portion that is overlapped with and joined to the upper surface of the hollow member in the terminal section. The joint portion and the upper surface of the terminal section are downwardly separated from the glass attachment flange section.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">More preferably, the terminal section is sandwiched between, and joined to, the reinforcing member and the inner panel.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">More preferably, a thickness of the hollow member and a thickness of the reinforcing member are of a magnitude suited for joining using MIG welding.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Preferably, the inner panel has, on a lower section, a stepped bead bulging towards the passenger compartment and an opening section penetrating in the vehicle width direction. The stepped bead has a plurality of fold sections formed on the inner panel so as to extend towards a rear section of the vehicle body along the hollow member. The opening section is a through-hole through which a flexible linear member drawn out from an interior of the hollow member can be drawn towards the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> passenger compartment. The through-hole is positioned so as to span at least a part of the fold sections, whereby an upper half portion of the through-hole is positioned on a section corresponding to the stepped bead.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">More preferably, the inner panel has a stepped section for reinforcement, surrounding a rim of the opening section.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">More preferably, the stepped bead is configured so that a front end section bulges maximally from the inner panel, and the degree of bulging gradually decreases towards the rear section of the vehicle body.</p><heading id="h0008">ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">According to the present invention, the hollow member has a curved shape, the entirety of which projects to the outside of the vehicle body. On the hollow member, an inner panel is overlapped with and joined to the wall section on the passenger compartment side. In other words, the hollow member is reinforced by the inner panel. The hollow member with increased stiffness can transmit impact load acting on the inner panel towards the rear section of the vehicle body in an efficient manner. There is no need to increase the thickness or the wall thickness of the hollow member in order to increase the stiffness of the hollow member. An increase in the weight of the front pillar can be minimized, and the size of the front pillar can be reduced. Reducing the size of the front pillar expands the visual field from the passenger compartment.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the restricting concave section is fitted onto a part of the hollow member, thereby making it possible to restrict a relative displacement of the hollow member in the vehicle width direction relative to the inner panel. Therefore, the hollow member is reinforced by the inner panel. As a result, the stiffness of the hollow member can be increased. Therefore, impact load<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> acting on the front end of the hollow member can be transmitted towards the rear section of the vehicle body in an efficient manner.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the first flange of the outer panel and the first flange of the inner panel overlap each other in the vicinity of the lower section of the hollow member. The stiffness of the front pillar therefore increases. It is also possible for the respective first flanges to form a rim section of a door opening. The sealing material for sealing the door opening can be attached to the rim section. In other words, the rim section also functions as the seal attachment section. The sealing material can be adequately supported by the seal attachment section having a high stiffness.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Furthermore, according to the present invention, neither of the second flanges overlaps the other, making it possible to reduce the size of each of the outer panel and the inner panel by a corresponding amount. Therefore, the size and the weight of the front pillar can be reduced.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Furthermore, according to the present invention, each of the first flange of the outer panel and the first flange of the inner panel can be overlapped with the other and joined by direct spot welding. The second flange of the outer panel can be joined to the hollow member by indirect spot welding from the outer panel side. The second flange of the inner panel can be joined to the hollow member by MIG welding. Welding means suitable for the configuration of each joint section can be employed as described above, and a step for joining by welding can be performed in an efficient manner; therefore, the capacity for mass production of the front pillar can be improved.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the intermediate portion of the inner panel between the first flange and the second flange can be joined to the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> hollow member by MIG welding. Both the second flange and the intermediate portion of the inner panel is joined to the hollow member, thereby making it possible to further increase the stiffness of the hollow member.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Furthermore, according to the present invention, three flanges; namely, the roof-joining extended flange section, the roof-joining outer flange section, and the flange section of the roof, can be overlapped with each other and joined by direct spot welding. Therefore, despite a hollow member being used for the front pillar, the specifications of the spot welding equipment can be substantially equivalent to those required conventionally, and it becomes possible to continue reducing the size of spot welding equipment. Also, even when a hollow member is used, welding conditions required for spot welding are substantially identical to those required conventionally, and spot welding can be readily performed. Only the roof-joining outer flange section and the roof-joining extended flange section for attaching the flange section of the roof protrude towards the passenger compartment. There is no need to provide a roof-joining outer flange section and a roof-joining extended flange section to a portion of the front pillar onto which the windshield is attached. Therefore, it is possible to provide an adequate visibility range forward of the vehicle body from the passenger compartment through the windshield.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the outer panel and the inner panel are joined by overlapping respective flanges and applying direct spot welding at a position opposite the roof relative to the hollow member. Therefore, even though a hollow member is used, it is possible to employ spot welding, as conventionally employed, when joining the inner panel and the outer panel.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the nut is provided between the hollow member and the inner panel. The nut comprises the plate section that<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> joins the inner panel, and the nut section that is smaller than the plate section. The nut section extends to the interior of the hollow member through a nut relief hole section formed on the hollow member. Therefore, even though a nut is provided between the hollow member and the inner panel, a space between the hollow member and the inner panel can be made narrower. As a result, the front pillar can be made thinner. Also, since the nut section is smaller than the plate section, the size of the nut relief hole can be made smaller by a corresponding amount.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the nut relief hole section is oriented at an incline relative to the center line of the nut section. Therefore, even when a plate nut is attached in advance when the inner panel is attached, an adequate space between the plate nut and the nut relief hole section can readily be provided, and the size of the nut relief hole section can be further reduced.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the hollow member, the outer panel, and the inner panel are combined to form a closed space section. A gap in communication with the space section is partially provided between each of the first flanges. The gap functions as a channel used when performing surface treatment on the front pillar using an electrodeposition liquid or another coating liquid. The coating liquid is caused to flow from the gap into the space section, thereby making it possible to adequately coat a wall surface of the front pillar inside the space section. Also, since a respective portion of each of the first flanges where the gap is not present is joined to the other, the first flanges can be imparted with adequate stiffness even though the gap is provided. As a result, adequate stiffness of the front pillar can be obtained. Also, the reinforcing member is provided to the front end section and the rear end section of the front pillar. Each of the reinforcing members is sandwiched between and joined to each of the first flanges. Therefore, the front end section and<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> the rear end section of the front pillar, which require higher stiffness than an intermediate section, can be reinforced by the reinforcing member. Therefore, the hollow member having a small diameter and a small wall thickness can be used to make the front pillar extremely compact.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the gap comprises a concave section formed on the flange surface of at least one of the first flanges. Since the concave section is formed on the flange surface, the concave section can be simultaneously formed during plastic forming of the first flange. Therefore, the gap can be provided to the flange surface with extreme ease. It is also possible to readily provide a large number of gaps across a wide range on the flange surface.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the reinforcing member sandwiched by and joined to each of the first flanges and is also joined to the hollow member. Therefore, the front end section and the rear end section of the hollow member can be reinforced by both the inner panel and the reinforcing member. The stiffness of the hollow member is increased, and the stiffness of the front pillar can therefore be further increased.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the reinforcing member for reinforcing each of the terminal sections of the hollow member has a joint portion for overlapping with and joining to the upper surface of each of the terminal sections. The joint portion and the upper surface of each of the terminal sections are downwardly separated from the glass attachment flange section, and therefore do not interfere with the glass attachment flange section. Therefore, the glass attachment flange section can be given a flat configuration overall. The windshield can be readily and reliably attached to the flat glass attachment section using an adhesive or<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> another common method of attachment, and the state of the attachment can be maintained to a sufficient degree.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the terminal section is sandwiched by and joined to the reinforcing member and the inner panel, and the joint strength is therefore increased.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Furthermore, according to the present invention, each of the thickness of the hollow member and the thickness of the reinforcing member is set to a size that is suitable for joining by MIG welding. Therefore, the hollow member and the reinforcing member can be sufficiently joined, and the joint strength can be increased.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the inner panel has a stepped bead bulging towards the passenger compartment, and the stiffness of the inner panel thereby increases. As a result, the front pillar has high stiffness. Also, the opening section is positioned so as to span at least a part of the fold sections, and the upper half portion of the opening section is thereby positioned on a section corresponding to the stepped bead. Therefore, the opening section is formed so as to have a stepped shape that matches a gradation of the stepped bead. Therefore, the flexible linear member drawn out from the interior of the hollow member can be readily drawn towards the passenger compartment through the opening section.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the rim of the opening section is surrounded by the stepped section for reinforcement. Therefore, the inner panel has a large stiffness around the rim.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the degree to which the stepped bead bulges from the inner panel is larger at the front end section and gradually decreases towards the rear section of the vehicle body. Therefore, impact<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> load acting on the front section of the vehicle body can be transmitted to the hollow member through the stepped bead in an efficient manner.</p><heading

The front pillar 18 comprises a hollow member 25, an outer panel 28, and an inner panel 29. The hollow member 25 is a long material that functions as a core material of the front pillar 18, and a front end is joined to a rear end section 13a of the right upper arm 13 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. The hollow<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> member 25 is made from, for example, a steel material, and is integrally formed by hydroforming so as to have a substantially rectangular closed cross-section. In other words, the hollow member 25 is made of a rectangular pipe. In the first embodiment, substantially rectangular refers to a rectangle, a square, or another quadrilateral.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the front pillar 18 has a curved shape, the entirety of which projects to an outside of the vehicle body 10 (arrow Ou). Therefore, each of the hollow member 25, the outer panel 28, and the inner panel 29 has a curved shape, the entirety of which projects to the outside of the vehicle body 10. Specifically, the overall shape of the front pillar 18 is a curve that projects upward, and outward in the vehicle width direction, of the vehicle body 10.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">A straight line 31 passing through the front end 18a and a rear end 18b of the front pillar 18 shall be referred to as a reference line 31.

The vehicle exterior-side wall section 26 is positioned on the hollow member 25 towards an exterior of the vehicle body 10. The inner lower wall section 37 and the inner side wall section 38 form a passenger compartment-side wall section 27 (i.e., a wall section 27 on a passenger compartment 34 side) that is substantially L-shaped in cross section.

The outer panel body 41 has a substantially U-shaped cross section, opens towards the vehicle exterior-side wall section 26, and has the first and second outer flanges 42, 43 provided to both ends 41a, 41b of the opening. One of the ends 41a is positioned near a corner between the outer side wall section 36 and the inner lower wall section 37. The other end 41b is positioned near a corner between the outer<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> upper wall section 35 and the outer side wall section 36. The first outer flange 42 (i.e., the first flange 42) extends from the end 41a of the outer panel body 41 towards the outside of the vehicle body 10. A distal end of the first outer flange 42 is positioned away from the corner between the outer side wall section 36 and the inner lower wall section 37.

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a lower front section of the inner panel 29 is joined to a lower inner panel 29A projecting upright from a lower section of the vehicle body 10. The lower inner panel 29A functions to link the lower section of the vehicle body 10 to the lower front section of the front pillar 18 as a part of a "front pillar undersection."</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref>, the inner panel body 45 comprises a flat plate that is overlapped with and joined to the passenger compartment-side wall section 27, and a predetermined welding position 64 (i.e., a welding section 64) is welded to the inner lower wall section 37. The restricting section 46 extends upwards from an end 45a of the inner panel body 45 towards the outside in the vehicle width direction, following the corner between the outer side wall section 36 and the inner lower wall section 37. A top end 46a of the upward extension is provided with the first inner flange 47.

The first inner flange 47 is caused to overlap with the first outer flange 42 of the outer panel 28 from below, and is joined by direct spot welding. The flanges 42, 47 thus integrated by joining are capable of functioning as a member for reinforcing the hollow member 25. As a result, the stiffness of the front pillar 18 is increased.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">The integrated flanges 42, 47 form a rim section 52 of the door opening 23. The rim section 52 functions as a seal attachment section for attaching a sealing material 53. The rim section 52 shall hereafter be referred to as a seal attachment section 52. The sealing material 53 is a material for sealing between the door opening 23 and a side door 51 when the door opening 23 is closed by the side door 51. Since the flanges 42, 47 are integrated, the stiffness of the seal attachment section 52 is increased. The sealing material 53 can be adequately supported by the seal attachment section 52 having a high stiffness.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The second outer flange 43 of the outer panel 28 is caused to overlap with the outer upper wall section 35 of the hollow member 25, and is joined by indirect spot welding. The second inner flange 48 of the inner panel 29 is caused to overlap with the inner side wall section 38 of the hollow member 25, and is joined by MIG welding (metal inert gas welding). The second outer flange 43 and the second inner flange 48 are provided separately to the hollow member 25. Therefore, there is no need to join the second outer flange 43 and the second inner flange 48 so as to overlap each other. The size of each of the outer panel 28 and the inner panel 29 can be reduced by an amount corresponding to the extent to which the second outer flange 43 and the<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> second inner flange 48 do not overlap. Therefore, the weight of the front pillar 18 can be reduced.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The second inner flange 48 (i.e., a second flange 48) extends upwards from an end 45b of the inner panel body 45 towards the inside in the vehicle width direction so as to lie along the inner side wall section 38. The second inner flange 48 overlaps the inner side wall section 38 up to half the height of the inner side wall section 38. The second inner flange 48 is positioned relative to the inner side wall section 38 so that a predetermined space S is provided therebetween.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">The second inner flange 48 has a plurality of joint sections 57 provided to an upper end portion 48a. The joint sections 57 are sections at which the second inner flange 48 projects towards the inner side wall section 38 so as to contact and join the inner side wall section 38. The joint sections 57 are arranged at a predetermined pitch along the longitudinal direction of the hollow member 25, and an upper end 65 (i.e., a welding section 65) of each of the joint sections 57 is joined by MIG welding to the inner side wall section 38.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The inner panel body 45, the restricting section 46, and the second inner flange 48 form a restricting concave section 61. The restricting concave section 61 is a concave section in which a part 25a; i.e., a lower section 25a, of the hollow member 25 can be fitted and accommodated. The lower section 25a of the hollow member 25 is sandwiched between the restricting section 46 and the joint sections 57. The hollow member 25 is restricted from undergoing relative displacement in the vehicle width direction relative to the inner panel 29. The hollow member 25 is therefore reinforced by the inner panel 29. As a result, the stiffness of the hollow member 25 can be increased. Therefore, an impact load acting on a front end of the hollow member 25 can be transmitted to a rear section of the vehicle body 10 in an efficient manner.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Next, an example of welding the front pillar 18 will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>. The first outer flange 42 and the first inner flange 47 are joined by spot welding as follows. Each of the overlapped flanges 42, 47 is shaped so as to extend away from the hollow member 25, and is outwardly exposed. As a result, the flanges 42, 47 can be sandwiched between a pair of electrodes 71, 72, and joining by direct spot welding can therefore be performed. The flanges 42, 47 in a state of overlapping each other are sandwiched by a pair of electrodes 71, 72. Next, an electrical current is supplied between the electrodes 71, 72, thereby joining the flanges 42, 47 by direct spot welding.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">The outer upper wall section 35 and the second outer flange 43 are joined by spot welding as shall now be described. An electrode 73 is pressed against the second outer flange 43 in a state in which the second outer flange 43 overlaps the outer upper wall section 35. Next, an electrical current is supplied between the electrode 73 and the outer upper wall section 35, thereby joining the electrode 73 to the outer upper wall section 35 by indirect spot welding. The joining step does not require the second outer flange 43 and the outer upper wall section 35 overlapping each other to be sandwiched between a pair of electrodes. Therefore, there is no need to insert an electrode into the hollow member 25 and press the electrode against an inner surface of the hollow member 25.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">The inner side wall section 38 and the second inner flange 48 are joined by MIG welding as shall now be described. In a state in which the second inner flange 48 overlaps the inner side wall section 38, a welding wire 75 is positioned in proximity with the second inner flange 48, the welding wire 75 is used as an electrode, and the second inner flange 48 is joined to the inner side wall section 38 by MIG welding. By positioning the welding wire 75, which functions as the electrode, in proximity with<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> the second inner flange 48 as described above, it is possible to join the second inner flange 48 to the inner side wall section 38. There is no need for a step for inserting an electrode into the hollow member 25, or for a step for pressing the inserted electrode against an inner surface of the hollow member 25. By employing welding means suitable for the configuration of each joint section as described above, a step for joining by welding can be performed in an efficient manner; therefore, the capacity for mass production of the front pillar 18 can be improved.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">A wall thickness dimension T1 of the hollow member 25 is relatively large, and a plate thickness dimension T2 of the inner flange 29 is larger than a plate thickness dimension T3 of the outer flange 28. Therefore, the second inner flange 48 is joined to the hollow member 25 by MIG welding. Therefore, the second inner flange 48 can be joined more firmly to the hollow member 25, and the stiffness of the front pillar 18 can be further increased.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">The inner lower wall section 37 and a center portion 45 of the inner panel 29 (i.e., the inner panel body 45) are joined by MIG welding as shall now be described. In a state in which the inner panel body 45 overlaps the inner lower wall section 37, a welding wire 76 is placed in proximity with the inner panel 29 with a laser being jointly used. Next, the welding wire 76 is moved along the welding section 64, the welding position 64 is caused to melt onto the inner lower wall section 37, and the inner panel body 45 is joined to the inner lower wall section 37.
