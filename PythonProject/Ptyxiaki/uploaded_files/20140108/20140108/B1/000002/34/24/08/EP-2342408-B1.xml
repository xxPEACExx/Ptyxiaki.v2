The movable portion rotates around the fixed portion around a hinge axis.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In particular, the movable portion comprises a bracket, which is firmly connected to the door leaf so as to couple the hinge and the door leaf together.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Known adjustment devices allow to position the door leaf with respect to the frame with the required accuracy. In particular, adjustment devices act by changing the position of the connecting bracket with respect to the remaining hinge.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Therefore, known adjustment devices act upon the connecting bracket by moving it with respect to the remaining movable portion of the hinge. Known devices thus comprise control members directly actuated by an operator, and connection means converting the operator's action into a bracket shift.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The control members of known devices comprise a pair of control screws arranged with mutually parallel axes on the movable portion of the hinge. In this case, the connection means comprise eccentric means directly controlled by the screws.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In other words, each screw is associated with an eccentric stud sliding in respective slots arranged perpendicularly to one another and obtained integrally with the connecting bracket, so as to control the latter to make two mutually orthogonal shifts. In general, the slots are arranged so as to let the door leaf move on its lying plane in a direction parallel to the hinge axis and in a direction transversal thereto.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Disadvantageously, known adjustment devices for hidden hinges are not characterized by a simple and intuitive use.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As a matter of fact, the use of eccentric means implies that control members lie side-by-side and parallel to one another. In order words, the adjustment of the door leaf position along the two perpendicular directions as mentioned occurs by actuating controls arranged mutually near each other and parallel to one another. Therefore, the adjustment direction associated with a specific control member cannot be immediately identified.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Moreover, a further drawback concerns adjustment accuracy. As a matter of fact, in case of eccentric connection means the maximum shift of the connecting bracket must be determined by a single 180° rotation<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> of the screws. This makes correct determination of the adjustment inaccurate.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A further drawback of the prior art lies in the complex manufacturing of the components, e.g. eccentric elements, which results in high manufacturing costs. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1091067A"><text>EP1091067A</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6715181B1"><text>US6715181B1</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="FR1422961A"><text>FR1422961A</text></patcit> disclose prior-art adjustment devices for door leaf hinges. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP1602794A"><text>EP 1 602 794</text></patcit> discloses the features of the preamble of claim 1.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Under these circumstances, the technical task underlying the present invention consists in proposing an adjustment device for hinges, typically hidden hinges, and an hidden hinge comprising the adjustment device, which both overcome one or more of the drawbacks of the prior art as mentioned above.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In particular, an aim of the present invention consists in providing an adjustment device for hinges, typically hidden hinges, and a hinge, typically an hidden hinge, comprising the adjustment device, which can make adjustment operations easier and more intuitive.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">One of the aims of the present invention consists in proposing an adjustment device for hinges, preferably hidden hinges, and an hidden hinge comprising the adjustment device, in which door leaf adjustment is more accurate.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">One of the aims of the present invention consists in proposing an adjustment device for hinges, typically hidden hinges, which is easy and cheap to manufacture.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The technical task and one or more of the aims referred to above are substantially achieved by an adjustment device for door leaf hinges, typically for hidden hinges, and by a hinge, typically an hidden hinge, comprising the adjustment device, having the technical features disclosed in one or more of the appended claims.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Further characteristics and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the following indicative, and therefore non-limiting description of some embodiments, including a preferred, though not exclusive embodiment of an adjustment device for hinges, e.g. hidden hinges, and of an hidden hinge comprising the adjustment device, with the accompanying drawings, in which:

Said folded elements 8 have each a tab 8a provided with a further through hole for housing the aforesaid stud 7.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The movable portion 5 comprises a supporting plate 10 intended to be stiffly fastened to the door leaf 6, e.g. by means of screws. Preferably, the supporting plate 10 has a plurality of holes 11 for coupling the movable portion 5 with the door leaf 6.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The movable portion 5 further comprises a body 12, preferably shaped as a plate at least partially folded for housing said stud 7. Such supporting plate 10 is associated with the body 12.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The adjustment device 1 is arranged on the movable portion 5 of the hinge 2, typically being a part of it. Advantageously, such device 1 mechanically connects the body 12 to the supporting plate 10, e.g. being placed therebetween.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to the present invention, the adjustment device 1 comprises a first body 13 which can be mechanically associated with the body 12 of the movable portion 5 of the hinge 2 (typically the first body 13 can be stiffly bound to the body 12 of the movable portion 5), and a second body 14 which can be mechanically associated with the supporting plate 10 (typically the second body 14 can be stiffly bound to the door leaf 6).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">By way of example, the first body 13 is made as one piece with the body 12. By way of example, the second body 14 is made as one piece with the supporting plate 10.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The first body 13 and the second body 14 are mechanically connected one to the other so that they are able to take stably a plurality of mutual positions. By way of example, the second body 14 is housed inside the first body 13.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The device 1 comprises at least a first 15 and a second control element 16, both associated with the first 13 and the second body 14 of the device 1 so as to determine the relative positions thereof, as will be more readily apparent from the following disclosure.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The device 1 advantageously comprises coupling means 17 acting between the first 15 and the second control element 16 and the second body 14 so as to cause respective shifts of the second body 14 with respect to the first body 13.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The coupling means 17 act between the first control element 15 and the second body 14 so as to enable a shift of the second body 14 with respect to the first body 13 along a first direction "D1" as a consequence of<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the activation of the first control element 15. Moreover, the coupling means 17 act between the second control element 16 and the second body 14 so as to enable a shift of the second body 14 with respect to the first body 13 along a second direction "D2" as a consequence of the activation of the second control element 16.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The first direction "D1" and the second direction "D2" are perpendicular to one another.

Force and movement transmission occurs where the contact between the respective inclined planes is. Thus, the direction of the force and/or movement acting upon the second element is transversal (i.e. non-parallel, typically orthogonal) to the predefined direction of the force of the first element.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The coupling means 17 with inclined planes comprise threaded means.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The first 15 and the second control element 16 comprise a first 18 and a second threaded screw 19, respectively, which are operatively located between the first 13 and the second body 14.

The panel 30 of the second body 14 lies facing and substantially parallel to the panel 27 of the first body 13. In particular, the panel 27 of the first body 13 and the panel 30 of the second body 14 are always in mutual contact during operation.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The slots 24 are obtained at least on the first 25 and on the second wall 26 of the first body 13. Preferably, a slot 24 wholly identical to the slot 24 of the second wall 26 is obtained on the additional second wall 26' of<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the first body 13.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The first threaded hole 20 is obtained on the second wall 29 of the second body 14, whereas the second threaded hole 21 is obtained on the first wall 28 of the second body 14. An additional first threaded hole 20' can be obtained on the additional second wall 29' of the second body 14.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The supporting plate 10 is connected to the second wall 29 and to the panel 30 of the second body 14, if necessary also to the additional second wall 29'. Preferably, the supporting plate 10 is made as one piece with the second wall 29 and the panel 30 of the second body 14 (and with the additional second wall 29', if present).</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">As can be inferred from the configuration of the walls of the first 13 and of the second body 14, the first screw 18 is arranged with its longitudinal axis perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the second screw 19. By way of example, the first screw 18 is arranged with its longitudinal axis parallel to said first direction "D1". The second screw 19 is arranged with its longitudinal axis parallel to said second direction "D2".</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In use, once the hinge 2 is mounted and the door leaf 6 is connected to the supporting plate 10, the fine adjustment of the position of the door leaf 6 with respect to the frame 4 is carried out by actuating the first 18 and/or the second screw 19.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In further detail, when it is necessary to adjust the position of the door leaf 6 along the first direction "D1" as described, the operator should only act upon the first screw 18, which is oriented parallel to the said first direction "D1".</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">If it is necessary to adjust the position of the door leaf 6 along the second direction "D2" as described, conversely, the operator should only act upon the second screw 19, which is oriented parallel to said second direction "D2".</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The device 1 further comprises blocking means 31 operating between the first 13 and the second body 14 so as to avoid relative movements between the two bodies, once the relative position has been obtained on the basis of the required adjustment.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">By way of example, the blocking means 31 comprise a bolt 32 getting through an additional slot 33 obtained in the panel 27 of the first body 13, and screwed into a threaded opening 34 obtained in the panel 30 of the second body 14.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In order to activate the blocking means 31 after executing the adjustment, it is necessary only to tighten the bolt 32 so that the panel 27 of the first body 13 remains firmly in contact with the panel 30 of the second body 14, thanks to the presence of the bolt 32 head which remains in contact with an outer surface of the body 13.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Advantageously, the first screw 18 and/or the second screw 19 have a collar 35. By way of example, the collar 35 is arranged around the respective shank 23 and protrudes radially from the latter. Advantageously, the collar 35 lies near the head 22 at a slightly greater distance from the latter than the thickness<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> of the walls 25 and/or 26 (thus, during operation, the wall 25 or 26 lies between the head 22 and said collar). This collar 35 is physically arranged between the first 13 and the second body 14. Advantageously, the collar 35 is made as one piece with the screw, as shown in the figure. In an alternative embodiment, which is not shown in the figure, the collar can consist of an open elastic (e.g. metal) ring, such as e.g. a Seeger ring, fitted into a groove on the screw shank.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Preferably, this collar 35 is at least on the second screw 19.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">If the blocking means 31 are inactive, the weight of the door leaf 6 weighs on the body 12 of the hinge 2 through the second body 14 of the device 1. In this case, if the second body 14 imparts an axial action to the second screw 19 with a direction from the shank 23 to the head 22 (e.g. if the corresponding hinge 2 is the lowest hinge of a pair of hinges 2), the collar 35 abuts against the first wall 25 of the first body 13 opposing this axial action of the door leaf. Thus, a misalignment of the door leaf 6 can be prevented and an effective adjustment thereof is allowed.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The slots 24 and 33 on the first body 13 are shaped so as to enable the relative movement of the respective bolt 18, 19 or 32 (integral with the second body 14) with respect to the first body 13.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Advantageously, the slot 24 of the first wall 25 has an operating portion 24a with a smaller width than the collar 35 so as to enable the passage of the threaded shank 23, but in order to interfere with the collar 35 so as to prevent the second screw 19 from sliding and at least an insertion portion 24b (preferably a pair of these portions 24b arranged on opposite sides of the aforesaid operating portion 24a) having a greater width than the collar 35 so as to enable the insertion of the collar 35 through the first body 13.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Advantageously, the first body 13 and/or the second body 14 have a symmetrical structure with respect to a respective plane of symmetry arranged perpendicular to the axis of rotation "A". Thus, the adjustment device and the hinge containing the latter can be mounted in two positions rotated of 180°.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The invention achieves the aims set forth and attains important advantages.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">As was said before, in order to adjust the door leaf with respect to the frame, the adjustment device accord= ing to the present invention enables to actuate appropriate control elements arranged along separate directions parallel to the separate directions of the various adjustments to be made. This makes the adjustment device and the hidden hinge according to the present invention easier and more intuitive in use.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">The adjustment is far more accurate since it is possible to make given shifts of the door leaf by broad screw rotations. Thus, a small shift is comfortably obtained with a broad screw rotation.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56985764" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Verstellvorrichtung (1) für Türblattscharniere (2), umfassend:
