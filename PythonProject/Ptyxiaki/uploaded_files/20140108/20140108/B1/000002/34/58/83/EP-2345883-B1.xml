load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">Technical Field</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a purifying agent for an oily liquid containing polychlorinated biphenyls, in particular, a purifying agent for removing, from an oily liquid, an interfering substance to an analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls contained in the oily liquid.</p><heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">As electric insulating oils for electrical instruments such as transformers or capacitors, those made of mineral oils containing polychlorinated biphenyls (hereinafter referred to as "PCBs" as the case may be) excellent in electric insulation properties were generally used. However, the toxicity of PCBs to the living body has been confirmed, so that in Japan, the production and import of PCBs have already been prohibited, and use of electric insulating oils and the like that contain PCBs came to be substantially prohibited. However, as it was feared that PCB-containing electric insulating oils and the like that were used in the past may cause environmental pollution in their disposal process, electrical instrument manufacturers or users, industrial waste disposers, and others have been continuing to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> store the oils and the like, as they are, over a long term up to the present time.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Meanwhile, with the background of the establishment of a safe process for chemically decomposing PCBs, in Japan the so-called PCB special measures law was enacted in 2001. This law obliges to dispose of all PCBs wastes which have been hitherto used or stored, typical examples of which include PCBs-containing electric insulating oils, by July in 2016.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It was initially assumed that PCBs wastes that should be disposed of under the PCB Special Measures Law were limited to those electric insulating oils and the like which had been manufactured or used until production and use of PCBs were prohibited and which had been stored heretofore. However, there were cases where PCBs estimated to be mixed during the production process were detected in electric insulating oils and the like manufactured after prohibition of use of PCBs, and thus some electric insulating oils used at present in electric instruments such as transformers may correspond to PCBs wastes subject to the PCB Special Measures Law. The PCB Special Measures Law set out the time limit as described above, so there has been demand for promptly judging whether electric insulating oils used in existing electric instruments and the like correspond to the PCBs wastes subject to the PCB Special Measures Law (that is, oils and the like containing PCBs at a concentration of not less than 0.5 mg/kg correspond to the PCBs<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> wastes subject to the PCB Special Measures Law, and judgment of whether oils and the like correspond to the PCBs wastes or not is referred to as PCB screening).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It is usually judged based on a result obtained by a high-sensitivity analysis, such as gas chromatography or bioassay, whether or not a sample collected from an object such as an electric insulating oil, contains PCBs at a predetermined concentration. Thus, the sample needs to be subjected to a high-level pretreatment for removing any interfering substance producing an effect on analysis results. Such a pretreatment is usually conducted in accordance with a method described in Appendix No.2 in Announcement No.192 issued in 1992 by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan "Method of Testing Standards Concerned with General Wastes Subject to Special Control and Industrial Waste Subject to Special Control" (hereinafter referred to as the "official method"). However, the official method needs a complicated treatment having many steps, such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)/hexane partition, a sulfuric acid treatment, an alkali treatment, and a silica gel column treatment; thus, in order to complete the method, a long period, the length of which is specified by day, is required, and further costs for conducting the method are also very high.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Thus, investigations have been made about a method for pretreating an object to be judged in place of the official method. As a method of extracting polychlorinated biphenyls<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> from an oily liquid such as an electric insulating oil containing PCBs by a simple operation in a short period in order to prepare a sample for analysis, the pamphlet of International Publication <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2008123393A"><text>WO 2008/123393</text></patcit> discloses a method using a column into which a sulfuric acid silica gel, a metal salt hydrate silica gel (for example, a copper salt hydrate silica gel), a silver nitrate silica gel, and alumina are filled.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, the metal salt hydrate silica gel or silver nitrate silica gel used in this pretreatment method deteriorates, with the passage of time, after the preparation thereof, so that the capability thereof for removing interfering substances contained in an oily liquid tends to lower. Thus, analysis results of a sample obtained by this pretreatment method may be affected by the interfering substances which remain in the sample.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP06135895B"><text>JP 06135895</text></patcit> describes a method for producing glycolic acid ester in which a catalyst is prepared by dissolving copper nitrate and silver nitrate in water, adding silica gel, and dropping aqueous ammonium carbonate solution onto the mixture before filtering the precipitates, drying the separated precipitates at 40°C for 12 hours, and reducing the dried precipitates in a hydrogen flow at 350°C for 2 hours.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP1612552A"><text>EP 1 612 552</text></patcit> relates to a sample preparation method for analyzing dioxins, and describes a method in which a hydrophobic solution of dioxins is supplied to a first column filled with a silica gel-based filler, passing a hydrophobic solvent through the first column, which is then passed through a second column filled with an alumina-based filler. A hydrophilic solvent capable of dissolving dioxins is passed through the second column in a direction opposite to that of the hydrophobic solvent.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to enhance the level of pretreatment of an oily liquid for which polychlorinated biphenyls contained therein are analyzed.</p><heading id="h0003">Disclosure of the Invention</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention relates to a purifying agent for an oily liquid containing polychlorinated biphenyls, which is for removing, from the oily liquid, an interfering substance to an analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls contained in the oily liquid. This purifying agent contains a nitrate silica<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> gel yielded by treating an activated silica gel with a mixed aqueous solution of copper nitrate and silver nitrate and then drying the activated silica gel.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">This purifying agent does not exhibit the capability of adsorbing polychlorinated biphenyls while the agent exhibits an excellent capability of adsorbing an interfering substance which affects an effect on an analysis of the polychlorinated biphenyls contained in the oily liquid, and a decomposition product thereof; thus, the interfering substance can be effectively separated from the polychlorinated biphenyls contained in the oily liquid. This function hardly deteriorates even when a time elapses after the preparation of the purifying agent. Thus, when this purifying agent is used for a pretreatment of the oily liquid containing the polychlorinated biphenyls to prepare a sample for analyzing the polychlorinated biphenyls, the analytical accuracy of the polychlorinated biphenyls contained in the oily liquid can be improved.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Another aspect of the present invention relates to a column usable for extracting polychlorinated biphenyls from an oily liquid containing polychlorinated biphenyls. The column includes a first layer of a sulfuric acid silica gel, and a second layer of a purifying agent containing a nitrate silica gel yielded by treating an activated silica gel with a mixed aqueous<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> solution of copper nitrate and silver nitrate and then drying the activated silica gel, arranged below the first layer.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In this purifying column, the oily liquid is added into the sulfuric acid silica gel of the first layer so as to be penetrated into the gel while the gel is heated. In this state, when the gel is kept for a predetermined time, the interfering substance contained in the oily liquid can be at least partially decomposed. Moreover, the first layer exhibits a strong dehydrating action. Accordingly, the first layer decomposes the interfering substance contained in the oily liquid at least partially, and further can effectively absorb water incorporated in the oily liquid.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Thereafter, an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent is supplied into the first layer side and this aliphatic hydrocarbon is developed from the first layer to the second layer. In this way, the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent dissolves the interfering substance which remains in the first layer, the decomposition products generated in the first layer, the polychlorinated biphenyls and the oily liquid, so that these components are transferred into the second layer. Since the second layer is made of the purifying agent of the present invention, the second layer adsorbs the interfering substance and the decomposition products therefrom from the first layer, and allows the oily liquid and the polychlorinated biphenyls together with the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent to be passed<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> therethrough. In this way, the polychlorinated biphenyls are separated from the interfering substance. This function of the second layer hardly deteriorates even when a time elapses after the preparation of the purifying agent; thus, when the purifying column of the present invention is used to treat the oily liquid, the interfering substance contained in the oily liquid can be effectively separated from the polychlorinated biphenyls therein. It is therefore possible to prepare a sample for analyzing the polychlorinated biphenyls that is excellent in enhancing the analytical accuracy.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the purifying column of the present invention, the first layer and the second layer may be filled into the same column. Alternatively, the purifying column of the present invention may be divided to include a forward column with which the first layer is packed, and a backward column with which the second layer is packed, wherein the forward column and the backward column are connected to each other so as to be separable from each other.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Still another aspect of the present invention relates to a column system for separating polychlorinated biphenyls from an oily liquid containing the polychlorinated biphenyls in order to analyze the polychlorinated biphenyls. This column system includes a first column and a second column. The first column includes a first layer of a sulfuric acid silica gel, and a second layer of a purifying agent containing a nitrate<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> silica gel yielded by treating an activated silica gel with a mixed aqueous solution of copper nitrate and silver nitrate and then drying the activated gel, arranged below the first layer. The second column is packed with alumina and attachable to and detachable from the second layer side of the first column.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The first column of this separating column system corresponds to the purifying column of the present invention, and as described above, can separate an interfering substance contained in the oily liquid effectively from the polychlorinated biphenyls contained in the oily liquid.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the meantime, when an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent containing the polychlorinated biphenyls and the oily liquid passed through the second layer of the first column is supplied into the second column, the second column captures the polychlorinated biphenyls by its alumina. Thus, the second column allows the oily liquid together with the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent to be passed therethrough. As a result, the polychlorinated biphenyls are separated from the oily liquid.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">When an extracting solvent in which the polychlorinated biphenyls can be dissolved is supplied to the second column and passed therethrough, the polychlorinated biphenyls captured in the second column can be secured as a solution of the extracting solvent. This solution is usable as a sample for analyzing the polychlorinated biphenyls.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The first column of the separating column system of the present invention may be a single column with which the first layer and the second layer are packed.

The resulting decomposition products, together with the polychlorinated biphenyls and any undecomposed interfering substance (mainly any paraffin in a case where the oily liquid is, for example, an electric insulating oil made of a mineral oil), are held in the sulfuric acid silica gel layer. Then, when the sulfuric acid silica gel layer cooled to ordinary temperature is supplied with an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent, the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent passes through the sulfuric acid silica gel layer to be supplied to a nitrite silica gel layer, and then passes through the nitrate silica gel layer. At this time, the polychlorinated biphenyls, a part of the decomposition products, the undecomposed interfering substance, and the oily liquid which are each held in the sulfuric acid silica gel layer are<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> dissolved in the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent supplied to the sulfuric acid silica gel layer, so as to be supplied from the sulfuric acid silica gel layer to the nitrate silica gel layer.

It is usually preferred to use the layers in the state of being filled into a column. A preferred example of the column with which the sulfuric acid silica gel layer, the nitrate silica gel and the alumina layer are packed is that wherein the sulfuric acid silica gel layer and the nitrate silica gel layer are stacked and packed in a single column, and the alumina layer is packed in another column attachable to and detachable from the nitrate silica gel layer side of the other column. Another preferred example is a column system wherein columns with which the sulfuric acid silica gel layer, the nitrate silica gel layer and the alumina layer are packed, respectively, are individually prepared, and these columns are connected to each other in this order so as to be attached to and detached from each other.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the extracting method and analyzing method of the present invention, the direction in which the extracting solvent is supplied to the alumina layer can be set arbitrarily.

However, in the case of the above-described preferred column in which the alumina layer is packed with one of columns, the extracting solvent is supplied to and passed through the alumina layer, preferably in a direction opposite to the direction in which the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent is passed. In the alumina layer, the polychlorinated biphenyls are captured mainly at the end on the supply side of the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent. Thus, when an extracting solvent is supplied to the alumina layer in a direction opposite to the direction in which the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent is passed, the polychlorinated biphenyls captured by the alumina layer are rapidly extracted from the alumina layer with a small amount of the extracting solvent. In this case, therefore, the extracting solvent solution of the polychlorinated biphenyls which is obtainable by supplying the extracting solvent to the alumina layer can turn into so small that the

analysis.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described mainly about a method of extracting PCBs from an oily liquid in order to analyze the PCBs contained in the oily liquid.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In the present invention, examples of an oily liquid from which PCBs are to be extracted, that is, an oily liquid containing PCBs include electric insulating oils used in electrical instruments such as transformers and capacitors,<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> PCB-containing organic solvent wastes generated in chemical experiments or chemical factories, extracts for analysis which are each obtained by extracting PCBs from a PCB-containing sample with an organic solvent, and decomposition process liquids or washing liquids generated in facilities for subjecting PCBs to a decomposition treatment. The electric insulating oils are usually composed of mineral oils consisting primarily of paraffin having relatively high boiling point, naphthene, aromatic compounds or the like obtained by rectifying petroleum and may contain PCBs when PCBs are added to improve electric insulation properties or when PCBs are mixed in a production process.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">For reference, PCBs are compounds including homologues having 1 to 10 chlorine atoms. However, PCBs contained in the electric insulating oils mentioned above are usually compounds having 2 to 8 chlorine atoms.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a description is made about an example of a column system used to carry out a process for extracting PCBs according to the present invention. In the drawing, a column system 1 is provided mainly with a first column 10, a second column 20, and a connecting member 30 for connecting the columns 10 and 20 to each other.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The first column 10 is formed in a cylindrical shape with the lower end 10a contracted in outside diameter and inside diameter, and has openings 11 and 12 at the upper and lower ends,<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> respectively. The first column 10 is made of, for example, glass, or a plastic having solvent-resistance, chemical-resistance and heat-resistance. The inside of the first column 10 is packed with a multilayer silica gel 13. The multilayer silica gel 13 has an upper layer 14 stacked on a lower layer 15.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The upper layer 14 is a layer filled with a sulfuric acid silica gel, that is, a sulfuric acid silica gel layer. The sulfuric acid silica gel used herein is prepared by adding concentrated sulfuric acid uniformly to the surface of activated silica gel, and then drying the activated silica gel. The activated silica gel used herein is usually a gel activated by heating a silica gel. Usually, the amount of concentrated sulfuric acid to be added to the activated silica gel is preferably from 10 to 130% by weight of the activated silica gel.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The lower layer 15 is a layer filled with a purifying agent of the present invention. The purifying agent contains a nitrate silica gel yielded by treating an activated silica gel with a mixed aqueous solution of copper nitrate and silver nitrate and then drying the activated silica gel. Copper nitrate used herein may be a hydrate, for example, a trihydrate, a hexahydrate or a nonahydrate thereof. Usually, it is preferred to use a trihydrate thereof.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The nitrate silica gel may be prepared by adding the above-mentioned mixed aqueous solution uniformly to the surface<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> of an activated silica gel, and then drying the activated silica gel. The mixed aqueous solution is a solution prepared by adding copper nitrate and silver nitrate to purified water such as distilled water and dissolving the nitrates therein. It is usually preferred to use a solution about which at the time of adding the whole amount thereof to the activated silica gel, the respective weights of copper and silver nitrates become 5 to 50% of the weight of the activated silica gel. When a copper nitrate hydrate is used, the amount thereof to be used is determined based on the weight excluding the weight of the hydrated water.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">About the mixed aqueous solution, the addition ratio between copper nitrate and silver nitrate therein is adjusted to set the ratio by mole of the copper element to the silver element (the copper element : the silver element) in the nitrate silica gel preferably into the range of 1 : 0.5 to 2.0, more preferably into the range of 1 : 0.8 to 1.5. The nitrate silica gel generally hardly deteriorates with the passage of time. However, when the ratio of the copper element to the silver element is adjusted in the above range, chemical stability of free water and semi-bonded water therein is enhanced so that the nitrate silica gel can easily keep water of appropriate amount, and additionally, the nitrate silica gel easily keep bonding forces of nitrate ions therein into an appropriate degree. Thus, the deterioration based on the passage of time<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> is less likely to be caused.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In the multilayer silica gel 13, the ratio by weight of the upper layer 14 to the lower layer 15 (the upper layer 14 : the lower layer 15) is desirably set into the range of 2 to 5 : 1. If the proportion of the upper layer 14 is less than this proportion, the purity of PCBs extracted from an oily liquid falls so that the reliability of analysis results thereof may be damaged. By contrast, if the proportion of the upper layer 14 is more than this proportion, the multilayer silica gel 13 may adsorb a part of PCBs so that the recovery rate of the PCBs may be lowered.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In the multilayer silica gel 13, the bulk density of the sulfuric acid silica gel in the upper layer 14 is usually set preferably into the range of 0.3 to 1.1 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, more preferably into the range of 0.5 to 1.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The bulk density of the nitrate silica gel in the lower layer 15 is usually set preferably into the range of 0.3 to 1.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, more preferably into the range of 0.4 to 0.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. When the bulk densities of the upper layer 14 and the lower layer 15 are set in this manner, the developing rate of an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent described later can be appropriately adjusted in the multilayer silica gel 13, and thus in an extracting operation described later, a high-purity PCBs solution less laced with an interfering substance can be obtained by use of the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent in an appropriate amount.<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --></p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The second column 20 is formed in a cylindrical shape having the same outside diameter and inside diameter as the lower end 10a of the first column 10, and the upper end and the lower end thereof have openings 21 and 22, respectively.

When the bulk density of the alumina is set in this manner, the developing rates of the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent and of an extracting solvent, which will be described later, can be appropriately adjusted in the alumina layer 23, and thus in the extracting operation described later, a high-purity PCBs solution less laced with the interfering substance can be obtained by using the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent and the extracting solvent in appropriate amounts,<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> respectively.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The sulfuric acid silica gel, the nitrate silica gel and the alumina used in the column system 1 can be stored after the preparation and used as needed.

Through this connecting member 30, the lower end 10a of the first column 10 and the upper end of the second column 20 can be connected to each other so as to be attached to and detached from each other.

The size of the second column 20 (the size of that portion of the column which can be packed with the alumina layer 23) is<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> preferably from 2.0 to 10.0 mm in inside diameter and from 10 to 200 mm in length.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The following describes a process for extracting PCBs, using the column system 1. Herein, a description is made about an example wherein for the analysis of the concentration of PCBs contained in an oily liquid, the PCBs are extracted from the oily liquid.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, in this extracting process, first, a first heating device 40 is arranged around the upper layer 14 of the first column 10, and further a suction device 50 is fitted to the lower end of the second column 20. The first heating device 40 may be a heater, a Peltier device, or the like, and is used to heat the whole of the upper layer 14 to a required temperature. The suction device 50 has a container 51 capable of hermetically accommodating the lower end of the second column 20 and a pump 52 for reducing the pressure in the container 51. Inside the container 51, a solvent vessel 53 is arranged for receiving an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent described later after passage through the column system 1.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Next, from an oily liquid, a sample is collected in a small or trace amount (usually about 1.0 to 500 mg). This sample is added from the opening 11 in the upper end of the first column 10 to the upper layer 14. The added sample penetrates into the upper layer 14 of the first column 10 so as to be held therein. Then the first heating device 40 is activated thereby heating<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> the upper layer 14 and keeping it heated for a predetermined time. In this way, interfering substances as described above, which are impurities contained in the sample and are substances other than PCBs, in particular, aromatic compounds, react with the sulfuric acid silica gel in the upper layer 14, so that most of the interfering substances decompose. The resulting decomposition products are adsorbed by the upper layer 14 so as to be held therein. Since the sulfuric acid silica gel exhibits a strong dehydrating action, the upper layer 14 effectively absorbs water incorporated in the sample.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In this step, the heating temperature of the upper layer 14 is set at least to 35°C, preferably to 50°C or higher, more preferably 60°C or higher. The upper limit of the heating temperature is not particularly limited. Usually, the limit is preferably 90°C or lower from the viewpoint of safety. If the heating temperature is lower than 35°C, the reaction between the interfering substances contained in the sample and the sulfuric acid silica gel does not advance smoothly, so that the PCBs are not easily extracted from the sample in a short time. Usually, the period for heating the upper layer 14 is set preferably into the range of 10 to 60 minutes. If the heating period is less than 10 minutes, the interfering substances contained in the sample decompose insufficiently. Thus, the interfering substances may be incorporated in a finally-yielded extract of the PCBs.<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --></p><p id="p0057" num="0057">When the oily liquid contains or may contain the interfering substances in a large amount, it is preferred to add the sample to the upper layer 14 of the first column 10 in this step and further add, to the upper layer 14, a hydrocarbon solvent capable of dissolving the sample, that is, the oily liquid. In this way, the sample is diluted with the hydrocarbon solvent so that the contacting efficiency between the sample and the sulfuric acid silica gel is improved to enhance the reaction efficiency therebetween. For this reason, in the upper layer 14, the interfering substances contained in the sample, in particular, the aromatic compounds are efficiently decomposed in a shorter time. As a result, the time required for the extraction of the PCBs can be shortened.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The hydrocarbon solvent usable herein is usually an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent having 5 to 8 carbon atoms, examples thereof including n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, isooctane, and cyclohexane. It is necessary to select, as the hydrocarbon solvent, a solvent having a boiling point not lower than the heating temperature of the upper layer 14. If the boiling point of the hydrocarbon solvent does not satisfy this requirement, the hydrocarbon solvent volatilizes speedily when the first column 10 is heated. Thus, the above-mentioned reaction efficiency does not become high easily.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Usually, the hydrocarbon solvent may be added to the upper<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> layer 14 of the first column 10 just after the sample is added thereto, or may be added to the sample in advance.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The upper layer 14 heated in the above process for the predetermined time is then cooled to ordinary temperature (usually room temperature of about 10 to 30°C) by removing, or turning off the switch of, the first heating unit 40 and then leaving the layer 14.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Next, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, a first reservoir 60 for supplying a solvent to the first column 10 is fitted into the opening 11, at the side of the upper end, of the first column 10, and an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent is stored in the first reservoir 60. When the pump 52 is actuated, the pressure in the container 51 is reduced so that the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent stored in the first reservoir 60 is supplied continuously and gradually to the first column 10. The aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent supplied from the first reservoir 60 into the first column 10 is supplied to the upper layer 14, then passed through the upper layer 14, supplied to the lower layer 15, and passed through the lower layer 15. The aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent passed through the lower layer 15 is then discharged from the opening 12 of the first column 10 through the connecting member 30 and flowed from the opening 21 into the second column 20.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">At this time, the PCBs and the oily liquid retained in the upper layer 14 are dissolved in the aliphatic hydrocarbon<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> solvent, and then passed, together with the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent, through the lower layer 15 into the second column 20. On the other hand, the interfering substances that remain in the upper layer 14 and the decomposition products that are in a free state without being captured by the upper layer 14 are dissolved in the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent, and then transferred into the lower layer 15. The interfering substances and the decomposition products transferred into the lower layer 15 are partially decomposed by the action of the nitrate silica gel, in particular, of nitrate ions dissociated from the nitrate silica gel, while a larger part of them is adsorbed onto the nitrate silica gel to be held therein. As a result, the interfering substances are separated from the PCBs.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent flowed into the second column 20 is passed through the alumina layer 23, and discharged from the opening 22 to be received by the solvent vessel 53 in the container 51. At this time, the PCBs dissolved in the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent from the first column 10 are captured by the alumina layer 23 and retained in the second column 20. PCBs are easily captured by the alumina layer 23 and thus retained mainly in the vicinity of the opening 21 in the upper end of the second column 20. On the other hand, the interfering substances remaining in the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent from the first column 10, the decomposition products<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> therefrom, and the oily liquid are passed through the alumina layer 23, together with the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent, and then received by the solvent vessel 53.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent used in this process is capable of dissolving the PCBs retained in the first column 10 and is usually an aliphatic saturated hydrocarbon solvent having 5 to 8 carbon atoms, for example n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, isooctane, and cyclohexane. Particularly, n-hexane is preferable. It is preferred that the amount of the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent stored in the first reservoir 60, that is, the total amount of the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent supplied into the first column 10 is usually set into the range of 10 to 120 mL. It is also preferred that the rate of feed of the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent from the first reservoir 60 is usually set into the range of 0.2 to 5.0 mL/min. by regulating the depressurized state in the container 51 with the pump 52.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Next, the connecting member 30 is removed to separate the second column 20 and the first column 10 from each other.

The second heating device 70 used herein is similar to the first heating device 40. While the second column 20 is heated to the range of about 35 to 90°C by means of the second heating device 70, the pump 52 is actuated to supply an inert gas such as nitrogen gas or air into the second<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> column 20 through the opening 21 at the upper end. In this way, the solvent such as the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent remaining in the second column 20 is discharged, together with the inert gas, from the opening 22 at the lower end of the second column 20, so that the solvent such as the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent are removed from the alumina layer 23. As a result, the alumina layer 23 in the second column 20 is dried.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Then, the second column 20 is removed from the suction device 50 and turned upside down by inverting it together with the second heating device 70. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, a second reservoir 80 for supplying a solvent is then fitted into the opening 22 of the second column 20 thus turned up by inversion. A predetermined amount of an extracting solvent is supplied into the second reservoir 80.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The extracting solvent supplied into the second reservoir 80 flows naturally by its own weight from the second reservoir 80 into the second column 20, so as to be supplied into the alumina layer 23. The extracting solvent then passes through the alumina layer 23 to be discharged from the opening 21 of the second column 20 thus turned down by inversion. At this time, the extracting solvent from the second reservoir 80 dissolves the PCBs captured by the alumina layer 23, so as to be discharged together with the PCBs from the opening 21. Accordingly, when the extracting solvent discharged from the opening 21 is secured, a solution of the PCBs, that is, the<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> objective extract of the PCBs, is obtained. Since the PCBs are captured mainly in the vicinity of the opening 21 side of the alumina layer 23, substantially the total amount of the PCBs captured by the alumina layer 23 comes to be dissolved in the extracting solvent mainly in a first elute discharged from the second column 20. Accordingly, only by securing the first elute of the extracting solvent discharged from the opening 21, the objective extract of the PCBs can be obtained. This extract consists of the first elute of low volume and is thus in such a small volume as to be easily utilizable in an analytical operation described later.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">In the extraction process, it is preferred to supply the extracting solvent into the second column 20 while the column 20 is heated by means of the second heating device 70. The heating temperature of the second column 20 is usually set so as to adjust the temperature of the alumina layer 23 preferably to at least 35°C, more preferably to 60°C or higher, in particular, about 80°C. The upper limit of the heating temperature is usually about 90°C from the viewpoint of safety. When the second column 20 is heated in this manner, the whole amount of the PCBs captured by the alumina layer 23 can be easily extracted with a smaller amount of the extracting solvent. Thus, the amount of the extract of the PCBs can be set smaller to be further utilizable in the analytical operation described later.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">The extracting solvent used in this extracting step may<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> be selected in accordance with an analyzing method described later. In other words, when gas chromatographic method is used as the analyzing method, a solvent suitable therefor is used. Examples thereof include toluene, a mixed solvent of toluene and an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent (for example, n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, isooctane, cyclohexane and the like), and a mixed solvent of an organochlorine solvent (for example, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, tetrachloromethane and the like), and an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent (for example, n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, isooctane, cyclohexane and the like). Among these solvents, toluene is preferable because by using it in a smaller amount, the PCBs can be extracted from the alumina layer 23.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">When bioassay is used as the analytical method, a solvent suitable therefor is used. Examples thereof include hydrophilic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and methanol.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">The extract of the PCBs obtained by the above-described extracting process is a liquid from which the interfering substances have been removed by the treatment with the column system 1, and is also a liquid obtained by removing the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent from the alumina layer 23 and then supplying the extracting solvent into the second column 20.

In the first column 10 in this case, the forward column 100a is packed with a sulfuric acid silica gel to form an upper layer 14 and the backward column 100b is packed with a nitrate silica gel to form a lower layer 15. When the first column 10 thus constituted is used to extract PCBs from an oily liquid, the forward column 100a only is heated by means of the first heating device 40.</li><li>(2) In the first column 10 or the like, used in the embodiments described above, in which the upper layer 14 and the lower layer 15 have been stacked may be provided between the upper layer 14 and the lower layer 15 with a layer made of<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> a usual silica gel, a glass stable to PCBs and aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents or a cotton matter or fibrous matter made of plastic or the like having solvent-resistance and heat-resistance.

However, the present invention can be used for other purposes. For example, an oily liquid containing PCBs should be disposed of after detoxification of PCBs by decomposition, but when a large amount of the oily liquid should be disposed of, detoxification treatment may be hardly smoothly advanced.
