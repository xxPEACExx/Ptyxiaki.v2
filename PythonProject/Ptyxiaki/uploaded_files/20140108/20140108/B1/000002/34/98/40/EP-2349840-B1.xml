mxw-id="PDES63960997" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</b></heading><heading id="h0002"><b>Field:</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to aircraft and, in particular, to refueling aircraft. Still more particularly, the present disclosure relates to a method, apparatus, and computer usable program code for controlling a refueling boom.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Background:</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Aerial refueling may be a process of transferring fuel from one aircraft to another aircraft. The aircraft from which the fuel originates may be referred to as a tanker, while the other aircraft receiving the fuel may be referred to as a receiver. This type of process may be applied to various types of aircraft, including, for example, without limitation, fixed wing aircraft and/or helicopters.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">One common approach for refueling may involve a boom and receptacle system, like that described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20030209633A"><text>US 2003/0209633</text></patcit>. With a boom, a fixed tube and a telescoping tube may be present on the tanker aircraft. These tubes may also be referred to as a refueling boom or telescoping refueling boom. The refueling boom may be attached to the rear of the tanker aircraft and may be maneuverable allowing movement along an x-axis and a y-axis relative to the tanker. An operator may extend and/or position the refueling boom for insertion into a receptacle on the receiving aircraft to transfer fuel to the receiving aircraft.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Tanker aircraft also may have auxiliary power units for various functions on the tanker aircraft. The auxiliary power unit has an exhaust plume that may intersect with the refueling boom when the refueling boom is elevated and fully extended towards a horizontal position with respect to the tanker. When stowing the refueling boom, it may be desirable to retract the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> refueling boom such that the refueling boom does not interfere with and/or contact exhaust from an auxiliary power unit in the tanker aircraft. Also, operation of the auxiliary power unit, while the refueling boom is extended beyond a certain distance within some angle of elevation with respect to the tanker, may be undesirable.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Currently, a refueling boom operator may operate the refueling boom to retract the refueling boom when stowing the refueling boom to avoid interference with exhaust from an auxiliary power unit. This type of process requires an operator to remember to retract the refueling boom before elevating the refueling boom to stow the refueling boom.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Other solutions may include turning off the auxiliary power unit, redirecting exhaust, and/or relocating the auxiliary power unit to avoid conflicts with the refueling boom. Redesigning and/or moving the auxiliary power unit may be time consuming and expensive.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Further, a refueling boom operator may control the ruddevators for a refueling boom to control the pitch and yaw of the refueling boom. The flexibility of the refueling boom may add a challenge to positioning the refueling boom when a refueling boom operator manipulates a control stick to operate the refueling boom. Movement of the ruddevators may be performed in concert or together since the refueling boom uses a pitch and yaw pivot, while the ruddevators may be in a "V" configuration. Converting from the motion of the refueling boom to directions controlled by the ruddevators in a manner that allows for effective control in moving the refueling boom may be difficult.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Existing solutions may use a mechanical pantograph that sums the positive position feedback and control stick inputs to combine the feedback and the mixing of the elevation and azimuth axes into the ruddevator deflections. Also, in some aircraft, the control surfaces may be in the same direction as the axes of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> motion. This type of solution for positioning a refueling boom may be tied to a specific configuration and may not be easily adapted to new configurations.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Therefore, it would be desirable to have a method, apparatus, and computer program code that overcomes one or more of the issues described above, as well as other possible issues.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention provides a method for controlling a refueling boom according to claim 1, and an apparatus according to clam 11.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A length of the refueling boom is sensed to form an identified length for the refueling boom.

The extending of the refueling boom may be prevented when the refueling boom is stowed against the aircraft.

The extending of the refueling boom may be prevented when the elevation of the refueling boom is within a threshold.
