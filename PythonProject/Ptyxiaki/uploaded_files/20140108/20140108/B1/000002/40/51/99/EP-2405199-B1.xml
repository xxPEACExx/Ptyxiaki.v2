Such devices are composed of a pair of electrodes, made of metal material, covered by a covering body made of insulating material.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Both the electrodes are generally connected to high-voltage electric current generating means by means of cables. Such generating means produce a high-voltage electric pulse which is transmitted by a cable connection to the electrodes such that a spark is generated between the pair of electrodes igniting the flame inside the combustion chamber of the boiler.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Boilers currently on the market have also electronic elements, in particular electronic boards, which are used both for safety controls, and for adjusting the boiler operation, such as for example for modifying the temperature or the ignition time of the boiler.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The high-voltage pulse flowing through the cable connecting the electrode to the current generating means produces electromagnetic fields affecting the operation of the electronic components inside the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> boiler causing the electronic boards to malfunction and generally to be damaged, preventing them and consequently the boiler from being properly used.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Moreover inside the cable a current leakage inevitably is generated preventing the yield of the high-voltage pulse used for igniting the flame from being optimized, increasing current consumption in order to create a potential between the two electrodes in order to ignite the boiler.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Finally due to the reasons described above and due to manufacturing technical problems mainly related to the high temperatures in question, generated by the high-voltage pulse, it is difficult to efficiently integrate all the components of the ignition devices for boilers.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The operating conditions of the several components do not allow electrodes and their insulating cover, the electronic boards and the high-voltage electric pulse generating means to be provided in a single body without providing various types of connections and/or interfaces.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2001248838B"><text>JP 2001248838</text></patcit> relates to a standard igniting electrode, for gas boilers, wherein a particular system for the electrical connection to the igniter has been provided overcoming the problems related to the electrical connection to the igniter, namely the electrode is directly connected to the igniter.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US4222089A"><text>US 4,222,089</text></patcit> relates to an oil burner providing an integrated system of components having an<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> output for the connection of high-voltage electrodes, but not including the electrodes.

In this case the ends of both the electrodes are connected directly, and preferably without interruption, to the wire forming the output winding of the coil.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">By the coil comprising at least a primary winding and a secondary winding which are galvanically isolated each other and the low voltage signal being supplied to one of them, while the other one supplies the high voltage signal it is possible to galvanically isolate the high voltage circuit for generating the spark and<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> which comprises at least one of the windings of the coil connected to at least one preferably both the electrodes between which the spark has to be generated.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">When both the electrodes are connected to a winding one of the electrodes is connected to an end and the other one is connected to the opposite end or to an intermediate end of the same winding, generally the so called secondary winding.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As it is known the coil transforms an input pulse into a high-voltage pulse.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The very proximity of the electric pulse generating source, preferably with no connection to the ground of the boiler, where electrodes have a different potential one with respect to the other, by the generation of the high-voltage spark, allows leakages generated inside the cable and on the ground of the boiler to be almost completely removed and at the same time electromagnetic fields affecting electronic components are not provided.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Preferably the device of the present invention is made by generating the high-voltage by a capacitive and low energy system.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The electrode supporting means are preferably composed of a casing or a case at least the covering body of both the electrodes connected to the electric pulse generating means being fastened or can be fastened to one wall thereof.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The different configurations described provide several advantages for the device of the present invention. There are advantages concerning the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> construction and the assembly of the device, in addition to those previously described and mainly concerning the functional point of view. First of all the fact of using a single material for making a housing for the pulse generating means and for the outer covering body of the electrodes provides a more reliable complete product, since the great amount of components is reduced to a single piece, thus reducing both maintenance costs and purchasing costs. The assembly is simplified too, since only one piece already containing all the system has to be fastened to one wall of the boiler, without providing cables for connecting a component to another one.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Moreover such configuration allows the metal mounting for fastening the electrode to be removed reducing not only the costs but also considerably increasing the reliability and simplicity as regards the construction and production perspective, by means of a very customized device, that is a single piece that can have several shapes matching user requirements, while keeping a high reliability and low costs.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Preferably each one of the electrodes of the pair of electrodes extends without interruption from a first end outside the insulating covering body and for a portion outside the insulating covering body, through said body and by the other end it extends inside the case housing the high-voltage electric pulse generating means and it is connected by said end directly to the power supply output of the high-voltage electric pulse<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> generating means.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Particularly as regards the embodiment wherein current generating means are composed of a high-voltage transformer coil and of an electronic circuit, both the ends of the electrodes inside the housing case are directly connected to the coil, which is inside the housing case too, by means of a through hole provided on a face of the case allowing the electrode end to pass inside the housing case.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Such configuration, from the functional point of view, has the important advantage of avoiding high-voltage to be carried inside the boiler, moreover avoiding a high-voltage end to be carried on the boiler frame which generally is at the common ground potential.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The ignition device for boilers or the like of the present invention is particularly suitable for the use with gas boilers, particularly condensing boilers and therefore it is suitable for operating at high temperatures developing among the different components, temperatures that can reach values exceeding 130°C.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Considering the processing possibilities combined with the insulation properties, the supporting means for the pair of electrodes, or at least a part thereof, are preferably made of a ceramic material.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Particularly said ceramic material is a high temperature resistant material, having an operating temperature ranging from 1100°C to 1900°C, preferably from 1300°C to 1700°C, particularly 1500°C.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">It has to be specified that such temperatures<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> relate to the temperatures reached inside the combustion chamber of the boiler upon which the device of the present invention is mounted.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Moreover said ceramic material is composed of alumina that has a firing temperature ranging from 1200°C to 2000°C, preferably from 1400°C to 1800°C, particularly 1600°C.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">According to an improvement of the device of the present invention the housing case constituting the supporting means for the electrodes has fastening means acting for fastening the ignition device according to the present invention to a further user apparatus, such as a boiler or the like.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Preferably such fastening means are made in the form of at least a through hole provided on the surface of one of the walls of the housing case, or on extensions of one of the faces, for any tightening elements known in the prior art, such as for example a screw passing into the through hole and going into the wall of the user apparatus.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">According to a particular embodiment the housing case is a parallepiped case having position-holding means therein for at least the coil and/or the electronic circuit and/or the electrodes. In particular the walls of such case, inside it, delimit an housing space that can be closed by closing members.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Advantageously position-holding means act also for fastening the electrode and the coil within the housing space and preferably are composed of a substance filling the housing space such that both the coil and<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> the electronic circuit and the ends of the electrode are embedded into the substance.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Such substance advantageously constitutes also the means for closing the housing space of the case.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">A thermosetting polymer is preferably used, in particular an epoxy resin, for filling the housing space and for embedding the components within the space.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Moreover the inner walls, if made of ceramic material, of the case delimiting the housing space can be provided not to be enameled and to have recesses, or grooves, throughout the surface such to facilitate the bonding/attachment of the resin.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In addition to the several advantages already described above, this particular solution gives the device of the present invention the further advantage that the electrode does not require to be fastened inside the insulating covering, it being embedded by the epoxy resin.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The arrangement of the components, the fastening system integrated into the housing case and the power supply made also by means of integrated cables, contribute, also due to their constructional characteristic, to overcome the problems caused by the integration of the high-voltage part with the pair of electrodes, till forming a single system that is monolithic and without interruption from the end of the electrode to the terminal of a possible power supply cable.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">According to an improvement of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> invention the supporting means made as one piece with said covering body are composed of a mixture of insulating materials, among such insulating materials at least one is a ceramic material.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Advantageously it is possible to provide the supporting means to be composed of different materials, preferably insulating materials, for example it is possible to provide some walls of the housing case to be made of a specific insulating material, such as ceramic material, and the remaining walls to be made of a different material, which is insulating too. In particular it is possible to provide the covering body of both the electrodes to be made of the same material as the case wall intended for fastening it, while the remaining walls can be made of a different material, such as for example a plastic material, a resin with electric insulation properties or the like.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">An embodiment provides both the covering bodies of both the electrodes and the case wall fastening them to be made of a ceramic material, while the remaining walls of the housing case to be made of a thermosetting material or vice versa. The resin acting for fastening the elements inside the housing space and for closing it in this case acts also for fastening the two different material as a single piece.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In this case, a particular variant embodiment provides a plate-like base element with two tubular projections extending from a face thereof, said plate-like element and said tubular projections being made of an insulating material, for example a ceramic material.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> Said tubular projections are the insulating coverings of the two electrodes, while the plate-like element constitutes a wall of the case housing the high-voltage pulse generating means, in particular the coil and the electronic circuit supplying the coil.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Inside each tubular projection a conducting wire is housed which comes out at the side of the plate-like element opposite to the projections and from the terminal end of said projections opposite to said side. The ends at the side of the plate-like element opposite to the tubular projections are connected to an end respectively of a secondary winding of a coil the power supply electronic circuit being connected to the primary winding thereof, said connections are all direct connections. The remaining part of the case which encloses and covers outwardly the coil, the electronic circuit and the ends of the conducting wires of the two electrodes and in case also the power supply wires of the electric cicuit, that is the terminals for connecting said wires to said ciruit is composed of a block made of hardening insulating material having such a shape and volume to embed by covering on all the sides said elements by adhering against the side of the plate-like element opposite to the tubular projections. In this case the material can be a thermosetting resin or the like.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The part of the case made of resin can be easily obtained by casting or molding it into a mold, the plate-like element being one of the wall thereof.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Again according to a characteristic, the plate-like<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> element can have fastening holes on peripheral extensions.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Moreover on the face adhering to the block made of hardening material said plate-like element can have attachments for the material of the block which can have different shapes such as for example webs, ribs, teeth, projection parts with or without enlarged heads or shapes intended to form undercuts wherein the material of the block is engaged once it hardens generating a mutual interlocking mechanical fit.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In order to increase the safety level of the device of the present invention a variant embodiment provides a thermal breaker between the ends of both the electrodes inside the housing space and the coil.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Moreover the ignition device for boilers or the like according to the present invention provides a cable for power supplying it which is connected to the electronic board. A portion of said power supply cable is therefore housed into the housing space which is held in place by filling the housing space with the resin. The invention relates also to other characteristics further improving the ignition device for boilers or the like described above and which are the subject of the subclaims.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">These and other characteristics and advantages of the present invention will be more clear from the following description of some embodiments shown in annexed drawings wherein:
