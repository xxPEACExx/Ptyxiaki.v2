Meanwhile, reality (e.g., heaviness and massiveness) close to that in the real helicopter is often sought in the radio-controlled helicopter by radio-controlled helicopter lovers, for example.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However, the radio-controlled helicopter is inevitably inferior in terms of reality partially because of its smallness in size in comparison with the real helicopter.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Moreover, since more lightweight material has to be used in the radio-controlled helicopter, material as used in the real helicopter cannot always be used in the radio-controlled helicopter as it is. This is also considered to be a factor in impairing reality in the radio-controlled helicopter.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A rotor blade of a radio-controlled helicopter constituted of carbon fiber, fiberglass or wood (balsa), for example, is prevailing. These materials are suitable as a material of a rotor blade of a radio-controlled helicopter due to their light weight and high strength. Not only suitable as a material of a rotor blade of a radio-controlled helicopter, these materials are also suitable as a material of a wing of a model aircraft in general (e.g., radio-controlled aircraft).</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">On the other hand, when a rotor blade of a radio-controlled helicopter is constituted of a material such as carbon fiber, fiberglass or wood (balsa), it is difficult to obtain reality as in the real<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> helicopter and, therefore, demands of radio-controlled helicopter lovers are not fulfilled.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention was made in view of the above problems and is applicable to a model rotorcraft. An object of the present invention is to provide a rotor blade that provides reality closer to that in a real rotorcraft and a method of manufacturing the rotor blade.</p><heading id="h0005">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">The invention provides a rotor blade of a model rotorcraft, according to claim 1 and a method of manufacturing thereof according to claim 3.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A rotor blade (a rotor blade of a model rotorcraft) according to a first aspect of this present invention, which was made to achieve the above object, is made of an aluminum alloy tubing having an elongated cylindrical shape and desired dimensions by roll-forming,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> in which, while feeding the aluminum alloy tubing by means of a feeder that feeds the aluminum alloy tubing, pressure is applied to the aluminum alloy tubing from opposed two directions. The aluminum alloy tubing is roll-formed such that a cross-section thereof viewed from one longitudinal end thereof has an airfoil section shape and an integral hollow structure is formed inside the aluminum alloy tubing. The rotor blade can be used as a main rotor (main rotor blade) as well as a tail rotor (tail rotor blade) in a radio-controlled helicopter, for example.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">An aluminum alloy is an alloy consisting primarily of aluminum. Aluminum itself is lightweight and soft, and becomes a high-strength metal material (aluminum alloy) when alloyed with copper, manganese, silicon, magnesium, zinc, nickel and the like, for example. Such an aluminum alloy is a preferable material of a rotor blade of a model rotorcraft (especially, a radio-controlled helicopter) because an aluminum alloy is lightweight and high in strength as well as providing a heavy and massive atmosphere peculiar to metal due to its metallic composition.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Nevertheless, a specific gravity of an aluminum alloy is greater than that of carbon fiber, fiberglass, wood (balsa) or the like, for example. Consequently, when an aluminum alloy is used, there still arises a problem in terms of weight. Specifically, if an aluminum alloy is merely adopted as a material of a rotor blade of a model rotorcraft, it will be difficult or impossible to let the model rotorcraft fly due to its weight.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In this regard, the rotor blade of the first aspect of the present invention has a hollow structure (has a cavity inside thereof) because the rotor blade is constituted by forming an aluminum alloy tubing, i.e., a tubular material consisting of an aluminum alloy. Specifically, an integral hollow structure is formed inside the rotor blade.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In other words, the weight of the entire rotor blade can be significantly reduced because the inside of the rotor blade is hollow and the hollow part is configured not to include metal (aluminum alloy). Consequently, the above-described problem related to weight can be solved.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Further, since the rotor blade of the first aspect of the present invention is formed based on the aluminum alloy tubing, the rotor blade has a seamless single-layer structure (integral structure), which secures sufficient strength.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Moreover, the rotor blade is very advantageous in terms of manufacturing man-hour and manufacturing cost because the above-described hollow structure and single-layer structure (integral structure) are achieved by a very simple constitution in which the originally hollow (cylindrical) aluminum alloy tubing is shaped. In short, manufacturing man-hour and manufacturing cost can be suppressed. As for a length, a wall thickness, cross-sectional dimensions and the like of the aluminum alloy tubing, they may be chosen in accordance with a size and the like of the model rotorcraft on which the rotor blade is installed, thereby to conform to a length<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> and a size (area) of an airfoil section shape required as the rotor blade of the model rotorcraft. As for an airfoil section shape, a standard or norm has been defined. Therefore, the airfoil section of the rotor blade may be determined in conformity with the standard or norm.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As described above, the rotor blade of the first aspect of the present invention is configured to be so lightweight as to be used in the model rotorcraft (e.g., the radio-controlled helicopter) without problems and also configured to provide a heavy and massive atmosphere. Therefore, according to the model rotorcraft in which the rotor blade of the first aspect of the present invention is used, reality close to that in a real rotorcraft is obtained and demands of radio-controlled helicopter lovers, for example, can be fulfilled. Furthermore, it is possible to manufacture the model rotorcraft at lower cost.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">A rotor blade according to a second aspect of this present invention, which was made to achieve the above object, is made of an aluminum alloy tubing having an elongated cylindrical shape and desired dimensions by press-forming with a mold such that a cross-section of the aluminum alloy tubing viewed from one longitudinal end thereof has an airfoil section shape and an integral hollow structure is formed inside the aluminum alloy tubing. The rotor blade can be used as a main rotor (main rotor blade) as well as a tail rotor (tail rotor blade) in a radio-controlled helicopter, for example.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The rotor blade of the second aspect of the present invention is press-formed from the aluminum alloy tubing with a mold and, as with the rotor blade of the first aspect of the present invention, has a hollow structure to achieve a significant weight reduction. According to the rotor blade of the second aspect of the present invention, the rotor blade can be used in the model rotorcraft (e.g., the radio-controlled helicopter) without problems and also can provide a heavy and massive atmosphere as with the rotor blade of the first aspect of the present invention. Therefore, the model rotorcraft can obtain reality close to that in a real rotorcraft.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The rotor blade of the present invention may be formed of an aluminum alloy tubing having a structure in which both longitudinal ends thereof are closed. When such an aluminum alloy tubing is formed, internal pressure may rise due to a decline in volume inside the aluminum alloy tubing. In such a case, pressure is applied outward from inside of the aluminum alloy tubing (from inside of the rotor blade) and, therefore, it is possible to allow the rotor blade to become resistant to unnecessary external pressure. In other words, the rotor blade can be configured not to be easily deformed thanks to its internal air pressure even if any external force that could unnecessarily deform the rotor blade is applied thereto after being manufactured. Further, even in a case where part of the rotor blade is dented due to unnecessary external force, the internal air pressure may work as a restoring force to allow the dented part to be restored to its original normal shape.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The present invention also provides a method of manufacturing a rotor blade of a model rotorcraft. The method comprises: a step of forming an aluminium alloy product having an elongated cylindrical shape and desired dimensions, such that a cross-section of the aluminum alloy product viewed from one longitudinal end thereof has an airfoil section shape and an integral hollow structure is formed inside the aluminum alloy product. The aluminum alloy product is an aluminum alloy tubing. The forming step is either: (a) a roll-forming step, the step including: a step of feeding the aluminum alloy tubing by means of a feeder that feeds the aluminum alloy tubing, and a step of applying pressure to the aluminum alloy tubing from opposed two directions; or (b) a press-forming step, where the aluminum alloy product is formed with a mold.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Therefore, according to a third aspect of this present invention, which was made to achieve the above object, there is a method for manufacturing a rotor blade of a model rotorcraft which comprises a step of roll-forming an elongated cylindrical aluminum alloy tubing having desired dimensions such that a cross-section of the aluminum alloy tubing viewed from one longitudinal end thereof has an airfoil section shape and an integral hollow structure is formed inside the aluminum alloy tubing. The above method includes a step of feeding the aluminum alloy tubing by means of a feeder that feeds the aluminum alloy tubing, and a step of applying pressure to the aluminum alloy tubing from opposed two directions.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">According to such a manufacturing method, the rotor blade of the present invention as described above can be manufactured through a simple process. Consequently, manufacturing man-hour and manufacturing cost can be suppressed.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Further, according to a fourth aspect of this present invention, which was made to achieve the above object, there is a method for manufacturing a rotor blade of a model rotorcraft which comprises a step of press-forming an elongated cylindrical aluminum alloy tubing having desired dimensions with a mold such that a cross-section of the aluminum alloy tubing viewed from one longitudinal end thereof has an airfoil section shape and an integral hollow structure is formed inside the aluminum alloy tubing.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">According to such a manufacturing method, the rotor blade of the present invention as described above can be manufactured through a simple process.

Since the main rotor blade 5a, to which the present invention is applied, is manufactured by forming the aluminum alloy tubing 10, the main rotor blade 5a has a seamless single-layer structure (integral structure) and has sufficient strength as well.

For example, the main rotor blade 5a may be manufactured of an aluminum alloy tubing which is rectangular in section and tubular. In some cases, the main rotor blade 5a may be manufactured of an aluminum alloy tubing which is triangular in section and tubular. Alternatively, the aluminum alloy tubing 10<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> may be trapezoid in section, and any generally available aluminum alloy tubing can be used as a material.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">The tail rotor blade 6a also has an airfoil section shape as with the main rotor blade 5a and, therefore, the present invention can be also applied to manufacture of the tail rotor blade 6a.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">In the main rotor blade 5a of the above embodiment, thermal treatment may be performed.

By performing plating, corrosion resistance, for example, can be improved. Further, smoother and glossier finished surface can be obtained, which can add more value. The smoother finished surface can inhibit turbulence of air flowing around the blade when the same is rotating, and the primary function as a rotor blade can be thereby enhanced.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Needless to say, some processing such as surface polishing, painting, and surface coating with film may be applied to the main rotor blade 5a of the above embodiment.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">In the above first and second embodiments, it is possible to use the aluminum alloy tubing 10 with both longitudinal ends thereof closed (with its inside hermetically sealed). In such a case, very small air holes may be provided on the side wall of the aluminum alloy tubing 10 such that air inside the aluminum alloy tubing 10 may escape outwardly at the time of processing. Then, the aluminum alloy tubing 10 with very small air holes may be formed<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> into the shape of the main rotor blade 5a. Such a processing can inhibit the internal air pressure from excessively increasing, which facilitates processing and inhibits the main rotor blade 5a from being deformed by the internal excessive air pressure. However, there is also an advantage in a case where the internal air pressure is increased, which will be described later.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Another method is possible in which the aluminum alloy tubing 10 is processed under low temperature to suppress increase in air pressure inside the aluminum alloy tubing 10 only during processing instead of providing very small air holes on the side wall of the aluminum alloy tubing 10. According to such a method, the internal air pressure is inhibited from excessively increasing during processing, thereby to facilitate the processing. When the processed aluminum alloy tubing 10 is placed under ordinary temperature after the processing, the internal air pressure is possibly increased with a rise in temperature from low temperature to ordinary temperature.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">Advantages in using the aluminum alloy tubing 10 with the inside thereof in hermetically sealed conditions may be as follows:
<ul><li>Specifically, when the aluminum alloy tubing 10 is plastic-worked into the shape of the main rotor blade 5a, the internal pressure is possibly increased by a decrease in volume inside the main rotor blade 5a. In such a case, pressure is applied outward from inside of the main rotor blade 5a and, therefore, it is possible to allow the main rotor blade 5a to have a resistance against<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> unnecessary external pressure. In other words, even if an external force is applied after the main rotor blade 5a is manufactured in such a manner as to unnecessarily deform the main rotor blade 5a, the internal air pressure enables the main rotor blade 5a not to be deformed easily. Further, even in a case where part of the main rotor blade 5a should be dented by unnecessary external force, the internal air pressure works as a restoring force to possibly allow the dented part to be restored to its original normal shape. In this case, processing such as thermal treatment, plating, and the like may be performed on the main rotor blade 5a.
