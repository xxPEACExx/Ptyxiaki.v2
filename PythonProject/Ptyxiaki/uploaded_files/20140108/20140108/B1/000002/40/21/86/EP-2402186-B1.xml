In this Patent Document 1, it is disclosed that outside air introduced form an outside of a vehicle is heated by a condenser and then introduced into a compartment. Then, heat is collected by a condenser from inside air to be discharged from the compartment is discharged and then the air is discharged to an outside of the compartment. Here, an operation of the compressor is stopped when room temperature is low. In this control, the heat is collected from the air to be discharged from the compartment and dehumidification is functioned even in an extremely low temperature state where a heat pump operation cannot be done due to negative suction pressure of refrigerant suctioned to the compressor.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In addition, another conventional control for an electric compressor is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2009264206A"><text>2009-264206</text></patcit> (Patent Document 2).
