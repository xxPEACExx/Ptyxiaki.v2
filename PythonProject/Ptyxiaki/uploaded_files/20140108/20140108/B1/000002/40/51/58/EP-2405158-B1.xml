<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2006009292A1"><text>WO 2006/009292 A1</text></patcit>, describes a friction gearing according to the preamble of claim 1, comprising an input shaft (20) an input disk (21), and an output disk (31) wherein rollers (50) rolling in contact with the input disk (21) and the output disk (31) are arranged around the input shaft 20.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">A patent document 1 discloses a commonly known driving force distribution device. This driving force distribution device is configured to transmit torque through indirect radial pressing contact between a first roller and a second roller with a torque capacity varying according to a state of the inter-roller radial pressing contact.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Patent document 1 proposes an idea that both of the rollers are supported by a common support plate, and housed in a housing, wherein the support plate bears a reaction force caused by the inter-roller radial pressing contact, and the housing is prevented from being reached by the reaction force.<br/>
Patent document 1: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2002349653A"><text>JP 2002-349653 A</text></patcit></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In order to make a friction gearing of this type capable of varying its transmitted torque capacity, it is necessary to configure the friction gearing to vary the inter-roller radial pressing force. This is implemented by a configuration that one of first and second rollers, for<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> example, the second roller, is made capable of being displaced with respect to the first roller so that the inter-roller radial pressing force can be varied according to the relative radial displacement of the second roller.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The following considers a situation in which the second roller is made to approach the first roller radially so as to increase the inter-roller radial pressing force (transmitted torque capacity). In this situation, the rotation axis of the second roller approaches the rotation axis of the first roller, and thereby increases an offset from a center of a torque transmitting shaft that transmits torque between the second roller and itself. The increase in the offset causes an increase in a relative radial displacement to be absorbed by a universal coupling between the second roller and the torque transmitting shaft, and thereby serves to adversely affect the durability of a driveline including the universal coupling.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">On the other hand, in the situation in which the second roller is made to approach the first roller radially so as to increase the inter-roller radial pressing force (transmitted torque capacity), the reaction force increases so as to increase an amount of extension of the common rotation support plate due to a stretching force acting on the first roller and the second roller away from each other.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The increase in the amount of extension of the rotation support plate serves to reduce the offset between the rotation axis of the second roller and the center of the torque transmitting shaft in the situation where the inter-roller transmitted torque capacity is increased. By nature,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> this serves to reduce the offset (relative radial displacement) that is to be absorbed by the universal coupling between the second roller and the torque transmitting shaft, and thereby enhance the durability of the driveline including the second roller and the torque transmitting shaft.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, patent document 1 and other conventional documents are silent at all about how to arrange the rotation support plate with respect to the housing. If the rotation support plate is attached to a section of the housing between the first roller and the second roller based a common idea without no special idea about arrangement of the rotation support plate with respect to the housing, it is impossible to take full advantage of the function of reducing the increase in the offset between the rotation axis of the second roller and the center of the torque transmitting shaft in the situation where the inter-roller transmitted torque capacity is increased, and thereby enhancing the durability of the driveline, and there is room to improve this point, as described in the following.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Specifically, if the rotation support plate is attached to the section of the housing between the first roller and the second roller, the stretching force acting on the first roller and the second roller away from each other serves to extend the rotation support plate toward the first roller side on one hand, and extend the rotation support plate toward the second roller side on the other hand, so that the amount of extension of the rotation support plate<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> is divided between the first roller side and the second roller side.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In this connection, only the amount of extension of the rotation support plate toward the second roller side can contribute to the function of reducing the increase in the offset between the rotation axis of the second roller and the center of the torque transmitting shaft, and thereby enhancing the durability of the driveline. Accordingly, if the rotation support plate is attached to the section of the housing between the first roller and the second roller, it is just possible to take half advantage of the function of reducing the increase in the offset between the rotation axis of the second roller and the center of the torque transmitting shaft, and thereby enhancing the durability of the driveline.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to propose a friction gearing capable of taking full advantage of the function of reducing the increase in the offset between the rotation axis of the second roller and the center of the torque transmitting shaft, and thereby enhancing the durability of the driveline.<br/>

The radial pressing force between first roller 31 and second roller 32 acts on input shaft 12 through first roller 31, and thereby serves to cause bending deformation of input shaft 12 between ball bearings 14, 15 which serves as bearings to support input shaft 12 with respect to housing 11.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">In the first embodiment, there is a clearance between bearing support 23, 25 and inner wall 11a of housing 11 so that bearing support 23, 25 can move in the direction indicated by arrow A1, A2 toward the inner wall 11a, and therefore cannot resist the inter-roller radial pressing force to cause bending deformation of input shaft 12 between ball bearings 14, 15 as described above.
