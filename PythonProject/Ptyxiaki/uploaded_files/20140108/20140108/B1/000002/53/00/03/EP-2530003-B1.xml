and a cylindrical nut having a tapered surface, wherein the handle weight is rigidly fixed to a handle pipe due to a wedge action generated by pushing the cylindrical nut into the cylindrical portion (see <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP10067376A"><text>JP 10067376 A</text></patcit>, for example). There, the vibration isolation property is enhanced by integrally mounting a vibration absorbing rod which extends toward a center side in the vehicle widthwise direction on the cylindrical nut.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, in the above-mentioned conventional handle weight mounting structure, the handle weight is rigidly mounted on the handle pipe and hence, there may be a case where the vibration isolation property cannot be sufficiently ensured.

In this case, the outer end portion of the bolt insertion hole of the handle weight in the vehicle widthwise direction projects more outward than the outer side surface of the handle weight, and the knuckle guard is fastened to the outer end portion of the bolt insertion hole in the vehicle widthwise direction by the bolt at a spigot and hence, the number of parts for fastening the knuckle guard can be decreased, and also the knuckle guard is fastened to the outer end portion of the handle weight in the vehicle widthwise direction whereby the knuckle guard can be supported in a stable manner.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Further, a mounting portion (54) of the knuckle guard (50) on an outer side in the vehicle widthwise direction may be formed in an approximately U-shape opening rearward, projecting portions (97, 97) which project toward an opening portion side may be formed on both open edges (96, 96) of a U-shaped portion (95) which face each other in an opposed manner, and a rear member (98) which occupies the opening portion of the U-shaped portion (95) of the knuckle guard (50) and is engaged with the projecting portions (97, 97) may be provided as a part separate from the knuckle guard (50).<br/>

The weight fixing bolt 56 is inserted into the bolt insertion hole 62 from the outside. An inner diameter of the bolt insertion hole 62 on a circular cylindrical portion 61 side is set larger than an inner diameter of the bolt insertion hole 62 on a weight body 60 side so as to allow the engagement of the nut member 57 with the bolt insertion hole 62.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">A circular cylindrical end portion 62A positioned on an outer side of the bolt insertion hole 62 in the vehicle widthwise direction (an outer end portion in the vehicle widthwise direction) projects outwardly from an outer side surface 60A of the weight body 60.

As described above, the knuckle guard 50 is fitted on the handle weight 55 at a spigot, and is fastened together with the handle weight 55 using the weight fixing bolt 56 and hence, the number of parts for fastening the knuckle guard 50 can be decreased.

Further, the pawl portions 79, 79 are connected to the outer-end-side rubber member 75 and hence, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of a situation where an operation of the dynamic damper 58 is impeded by the mounting member 59 whereby the favorable vibration isolation property can be acquired.<br/>
Further, the dynamic damper 58 is provided independently from the handle weight 55 and hence, the dynamic damper 58 can be effectively operated whereby the favorable vibration isolation property can be acquired. Still further, the vibration isolation property can be adjusted independently between the handle weight 55 and the dynamic damper 58 and hence, the vibration isolation property can be easily set and changed.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Here, the steps of mounting the handle weight 55 and the dynamic damper 58 are explained in conjunction with <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>.<br/>

Next, the handle weight 55 is inserted into the handle pipe 16.

With such an operation, the handle weight 55 is fixed to the handle pipe 16 due to a wedge action of the nut member 57. The handle weight 55 is positioned in the axial direction of the handle pipe 16 due to the contact of the contact portion 65 with the outer end 16C.

That is, when a load which pushes the knuckle guard 50 frontwardly acts exceeding a predetermined value, the rear member 98 is pushed by a rear portion of the circular cylindrical end portion 62A (<figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>) of the handle weight 55 and is removed rearwardly and hence, the knuckle guard 50 can be removed frontwardly such that the circular cylindrical end portion 62A is allowed to pass through the U-shaped portion 95 thus releasing the load acting on the knuckle guard 50.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">As has been explained heretofore, according to the embodiment to which the present invention is applied, the handle weight mounting structure includes: the hollow handle pipe 16; the handle weight 55 which is arranged in the handle pipe 16 by insertion from the outer end 16C of the handle pipe 16, wherein the handle weight 55 is provided with the bolt insertion hole 62 which has the tapered portion 64A on the inner portion thereof in the vehicle widthwise direction and the split groove 63; the nut member 57 which is formed into a tapered shape and is engaged with the split-groove 63 side of the handle weight 55; and the weight fixing bolt 56 which is made to pass through the bolt insertion hole 62 formed in the handle weight 55 and fastens the handle weight 55 and the nut member 57, wherein the mounting member<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> 59 for the dynamic damper 58 which is supported in the inside of the handle pipe 16 in a floating state is mounted on the nut member 57 and hence, the dynamic damper 58 can be supported in the inside of the handle pipe 16 by the mounting member 59.

Still further, the knuckle guard 50 is rigidly supported on the holder member 35 on the center side of the handle pipe 16 in the vehicle widthwise direction and the handle weight 55 by the bolt 92 and hence, the knuckle guard 50 becomes a so-called closed type whereby the knuckle guard 50 can be firmly fixed, and the vibration isolation property can be also enhanced by the handle weight 55 and the dynamic damper 58.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Further, the circular cylindrical end portion 62A on the vehicle widthwise outer side of the bolt insertion hole 62 formed in the handle weight 55<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> projects outward from the outer side surface 60A of the handle weight 55, and the knuckle guard 50 is fastened to the circular cylindrical end portion 62A of the bolt insertion hole 62 by the weight fixing bolt 56 at a spigot and hence, the number of parts for fastening the knuckle guard 50 can be decreased, and also the knuckle guard 50 is fastened to the circular cylindrical end portion 62A on a vehicle widthwise outer side of the handle weight 55 whereby the knuckle guard 50 can be supported in a stable manner.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Further, the outer mounting portion 54 of the knuckle guard 50 on the vehicle widthwise outer side is formed into an approximately U-shape opening rearward, the projecting portions 97, 97 which project toward the opening portion side are formed on both open edges 96, 96 of the U-shaped portion 95 which face each other in an opposed manner, the rear member 98 which occupies the opening portion of the U-shaped portion 95 of the knuckle guard 50 and is engaged with the projecting portions 97, 97 is provided as a part separate from the knuckle guard 50. Due to such a constitution, when a large load is applied to the knuckle guard 50 frontwardly, the rear member 98 is removed from the U-shaped portion 95, and the knuckle guard 50 can be removed frontwardly by allowing the circular cylindrical end portion 62A of the handle weight 55 to pass through the U-shaped portion 95 which opens rearwardly.
