As a consequence, the need to reduce the overall size, costs and complexity of those current sources has increased as well.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">This and other needs are taken into account by the current independent claims. Further embodiments and different aspects of the invention are a subject matter of the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">An aspect of the invention is related to a regulated current source comprising controllable output means coupled to a supply terminal and to an output terminal to provide a respective output current. A first regulation loop comprises first comparing means to provide a control signal to the controllable output means in response to a feedback signal and a reference signal. As such, the first regulation loop may regulate the output current to a specific value in response to the reference signal. Further, the regulated current source may comprise a first switch between the controllable output means and output of the first comparing means. An offset cancellation<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> loop having second comparing means is coupled with its input to the output of the first comparing means to provide an offset cancellation signal to the first comparing means. A unity gain buffer is coupled to a node between the first switch and the controllable output means and is selectively switchable arranged in parallel to the first switch. To this extent, the present invention proposes two loops to control an output current, whereby the first regulation loop provides a regulation for the output current while the second loop acts to cancel any offset generated in the first regulation loop. The unity gain buffer offers offset cancellation prior to signal application and operation of the regulation loop. As a result, there is no limitation of bandwidth compared to known implementations.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In an aspect, the first switch of a regulated current source is adapted to be closed during a regulation cycle of the first regulation loop. During the regulation cycle, the first regulation loop provides a regulated output current. The offset cancellation loop is adapted to provide the offset cancellation signal during a refresh cycle of the first regulation loop. Finally, the unity gain buffer is adapted to be operated between the refresh cycle and the regulation cycle. Due to the operation of the gain buffer between the refresh cycle and the regulation cycle, the output of the first comparing means and the control input are at the same potential at the start of the regulation cycle.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In accordance with the present invention, the regulated current source is operated in three different consecutive cycles. During a regulation cycle, the first regulation loop is active and provides a respective control signal such as a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> controllable output means. To reduce an offset in the first regulation loop, a refresh cycle follows the regulation cycle consecutively. During the refresh cycle, the offset cancellation loop is active to evaluate an offset of the first regulation loop. In response to an evaluated offset, the offset cancellation loop provides a respective cancellation signal to the first regulation loop. Said cancellation signal may be used in the regulation cycle. After the refresh cycle and before the following regulation cycle, the unity gain buffer is operated.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The gain buffer equalizes the signal at the node between the first switch and the controllable output means to a signal between the output of the first regulation loop and the first switch. As a result, any glitches during transition from the refresh cycle to the regulation cycle are significantly reduced.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In an aspect of the present invention, the first comparing means comprise a differential operational amplifier, wherein at least one output is coupled to the first switch. The second comparing means may also comprise a differential amplifier coupled with its input via respective switches to the output of the first comparing means and with its output to a supply of the first comparing means.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In accordance with the present invention, the second comparing means provide a cancellation signal, that cancellation signal being the supply signal for the first comparing means.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In a further aspect, the second comparing means may comprise at least one capacitor coupled between one of the inputs and<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the respective switch.

The known regulated current source includes a first regulation loop L1 having a low bandwidth, a first offset cancellation loop L2 with a medium bandwidth, and a second offset cancellation loop L3 with a high bandwidth. The second offset cancellation loop L3 is used to cancel any offset of an operational amplifier A2 in the first offset cancellation loop.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The first regulation loop L1 comprises a comparator A1 with its output coupled to a current output transistor Mp. The current output transistor is connected between the supply terminal Vbat and an output terminal for providing the output current Iout. A feedback is coupled between power transistor Mp and the inverting input for operational amplifier A1, thereby implementing the first regulation loop.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The operational amplifier A1 compares the feedback signal with a reference signal Vref applied to its non-inverting input and provides a respective control signal to the gate of output transistor Mp. To cancel any offset of the operational amplifier A1, three other operational amplifiers A2, A3 and A4 are used. The operational amplifier A2 forming a portion of the first cancellation loop L2 also requires its own offset cancellation loop implemented by the second offset cancellation loop L3 and the operational amplifier A3.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">For offset cancellation as well as for regulation, several switches are arranged in the regulated current source. The current source itself is operated by a clock signal.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In a first switching phase of the clock, the switches Sa between the inverting and non-inverting input of operation amplifier A2 and S1 are closed. Capacitor C1 thereby stores voltage equal two a reference signal Vref0, as operational amplifier A3 of the second offset cancellation loop L3 provides a respective supply signal to operational amplifier A2.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In a second phase of the clock signal, switches SB and S1 are open, while switches S2 and Sa are closed. During this phase, the output signal of operational amplifier A2 now with a significantly reduced offset due to the offset cancellation loop L3 provides a control signal to the inverting input of operational amplifier A4 and capacitor C2. At the same time, operational amplifier A2 receives the reference signal Vref at its non-inverting input and the feedback signal from the main regulation loop L1 at its inverting input signal.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In steady state, capacitor C2 stores a voltage equal to reference voltage Vref1, as operational amplifier A4 provides the offset cancellation signal for operational amplifier A1 in the main loop. If regulation loop L1 is active, operational amplifier A1 will have a balanced offset signal over a number of clock cycles.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">To provide the respective stability of all regulation and offset cancellation loops, offset cancellation loop L3 requires a high bandwidth than offset cancellation loop L2. At the same time, the main regulation loop L1 requires a lower<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> bandwidth compared to the first cancellation loop. This poses a bandwidth limit.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Further to this limitation, an offset cancellation is only achieved if the main regulation loop L1 is stable. During transience, no offset cancellation may exist.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">To this extent, <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the proposed principle of a regulated current source. The regulated current source according to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a main regulation loop L1 as indicated, and an offset cancellation loop L2.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The main regulation loop comprises an operational amplifier A1 which is implemented as a fully differential operational amplifier. The non-inverting output of the operational amplifier A1 providing output signal outp is coupled via a first switch S1 to the gate of the output transistor Mp providing the output current Iout. Between resistor Rs and output transistor Mp, a feedback node for feedback signal Vfb is coupled via switch SC to the inverting input of operational amplifier A1. The non-inverting input of amplifier A1 is connected via switch SD to a reference signal Vref. The two inputs of amplifier A1 are also connected via switches Sa and Sb to a common mode reference Vc. The switches Sa and Sb are operated in a specific mode as it will be explained in greater detail below. The common mode reference Vc could be the same as Vbat.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The offset cancellation loop comprises an operational amplifier A2 with an inverting and non-inverting input. The inverting input is connected via switch Sp to the inverting output of operational amplifier A1. The non-inverting input<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> is coupled via switch Sn to the inverting output outn of operational amplifier A1. Further, capacitances C1 and C2 are connected between the inputs of amplifier A1 and the respective switches. They are used to store respective signals applied to operational amplifier during operation of the circuit. The output of operational amplifier providing output signals Icp and Icn are connected to respective supply terminals of operational amplifier A1.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">To provide an offset cancellation and reduce any spikes during operation of the regulated current source, a unity gain buffer is substantially arranged in parallel to switch S1. Particularly, the unity gain buffer is coupled to a first node Vs between the gate of transistor Mp and switch S1 and with a second node via switch Se to the non-inverting output of operational amplifier A1.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Finally, node Vs is connected via capacitor C to supply terminal Vbat. Switch S2 for selectively activating or deactivating the regulated current source is arranged in parallel to capacitor C.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a time-signal diagram of several signals applied to the embodiment of the regulated current source according to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The regulated current source is operated in consecutive sequential cycles, namely regulation cycle, refresh cycle, and equalizer cycle. Starting with a first refresh cycle, switches S1, S2, Se, Sc and Sd are open, while switches Sa, Sb, Sn and Sp are closed. Common mode voltage signal Vcm is both applied to the non-inverting and to the inverting input of operational amplifier A2 of the main regulation loop. If<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> there is no internal offset voltage in operational amplifier A1, the difference between the output signals outp and outn must be zero as well. If there is any offset, said offset will result in a difference applied to operational amplifier A2 of the offset cancellation loop. In response to any offset signal provided by operational amplifier A1, the offset cancellation loop provides output signals Icp and Icn to cancel the offset signal in amplifier A1.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">After the first refresh cycle, the switches Sa, Sb, Sn and Sp are open and the current source starts the regulation cycle by closing switch S1, Sc and Sd. Reference signal Vref is now applied to operational amplifier A1. In response to a comparison between the feedback signal Vfb and the reference signal Vref, the operational amplifier provides an output signal outp applied to power transistor Mp to drive the transistor. The transistor provides the respective regulated output current Iout.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">After the regulation cycle is finished, the second refresh cycle starts by opening switch S1, Sc and Sd, thereby separating the feedback signal Vfb as well as the reference signal Vref from the respective input terminals of operational amplifier A1. Similar to the first refresh cycle, any offset in operational amplifier A1 is cancelled by the offset cancellation loop L2.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The second refresh cycle and any refresh cycle afterwards is immediately followed by an equalizer cycle. For this purpose, switch S1 remains open, switches Sa, Sb, Sn and Sp are opened as well. Switch Se coupling the unity gain buffer to the output of operational amplifier A1 is now closed as well as switches Sc and Sd. The operational amplifier compares the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> feedback signal Vfb with the reference signal and provides an output signal outp to the still open switch S1. The unity gain buffer now arranged in parallel to switch S1 has the purpose of equalizing a signal at node VS with the signal outp provided by operational amplifier A1. After the equalization process at the end of the equalizer cycle, any potential at node VS is equal to the potential at the output of operational amplifier A1. Closing switch S1 with the beginning of the next regulation cycle will therefore not provoke any spike on the output current Iout.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Further, during the refresh and the equalizer cycle, the output current Iout is given by the output current during the last regulation cycle. This is achieved by the unity gain buffer arranged in parallel to switch S1 and capacitor C connected between node VS and supply terminal Vbat.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">During the regulation cycle, switch S1 is closed and the feedback signal Vfb regulated to the reference signal Vref by the main regulation loop and the amplifier A1.

wherein Rs is the resistance value in the resistor connected between supply terminal Vbat and output transistor Mp.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In the refresh cycle following the regulation cycle, the operational amplifier A2 of the offset cancellation loop generates, if necessary, the supply signals Icp and Icn such that output signal outp is regulated to output signal outn of operational amplifier A1. During this phase, both capacitors C1 and C2 are charged to a value of outp = outn. The output current<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> Iout stays to the value at the end of the previous regulation cycle.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In the following equalizer cycle, just before the next regulation cycle, the output node outp of operational amplifier A1 is equalized to the voltage at node VS. This equalization process assures that the voltage at VS and the control signal of operational amplifier A1 in the following regulation cycle are at the same potential before the start of the regulation cycle.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">As such, the regulation cycle may be much longer than the following refresh and equalizer cycle. The equalizer cycle may be only a few per cent of the refresh cycle sufficient to equalize the signal at node VS with the output signal outp of operational amplifier A1. For example, the regulation cycle may be in the range of a few hundred µs up to a few milliseconds, while the refresh cycle is about a few µ-seconds. The equalizer cycle is only a few hundred nanoseconds long, and sufficiently long enough to obtain equalization of the potential on both sides of switch S1.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a unity gain buffer to be used in the regulated current source according to the present invention. The unity gain buffer equalizes signal Vs applied to gate terminal of transistor M1 to output signal Ve. For this purpose, signal Vs is basically mirrored via transistors M1, M2, M3 and M4 to the respective output terminal. The current Icn1 given by current source I1 flowing through transistor M1, M5 and M9 is mirrored into transistor M10, M11 and M12. If the transistors M9 to M12 carry equal currents, the respective gate-to-source voltages of transistors M1, M2, M3 and M4 are equal as well.
