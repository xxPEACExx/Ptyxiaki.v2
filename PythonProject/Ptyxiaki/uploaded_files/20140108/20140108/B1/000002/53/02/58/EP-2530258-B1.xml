load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">Technical Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method and device for adjusting a valve clearance which is established to accommodate variations due to thermal expansion in an internal combustion engine.</p><heading id="h0002">Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Internal combustion engines, in particular, vehicle engines are equipped with inlet and exhaust valves to draw and exhaust mixed gas, and these valves are opened or closed when the mixed gas is drawn or exhausted. The opening and closing of the valves are controlled by camshafts.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A manner of opening the inlet valve or the exhaust valve by means of a cam on the camshaft includes a direct acting type in which the cam directly pushes a valve lifter to thereby open or close the valve, and a rocker arm type in which the cam pushes the valve via an arm, which is referred to as a rocker arm, for opening or closing the valve.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The inlet and exhaust valves are thermally expanded due to heat from a combustion chamber. Because timings of drawing and exhausting air will be changed when the valves are thermally expanded, a clearance (a valve clearance) for adjustment is defined, in order to accommodate variations due to the thermal expansion, between the cam and the valve lifter (or a camshaft contact section of the rocker arm) in a state where the cam does not push the valve lifter or the camshaft contact section (a roller, a slipper surface) of the rocker arm.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">While an engine is being assembled and fabricated, in general, the valve clearance is automatically adjusted in a valve clearance adjusting device after the valves are assembled in the cylinder head. Further, after the adjustment, the valve clearance is actually measured and checked.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A valve clearance adjusting method includes that described in Patent Document 1, for example. In this valve clearance adjusting method, an adjusting screw (an adjustment screw) of the rocker arm is rotated in a forward direction to push the valve through the rocker arm by an amount of displacement that exceeds the valve clearance, and thereafter rotated in a reverse direction to return the valve to an original fixed position. Then, an instant when the displacement is stopped at the returning of the valve to the fixed position valve is detected by a means for detecting a stop of displacement, and a location of the rocker arm at that instant is recognized as a zero position of clearance zero. After that, the adjusting screw is rotated in the same reverse direction by a predetermined angle to establish the valve clearance, and locked by a lock nut to disable rotation of the adjusting screw. In this context, the valve clearance denotes a gap between a top part of a bridge member for connecting valve retainers for each valve in a pair of right and left valves and an end part on a valve side of the rocker arm.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">On the other hand, a valve clearance adjusting device includes that described in Patent Document 2, for example. This valve clearance adjusting device allows setting of a valve clearance between an adjustment screw and a valve in a condition of an actual machine incorporating a cylinder head and a cylinder block. In addition, an adjustment head for adjusting the valve clearance is disposed movably along a guide rail in a vertical direction, and lifted up and down by a predetermined stroke when driven by a lifting actuator such as a cylinder.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Moreover, regarding a roller rocker arm, a roller rocker arm including no rocker shaft (a rocker arm of a support point adjustable type) is suggested, for example, as described in Patent Document 3.

Such shifting of the support point complicates a relationship between a rotation angle of the adjustment screw and an amount of change of the valve clearance, and accordingly makes it difficult to accurately adjust the valve clearance with respect to which an accuracy on the order of µm is required.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">On the other hand, in both inventions described in Patent Documents 1 and 2, after a zero point where the valve clearance becomes 0 is initially found, a given valve clearance value is adjusted based on the zero point. However, because the zero point itself is inaccurate, the valve clearance adjusted based on such an inaccurate zero point is problematic in terms of a degree of accuracy.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">An object of the present invention, which was conceived in view of the aforesaid circumstances, is to provide a valve clearance adjusting method and device capable of accurately adjusting a valve clearance in a cylinder head using a rocker arm of a support point adjustable type.</p><heading id="h0005">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">In order to attain the above-described object, an invention according to embodiment 1 of the present invention is a valve clearance adjusting method for adjusting a valve clearance in a cylinder head comprising a valve incorporated in a cylinder head body, a rocker arm connected at one end thereof to an end of the valve, an adjustment screw screwably connected to the other end of the rocker arm and having a lower end section swingably supported by the cylinder head<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> body, and a camshaft contacted by a camshaft contact section of a circular-shaped surface in the rocker arm and capable of rotating to open and close the valve.

while the camshaft is in contact with the camshaft contact section, the rocker arm is rotated using both a center of the circular-shaped surface of the camshaft contact section and the other end of the rocker arm as a support point, and, based on a relationship between an adjustment screw rotating angle and a valve opening amount during rotation of the rocker arm, a first rotation angle by which the adjustment screw should be rotated to reach a position where the camshaft comes in contact with the camshaft contact section from the position where the valve is released with the certain valve opening amount is determined,<br/>
while the camshaft is separated from the camshaft contact section, the rocker arm is rotated using one end of the rocker arm as the support point, and, based on a relationship between the adjustment screw rotating angle and the valve clearance value during rotation of the rocker arm, a second rotation angle by which the adjustment screw should rotated to reach a position where the desired valve clearance value is obtained from the position where the camshaft comes in contact with the camshaft contact section is determined, and<br/>
the adjustment screw is rotated in the reverse direction by a given rotation angle which is a sum of the first and second rotation angles.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">A valve clearance adjusting method according to embodiment 2 of the present invention is a method for adjusting a valve clearance in a cylinder head comprising a valve incorporated in a cylinder head body, a rocker arm connected at one end thereof to an end of the valve, an adjustment screw screwably connected to the other end of the rocker arm and having a lower end section<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> swingably supported by the cylinder head body, and a camshaft contacted by a camshaft contact section of a circular-shaped surface in the rocker arm and capable of rotating to open and close the valve. The method comprises:

Specifically, in the clearance adjusting step in which rotation of the bit servomotor 123 is controlled, or regulated by a controller 300, the adjustment screw 225 is rotated by a given rotation angle θ in the reverse direction, to thereby loosen the adjustment screw 225 from the backlash removing position (the position I) to a position where the predetermined valve clearance value L7 is obtained (position n). The given rotation angle θ is determined as described below.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">Here, in the roller 224 of the rocker arm 223 shown in <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 15</figref>, its center of rotation is not fixed by a rocker shaft or the like (capable of moving), and will be changed depending on whether the camshaft 227 is in contact with the roller 224. For this reason, it has been difficult to accurately determine the given rotation angle θ. The inventors have sorted cases based on whether or not the camshaft 227 is in contact with the roller 224 and found a relationship between the rotation angle of the adjustment screw 225 and the valve clearance value or the valve opening amount using model diagrams in a case where the camshaft 227 is in contact with the roller 224 and in a case where the camshaft 227 is separated from the roller 224. The "case where the camshaft 227 is in contact with the roller 224" as used herein means a condition that the valve opening amount is 0 or greater (inclusive of 0), while the "case where the camshaft 227 is separated from the roller 224" means a condition that the valve clearance value is greater than 0 (exclusive of 0).</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">That is to say, when the camshaft 227 is in contact with the roller 224 (in the zone I-m in <figref idrefs="f0018">FIG. 16</figref>), rotation of the adjustment screw 225 causes the rocker arm 223 to rotate (clockwise in the figure) as shown <figref idrefs="f0020">FIG. 18</figref> using both a center C1 of a circular surface of the roller 224 and the other end (a right end in <figref idrefs="f0020">FIG. 18</figref>) of the rocker arm 223 as a support point. At this time, as the rocker arm 223 is rotated, the center C1 of the circular surface is moved along a cam surface of the camshaft 227, i.e. along an arc 180. Further, when the center C1 of the circular surface is<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> moved, an angle of an axis line direction D1 of the adjustment screw 225 is accordingly changed. Also, when the center C1 of the circular surface is moved, a location of a contact point 229 between the rocker arm 223 and the adjustment screw 225 is accordingly shifted, thereby reducing a distance between the contact point 229 and the pivot bearing 228.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">A relationship between the rotation angle of the adjustment screw 225 and a raised amount of one end of the rocker arm 223, i.e. the travel amount of the valve 222 (the valve opening amount) in the zone I-m is modeled in order to allow the relationship to be determined by a formula. In other word, it can be determine in the zone I-m by the formula how much elevation of the valve 222 (how much reduction of the valve opening amount) is caused by what degree of rotation of the adjustment screw 225. Thus, the relationship between the rotation angle of the adjustment screw 225 and the valve opening amount in that zone can be obtained in advance. Then, based on the obtained relationship, a first rotation angle θ1 which is the rotation angle of the adjustment screw 225 can be uniquely determined by finding the travel amount of the valve 222 necessary to reach the position where the camshaft 227 is brought into contact with the roller 224 (the position m) from the backlash removing position (the position I). The valve opening amount at the position I is measured in real time by the linear gauge 81 (the valve opening amount measuring unit) as described above. Therefore, because the valve opening amount is known, the travel amount L6 of the valve 222 can be, of course, readily found, and the first rotation angle θ1 is uniquely determined accordingly.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">On the other hand, when the camshaft 227 is separated from the roller 224 (in the zone m-n of <figref idrefs="f0018">FIG. 16</figref>), the rotation of the adjustment screw 225 causes, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0021">FIG. 19</figref>, the rocker arm 223 to rotate (clockwise in the figure) using one end (a left end in <figref idrefs="f0021">FIG. 19</figref>) of the rocker arm 223 as the support point. At this time, a contact point 230 between the one end of the rocker arm 223 and the valve 222 is shifted along an upper end height of the valve 222, i.e. along a line 190 to a camshaft 227 side (a right side in the figure), while remaining a height of the contact point 230 unchanged. Then, as the rocker arm 223 is rotated, the center<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> C1 of the circular surface is accordingly moved in a direction away from the cam surface of the camshaft 227. Further, when the center C1 of the circular surface is moved, the angle of an axis line direction D2 of the adjustment screw 225 is accordingly changed, thereby reducing the distance between the contact point 229 and the pivot bearing 228.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">A relationship between the rotation angle of the adjustment screw 225 and the distance from the contact point 229 to the pivot bearing 228, i.e. the travel amount of the valve 222 in the above-described zone m-n is modeled in order to allow the relationship to be determined by a formula. In other word, it can be determine in the zone m-n by the formula how much loosening of the adjustment screw 225 is caused by what degree of rotation of the adjustment screw 225. Thus, the relationship between the rotation angle of the adjustment screw 225 and the travel amount of the adjustment screw 225 in that zone can be obtained in advance. Then, based on the obtained relationship, a second rotation angle θ2 which is the rotation angle of the adjustment screw 225 can be uniquely determined by finding the travel amount of the adjustment screw 225 necessary to reach the position (the position n) where the desired valve clearance value L7 is obtained from the position (the position m) where the camshaft 227 is brought into contact with the roller 224.

Then, in the valve clearance adjusting step for adjusting the valve clearance value,<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> because the rocker arm 223 behaves in different ways between the two zones (I-m, m-n), a different formula is used for each of the zones to determine the given rotation angle θ of the adjustment screw 225.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">Therefore, in the cylinder head 22 using the rocker arm 223 of a support point adjustable type which exhibits different behaviors depending on whether or not the camshaft 227 is in contact with the roller 224, the valve clearance can be adjusted with a high degree of precision.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">This embodiment has been described with reference, by way of example, to the rocker arm whose camshaft contact section is the roller. It is, however, obvious that the valve clearance adjusting method according to this embodiment is not limited to adjustment of the valve clearance in the cylinder head using the rocker arm of the above-described type, and may be applied to adjustment of the valve clearance in a cylinder head including a rocker arm whose camshaft contact section is a slipper surface.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">Next, another embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawing.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">In the valve clearance adjusting method according to the previous embodiment, the backlash removing step is performed to remove purely mechanical backlash.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">In contrast, the valve clearance adjusting method according to this embodiment differs in a way that in addition to removing backlash, rotation controlling is corrected in the backlash removing step. Details other than the above-indicated different point are identical to those of the valve clearance adjusting method according to the previous embodiment, and only the different point will be described below.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">In the backlash removing step, the adjustment screw 225 is rotated in the reverse direction for loosening the adjustment screw 225 to the given backlash removing position (zone k) between the released state of the valve 222 (zone j) and the state of the valve opening amount zero (zone m), and backlash is removed there.<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --></p><p id="p0105" num="0105">At this time, the travel amount L5 of the valve calculated by the bit servomotor 123 which controls rotation of the adjustment screw 225 is compared with the valve opening amount L6 actually measured by the linear gauge 81 (a comparing step). A calculational valve opening amount L6 is obtained by subtracting L5 from L4. Then, a difference between the calculated value and the actually measured value is found by comparing the calculational valve opening amount L6 and the actually measured valve opening amount L6. Through feedback of the difference to the bit servomotor 123 for correction, controlling of rotation can be performed more closely depending on the actual value, and become more accurate in the subsequent clearance adjusting step.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">The present invention is not limited to the embodiments set forth above, and it is obvious that various types of other modifications are contemplated as well.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56983277" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Vorrichtung zur Einstellung des Ventilspiels zum Einstellen eines Ventilspiels in einem Zylinderkopf (22), umfassend wenigstens ein Ventil (222), welches in einen Zylinderkopfkörper (221) eingebaut ist, einen Kipphebel (223), welcher an seinem einen Ende mit einem Ende des Ventils verbunden ist, eine Einstellschraube (225), welche schraubbar mit dem anderen Ende des Kipphebels verbunden ist und einen unteren Endabschnitt aufweist, welcher schwingbar von dem Zylinderkopfkörper gelagert wird, und eine Nockenwelle (227), mit welcher ein Nockenwellenkontaktabschnitt (224) des Kipphebels in Kontakt tritt und welcher in der Lage ist, sich zum Öffnen und Schließen des Ventils zu drehen, wobei der Kipphebel gedreht wird unter Verwendung sowohl einer Mitte einer kreisförmigen Oberfläche (C1) des Nockenwellenkontaktabschnitts als auch des anderen Endes des Kipphebels als einem Auflagepunkt, während die Nockenwelle in Kontakt ist mit dem Nockenwellenkontaktabschnitt, und gedreht wird unter Verwendung des einen Endes des Kipphebels als dem Auflagepunkt, während die Nockenwelle von dem Nockenwellenkontaktabschnitt entfernt ist, wobei die Vorrichtung zur Einstellung des Ventilspiels <b>dadurch gekennzeichnet ist, dass</b> sie umfasst:
