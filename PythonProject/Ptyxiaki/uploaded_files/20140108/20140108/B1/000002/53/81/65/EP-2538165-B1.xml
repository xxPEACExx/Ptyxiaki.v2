This patent attempts to resolve the problem of loading the pellets, most of which are made of lead.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It employs a system that halfway between the Mauser system, in which the pellet or projectile is located outside the breech to be subsequently moved forward and fitted into the breech and the folding barrel system in which the projectile is positioned directly in the barrel, with the user subsequently closing the rifle.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">This invention is intended to improve this US patent. The inventors have realised that, occasionally, if the pellets are not correctly inserted inside the barrel, the rotation of the pellet-loading mechanism could damage the pellet and interfere with its desired trajectory, thus losing accuracy because the pellet does not perform as desired along its trajectory.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Thus, the inventors have developed a new pellet-loading system that ensures the pellet is inserted into the barrel without being pinched when the pellet-loading mechanism, rotates, moreover, it is a system that always operates within the rifle or pistol and is therefore much easier to manipulate from the user's comfort point of view.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Tests have shown that this is a highly reliable system because the pellet is always correctly positioned inside the barrel and, in addition, is never pinched by the cited pellet-loading element.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As can be seen, it is easy to use and does not require any great effort to go from the open to closed positions and vice versa.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">One objective of this invention is a pellet-loading system for sporting rifles and pistols of the type comprising a barrel, a casing joined to said barrel, with an aperture, a pellet-loading element arranged inside the casing, with a notch that ends facing the barrel mouth in the open or pellet-loading position, a handle firmly joined to the pellet-loading element that protrudes beyond the casing through the aperture that rotates the pellet-loading element from the closed position to the open position and vice versa, with referred handle resting on a first side of said aperture and a spring pusher, characterised in that it comprises a spring between the barrel and pellet-loading element, and a partial necking on the first side of the aperture along which the handle moves from the open position to closed position and vice versa, during which same time it moves the pellet-loading element away from the mouth by action of the spring, each time the handle is at the necking.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">In order to facilitate the description this report includes five sheets of drawings that represent a practical exemplary embodiment which is for guideline purposes and does not limit the scope of this invention.

Pellet-loading element 2 rotates inside casing 6, which can be seen through aperture 7. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>, there is a spring 9 that pushes pellet-loading element 2 away from barrel 1 so that, when handle 5 reaches necking 10 of first side 11, spring 9 separates from pellet-loading element 2 of barrel 1. This movement is especially important when the pellet has been loaded into barrel mouth 4, as will be described below.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Said spring 9 is controlled by a spring pusher 8, which is partially inserted inside spring 9 to prevent it losing its position during spring 8 compression/decompression movements.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Then when the other end of aperture 7 (<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>) is reached, bevelled edge 12 moves the handle 5 forward in turn moving pellet-loading element 2 forwards, approaching barrel 1 when handle 5 reaches the end of its movement.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, in the open position, pellet-loading element 2 uncovers notch 3, where groove 15 is located facing barrel mouth 4.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Thus, when the user desires to insert the pellet into barrel mouth 4, said pellet is positioned in groove 15 of notch 3 and is pushed inside barrel mouth 4 and positioned inside said mouth 4.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Then, in order to fire the rifle, the user grips handle 5 and pushes it in the opposite direction, in other words, moving said handle 5 until pellet-loading element 2 is in the position illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">When handle 5 (<figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>) is moved and it reaches necking 10, spring 9 pushes pellet-loading element 2, separating it from barrel 1. This is very important because it prevents pellet-loading element 2 from rotating if the pellet is not correctly fitted inside barrel mouth 4, the same pellet-loading element 2 strikes the incorrectly positioned pellet and damages it. This means<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> that if the pellet has been damaged, when the rifle is fired, the pellet trajectory will not be that desired.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">When the movement of necking 10 ends, handle 5 leaves necking 10 and moves forward, positioning itself at the other side of the aperture (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>), thus moving pellet-loading element 2 towards the barrel mouth 4, with barrel mouth 4 facing towards compressed air or CO<sub>2</sub> pipe 17 positioned in pellet-loading element 2.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As can be verified, even when the pellet has not been pushed to the end, this new system does not allow the pellet to be damaged and it is similarly facing to compressed air or CO<sub>2</sub> pipe 17 in order to be fired.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">It has been observed that, on occasions, the existence of bevelled edge 12 on aperture 7, located just before necking 10, which facilitates transit from aperture 7 to necking 10 helps to prevent the pellet from being pinched. In this way, at the same time that pellet-loading element 2 is rotating, is produced a gradual separation movement of pellet-loading element 2 with respect to barrel 1, the separation of which is not sudden, because it occurs just when it is moving over bevelled edge 12.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In fact, it can be calculated that when handle 5 passes over said bevelled edge 12, this moment coincides with the start of moving away of the pellet-loading element 2 from the mentioned barrel mouth 4.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In order to improve still further, if this is possible, the prevention of pellet pinching, groove 15 can optionally comprise blunt edge 16, arranged just to the side of the barrel mouth. This permits that, even when the pellet is not adequately inserted, blunt edge 16 would prevent damaging it and, at the same time, would smoothly push it inside barrel mouth 4.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56984474" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Ein Kugel-Ladesystem für Sportgewehre
