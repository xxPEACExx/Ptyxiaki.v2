location services in mobile communication systems.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>BACKGROUND</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The increasing demand for wireless telecommunication services has resulted in the growth of many wireless telecommunication systems and increase in the number of roaming wireless subscribers. With newer third generation (3G) systems, efforts have been implemented to accommodate and distribute the increased traffic load in the network. By way of example, for handling communications such as mobile terminated calls (MTC) towards a mobile terminal or mobile originated calls (MOC) from the mobile terminal, a network communication node such as MSC (Mobile Switching Centre) may be provided.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In addition to mobile calls, also location based services (LBS, LCS) which usually require knowledge on a location of the mobile terminal in the communication network may emerge. In order to retrieve the location of the mobile terminal, first a MSC in which the mobile terminal is registered has to be determined. This may be achieved according e.g. to the 3GPP TS 23.271 standard by requesting a Home Location Register (HLR) by e.g. a GMLC (Gateway Mobile Location Centre) to provide a network address of the MSC which is currently handling communications of the mobile terminal. Thereafter, the MSC may be requested to transmit location information indicating the location of the mobile terminal. In this set-up the HLR is repeatedly queried to provide the network address of the serving MSC.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As such set-up reduces network performance; there exists a need for efficiently retrieving location information indicating a location of a mobile terminal in a mobile communication network.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO0025545A1"><text>WO 00/25545 A1</text></patcit>, relates to methods and equipment for providing location services in a telecommunications system comprising a packet radio network, and for the use of the packet radio network as a bearer for location information.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Document <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>S2-094091, "Update to the GMLC State Description", Huawei</text></nplcit>, describes different GMLC states.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Document <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>S2-023076, "Introduction of reuse mechanism of previously obtained location information", NEC</text></nplcit>. describes routing procedures in different domains.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>SUMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The invention is based on the finding that location requests may efficiently be retrieved in a communication network if, by way of example, instead of always querying the HLR for the serving MSC, a network location management entity such as the GMLC uses the last known MSC address if available. Thus, according to some embodiments, as the target normally stays attached to the same MSC for a time period, the load on the HLR may be reduced.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to an aspect, the invention relates to a network location management entity for managing location information indicating a location of a mobile terminal in a communication network.

By way of example, the subscriber location request may be formed by the Mobile Terminal Location Request (MT-LR) message. The pre-stored information may be stored in a memory which may be an element of the network location management entity. However, the memory may remotely be arranged and accessible over the communication network.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to an embodiment, the pre-stored information fulfills the validity criterion if a time period which elapsed after a transmission of a previous subscriber location request towards the network communication node is shorter than or equal to a predetermined time period, e.g. 10min, 20min or 30min.

The network location management entity comprises a provider 101 for providing pre-stored information on a network communication node, e.g. a MSC (Mobile Services Switching Centre) or a MME (Mobility Management Entity) or a SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node), which previously, i.e. at an earlier time instant, handled communications of the mobile terminal, and a transmitter 103 for transmitting a subscriber location request towards the network communication node if the pre-stored information fulfills a validity criterion, the subscriber location request requesting a transmission of the location information.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The pre-stored information, e.g. a network address of the network communication node, may originate from a Home Location Register (HLR) or from a Home Subscriber Server (HSS). Thus, the network location management entity 100 may further comprise a receiver for e.g. receiving information on the network communication node from the HLR or from the HSS.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In order to pre-store this information, the network location management entity 100 may further comprise a memory 107.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">According to some embodiments, the network location management entity 100 may comprise a request controller 109 being configured to determine when to transmit the subscriber location request. By way of example, the request controller 109 may determine when a request for location is needed according e.g. to the TS 23.271 standard. According to some embodiments, the request controller 109, which forms a mechanism to determine when a request for location is needed, may create requests for location repeatedly with intervals that may vary. The intervals may, however, be chosen or assumed to be short relative to intervals of an inter-MSC handover.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Once the need of location is determined, the network location management entity 100 may verify if the network address, which forms an embodiment of information on the network communication node, used in a previous location request is stored in the network location management entity 100, e.g. in the memory 107. If the network address is available and, optionally, if the network address is found usable, then the network location management entity 100 may use that address to request location of the mobile terminal from the network communication node. In order to determine whether the network address is usable, a validity criterion may be employed. By way of example, a validity criterion may be a time period since last location request and if an indication that a last location request was successful, or any other validity criterion described herein.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">If the network address, e.g. a MSC address, is not available or if it is not usable, then the network location management entity 100 may query the HLR not shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> for the address of the network communication node which is serving the target, i.e. the mobile terminal. Thereafter, the network location management entity 100 may request location from the network communication node indicated by the network address provided by the HLR.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">If the network communication node cannot provide location information as the target is unknown to the network communication node, the network<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> communication node may, optionally, transmit an error message towards the network location management entity 100. Further, the network location management entity 100 may query the HLR for the address of the network communication node serving the target, and then request location from the network communication node indicated by the address provided by the HLR.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> shows a block diagram of a communication system employing the principles described herein. The communication system comprises a network location management entity 201, e.g. a GMLC which may have a structure as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a network communication node 203, e.g. a MSC or a MSC server or a MME or a MME server or a SGSN, and a location based application 205 triggering a communication over a communication network 209 towards a mobile terminal 211, e.g. towards a user equipment (UE).</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> shows a network positioning approach for e.g. EPC-MT-LR according to an embodiment. As depicted in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the messages may be exchanged between a network location management entity 301, e.g. a GMLC, a network communication node 303, e.g. a MSC, and a HLR 305.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In step A, the network location management entity 301 may wait until a request for location is needed. If the location of a mobile terminal, which is not depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, shall be provided, then, in step B, the network location management entity 301 may determine whether a previously used network address of a network communication node, e.g. of the network communication node 303, is known, e. g. pre-stored. If at least one validity criterion regarding the usability of the pre-stored network address is fulfilled, then the network location management entity 301 may transmit a Provide Subscriber Location request towards the network communication node 303. If the network communication node 303 has location information concerning the mobile terminal, then an acknowledgement message formed by e.g. a Provide Subscriber Location Acknowledgement message may be transmitted towards the network location management entity 301. Otherwise, the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> network communication node 303 may transmit an error message towards the network location management entity 301 or towards the HLR 305, the error message indicating that the requested subscriber, i.e. the mobile terminal, is unknown.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In step E, the network location management entity 301 or one of its elements such as the aforementioned verifier may verify whether the location information has been provided. If the location information has been provided, then the method or the system may return to step A or to a state in step A.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">If, however, the location information has not been provided, then, in step F, a Send Routing Information request for LCS (LCS: location services) may be transmitted towards the HLR 305 to request information, e.g. network address, on the network communication node currently managing communications of the target mobile terminal. The HLR 305 may, in step G, transmit a Send Routing Information request for LCS Acknowledgement message comprising e.g. the network address of that network communication node, e.g. of the network communication node 303. Then, the network location management entity 301 may, in step H, transmit a Provide Subscriber Location request towards the network communication node 303, which, in step I, may respond with a Provide Subscriber Location Acknowledgement message comprising the requested information. Thereafter, the method or the system may return to step A or to a state in step A.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> a network positioning approach according to an embodiment in a communication arrangement comprising a home network location management entity 401, e.g. a home GMLC, a visited network location management entity 403, e.g. a visited GMLC, a network communication node 405, e.g. a serving MSC, a SGSN or a MME, and a HLR/HSS 407. Further, a requesting network location management entity 409, e.g. a requesting GMLC, a requesting client 411, a RAN entity 413 (RAN: Radio Access Network) and a mobile terminal 415, also referred to as UE in the following, are present.

In step 3, the HLR/HSS 407 responds with Send Routing Info for LCS Acknowledge to the requesting network location management entity 409. In step 4, the requesting network location management entity 409 transmits a LCS Service Request towards the home network location management entity 401.
