mxw-id="PDES63960578" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The field of the disclosure relates generally to soil treatments, and more particularly to a method for applying pesticides below the ground surface using a handheld application tool that can be positioned adjacent to structures, in a manner which does not disturb the soil surface before the pesticide is injected, see e.g. document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4009666A"><text>US-A-4,009,666</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">The insertion of soil treatments into the soil near buildings has been used to prevent or reduce the infestation of insects or other pests. Without treatment, these pests can be become a significant nuisance or hazard to a building owner or its occupants. Such pests are known to attack the structure of buildings and may infiltrate the building causing other problems for its occupants.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">At least one know method of soil treatment includes an application of pesticides, fertilizers, or other soil treatments by direct placement into the soil under and around structures, around or near ornamental plantings, poles, fences, decks, or other wooden elements. This direct placement method includes digging, trenching and/or rodding (i.e., forcing an application device into the soil), and then directly placing the soil treatment into the dug out area of the trench. This known method can cause damage to vegetation, disrupt landscaping, and greatly impact or diminish the aesthetic beauty and value of the treated area until either the plants recover or new plantings are installed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For example, in some common termite treatments direct placement of a termiticide into the soil around structures involves the digging of a trench approximately 4 to 6 inches wide by 6 inches deep into which a termiticide composition is applied at a rate of 4 gallons per 10 linear feet of trench per foot of depth. In addition to the application of the soil treatment to the trench, soil treatment may also be dispensed into the ground through the use of a rod injection tool, which is plunged down into the ground or in the top of a footer (i.e., a part of the building's foundation). For a typical structure having a perimeter of 200 linear feet, the time to prepare, dig, inject, and finish the application of soil treatment requires at least 4 to 6 hours depending on the type of soil and whether the application is conducted by a pair of or a single technician(s).<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Another known method of soil treatment includes the direct insertion of a tool down into the ground and delivering the pesticides, fertilizers, or other soil treatments into the ground Applying the soil treatments below the surface of the soil has been used as a way of limiting the wash off of the treatments. Typical devices for implementing such soil treatments have utilized needles or other mechanical devices to create a passageway into the soil to allow the soil treatment to be inserted into the ground. These devices have the obvious limitation that they create holes in the soil, which may be unsightly, or create other adverse concerns, such as unwanted soil compaction adjacent the insertion sights, as well as require the creation of the hole using mechanical forces.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The use of high pressure flows as a method of effectively injecting materials below the soil surface has been described before, such as in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5370069A"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 5,370,069 to Monroe</text></patcit>, titled Apparatus and Method for Aerating and/or Introducing Particulate Matter into a Ground Surface. These methods use high pressure jets of a fluid, such as air or water that entrain the soil treatment agent, whether the soil treatment agent is in solution with the fluid, or a granular material carried with the fluid. The high pressure jet can form a small hole in the surface into which the material is being placed, or cause the material to be absorbed by the surface in a rapid fashion, such that soil disturbance is minimal. One benefit of the use of a pressure jet is that no mechanical effort is required to create a passageway as a predicate for the soil treatment material to be placed below the surface of the soil. Nor is any other disturbance of the soil required, such as placing a tool directly down below the ground surface.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">While devices such as that disclosed in Monroe are effective at placing soil treatment materials below the surface, they are designed to distribute such materials both a short distance below the soil surface and over a large open space area, where the size of the equipment is not a limitation. These known devices are not suitable for strategically injecting soil treatments into the soil under and around structures, ornamental plantings, poles, fences, decks and other wood elements where treatments relating particularly to treatments against insects infestation are common.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Accordingly, a handheld high pressure application tool for applying a termiticide or other pesticide beneath the surface of the ground adjacent a structure is needed. Such a handheld tool would permit an operator to strategically position the tool around a structure such as a house, a deck, any landscaping that may be near the house and/or deck, around utility poles, and around plants. The tool could include multiple nozzles for applying a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> predetermined amount of pesticide at a controlled pressure for injecting the pesticide down to a desired predetermined depth.</p><heading id="h0002">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the invention, a method of treating soil adjacent a structure is disclosed in claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to the invention, an injection apparatus for treating soil adjacent a structure according to claim 8 generally comprises a handle and a manifold head connected to the handle. The manifold head has a first high pressure nozzle, a second high pressure nozzle, and a contact member having at least one opening therein. The contact member is configured to rest on the ground surface during operation of the injection apparatus. The first high pressure nozzle is adapted for emitting a discharge stream of pesticide through the at least one opening in the contact member for injection of the pesticide into the soil. The discharge stream from the first high pressure nozzle is emitted in a first direction. The second high pressure nozzle is adapted for emitting a discharge stream of pesticide through the at least one opening in the contact member for injection of the pesticide into the soil. The discharge stream from the second high pressure nozzle is emitted in a second direction that is angled relative to the first direction of the discharge stream of pesticide emitted from the first high pressure nozzle. A supply of pesticide is in fluid communication with the first and second high pressure nozzles.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0003">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a schematic illustration of a high pressure injection system for injecting a termiticide into the ground in accordance with an exemplary embodiment in which the system includes a base unit and a handheld application tool, but not according to the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is a front view schematic illustration of the handheld portable application tool of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> with parts cut away, but not according to the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> is a side view schematic illustration of the handheld portable application tool of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, but not according to the invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> is a perspective schematic illustration of an elongated shaped manifold head for use with the application tool, but not according to the invention<i>.</i></li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref> is a perspective schematic illustration of an arcuate shaped manifold head for use with the application tool, but not according to the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref> is a perspective schematic illustration of the manifold head shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> having low pressure nozzles positioned adjacent to high pressure nozzles, but not according to the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 7</figref> is a perspective schematic illustration of the manifold head shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> having low pressure nozzles concentric with high pressure nozzles, but not according to the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 8</figref> is a bottom schematic illustration of the manifold head shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> having nozzles on the perimeter for applying marking materials, but not according to the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 9</figref> is a side view schematic illustration of the base unit shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, but not according to the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 10</figref> is a top plan schematic illustrating the high pressure injection system of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> being used to inject termiticide into the soil adjacent a structure, but not according to the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 11</figref> is a perspective schematic illustration of a manifold head that includes multiport center nozzles.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">Figure 12</figref> is a perspective schematic illustration of a manifold head that includes four center nozzles.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">Figure 13</figref> is a perspective schematic illustration of another embodiment of a handheld application tool.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0012">Figure 14</figref> is a perspective schematic illustration of the handheld application tool of <figref idrefs="f0011">Figure 13</figref> but with a trigger switch of the tool being actuated.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0013">Figure 15</figref> is a schematic illustration of a high pressure injection system for injecting a termiticide into the ground in accordance with another exemplary embodiment in which the system includes a base unit and a handheld application tool.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0014">Figure 16</figref> is a front view schematic illustration of the handheld portable application tool of <figref idrefs="f0013">Figure 15</figref> with parts cut away.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0015">Figure 17</figref> is a side view schematic illustration of the handheld portable application tool of <figref idrefs="f0014">Figure 16</figref>.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">A high pressure injection system for applying a pesticide, insecticide or termiticide beneath the surface of the ground is described below in detail. It is understood that the system disclosed herein can be used to apply any suitable pesticide, insecticide, or termiticide and can be used to inhibit or control various types of pests. For example, it may be desirable to inhibit and/or control termites, ants, cockroaches, beetles, earwigs, silverfish, crickets, spiders, centipedes, millipedes, scorpions, pillbugs, sowbugs, flies, mosquitoes, gnats, moths, wasps, hornets, bees, and the like. As used herein, the term "pesticide" refers to any substance or mixture for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest including insects, animals (e.g., mice, rats), plants (e.g., weeds), fungi, microorganisms (e.g., bacteria and viruses), pseudocoelomates (e.g., nematodes) and prions. The term "insecticide", which is a type of pesticide, is used herein to mean any substance or mixture for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating insects. The term "termiticide", which is a type of insecticide, is used herein to mean any substance or mixture for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating termites.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Although the method and system described herein relate to the application of termiticides beneath the surface of the ground, the method and system could also be used to apply pesticides, insecticides, or other soil treatments. The use of termiticides as described herein is not intended to be limiting in any way. Rather, it is for exemplary purposes. The method and system described herein may be used, therefore, to apply any type of soil treatment beneath the ground (e.g., pesticides, fertilizers, other soil conditioning materials and insect treatments including insecticides placed around the perimeter of a structure), and is in no way limited to only termiticides.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The method and system described herein include a termiticide fluid supply cart (a base unit), and a portable handheld application tool that facilitates the application or injection of termiticides into the soil under and around structures, ornamental plantings, poles, fences, decks and other wood elements. The example embodiment eliminates the need to apply termiticides using certain known techniques such as digging, trenching, and/or rodding, which all require mechanically disturbing at least the surface of the ground or soil. These known techniques can cause damage to vegetation, disrupt landscaping, and impact or diminish the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> aesthetic beauty and value of the treated area until the plants recover or new plantings are installed.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The application system described herein includes an application tool that has a tee-handle at the top of the tool and a manifold assembly at the bottom of the tool. The tee-handle includes a hand grip portion on each side of a vertical shaft that extends between the handle and the manifold assembly. The hand grip portions may include rubber grips to aid in holding the tool during application and to reduce hand strain. The vertical shaft of the tool consists of several parts that allow the shaft to compress, when the handle is pushed down, much like a pogo stick. The compression of the shaft activates an electronic triggering switch (broadly, "an actuator") that temporarily opens a discharge valve, for example a poppet. When the operator has the manifold assembly (i.e., device plate) in position on the ground, the operator uses the handle to apply a downward pressure (approximately 15-20 pounds or 6.80 to 9.07 kg) onto the shaft to actuate the trigger switch, which in turn causes a single injection of termiticide into the ground.

Thus, for each compression of the shaft, the discharge valve is opened a single time and a predetermined quantity of termiticide is discharged from the tool. The switch of tool is reset when the shaft is released. The next application can then be made by again compressing the shaft.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The application tool also includes a mounting bracket that mounts the manifold assembly to the shaft.

The system also includes at least one high pressure liquid line and electrical connections that extend between the supply cart and the handheld application tool. The system also includes a pressure manifold and an electronic controller (broadly, "a valve closer") that sets the length of time the discharge valve remains open during each activation of the electronic switch.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In operation, a measured dose of a liquid termiticide concentrate from a container housed on the supply cart is mixed with measured supply of water and fed to the application tool by an inline injection system. In another embodiment, the termiticide solution is supplied to the application tool from a tank or container without the need of an inline injection pump or device. In yet another embodiment, the termiticide concentrate can be carried by the operator and housed in a transportable container formed into and/or held within a backpack, a shoulder holster or sling, a belt holster, a leg holster, or other suitable device capable of holding the pesticide container.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The method and system described herein utilize high pressure to inject the termiticide into soil beneath the surface of the ground. The high pressure injection system described herein differs from at least some known liquid injection systems that apply termiticides for soil application in that the current industry standard liquid termiticide solution injection systems inject liquids into the ground using pressures of 25 to 35 psi (0.172 to .241 MPa) and through a single injection port or tip. The example system described herein injects the termiticide solution into the ground at pressures ranging from about 50 psi to about 10,000 psi (about 0.345 to about 68.948 MPa), and in another embodiment, from about 1,000 psi to about 7,000 psi (about 6.895 to about 48.263 MPa), and in yet another embodiment, at about 4,000 psi (about 27.579 MPa).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In operation, the application tool is set at a desired pressure for applying the termiticide. The operator then places the manifold assembly, and more specifically, the contact plate, which protects the injection nozzles, in a desired application area. The desired area is adjacent to a wall or foundation of a structure. The operator then press down on the application handles to compress the shaft of the tool. This downward pressure causes the upper and lower portions of the device shaft to come together thereby activating an electronic switch. The switch would temporarily open the discharge valve and allow a predetermined amount of termiticide solution to pass through the high pressure injection nozzles and into the ground. The switch would only allow a single charge (i.e., a predefined amount of termiticide solution) to pass through the nozzles. The switch is reset by releasing the pressure on the handle and allowing the two parts of the electronic switch to separate. The operator applicator would then lift or slide the handheld application tool along the wall to the next application point and press down on the handle again, thus repeating the injection of the termiticide solution into the soil. The operator continues to move the handheld application tool and inject termiticide until the desired application is area is injection. In one example, the desired application area is the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> perimeter of the structure so that a barrier of termiticide completely surrounds the structure and thereby inhibits termites from passing through the barrier to the structure.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The high-pressure application tool and method of using the same as described herein have many advantages over the known systems. For example, the tool described herein may include an inline injection assembly which eliminates the need to mix large volumes of the termiticide solution, and reduces the hazards associated with transporting or handling large volumes of termiticide solutions on public roadways or on private property. The use of the high-pressure injection tool also eliminates the need for digging (i.e., trenching) before applying the termiticide solution into the ground. This reduces the destruction of the landscaping and/or natural vegetation around the perimeter of a structure being treated. The high-pressure injection tool also reduces or eliminates the need for rodding into the soil with an application device in order to apply the termiticide solution. The high-pressure tool can also be programmed to deliver a specific volume of termiticide solution per nozzle, and control the depth to which the solution penetrates into the soil by controlling the application pressure. By controlling the volume and the pressure, the application volume of the termiticide can be reduced by 25% to 80% of a normal liquid termiticide application, thus saving cost and reducing demands on water. This is especially important in drier climates or during times of drought. The high-pressure tool also greatly reduces the time required to complete a termiticide treatment around a structure. This reduction in time can range between 40% and 80%. As a result, less time is spent at the site and thereby labor costs associated with the site preparation and application are reduced. Also, the application tool, which is designed to place the injection nozzles in close proximity to the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> ground when injecting the termiticide into the ground, reduces the risk of exposure to the operator or anyone in the immediate area of the application.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Referring to the drawings, <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a schematic illustration of a high pressure injection system 10 for injecting termiticide into the ground.

The application tool 12 is connected to the cart 14 via a conduit 13 defining a fluid passageway (e.g., a hose) and at least one electrical connection 15. The conduit 13 permits fluid (e.g., water and/or a termiticide solution) to flow from the cart 14 to the application tool 12. The electrical connection 15 is used for transmitting various control signals between the application tool 12 and the cart 14.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is a front view schematic illustration of the handheld portable application tool 12, and <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> is a side view schematic illustration of the application tool 12. The handheld portable application tool 12 includes a handle 17 and a manifold head 16 mounted to the handle. The handle 17 includes an upper portion 18 and a lower portion 19. The upper portion 18 includes a tubular section 20 and a hand grip section 22 attached to an upper end 24 of the tubular section 20. As a result, the upper portion 18 of the handle 17 has a generally T-shape. The lower portion 19 of the handle 17, which is tubular, is sized for insertion into the tubular section 20 of the upper portion 18 of the handle. With the lower portion 19 of the handle 17 inserted into the tubular section 20 of the upper portion 18 of the handle, the upper portion can move with respect to the lower portion from a first, extended position to a second, compressed position. A biasing element, such as a spring 26, is provided to bias the upper portion 18 of the handle 17 toward its first, extended position. It is understood, however, that any known biasing element 26 may be used. A flange (not shown) or other suitable retainer(s) may be provided to inhibit the lower portion 19 of the handle 17 from being pulled or otherwise withdrawn from the upper portion 18 to thereby ensure that the lower portion remains telescopically attached to the upper portion. A lower end 28 of lower portion 19 of the handle 17 is attached to an inverted U-shaped attachment bracket 30. The manifold head 16 is pivotally attached at each of its ends 32, 34 to the attachment bracket 30 via a pair of pivot pins 36.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The manifold head 16 includes at least one internal passage to distribute the termiticide to a plurality of high pressure nozzles 38 in fluid communication with the internal passage. As seen in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, the illustrated manifold head 16 includes two main internal<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> passages 40, 42, and a cross passage 44 connecting main internal passages. It is contemplated that the manifold head 16 may include any number of high pressure nozzles 38. For example, the manifold head 16 of the exemplary embodiment has a matrix of six high pressure nozzles 38 with each nozzle generally equidistant from each other. Each of the high pressure nozzles 38, in one embodiment, has an orifice diameter ranging from about 0.002 inch to about 0.01 inch (about 0.005 to about 0.025cm).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">With reference again to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, a contact plate 50 is attached to a bottom surface 52 of the manifold head 16 to protect the high pressure nozzles 38. In the illustrated embodiment, the contact plate 50 includes a plurality of openings 54 with each of the openings being generally aligned with a respective one of the plurality of high pressure nozzles 38. As a result, the high pressure nozzles 38 are spaced from the soil by the contact plate 50 and therefore do not directly contact the soil. Moreover, the contact plate 50 shields or otherwise blocks soil, rocks, and/or other debris that may be "kicked-up" during the injection of the termiticide. The contact plate 50 includes rounded edges to facilitate sliding of the tool 12.

In one embodiment, the manifold head 16 has a shape with a high length to width ratio such as the high pressure nozzles 38 being arranged linearly in a row as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>. In another embodiment, the manifold head 16 has an arcuate shape as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref>. The arcuate shaped manifold head 16 may be used to conform around circular edges, such as around trees. It is contemplate that the manifold heads 16 can be interchangeable. That is, the operator of the tool 12 can selectively change out the manifold head 16. It is also contemplates that the manifold head 16 can be replaced with other delivery means (e.g., a rod injection tool) for delivering a supply of termiticide at low pressures. These low pressure delivery means can be used in areas less suitable for high pressure injection.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The weight of the manifold head 16 may be selected so that the mass of the manifold head 16 assists in retaining tool 12 in position during a discharge from the plurality of high pressure nozzles 38, without being unduly burdensome for manual positioning and moving the tool by an operator. In general, the lighter the mass of the manifold head 16, the greater the force that the operator must apply to the handle 17 to retain the tool 12 in position during a discharge of termiticide from the high pressure nozzles 38.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, a discharge valve 56 is attached to the manifold head 16 and is in fluid communication with the internal passages 40, 42, 44 in the manifold head and the supply of termiticide. More specifically, one end of the discharge valve 56 is coupled to a high pressure inlet port 58 and the other end of the discharge valve is coupled to the hose 13. The discharge valve 56 is moveable between an opened position and a closed position. When the discharge valve is in its closed position, termiticide is inhibited from flowing from the supply of termiticide via the hose 13 to the internal passages 40, 42, 44 in the manifold head via the high pressure inlet port 58. When the discharge valve 56 is opened, the termiticide solution flows from the supply of termiticide through the hose 13 and into inlet port 58 under high pressure. From the inlet port 58, the pressurized termiticide flows into internal passages 40, 42, 44 of the manifold head 16 and through the high pressure nozzles 38 from which the termiticide is injected into the ground. In one embodiment, the termiticide is pressurized to a pressure of about 25 psi to about 10,000 psi (about 0.172 to about 68.948 MPa), and in another embodiment, from about 1,000 psi to about 7,000 psi (about 6.895 to about 48.263 MPa), and in yet another embodiment, at about 4,000 psi (about 27.579 MPa).</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In one suitable embodiment, the discharge valve 56 is a solenoid operated poppet valve capable of sufficiently rapid operation to allow opening and closing of the discharge valve 56 within the desired time parameters to allow correct depth penetration of the soil based on the pressure in use and correct volume of termiticide solution for the specific application. While it is possible to use a hydraulically actuated valve, the size and weight constraints of such a valve may otherwise limit the utility of the handheld application tool 12.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In another suitable embodiment, the manifold head 16 may have a discharge valve 56 associated with each of the high pressure nozzles 38, such that even distribution of termiticide fluid across the plurality of high pressure nozzles 38 may be ensured. While discharge balancing can be obtained within reasonable parameters simply through proper sizing of the internal passages 40, 42, 44, should it be required, and should it justify the expense, multiple discharge valves 56 may be used, such that pressurized termiticide solution contained in a feed hose supplying each of the discharge valves 56 may provide that an adequate amount of termiticide solution is available for each of the high pressure nozzle 38. Such a configuration, however, adds complexity to the system 10 in that the controller must be able to actuate the multiple discharge valves 56 in response to a single actuation, i.e., increasing the amount of wiring and power required to control the valves, although the power requirement may be offset by the use of smaller discharge valves 56.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, a trigger switch 60 (broadly, an "actuator") is mounted on the lower portion 19 of the handle 17 and a trigger switch actuator 62 is mounted on the upper portion 18.

Thus, the trigger switch 60 can be actuated by moving the upper portion 18 of the handle 17 from its first, expanded position to its second compressed position by applying a force on the upper portion so that it slides downward relative to the lower portion 19 of the handle until the trigger switch actuator engages the trigger switch 60.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In another embodiment (not shown), the trigger switch 60 can be located on the hand grip section 22 of the upper portion 18 of the handle 17 where it can be actuated by the operator using a finger or thumb.

A downward force between about 15 to 20 pounds (about 6.80 to 9.07 kg) is applied by the operator to the upper portion 18 of the handle 17 to move the upper portion 18 from its first position to its second position and thereby cause the trigger switch actuator 62, which is mounted to the upper portion, to engage the trigger switch 60, which is mounted to the lower portion 19. Engagement of the trigger switch actuator 62 and the trigger switch 60 actuates the trigger switch 60. As a result, an electronic signal is sent from the trigger switch 60 to the discharge valve 56 causing the discharge valve to move from its closed position to its opened position for a predetermined amount of time thereby permitting termiticide to flow to and out the high pressure nozzles 38 for injecting the termiticide into the ground. The operator then releases the pressure from the handle 17, which resets the trigger switch. More specifically, the spring 26 causes the upper portion 18 of the handle 17 to move back to its first, extended position.
