Examples of typical hydrogels used in an ophthalmic lens include silicone hydrogels prepared by copolymerizing a silicone monomer (or macromer) with a hydrophilic monomer.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, waste products in the lacrimal fluid and bacteria in the air are likely to attach to the ophthalmic lens in which such a hydrogel is used, and thus proliferation of bacteria in hydrogel systems are likely to occur, whereby eye diseases and the like may be developed. To cope with such disadvantages, cleanliness of the lens can be maintained by periodically executing disinfection such as boiling. However, such a treatment is laborious, and the disinfecting effect does not persist for a long period of time. In addition, a method of immersing in a cleaning and preservative solution for contact lenses, referred to as "multipurpose solution", containing an antiseptic component was proposed, and has become broadly prevalent. However, in addition to the disadvantages similar to those described above, wearing of contact lenses results in disadvantages of inferior effect of suppressing bacterial infection during wearing due to bleeding out of the antibacterial component together with the lacrimal fluid. Therefore, development of a technique of imparting an antibacterial effect to the ophthalmic lens per se has been in progress.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Also, an ophthalmic lens in which a hydrogel is used generally has a high moisture content, and the moisture gradually volatilizes during the lens is kept wearing, accompanied by absorption of the lacrimal fluid into the hydrogel. Therefore, feeling of dryness is likely to be provided, and as a result, wearing feel may be deteriorated. The moisture content is almost in a proportional relationship with a coefficient (i.e., linear swelling coefficient) representing the degree of change in size between the state prior to moisturization of the hydrogel (i.e., xerogel) and the state after swelling to reach equilibrium by absorbing the moisture. Therefore, reduction of the linear swelling coefficient in water as low as possible leads to decrease in the moisture content of the hydrogel. Accordingly, an ophthalmic lens having a low linear swelling coefficient, and is capable of achieving comfortable wearing feel for a long period of time has<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> been demanded.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Contact lenses having antibacterial properties are disclosed in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPH476518B"><text>H4-76518</text></patcit>. The antibacterial contact lenses are produced by kneading an antibacterial ceramic carrying a metal selected from silver, zinc and copper into a base material such as a hydrogel, or by coating a base material with an antibacterial ceramic, thereby imparting an antibacterial property to the contact lens. This antibacterial effect is exerted by generation of active oxygen due to the silver, zinc or copper metal, followed by killing of common bacteria and mold by the generated active oxygen. However, such a contact lens is disadvantageous in that use for a long period of time leads to impairment of the antibacterial property with time, as a result of elution or detachment of the antibacterial ceramic or the metal carried. In addition, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JPH47651B"><text>H4-7651B</text></patcit> does not disclose means for reducing the linear swelling coefficient of the contact lens in water.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Furthermore, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JPH6337378B"><text>H6-337378</text></patcit> discloses a hydrogel that includes a copolymer obtained from a monomer mixture containing a hydrocarbon-group-containing (meth)acrylate having a hydroxyl group and may have an in-chain ether linkage, and a monomer having a quaternary ammonium salt in the side chain, as well as a soft contact lens formed from this hydrogel. However, although this hydrogel has a certain level of antibacterial properties per se, due to having very high hydrophilicity, when a cationic monomer such as a quaternary ammonium salt having a halide ion as a counter ion is copolymerized with other additional hydrophilic monomer to produce a hydrogel results in a too great linear swelling coefficient, thereby leading to failure in solving the foregoing problems. In addition, when the solubility of the employed monomers with one another is insufficient, and a hydrophobic compound must be further added to a system of copolymerization of a hydrophilic monomer with a monomer having a quaternary ammonium salt, in particular, the transparency is unsatisfactory. Moreover, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JPH6337378B"><text>H6-337378</text></patcit> does not disclose means for reducing the linear swelling coefficient when this hydrogel is used for an ophthalmic lens.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">On the other hand, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2008122937A"><text>2008-122937</text></patcit> discloses an ophthalmic lens having a base layer part made of a silicone hydrogel containing a silicone component, and a superficial layer part made of a polymer compound including monomer units having at least one ammonium group in the molecule. Also, it is described that such an ophthalmic lens has an antibacterial property, and the antibacterial property is not<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> reduced even if washing with water or the like is carried out. However, since this ophthalmic lens has a two-layer structure including a base layer part and a superficial layer part, it is manufactured by producing the base layer part first, and then forming the superficial layer part on the surface thereof. Therefore, multiple steps are included in manufacture, and thus the manufacture equipment becomes complicated, thereby leading to increase in the cost.

More specifically, a main object of the present invention is to provide an ophthalmic lens having superior antibacterial property and transparency, with a sufficiently low linear swelling coefficient, and being capable of providing comfortable wearing feel. In addition, another object of the present invention is to provide an ophthalmic lens which may be suitably used as a contact lens.</p><heading id="h0007">[Means for Solving the Problems]</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present inventors thoroughly investigated, and consequently found that an ophthalmic lens having high transparency, and low linear swelling coefficient, and superior antibacterial property can be obtained by using a hydrogel formed from an ionic compound including a cation having a polymerizable functional group, and a fluorine-containing anion. Thus, the present invention was accomplished.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">An aspect of the invention made in order to solve the foregoing problems provides an ophthalmic lens integrally formed<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> with a hydrogel,<br/>
the hydrogel including a copolymer obtained from a composition comprising
<ul><li>(A) an ionic compound including a cation having a polymerizable functional group, and a fluorine-containing anion (hereinafter, referred to as ionic compound (A)), and</li><li>(B) a hydrophilic compound having a polymerizable functional group.</li></ul></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The ophthalmic lens exhibits a potent antibacterial property, and can effectively reduce the occurrence of eye diseases and the like owing to the cation and the fluorine-containing anion present as components of the hydrogel. In addition, since the ophthalmic lens is integrally formed in the entirety of the lens from the hydrogel lens, production of a base layer part and a superficial layer part in separate steps is not necessary, whereby manufacturing step and the equipment can be simplified, and thus reduction of the manufacturing cost is enabled. Moreover, due to containing the fluorine-containing anion in the hydrogel, the ophthalmic lens has significantly low linear swelling coefficient in water, whereby comfortable wearing feel can be provided. It is to be noted that the "hydrophilic compound having a polymerizable functional group" that is the component (B) does not contain a silicone compound as a component (C) described later.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the ophthalmic lens, the cation having a polymerizable functional group in the ionic compound (A) is preferably at least one selected from the set consisting of an imidazolium ion, a pyridinium ion, and a quaternary ammonium ion. By using a combination of such a cation with a fluorine-containing anion, production of a hydrogel having superior antibacterial property, and having a linear swelling coefficient kept at low level is enabled. Moreover, also in the case in which addition of a hydrophobic compound allowing for copolymerization is intended, a transparent hydrogel can be produced due to having sufficient affinity.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the ophthalmic lens, the ionic compound (A) constituting the copolymer is preferably at least one selected from the set consisting of compounds represented by the following formulae (I), (II) and (III).

Moreover, also in the case in which addition of a hydrophobic compound when allowing for copolymerization is intended, a transparent hydrogel can be produced due to having sufficient affinity.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> -->

(in the formula (VII), n6 is of 1 to 3.)</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the ophthalmic lens, it is preferred that the composition further contains a silicone compound (C) in addition to the ionic compound (A) and component (B). Use of a silicone compound as a component of the composition enables to prevent development of eye diseases effectively by improving oxygen permeability of the ophthalmic lens to relieve strain on eyes.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the ophthalmic lens, the ionic compound (A) is preferably an ionic liquid. Since ionic liquids are flame retardant and have a high thermal decomposition temperature, a hydrogel that is superior in thermal stability can be obtained by using an ionic liquid as the ionic compound (A) . In addition, since the ionic liquid is in a state of liquid at normal temperatures, it is miscible with other monomer without need of a large quantity of a solvent, and additionally the handling can be more convenient as compared with the state of solid. Still further, due to comparatively high ion density and polarity, ionic compound molecules failed to participate in the copolymerization reaction stably coordinate to the polar group of the copolymer in the ionic liquid, and thus an ophthalmic lens capable of exhibiting superior antibacterial property for a long period of time, and a low linear swelling coefficient in water can be obtained.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The linear swelling coefficient in water of the ophthalmic lens is preferably less than the linear swelling coefficient in water of the ophthalmic lens in which the fluorine-containing anion<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> was replaced for an anion not containing fluorine. Moreover, the difference between the linear swelling coefficient in water of the ophthalmic lens in which the fluorine-containing anion was replaced for an anion not containing fluorine and the linear swelling coefficient in water of the ophthalmic lens before the replacement is preferably no less than 0.005 and no greater than 0.1. By using the fluorine-atom-containing anion as the anion in the ionic compound (A) in the ophthalmic lens, the linear swelling coefficient in water can be reduced as compared with the case in which an anion not containing fluorine was used, whereby more comfortable wearing feel can be achieved, and preventing deterioration of wearing feel and eye diseases such as failures due to dry eyes and the like, which may occur based on ease in drying resulting from the ophthalmic lens having a high linear swelling coefficient is enabled. It is to be noted that the "linear swelling coefficient" as referred to herein means the proportion of the diameter of the ophthalmic lens subsequently immersed in distilled water at 20°C and reached a state of equilibrium in terms of swelling, with respect to the diameter of the ophthalmic lens after completing the copolymerization reaction of the ionic compound (A) and component (B) and represented by the proportion.

These cations may be used alone, or a plurality of types of the cations may be used in combination.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Although the polymerizable functional group included in the cation is not particularly limited, typical examples are ethylenic unsaturated groups.

Moreover, also in the case in which addition of a hydrophobic compound when allowing for copolymerization of the ionic compound (A) and the component (B) is intended, a transparent hydrogel can be produced due to having sufficient affinity.
