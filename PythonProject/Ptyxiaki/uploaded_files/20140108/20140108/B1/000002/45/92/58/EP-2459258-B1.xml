The invention also relates to a metered-dose inhaler which includes the dose counter and a method of counting doses dispensed from a metered-dose inhaler.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Background of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Metered-dose inhalers include pressurised metered-dose inhalers (of both manually operable and breath-actuated types) and dry-powder inhalers. Such metered-dose inhalers typically comprise a medicament-containing vessel and an actuator body having a drug delivery outlet. The medicament-containing vessel may be a pressurised canister containing a mixture of active drug and propellant. Such canisters are usually formed from a deep-drawn aluminium cup having a crimped ferrule which carries a metering valve assembly. The metering valve assembly is provided with a protruding valve stem which, in use, is inserted as a tight push fit into a so-called "stem block" in the body.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">To actuate the conventional manually operable inhaler, the user applies a compressive force to the closed end of the canister. The internal components of the metering valve assembly are spring loaded so that a compressive force of about 15 to 30 N is required to activate the device. In response to this compressive force, the canister moves axially with respect to the valve stem by an amount varying from about 2 to 4 mm. This degree of axial movement is sufficient to actuate the metering valve and cause a metered quantity of the drug and propellant to be expelled through the valve stem. This is then released into the mouthpiece via a nozzle in the stem block. A user inhaling through the drug delivery outlet of the device at this point will thus receive a dose of the drug.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Metered-dose inhalers as described above administer an accurate dose of medicament whenever required, which is particularly useful for users whose<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> respiratory difficulties manifest themselves suddenly. Such has been the success of these devices that they are now used throughout the world.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A more recent development is the so-called breath-actuated metered-dose inhaler which delivers a dose of drug through a mouthpiece in response to inhalation by the user. This type of arrangement is particularly convenient in circumstances where the co-ordination between user inhalation and manual depression of the aerosol canister is imperfect. For example, children sometimes lack the necessary co-ordination to achieve effective self-administration and, at times of respiratory distress, adult users may also experience poor co-ordination.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">One of the drawbacks of self-administration from an inhaler, whether manually operated or breath-actuated, is that users often experience difficulty in determining when the charge in the medicament-containing vessel has nearly run out, since the contents of the medicament reservoir are typically invisible to the user. With aerosol canisters, part of the reason for this difficulty is that a surplus of propellant may remain in the canister even though the drug supply is nearly exhausted. Alternatively, the near-exhausted state may result in a surplus of drug in relation to propellant. Thus, the illusion is created that the inhaler is still capable of providing useful doses of medicament simply because the canister contains liquid. This is potentially hazardous for the user since dosing becomes unreliable and because few users routinely carry a back-up device. Many users have several different inhalers for the treatment of a variety of conditions. Others keep inhalers at a number of different locations such as at school, home, work etc. In these circumstances it is particularly difficult for the user to keep track of the amount of usage extracted from each individual inhaler apparatus.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO9828033A"><text>WO 98/28033</text></patcit> discloses a dose counter suitable for use with the above-described metered-dose inhalers. The dose counter enables users to assess how many doses remain in the obscured canister. Such a counter can provide a warning when the inhaler nears exhaustion so that appropriate measures can be taken to avoid running out of medication. Moreover, since the dose counter has a counting resolution of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> one dose, it can be used for compliance monitoring, either under hospital supervision or by parents and teachers assessing compliance by children in their care. Furthermore, there are regulatory requirements for metered-dose inhalers to have a dose counter in a number of countries.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs 1 to 3</figref> reproduced herein from <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO9828033A"><text>WO 98/28033</text></patcit> show the lower portion of a metered-dose inhaler. The inhaler comprises a body 2 having a drug delivery outlet 4. An aerosol canister 6 extends into the lower portion of the body 2. The aerosol canister 6 is formed from a deep-drawn aluminium cup 8 to which a ferrule 10 is attached by crimping.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The lid 10 carries a metering-valve assembly having a protruding valve stem 12, the end of which is received as a tight push fit in a stem block 14 of the body 2. Stem block 14 has a nozzle 16 communicating with the drug delivery outlet 4 so that, upon actuation of the metering-valve assembly, a charge of the drug is emitted through the nozzle 16 into the drug delivery outlet 4. Actuation of the metering-valve assembly is effected by causing downward movement of the aerosol canister 6 relative to the body 2. This may be achieved through manual pressure exerted by the user against the upturned base (not shown) of the aerosol canister 6 or by automatic depression of the aerosol canister 6 in response to user inhalation in inhalers of the breath-actuated type. The mechanism of actuation does not form part of <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO9828033A"><text>WO 98/28033</text></patcit> or the present invention and will not be described in further detail. A user inhaling through the drug delivery outlet 4 when the aerosol canister 6 is depressed will receive a metered dose of the drug.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">With reference to the Figures, a counter mechanism 18 includes an actuator shaft 20 moulded from a plastics material, such as nylon, the actuator shaft 20 having a boss 22 integrally formed at its base. The underside of boss 22 is formed with a blind hole which receives a compression spring 24 mounted on an upstanding spigot 26 formed on a lower element of the counter chassis.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A driver 28 for driving a rotary gear in the form of a ratchet-toothed wheel 30 is<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> integrally moulded with boss 22 of the actuator shaft 20 and comprises a transverse hook element mounted between two arms (only one of which is visible in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>), the bases of which are conjoined to the boss 22. The transverse hook is dimensioned and oriented to engage with ratchet teeth 32 formed around the periphery of the ratchet-toothed wheel 30 to rotate it in a forward direction.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The ratchet-toothed wheel 30 is integrally moulded with a first hollow axle 34 which is rotatably supported on a first spindle 36 that projects transversely from a chassis sub-element 38. Chassis sub-element 38 also has a second spindle 40 projecting transversely therefrom on which a second hollow axle 42 is rotatably supported. A flexible tape 44 is wound around the second hollow axle 42 which serves as a supply spool and passes to the first hollow axle 34 which serves as a take-up spool (stock bobbin). A guide plate 46 forming part of the chassis sub-element 38 helps to guide the tape 44 in a smooth passage from the supply spool to the take-up spool. The surface of the tape 44 is marked with a progression of descending numbers which denote the number of doses remaining in the aerosol canister. Typically, the starting count is 200 and successive markings on the tape decrease by one. The spacing between successive markings is coincident with the indexing motion of the ratchet-toothed wheel 30 so that a new number appears in a window 48 provided in the body 2 for each successive actuation.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The ratchet-toothed wheel 30 and integrally formed first hollow axle 34 are restrained from reverse rotation by a wrap-spring clutch 50 surrounding the hollow axle 34 at the end thereof remote from ratchet-toothed wheel 30. One end (not shown) of the wrap-spring clutch 50 is braced against the counter chassis. The windings of the wrap-spring clutch 50 are oriented such that rotation of the first hollow axle 34 in a forward sense is not resisted by the spring coils. However, reverse rotation of the hollow axle 34 acts so as to tighten the spring coils around it, thereby causing the first hollow axle 34 to be gripped by the internal surface of the wrap-spring clutch 50 and hence restraint from reverse rotation.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> shows a more detailed view of the principal elements of the dose counter 18.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It will be seen that the driver 28 comprises the transverse hook 52 mounted between a pair of arms 54, 56 which are joined at their bases by a web. The web is connected to the boss 22 of the actuator shaft 20. A combined actuator and driver assembly may be integrally formed, such as from a plastics material, e.g. as nylon.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In use of the dose counter 18, depression of the canister 6 causes the ferrule 10 to engage with the actuator shaft 20, which actuator shaft 20 moves downwards against the compression spring 24. The transverse hook 52, in turn, engages with the ratchet teeth 32 of the ratchet-toothed wheel 30 which is mounted on the hollow axle 34 serving as the take-up spool for the flexible tape display 44. At the end of the hollow axle 34 remote from the ratchet-toothed wheel 30 is the clutch 50 which serves to restrain the axle 34 against reverse rotation and hence prevents reverse travel of the counter tape 44.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">A control surface 58 is depicted in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> as a see-through element so that the workings of the dose counter may be more clearly seen. The control surface 58 extends parallel to the direction of travel of the actuator shaft 20 and is located adjacent the ratchet-toothed wheel 30 at a position which marks a chordal projection across one of the wheel faces. One of the support arms 56 of the driver 28 is in sliding contact with control surface 58. This sliding contact serves to inhibit the natural tendency of the driver 28 to flex radially inwardly towards the axis of rotation of the ratchet-toothed wheel 30. By preventing such radially inward flexure, the control surface 58 restricts the engagement and disengagement of the drive 28 with the ratchet-toothed wheel 30 so that the distance by which the ratchet-toothed wheel 30 rotates is limited to one tooth pitch. This condition is observed regardless of the extent of linear travel, or stroke, of the actuator shaft 20.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> shows a schematic view of an alternative arrangement for the ratchet-toothed wheel and driver used in the dose counter 18 described in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO9828033A"><text>WO 98/28033</text></patcit>. The alternative arrangement uses a reciprocating driver 28 acting in a pushing sense to rotate a ratchet-toothed wheel 30 in the direction shown by the arrows 31. A fixed pawl 60 acts to prevent reverse rotation of the ratchet-toothed wheel 30 by<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> engagement against the trailing edge 62 of a ratchet tooth 32. However, on forward rotation of the ratchet-toothed wheel 30 in the sense of arrows 31, the fixed pawl 60 is capable of radially outward deformation, urged by the leading edge 63 of a ratchet-tooth 32.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In this arrangement, if the ratchet-toothed wheel 30 is rotated by more than a single tooth pitch but by less than two tooth pitches for each reciprocating movement of the driver 28, there is a degree of reverse rotation until the pawl 60 becomes engaged by the trailing edge 62 (as opposed to the leading edge 63) of a ratchet tooth 32. Thus, the rotation of the ratchet-toothed wheel 30 may be described as "stepped".</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The components of metered-dose inhalers are manufactured to a high technical specification. However, inevitable variations in the tolerances of the components can, in some circumstances, lead to failure of the dose counter of the type disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO9828033A"><text>WO 98/28033</text></patcit>. In a known failure mode, the reciprocating stroke of the canister is insufficient to fully increment the dose counter. This may lead to undercounting, particularly where rotation of the ratchet-toothed wheel is stepped, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Another problem relates particularly to manually operated metered-dose inhalers. In these types of inhaler, the user cannot be relied upon to repeatably actuate the inhaler with a full reciprocating stroke of the canister. Instead, the user may on some occasions release the canister immediately after the "fire point" of the metering valve, that is to say the point in the stroke at which the medicament is dispensed. This reduced stroke of the canister available for incrementing the dose counter may exacerbate the problem described above.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Overtravel, or excessive travel, of the canister can also cause problems in relation to dose counters.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO9209324A1"><text>WO9209324 (A1</text></patcit>) discloses an aerosol dispenser for use with an aerosol vial, comprising an assembly that indicates the quantity of doses dispensed from or remaining in the aerosol vial.

<ul><li>a rotatably mounted gear wheel having a circular arrangement of ratchet teeth;</li><li>a display coupled to the gear wheel, the display having a visible array of dose counting indicia indexable in response to rotary motion of the gear wheel; and</li><li>an actuator mechanism having a driver for rotatably driving the gear wheel in response to the dispensation of a medicament dose, the driver being arranged to engage the ratchet teeth of the gear wheel,</li><li>wherein the actuator mechanism comprises a pivotally mounted lever or linkage having an input portion, the lever or linkage being arranged to amplify a linear stroke at the input portion such that a linear stroke of the driver exceeds the linear input stroke.</li></ul></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The counter of the present invention thus provides an actuator mechanism which is able to amplify the stroke of a linear input means such as the ferrule of a medicament canister. That is to say, the linear travel of the driver is greater than the linear travel at the input portion of the lever.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The increased stroke of the driver may provide sufficient travel for the dose counter to be reliably incremented, even when the medicament canister is released by the user immediately after the fire point, and even when there is a large degree of accumulated variation, or tolerance stack, in the components of the inhaler. Miscounting or non-counting of doses can thereby be avoided, which in turn significantly reduces the failure rate of the dose counter. Dose counters of the type<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="WO9828033A"><text>WO 98/28033</text></patcit> have been found to be particularly suitable for modification according to the principles of the present invention.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In operating the dose counter, a small increase in actuating force will be required compared to dose counters of the type disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="WO9828033A"><text>WO 98/28033</text></patcit>. For a metered-dose inhaler comprising a pressurised medicament canister, this increase in actuating force generally remains insignificant compared to the force required to overcome the internal valve spring of the canister.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Herein, the term "linear stroke" generally refers to the straight line distance covered at the input portion of the lever arm, or the input portion of the linkage, or the driver, from the start of the stroke to the end of the stroke. In practice, these elements may follow an arcuate path, the radius of which will depend on the particular geometry of the dose counter.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The lever or linkage may be arranged such that the linear stroke of the driver is at least 1.1 times, preferably at least 1.15 times, and most preferably at least 1.2 times, the linear input stroke. In this way, a significant amplification of the input stroke is achieved.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In some embodiments of the dose counter, the actuator mechanism comprises the pivotally mounted lever, with the pivotal mounting being arranged between the input portion and an output portion of the lever. The input portion of the lever may be arranged at an end of the lever.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In other embodiments of the dose counter, the actuator mechanism still comprises a pivotally mounted lever, but the input portion of the lever is arranged between the pivotal mounting and an output portion of the lever. These embodiments may be advantageous in that the travel of the input portion and the travel of the output portion may be in the same direction. In embodiments of this type the input portion of the lever may be defined by a projection extending from the lever in a direction substantially perpendicular to an imaginary line joining the pivotal mounting and<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> the output portion. Alternatively, the input portion may be defined by a bend in the lever.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">A variety of configurations for the actuator mechanism are suitable. For example, the actuator mechanism may be configured so that a medicament canister arranged for reciprocating movement contacts the input portion of the lever directly or via a separate actuator shaft arranged for reciprocating movement. The output portion of the lever may itself carry the driver which engages the gear wheel ratchet teeth, or the driver may be carried by a separate driver shaft arranged for reciprocating movement and for engagement by the output portion of the lever.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In embodiments including a separate actuator shaft for contact by the medicament canister, the actuator shaft is mounted for reciprocating movement and an output portion of the actuator shaft is arranged to engage the input portion of the lever. The actuator shaft may be resiliently biased towards a starting position, the actuator shaft being displaceable against the resilient bias to engage the input portion of the lever. In a particular embodiment, the actuator shaft and lever are arranged such that, in use of the dose counter, pivotal movement of the lever causes the output portion of the actuator shaft to slide across and become misaligned with the input portion of the lever, such that the actuator shaft may continue to move linearly after the pivoting lever (and driver) has reached the end of its travel. In this way, the mechanism may accommodate overtravel, or excessive travel, of the medicament canister.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In embodiments in which the output portion of the lever caries the driver, the lever may be resiliently biased towards a starting position, the lever being displaceable against the resilient bias in response to the linear input stroke. The resilient bias may be provided by at least one of: a leaf spring separate from the lever, a leaf spring integrally formed with the lever, and a compression spring and a torsion spring.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In embodiments including a separate driver shaft which carries the driver, the driver shaft is arranged for contact by the output portion of the lever and is mounted for reciprocating movement. The driver shaft may be resiliently biased towards a starting position, the driver shaft being displaceable against the resilient bias in response to engagement by the output portion of the lever. The resilient bias may, for example, be provided by a compression spring.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In some embodiments, the lever is arranged such that the direction of movement of the output portion is substantially perpendicular to the direction of movement of the input portion. In other embodiments, the lever is arranged such that the direction of movement of the output portion is substantially parallel to the direction of movement of the input portion.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">A variety of different types of pivotal mounting are suitable for the lever. For example, the lever may be rotatably mounted to a separate mounting structure to thereby provide the pivotal mounting. The rotatable mounting may comprise a male member formed on one of the lever and the mounting structure and received in a hole or opening formed in the other of the lever and the mounting structure.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Alternatively, a mounting end of the lever may be provided with a tongue which is narrower than the lever, and the tongue may be inserted through an aperture or slot formed in a thin walled mounting structure. The end of the lever having the tongue is then able to rotate about the aperture or slot, to thereby provide the pivotal mounting of the lever. In another arrangement a mounting end of the lever is simply received in a channel formed in a mounting structure, which arrangement allows limited pivotal movement of the lever.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The pivotal mounting of the lever may also be provided as one of a variety of different types of flexure hinges. In this case, the lever may be integrally formed with a mounting structure, the flexure hinge being located between the lever and the mounting structure. For example, the lever and mounting structure may be defined by a moulded plastics component, in which case the flexure hinge is a living hinge.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The lever and mounting structure may alternatively be defined by a stamped metal component, preferably a thin-walled component, in which case the flexure hinge may be a portion of the component having reduced flexural strength such that, in use of the dose counter, deformation at the flexure hinge is substantially elastic. The stamped metal component may have a cantilever configuration.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">When the pivotal mounting is provided as a flexure hinge, the integrally formed mounting structure may be provided with an aperture or slot for receiving a male locating feature of a housing component of the dose counter or inhaler. The mounting structure may define at least one barb-like feature adjacent to the aperture or slot for engagement with the male locating feature. The barb-like feature may serve to attach the mounting structure to the housing component.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The lever may be provided with a second flexure hinge for accommodating overtravel at the input portion. The second flexure hinge may be arranged between the pivotal mounting and the output portion of the lever, the flexure hinge comprising a portion of the lever having reduced flexural strength. In use of the dose counter, the second flexure hinge is elastically deformable to allow continued travel at the input portion after the output portion (and driver) has reached the end of its normal travel.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Alternatively, overtravel at the input portion of the lever may be accommodated by configuring the pivotal mounting to be linearly displaceable against a resilient bias, such as a compression spring. In this way, the input portion of the lever may be allowed to continue to move after the output portion (and the driver) has reached the end of its travel. The resilient bias may have a preload so that the pivotal mounting only displaces after the dose counter has been actuated.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In a specific embodiment of the dose counter, the lever is provided with a through-hole or opening having an axis extending in a direction perpendicular to the pivotal axis, and in a direction substantially parallel to the direction of travel at the input portion of the lever. A fixed mounting post with a flanged head (preferably T-shaped)<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> extends through the through-hole or opening with a clearance fit sufficient to provide the pivotal mounting. The mounting post also carries a preloaded compression coil spring which urges the lever against the flanged head of the post. The lever is displaceable along the post, against the compression spring, to allow the input portion of the lever to continue to move after the output portion has reached the end of its travel. The spring preload exceeds the force required at the input portion of the lever to actuate the dose counter, so that the pivotal mounting is not displaced linearly until after the dose counter has been actuated.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The dose counter may be provided with means to prevent reverse rotation of the gear wheel, such as a pawl arranged to engage the ratchet teeth of the gear wheel. This means may provide step-wise rotation of the gear wheel.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The driver may be arranged to rotatably drive the gear wheel on a forward or a return stroke. The driver may also be arranged such that its engagement surface extends in a direction parallel to the axis of the gear wheel (and its ratchet teeth) at substantially the middle of its normal stroke. In this way, the angles at which the driver engages the ratchet teeth of the gear wheel can be minimised, thereby minimising component wear. A control surface may be provided to regulate the position of engagement and disengagement between the driver and the gear wheel.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The display may comprise a flexible tape arranged between an indexing spool and a stock bobbin. The dose counting indicia of the display may include a unique indicium for display after each and every dose has been dispensed. The dose counting indicia may comprise at least 50 unique dose counting indicia representative of a number of doses dispensed by or remaining in the inhaler.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a metered-dose inhaler comprising a medicament canister, an actuator body for receiving the canister and having a medicament delivery outlet, and the dose counter described above.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0050" num="0050">According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of counting doses dispensed from a metered-dose inhaler, the dose counter comprising:

Thus, the invention generally provides a dose counter comprising a<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> rotatably mounted gear wheel having a circular arrangement of ratchet teeth and a display coupled to the gear wheel. The display has a visible array of dose counting indicia indexable in response to rotary motion of the gear wheel. The dose counter also comprises an actuator mechanism having a driver for rotatably driving the gear wheel in response to the dispensation of a medicament dose, the driver being arranged to engage the ratchet teeth of the gear wheel.

The third dose counter 318 additionally comprises an actuator member 320 in the form of a stamped metal component arranged directly under the canister (not<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> shown). The actuator member 320 is formed of a metal such as stainless steel to be resilient, that is to say elastically deformable. The actuator member 320 is arranged for engagement by the canister and is further arranged for engaging the upper surface of the actuator shaft 20. The actuator member 320 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 11</figref>, which is a cut-away perspective view showing the inside of a breath-actuated inhaler body 2 without a medicament canister, and in <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 12</figref>, which shows the actuator member 320 in isolation.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">The actuator member 320 defines two portions: a flat mounting structure 320a and an elongated lever 320b extending from the mounting structure 320a in a cantilever configuration.

The mounting structure 320a includes a folded-down tab 322 which passes through a slot 362 moulded into the chassis wall 360. The tab 322 serves to locate the member 320 in the correct position on the chassis wall 360. The mounting structure 320a also comprises an opening 324 provided with barb-like features 326a, 326b. A male locating feature 364 of the dose counter chassis passes through the opening 324 and the barb-like features 326a, 326b bear against the male locating feature 364 to retain the mounting structure 320a of the actuator member 320 in place against the chassis wall 360.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">The lever 320b of the actuator member 320 extends from the mounting structure 320a.

The mounting structure 1220a and lever 1220b are joined together by a living hinge 1226 which defines a pivotal mounting of the lever 1220b. The mounting structure 1220a is fixedly attached to the dose counter chassis (not shown).</p><p id="p0144" num="0144">The lever 1220b is substantially "U" shaped. A proximal end of the lever 1220b, adjacent to the living hinge 1226, is provided with an upwardly-facing flat<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> engagement surface 1224 which extends in a substantially horizontal plane. A distal end of the lever 1220b carries the driver 1222. The driver 1222 comprises a transversely extending ratchet drive pawl arranged for engaging the teeth of the ratchet-toothed wheel 30. The ratchet drive pawl extends between a pair of spaced apart support arms.</p><p id="p0145" num="0145">The actuator shaft 20 of the twelfth dose counter 1220 has an upper surface (not shown) arranged for direct engagement by the ferrule of the medicament canister. The actuator shaft is provided with a transverse protrusion which defines a downwardly-facing engagement surface 1240. The actuator shaft 20 is arranged for linear reciprocating movement in a direction parallel to the axis of the medicament canister. The actuator shaft 20 is biased towards the medicament canister by a compression spring 24, as described hereinabove with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>. The engagement surface 1240 of the actuator shaft 20 is arranged to engage the input portion 1224 of the lever 1220b when the actuator shaft is displaced downwards.</p><p id="p0146" num="0146">Use of the twelfth dose counter 1218 for counting doses dispensed from a metered-dose inhaler will now be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0024 f0025">Figures 35a to 36c</figref>, which are schematic sectional views showing the dose counter at different stages of actuation. The Figures show the actuator member 1220 of the dose counter 1218 and the engagement surface 1240 of the actuator shaft 20. The other components of the twelfth dose counter 1218 are essentially the same as those shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref> and are not illustrated. As described hereinabove, the actuator member 1220 includes a pivotally mounted lever 1220b, the living hinge 1226 defining the pivotal mounting. The input portion of the lever 1224 is arranged adjacent to the living hinge 1226 for engagement by the engagement surface 1240 of the actuator shaft 20. The driver 1222 arranged at the distal end of the lever 1220b defines an output portion of the lever 1220b.</p><p id="p0147" num="0147">In <figref idrefs="f0025">Figure 36a</figref> the dose counter 1218 is shown in its neutral arrangement, that is to say the arrangement prior to depression of the medicament canister (not shown) to<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --> dispense a dose of medicament. In this arrangement, the actuator shaft 20 is biased towards the medicament canister 6 by the compressions spring 24.</p><p id="p0148" num="0148">The metered-dose inhaler is actuated by the user applying a manual compressive force to the closed end of the medicament canister (not shown). In response to this compressive force, the canister moves axially with respect to its valve stem (not shown) by an amount varying between 2 and 4mm. The downwards movement of the canister causes the ferrule to engage with and displace downwards the actuator shaft 20, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0025">Figure 36b</figref>. The engagement surface 1240 of the actuator shaft 20 engages the input portion 1224 of the lever 1220b, thereby causing the lever 1220b to rotate clockwise about the pivotal mounting (defined by living hinge 1226). The output portion of the lever (defined by driver 1222) directly engages a tooth of the ratchet-tooth wheel 30 to increment the dose counter 318, as described hereinabove with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>. The twelfth dose counter 1218 may be provided with a control surface to regulate the positions of engagement and disengagement by the driver 1222, as described hereinabove with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0149" num="0149">The input portion of the lever 1220b is positioned between the pivotal mounting (defined by living hinge 1226) and the output portion of the lever (defined by driver 1222), and is relatively closer to the pivotal mounting. As such, the lever 1220b serves to amplify a linear input stroke at the input portion of the lever 1220b so that the output portion provides an increased stroke for indexing the ratchet-toothed wheel 30. This reduces the risk of miscounting, particularly undercounting, and, in turn, reduces the failure rate of the dose counter.</p><p id="p0150" num="0150"><figref idrefs="f0025">Figure 36c</figref> shows the arrangement of the twelfth dose counter 1218 after the driver 1222 has reached the end of its downwards travel, and following further downwards displacement of the medicament canister (not shown). In this arrangement, the engagement surface 1240 of the actuator shaft 20 has become misaligned with the input portion 1224 of the lever 1220b. The engagement surface 1224 of the actuator shaft therefore slips off the edge of the input portion 1224 of the lever<!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --> 1220b and may continue to move downwards to thereby accommodate overtravel of the canister. As shown in the Figure, the actuator shaft 20 continues to move downwards without causing any further rotation of the lever 1220b.</p><p id="p0151" num="0151">The present invention further provides a metered-dose inhaler 72 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0026">Figure 37</figref>. The inhaler comprises a medicament canister 6, an actuator body 74 for receiving the canister 6 and having a medicament delivery outlet, and the dose counter as described hereinabove. The actuator body 74 has a window 76 for viewing the display. In a preferred embodiment the actuator body 74 comprises a sump, and preferably a smooth rounded sump. The rounded sump may have a substantially cylindrical upper portion and a substantially hemi-spherical lower portion. By providing a smooth sump the internal surfaces are sufficiently free of protrusions so that during normal use medicament will not substantially adhere thereto.</p><p id="p0152" num="0152">The medicament canister 6 may contain a medicament in the form of an aerosol. The medicament may be any medicament that is suitable to be delivered to a patient via a metered-dose inhaler. In particular medicaments for the treatment of a wide variety of respiratory disorders are delivered in this manner including anti-allergic agents (e.g. cromoglycate, ketotifen and nedocromil), anti-inflammatory steroids (e.g. beclomethasone dipropionate, fluticasone, budesonide, flunisolide, ciclesonide, triamcinolone acetonide and mometasone furoate); bronchodilators such as: [beta]2-agonists (e.g. fenoterol, formoterol, pirbuterol, reproterol, salbutamol, salmeterol and terbutaline), non-selective [beta]-stimulants (e.g. isoprenaline), and xanthine bronchodilators (e.g. theophylline, aminophylline and choline theophyllinate); and anticholinergic agents (e.g. ipratropium bromide, oxitropium bromide and tiotropium).</p><p id="p0153" num="0153">Although the invention herein has been described with reference to particular embodiments, it is to be understood that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles and applications of the present invention. It is therefore to be understood that numerous modifications may be made to the illustrative<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --> embodiments and that other arrangements may be devised without departing from the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p0154" num="0154">For example, the dose counters described hereinabove are configured to actuate the dose counter on the forward (downwards) stroke of a medicament canister. The dose counters may alternatively be configured to actuate the dose counter of the reverse (upwards) stroke.</p><p id="p0155" num="0155">The actuator mechanisms of the dose counters described hereinabove comprise levers. Instead of a lever, more complicated linkages may be used to amplify the linear input stroke. Suitable linkages will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56983862" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Ein Dosiszähler zum Zählen der abgegebenen oder verbliebenen Medikamentendosen in einem Dosieraerosol, wobei zum Dosiszähler folgendes gehört:
