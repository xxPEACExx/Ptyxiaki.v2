Description of Related Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The barbecue devices in the current market are mainly direct fired barbecues that burn charcoal as the origin of heat, which apply a top-opening cabinet structure. The ignited charcoal is placed at the bottom of the cabinet while using, and generally the barbecuing area is above the heating area, e.g. a net rack is on the upper part of the cabinet for the food to be barbecued. The potential problem is that the ignition of charcoal is quite difficult. And the burning of charcoal will bring a large amount of smoke and ash, which not only causes the pollution of the air but also affects the cleanness of the barbecued food. And it is easy to cause the food undercooked or scorched due to the difficulty of control of the fire temperature, thus being difficult to control the quality of food. In order to solve the problems of the charcoal burned barbecue, some top-opening electrically heated barbecues are designed. However, since the issues regarding temperature adjustment and time adjustment of the barbecue are not solved, the quality of the barbecued food remains unsatisfied. Additionally, since the temperature at the lower part is much higher than in the upper part of such barbecue, the heat may lose during the process of heat transfer from the bottom up which causes the waste of energy, and the food may fall down to the bottom of the device during barbecuing thus being burnt and causing smog pollution which makes the barbecue difficult to clean after cooking. Since the current barbecuing device can only heat one side of the food, the user is required to flip the food constantly during barbecuing to evenly heat both sides of the food, and the barbecuing condition of the food needs to be<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> judged by experience, which makes it difficult to control the food quality.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">One example of the prior art is <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO9614786A"><text>WO96/14786A</text></patcit> which discloses the preamble of claim 1.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">An internally electric heated barbecue is provided in the present invention, which created a brand-new way to simplify the operation of barbecue and make it safe and clean, through which the food quality can be controlled effectively.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In order to achieve the above-mentioned purposes, an internally electric heated barbecue is characterized in that: the opening is 30mm-200mm wide; the rack supporting part has a concavity and a supporting part, the barbecue rack's support rod holder has a convexity matching with the concavity to limit the position of the barbecue rack, and the supporting part is used to support the barbecue rack's support holder.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Preferably the barbecue rack's support rod holder includes a first rod holder and a second rod holder, which are fixed separately and connected to the other sides of the two frames, wherein said two rod holders have certain gradient.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Preferably, the two frames pin joining parts have position holders.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Preferably, the two rod holders have buckling parts which cooperate with each other.
