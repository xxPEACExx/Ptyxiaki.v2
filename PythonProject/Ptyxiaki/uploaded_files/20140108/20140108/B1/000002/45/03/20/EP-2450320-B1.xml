Nonetheless it is explained that ZrO<sub>2</sub> is unnecessary as nucleating agent as TiO<sub>2</sub> is a much more efficient nucleating agent. Moreover ZrO<sub>2</sub> is much less soluble than TiO<sub>2</sub> in the glass, hence its presence hazards unmelted particles and/or devitrification in the glass and requires higher melting temperature.

The described glass-ceramics are able to withstand thermal treatments at 1 000°C without deformation. L. R. Pinckney has observed that the precursor glasses melted with TiO<sub>2</sub> (but without arsenic) leads to glass-ceramics showing a gray colour and so having a low transmission in all the visible range. Such a low transmission is a stopper to the use of these glass-ceramics in photovoltaic applications and the like as it reduces the amount of light which is able to reach the silicon. L. R. Pinckney suggests that a partial reduction of titanium in Ti<sup>3+</sup> is responsible for the very strong absorption in the visible. Actually, it appears that, in addition to its fining effect, arsenic also plays a role of bleaching agent.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US20050096208A"><text>US patent application 2005/0096208</text></patcit> describes glass-ceramics containing spinel, sapphirine or cordierite as main crystalline phase.

There is also no teaching at all in said International patent application on the transparency of the disclosed glass-ceramics.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In such a context, the inventors have considered the technical problem of providing spinel glass-ceramics:
<ul><li>free of any toxic fining agent (free of As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>),</li><li>showing a high transmission in the visible and near IR (such a high transmission is very important in the case of photovoltaic or equivalent applications: the glass-ceramic used as superstrate so allows a maximum of solar energy to reach the silicon layer), i.e, showing (under a thickness of 1 mm) a transmission of at least 50% for any wavelength in the 400-450 nm range (preferably higher than 70% for any wavelength in the 400-450 nm range), higher than 80% for any wavelength in the 450-520 nm range and higher than 85% for any wavelength in the 520-1000 nm range, and</li><li>for which the precursor glasses display a liquidus lower than 1500°C and a viscosity at the liquidus higher than 700 dPa.s.

<ul><li>a high strain point (higher than 850°C, more preferably higher than 875°C and most preferably higher than 900°C), as well as</li><li>a CTE in the 30-40x10<sup>-7</sup>K<sup>-1</sup> range (25-300°C).</li></ul></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Said advantageous characteristics are particularly required if the glass-ceramics of the invention are aimed to be used as substrate for layer(s) made of a semi-conductor, especially for crystalline silicon layer(s). So:
<ul><li>their CTE provides a relatively close thermal match to silicon,</li></ul>
and<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> -->
<ul><li>their high strain point allows to use them as substrate to make high quality crystalline silicon by growth at high temperature (&gt; 850°C).</li></ul></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">We incidentally note here that the glass-ceramics of the invention have more particularly been developed in reference to the 5 above stipulations (so as to be particularly suitable as substrate for layer(s) made of a semi-conductor, especially for crystalline silicon layer(s)) but that the invention also encompasses glass-ceramics complying with only the first 3 stipulations and usable in others contexts. Such transparent spinel glass-ceramics are easily obtained, free of toxic fining agent and are <i>per se</i> interesting.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Tin oxide is known as a possible substitute to arsenic for fining in alumino-silicate glasses. However it was not at all obvious to have tin oxide in the composition of glass-ceramics, said glass-ceramics obtained from a precursor glass with a suitable liquidus <u>and</u> said glass-ceramics having a high transmission. As explained above, the removal of arsenic leads to a strong absorption in all the visible range and the removal of titanium oxide and its replacement by zirconium oxide leads to transparent material but with an inacceptable liquidus (&gt; 1500°C). Moreover, titanium containing glass-ceramics tend to have a strong absorption in the 400-450 nm range, probably due to the existence of a charge transfer between titanium and iron brought as an impurity by the raw materials. This absorption is enhanced when tin oxide is added.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The inventors have actually surprisingly discovered that the co-presence of TiO<sub>2</sub> <u>and</u> ZrO<sub>2</sub> as nucleating agents together with a low level of iron allow the use of SnO<sub>2</sub> as substitute for As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the obtaining of suitable transparent spinel glass-ceramics.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">So they are able to propose, as the main subject-matter of the present invention, a <u>transparent</u> glass-ceramic material, <u>free of As and Sb</u> and containing a <u>spinel</u> solid solution as the main crystalline phase.

The epitaxial thickening of such layers is advantageously performed at temperatures above 800 °C, and more advantageously performed at temperatures above 1000 °C (<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>I. Gordon et al., Solar Energy Materials &amp; Solar Cells 94 (2010) 381-385</text></nplcit>). Another mean of achieving a high quality polycrystalline silicon layer is to perform a high temperature rapid thermal annealing step of a previously grown polycrystalline silicon layer (<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>B. Rau et al., Materials Science and Engineering B 159-160 (2009) 329-332</text></nplcit>).</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Photovoltaic cells usually include at least one transparent conductive layer located between the superstrate and the at least one semiconductor absorber layer. Such a transparent conductive layer allows the collection of the charge carriers generated in the semiconductor absorber layer, while allowing most of the photons to reach the semiconductor absorber layer. The transparent conductive layer may be a transparent conductive oxide layer, or more advantageously, in the case of an epitaxial thickening of a seed layer, may be the seed layer itself in the event that it is a highly doped layer. The transparent conductive layer usually has significant absorption below a wavelength of 400 nm, which does not result in the generation of collectable charge carriers. Therefore a superstrate should preferably have a high transmission for wavelengths above 400 nm. In the preferred case of an epitaxially thickened seed layer, where the seed layer also acts as the conductive layer, this semitransparent conductive layer usually has significant absorption up to a wavelength of about 450 nm. In this case, a superstrate should preferably have a high transmission for wavelengths above 450 nm. In this way the glass-ceramics of the invention are particularly suitable as superstrates for photovoltaic cells.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">According to its second subject-matter, the present invention relates to alumino-silicate glass materials which are precursor of the glass-ceramic materials described above (constituting the first subject-matter of the present invention). Such glass materials are novel. They have the compositions indicated above (for the glass-ceramics of the invention). Within said compositions, the level of zirconium oxide can be kept at a low enough level to limit devitrification. The co-presence of TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZrO<sub>2</sub> allows the requirements to be satisfied.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">According to its third subject-matter, the present invention relates to articles made of glass-ceramic materials described above. Such glass-ceramic articles may present any shape and may be aimed to any use. Advantageously, they consist in a sheet. Such sheets generally have a thickness in the range of 0.5 to 4 mm. Such sheets are advantageously used as support (substrate) for semiconductor thin films.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">According to its fourth subject-matter, the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing an article made of a glass-ceramic material as described above. Said method successively includes:
<ul><li>melting of a batch mixture of raw materials able to vitrify, said batch mixture containing SnO<sub>2</sub> as refining agent, followed by refining of the molten glass obtained,</li><li>cooling of the refined molten glass obtained and, simultaneously, forming it into a desired form for the targeted article, and</li><li>ceramming of said formed glass,</li></ul>
said batch mixture being a precursor of a glass-ceramic material as described above.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Said method is a conventional one in that it includes the three successive conventional steps of melting, cooling and forming, and ceramming. It is characteristically carried out with a suitable mineral batch mixture (including SnO<sub>2</sub> as fining agent, TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZrO<sub>2</sub> as nucleating agents and less than 100 ppm of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, advantageously in the amounts as more precisely described above) and with a suitable heat-treatment which provides a spinel glass-ceramic.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The ceramming treatment generally comprises the two steps: a nucleation step (in the 700-850°C range) and a step of crystal growth (in the 850 - 1050°C range). At least one hour is required for each of these steps.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The forming step of said method is advantageously carried out to produce a sheet. Thus, it very advantageously consists in rolling (between rollers) or in a float process. The produced sheet generally has a thickness of 0.5 to 4 mm.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Any sheet produced by the above method, more generally any sheet in a glass-ceramic of the invention, is opportunely a part of a structure including, further to said sheet, at least one layer made of a semi-conductor (arranged on said sheet). Such a structure constitutes a further subject-matter of the invention.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Lastly, the invention relates to electronic and optoelectronic devices comprising such a structure (glass-ceramic sheet + at least one layer made of a semi-conductor). Such devices may consist in a photovoltaic device, a flat panel display device, a liquid crystal display device. Said list is in no way exhaustive.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The man skilled in the art has understood the great advantage of the spinel glass-ceramic materials of the invention.
