Discussion of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">Generally, almost every vehicle employs an electric power-assist steering<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> system. Such an electric power-assist steering system generates an assist force based on the steering torque and the steering angle, so as to enhance the steering performance of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">That is, a steering system that assists a steering force of a vehicle with a separate power is used to enhance the motion stability of a vehicle.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Conventionally, the auxiliary steering device uses hydraulic pressure, but an Electronic Power Steering (EPS) system adapted to transmit a rotation output of an electric motor to a steering shaft via a speed reduction mechanism has been increasingly employed these days from a viewpoint of a reduction in engine load, a reduction in weight, an enhanced steering stability and a quick restoring force.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The EPS system is such that an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) drives a motor in response to steering conditions detected by a speed sensor, a torque angle sensor and a torque sensor to enhance a steering stability and provide a quick restoring force, whereby a driver can safely steer a vehicle.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The EPS system is also such that a motor assists a torque manipulating a steering wheel to allow a driver to steer a vehicle with less power, where the motor employs a Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) motor.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The BLDC motors have been increasingly used because the brushless motors are excellent in maintenance property, have small size, and are capable of generating high torque. The BLDC motor is a DC motor mounted with an<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> electronic rectifying system, excluding those mechanical contact portions such as a brush and a rectifier from the conventional DC motor. The BLDC motor largely includes a stator and a rotor, where the stator is wound with a coil, and the rotor is coupled to a magnet and rotated by electromagnetic interaction therebetween.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The stator includes a core and a coil, and generally employs a plurality of divided cores these days that are connected in a circular shape.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a stator and a bus bar of an EPS motor according to prior art.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The stator (10) is a member secured inside a housing (not shown) of a motor to generate a rotation movement in response to an electromagnetic interaction with a rotor (not shown) arranged inside a hollow hole, and includes a core (13) and a coil (14) wound on the core (13).</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">A motor in a vehicle generally uses a plurality of coils connected in parallel to reduce loss caused by coil resistance, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.
