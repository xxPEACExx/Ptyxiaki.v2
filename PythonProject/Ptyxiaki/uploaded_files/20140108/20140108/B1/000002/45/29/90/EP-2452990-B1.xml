More particularly, the invention relates to a pressure-sensitive adhesive tape or sheet that can maintain high initial adhesive force and adhesion reliability (particularly, repelling resistance) at the time of bonding and can easily be peeled off and can separate and dismantle a joined part at the time of peeling.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally, a pressure-sensitive adhesive tape or sheet ("tape or sheet" is hereinafter sometimes referred to as merely "tape" or "sheet") is utilized in various uses. Representative examples of the pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet include an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet (acrylic adhesive sheet) having a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer (adhesive layer) formed using an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition (acrylic adhesive composition).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In recent years, from growing environmental consciousness, resource saving and recycle are increasingly required in fields using the pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet. For example, an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet particularly is required to have both excellent adhesiveness and easy peelability to a metal adherend in fields of automobiles, machines, electric appliances, building materials and the like from standpoints of improvement in yield, rework in process flow, recycle, workability and the like.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet, for example, an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet having a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer formed from a bubble-containing viscoelastic composition which is a viscoelastic composition containing bubbles, hollow microspheres and a surfactant, the surfactant being a fluorine-based compound having an oxy(C<sub>2-3</sub>)alkyl group and a fluorinated hydrocarbon group in the molecule, is known as an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> composition having high initial adhesive force and adhesion reliability at the time of bonding (see Patent Document 1). The acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet had the problem that the sheet cannot easily be peeled off when peeling.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Furthermore, as an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet, an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet having a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer formed from a pressure-sensitive adhesive composition blending 100 parts by weight of an acrylic polymer prepared by copolymerizing an alkyl (meth)acrylate having 4 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety as the main monomer component and a carboxyl-containing radically polymerizable monomer in an amount of 0.5 to 20% by weight based on the total weight of the monomers, with 0.5 to 20 parts by weight of an epoxy crosslinking agent and 0.1 I to 5 parts by weight of a polyisocyanate compound is known as an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet that can easily be peeled off at the time of peeling (see Patent Document 2). The acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet had the problem that the sheet has poor initial adhesive force and adhesion reliability at the time of bonding.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In addition, a pressure-sensitive adhesive tape which maintains high adhesion force and which can be easily separated/debonded is known. In one embodiment, the adhesive layer of said tape comprises a blowing agent and a monomer mixture or a partially polymerized product of at least one alkyl (meth)acrylate having 2 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety, at least one N-hydroxyalkyl(meth)acrylamide monomer and at least one nitrogen-containing monomer (see Patent Document 3).

In the present invention, the "pressure-sensitive adhesive layer formed from a pressure-sensitive adhesive composition comprising: a monomer mixture comprising (a1), (a2) and (a3) or<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> partially polymerized product thereof; and thermal-expandable fine particle" is sometimes referred to as a "thermal-expandable fine particle-containing pressure-sensitive adhesive layer".</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the present invention, the term "ethylenically unsaturated bond" means a radically polymerizable carbon-carbon double bond. A group having the ethylenically unsaturated bond is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include a vinyl group, a vinylidene group, an allyl group and a (meth)acryloyl group. In the present invention, the term "monofunctional" means to have one ethylenically unsaturated bond in its molecule, and the term "polyfunctional" means to have at least two ethylenically unsaturated bonds in its molecule.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The term "glass transition temperature (Tg) when formed into a homopolymer" means "a glass transition temperature (Tg) of a homopolymer of the monomer", and means a glass transition temperature (Tg) of a polymer formed using only a certain monomer (sometime referred to as a "monomer X") as a monomer component. Specifically, numeral values of Tg of respective homopolymers are shown in <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>Polymer Handbook (third edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1989</text></nplcit>). As for homopolymers that are not described in this literature, values obtained, for example, by the following method are taken as the respective glass transition temperatures (Tg). First, into a reactor equipped with a thermometer, a stirrer, a nitrogen introduction pipe and a reflux cooling tube, 100 parts by weight of a monomer X, 0.2 parts by weight of 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile and 200 parts by weight of ethyl acetate as a polymerization solvent are introduced, and the resulting mixture is stirred for 1 hour while introducing nitrogen gas. After thus removing oxygen in a polymerization system, the mixture is heated to 63°C and allowed to react for 10 hours.

To 100 parts by weight of the partially polymerized monomer syrup, 0.1 part by weight of 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate was added. Further, fine particles (hollow glass beads, trade name: FUJI BALLOON H-40, average particle size: 40 µm, manufactured by Fuji Silysia Chemical Ltd.) were added to the syrup in a proportion of 30% by volume based on the total volume of the syrup. Subsequently, 1 part by weight of a fluorine-based surfactant (trade name: SURFLON S-393,<!-- EPO <DP n="70"> --> manufactured by AGC Seimi Chemical Co., Ltd.) was added to the syrup, followed by uniformly mixing with a propeller mixer, thereby obtaining a polymerizable composition containing fine particles (fine particle-containing polymerizable composition).<br/>
The fine particle-containing polymerizable composition was placed in a beaker, and nitrogen gas was bubbled from the bottom of the beaker. The bubbles generated were uniformly introduced in the fine particle-containing polymerizable composition by a homomixer, thereby obtaining a polymerizable composition containing bubbles and fine particles (bubble-mixed, fine particle-containing polymerizable composition). The bubbles were introduced such that the amount thereof is about 15% by volume based on the total volume (100% by volume) of the polymerizable composition containing bubbles and fine particles.<br/>
The bubble-mixed, fine particle-containing polymerizable composition was applied to a release-treated surface of the release film B in a thickness of 800 µm to form a coating layer. The coating layer was covered with a release-treated surface of the release film A, thereby obtaining a sheet having the bubble-mixed, fine particle-containing polymerizable composition layer between two release films (bubble-mixed, fine particle-containing polymerizable composition layer sheet). The bubble-mixed, fine particle-containing polymerizable composition layer sheet was irradiated with ultraviolet rays under the conditions of illuminance: 4 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> and light intensity: 1,200 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> to photocure the bubble-mixed, fine particle-containing polymerizable composition layer sheet, thereby obtaining a sheet having a bubble-mixed, fine particle-containing viscoelastic layer between two release films (viscoelastic layer sheet A, a sheet having a laminate constitution of release film A/bubble-mixed, fine particle-containing viscoelastic layer/release film B).<br/>

Each of the samples for repelling resistance test was bent at the curvature of R50, that is, bent along the circumference of a circle having a radius of 20 mm in such a manner that the surface side provided by the release film B (in Examples and Comparative Examples 1 and 3 and 6, thermal-expandable fine particle-containing pressure-sensitive adhesive layer side) faces outward.<br/>
After bending, the release film B was peeled off from the sample for repelling resistance test to expose the pressure-sensitive adhesive surface.

Floating distance (distance floated) from the acrylic plate at both ends (both ends in a length direction) of the sample for repelling resistance test was measured, and its average value was obtained. The average value was taken as "floating distance".<br/>
The case that the floating distance was less than 1 mm was evaluated as "Very good", the case that the floating distance was 1 mm or more to less than 3 mm was evaluated as "Good", and the case that the floating distance was more than 3 mm was evaluated as "Poor".</p><p id="p0245" num="0245">In Comparative Example 3, "interlaminar fracture" (peeling between the thermal-expandable fine particle-containing pressure-sensitive adhesive layer and the bubble-mixed, fine particle-containing viscoelastic layer) occurred at evaluating the repelling resistance, and evaluation could not be made.<!-- EPO <DP n="87"> -->
