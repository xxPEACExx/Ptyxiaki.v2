One source is the phasing of the upper and lower cardan joints on an intermediate shaft. Cardan joints phasing imperfections will cause a cyclical variation in the steering torque applied by a driver that repeats every 180 degrees of the steering wheel. A goal in the design of any steering system is to eliminate, or at least minimize, unwanted steering torque variations that are felt by a driver. The best approach to eliminate these torque variations is to eliminate or minimize them at the source, however, due to various limitations and trade-offs, torque variations will always be present to some degree.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2003042067A1"><text>US 2003/042067 A1</text></patcit> discloses a method in accordance with the preamble of claim 1 and a control system in accordance with the preamble of claim 6.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method and an improved system for controlling an electric power steering system.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The object is satisfied by a method in accordance with the features of claim 1 and a control system in accordance with the features of claim 6.

It should be understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals indicate like or corresponding parts and features.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, where the invention will be described with reference to specific embodiments without limiting same, an exemplary embodiment of a vehicle 10 including a steering system 12 is illustrated. In various embodiments, the steering system 12 includes a hand wheel 14 coupled to a steering shaft 16. In one exemplary embodiment, the steering system 12 is an electric power steering (EPS) system that further includes a steering assist unit 18 that couples to the steering shaft 16 of the steering system 12 and to tie rods 20, 22 of the vehicle 10. The steering assist unit 18 includes, for example, a rack and pinion steering mechanism (not shown) that may be coupled through the steering shaft 16 to a steering actuator motor and gearing (hereinafter referred to as the steering actuator). During operation, as the hand wheel 14 is turned by a vehicle operator, the motor of the steering assist unit 18<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> provides the assistance to move the tie rods 20, 22 which in turn moves steering knuckles 24, 26, respectively, coupled to roadway wheels 28, 30, respectively of the vehicle 10. Although an EPS system is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> and described herein, it is appreciated that the steering system 12 of the present disclosure can include various controlled steering systems including, but not limited to, steering systems with hydraulic configurations, and steer by wire configurations.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the vehicle 10 further includes various sensors 31, 32 that detect and measure observable conditions of the steering system 12 and/or of the vehicle 10. The sensors 31, 32 generate sensor signals based on the observable conditions. In various embodiments, the sensors 31, 32 can include, for example, a load sensor, a driver torque sensor, and/or a position sensor.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In various embodiments, a control module 40 controls the operation of the steering system 12 and/or the vehicle 10 based on one or more of the sensor signals and further based on the torque correction systems and methods of the present disclosure. Generally speaking, the torque correction systems and methods of the present disclosure reduce steering torque variation felt by a driver due to intermediate shaft phasing. For example, the systems and methods receive a handwheel angle signal from a position sensor which measures the handwheel angle and uses this information to modify the torque sensor signal and remove any harmonic variation in the output signal. Once implemented, the systems and methods allow a designer more flexibility in designing steering system geometry because the variation in handwheel torque due to the positioning of the steering system components may be removed analytically.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> where a dataflow diagram illustrates exemplary embodiments of the control module 40 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> used to control the steering system 12 and/or the vehicle 10 of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. In various embodiments, the control module 40 can include one or more sub-modules and datastores. As used herein the terms module and sub-module refer to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that executes one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> other suitable components that provide the described functionality. As can be appreciated, the sub-modules shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> can be combined and/or further partitioned to similarly reduce steering torque variation. As can be appreciated, the sub-modules shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> can be implemented as a single control module 40 (as shown) or multiple control modules (not shown). Inputs to the control module 40 can be generated from the sensors of the vehicle 10 (<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>), can be modeled within the control module 40 (e.g., by other sub-modules (not shown)), can be received from other control modules (not shown), and/or can be predefined. In various embodiments, the control module 40 includes a scale factor determination module 50 and a handwheel torque determination module 52.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The scale factor determination module 50 receives as input a relative handwheel position 56. Based on the relative handwheel position 56, the scale factor determination module 50 determines a scale factor 54.

The scale factor determination module 50 evaluates one or more diagnostic trouble codes relating to the handwheel position 56. When a diagnostic trouble code has been set to TRUE, then the scale factor 54 may be set to a predetermined value (e.g., one, or any other value). Otherwise, when the diagnostic trouble code(s) are set to FALSE, then the scale factor 54 is determined as discussed above.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In another example, the scale factor determination module 50 may evaluate the status of other algorithms that affect the handwheel position 56.

In various embodiments, the non-corrected handwheel torque 62 can be estimated based on one or more algorithms.

The torque correction scale factor 54 is applied to the handwheel torque 62, for example, using equation 2 at 130. The handwheel torque signal 64 is generated at 150.
