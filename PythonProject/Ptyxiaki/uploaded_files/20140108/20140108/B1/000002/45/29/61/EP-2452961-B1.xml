More particularly, the invention relates to a pressure-sensitive adhesive composition for forming a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer that can maintain high initial adhesive force and adhesion reliability (particularly, repelling resistance) at the time of bonding and can easily be peeled off and can separate and dismantle a joined part at the time of peeling. Further, the present invention relates to a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer formed from the pressure-sensitive adhesive composition, and to a pressure-sensitive adhesive tape or sheet having the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally, a pressure-sensitive adhesive tape or sheet ("tape or sheet" is hereinafter sometimes referred to as merely "tape" or "sheet") is utilized in various uses. Representative examples of the pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet include an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet (acrylic adhesive sheet) having a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer (adhesive layer) formed using an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition (acrylic adhesive composition).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In recent years, from growing environmental consciousness, resource saving and recycle are increasingly required in fields using the pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet. For example, an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet particularly is required to have both excellent adhesiveness and easy peelability to a metal adherend in fields of automobiles, machines, electric appliances, building materials and the like from standpoints of improvement in yield, rework in process flow, recycle, workability and the like.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet, for example, an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet having a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer formed from a bubble-containing viscoelastic composition which is a viscoelastic composition containing bubbles, hollow microspheres and a surfactant, the surfactant being a fluorine-based compound having an oxy(C<sub>2-3</sub>)alkyl group and a fluorinated hydrocarbon group in the molecule, is known as an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition having high initial adhesive force and adhesion reliability at the time of bonding (see Patent Document 1). The acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet had the problem that the sheet cannot easily be peeled off when peeling.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Furthermore, as an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet, an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet having a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer formed from a pressure-sensitive adhesive composition blending 100 parts by weight of an acrylic polymer prepared by copolymerizing an alkyl (meth)acrylate having 4 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety as the main monomer component and a carboxyl-containing radically polymerizable monomer in an amount of 0.5 to 20% by weight based on the total weight of the monomers, with 0.5 to 20 parts by weight of an epoxy crosslinking agent and 0.1 to 5 parts by weight of a polyisocyanate compound is known as an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet that can easily be peeled off at the time of peeling (see Patent Document 2). The acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet had the problem that the sheet has poor initial adhesive force and adhesion reliability at the time of bonding.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In addition, a pressure-sensitive adhesive tape which maintains high adhesion force and which can be easily separated/debonded is known. In one embodiment, the adhesive layer of said tape comprises a blowing agent and a monomer mixture or a partially polymerized product of at least one alkyl (meth)acrylate having 2 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety, at least one N-hydroxyalkyl(meth)acrylamide monomer and at least one nitrogen-containing monomer (see Patent Document 3).

The term "pressure-sensitive adhesive composition" includes the meaning of "a composition for forming a pressure-sensitive adhesive". The term "monomer mixture" means "a mixture of only monomer components". Furthermore, a pressure-sensitive adhesive composition of the present invention is sometimes referred to as "a thermal-expandable fine particle-containing pressure-sensitive adhesive composition".</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the present invention, the term "ethylenically unsaturated bond" means a radically polymerizable carbon-carbon double bond. A group having the ethylenically unsaturated bond is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include a vinyl group, a vinylidene group, an allyl group and a (meth)acryloyl) group. In the present invention, the term "monofunctional" means to have one ethylenically unsaturated bond in its molecule, and the term "polyfunctional" means to have at least two ethylenically unsaturated bonds in its molecule.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The term "glass transition temperature (Tg) when formed into a homopolymer" means "a glass transition temperature (Tg) of a homopolymer of the monomer", and means a glass transition temperature (Tg) of a polymer formed using only a certain monomer (sometime referred to as a "monomer X") as a monomer component. Specifically, numeral values of Tg of respective homopolymers are shown in<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text> Polymer Handbook (third edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1989</text></nplcit>). As for homopolymers that are not described in this literature, values obtained, for example, by the following method are taken as the respective glass transition temperatures (Tg). First, into a reactor equipped with a thermometer, a stirrer, a nitrogen introduction pipe and a reflux cooling tube, 100 parts by weight of a monomer X, 0.2 parts by weight of 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile and 200 parts by weight of ethyl acetate as a polymerization solvent are introduced, and the resulting mixture is stirred for 1 hour while introducing nitrogen gas. After thus removing oxygen in a polymerization system, the mixture is heated to 63°C and allowed to react for 10 hours. Subsequently, the reaction system is cooled to room temperature, to thereby obtain a homopolymer solution having a solid content concentration of 33% by weigh. The homopolymer solution is cast on a release liner and dried, to thereby provide a test sample (sheet-like homopolymer) having a thickness of about 2 mm. About 1 to 2 mg of the test sample is weighed on an aluminum-made open cell and Reversing Heat Flow<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> (specific heat component) behaviors of the homopolymer are obtained at a temperature-rising rate of 5°C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere of 50 ml/min using a temperature-modulated DSC (trade name: Q-2000, manufactured by TA Instruments). In accordance with JIS K-7121, the temperature of the point at which a line equidistant in a vertical axis direction from lines which extend a base line at a low temperature side of Reversing Heat Flow obtained and a base line at a high temperature side thereof intersects with a curve of a stepwise changed part of the glass transition is taken as a glass transition temperature (Tg) when formed into a homopolymer.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The monomer mixture or its partially polymerized product is an essential component in the pressure-sensitive adhesive composition.
