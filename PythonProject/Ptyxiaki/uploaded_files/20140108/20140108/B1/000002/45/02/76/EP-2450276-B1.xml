From a practical standpoint the "angle of incidence" - "thrust output" ratio is hardly ever 100%. And more specifically the ratio "pedal input" - "thrust output"' is likely even less linear as this ratio is also dependant on the entire control/actuator -chain, with all its integral parts. Any linear transmission of a control signal from a pilot may result in "forced" nonlinearities due to other parts of the actuator chain and therefore produces non-linear responses from the controlled rotor and hence inadequate reactions of the aircraft. Such unwanted nonlinear responses may be subject to analysis and a converter may be conceived to cancel out the non-linear responses of the blades to a control signal from the pilot.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP2034384A"><text>EP2034384</text></patcit> describes a pedal arrangement for operating a clutch having a variable force transmission ratio. When initially depressing a pivoting pedal, a first region is traversed. In that region, the pedal force required for moving an operating member is greater than the pedal force required for a conventional pedal arrangement. In a second region, the pedal continues to pivot about a pivot axis, and the maximum force is reduced. In a final third region, the force required increases.

Connection means are provided to link the input means to the output means. A conversion mechanism is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> provided to convert any of the translational motion of the input means in the predetermined direction along the first guide mechanism into translational motion of the output means in a direction along the second guide mechanism. The conversion mechanism is provided with an at least partly non linear profile and said connection means are provided with engagement means interacting with said at least partly non linear profile. Any movement of the engagement means along the non linear profile is transmitted to the connection means where said movement along the non linear profile is split into translational movements of the input means and translational movements of the output means with the ratios of said translational movements of the input means versus said translational movements of the output means reflecting the at least partly non linear profile of the conversion mechanism. According to an advantageous embodyment the non-linear responses from a rotor to control signals are analysed and the non linear profile of the conversion mechanism subsequently is designed to cancel out in a simple and highly reliable way the non-linear responses to said control signal from the pilot such that any input from the pilot controlling the "angle of incidence" of the blades of a rotor or a propeller results in a smooth and linear response of the thrust from the blades over their entire range of the angle of incidence. The invention allows the seamless linear and/or non-linear transmission of a translational motion of an input means into a different translational motion of an output means including a change of the direction of the output motion from back to forth and vice versa. The inventive mechanical transmission allows for quick and easy replacement of the conversion means to adapt to different ratios of non linearity.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the conversion mechanism comprises a plate with said at least partly<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> non linear profile being integrated to said plate, said plate being essentially parallel to the plane of the second guide mechanism</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention said engagement means is a pin extending from said connection means into said at least partly non linear profile of said plate.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention the at least partly non linear profile is smoothly curved with limited deviations from an overall angle of 45° of a square shaped transmission or limited deviations from a diagonal between the extreme end points of a rectangular transmission relative to either of said first guide mechanism and said second guide mechanism for high transmission rates at tolerable friction resistance from the at least partly non linear profile.
