Both these tendencies depend substantially on a combination of two critical drying factors, such as drying air temperature and surface rubbing of the laundry against other laundry items or the inner wall of the drum as it rotates.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">To reduce rubbing of the laundry, a method of controlling a rotatable-drum laundry drier has been devised whereby, substantially, the drum is controlled to reach, during the drying cycle, such a rotation speed that delicate laundry is pressed by centrifugal force against the inner wall of the drum, to which it adheres, so as to be prevented from sliding/tumbling inside the drum. A method of this sort is described, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP2014822A"><text>EP 2014822</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The above method is particularly advantageous, in that, besides reducing rubbing of the laundry inside the drum, also allows accurate laundry moisture measurement using electronic control systems comprising measuring sensors/electrodes fitted to the inner wall of the drum and directly contacting the laundry. That is, keeping the laundry clamped against the inner wall of the rotating drum ensures effective contact between the sensors/electrodes and the laundry and, hence, accurate moisture measurement, enabling the electronic control system to determine completion of the drying operation and, hence, when to stop the drying cycle.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Though effective, the above method is not altogether suitable for use in<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> rotatable-drum laundry driers in which the measuring sensors/electrodes, instead of being located inside the drum, directly contacting the laundry, are associated to a stationary part of the casing in such a way to face the loading/unlading opening in the drum.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Research by the Applicant, in fact, shows that, when the above control method is implemented in a rotatable-drum laundry drier in which the measuring sensors/electrodes are located outside the drum, i.e. in a lateral position facing the opening in the drum, clamping the laundry to the rotating drum greatly reduces the probability that the laundry contacts the sensors/electrodes in such a way to effectively detect the moisture of the laundry, which may result in an incorrect laundry moisture measurement and, in some cases, as, for example, with small laundry loads, in no moisture measurement at all.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Without an accurate moisture measurement, the electronic control system is therefore unable to accurately determine when to stop the cycle, thus resulting in either incomplete drying of the laundry, or temporary overheating and, hence, felting of delicate items.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="CH659841"><text>CH659841</text></patcit> discloses a drier in which the rotational speed of the drum is varied during the drying process. A first rotational speed is so high that, as a result of the centrifugal force, the laundry bears against the inside of the drum and no falling of the laundry occurs. At a second lower rotational speed, a falling of the laundry occurs and the laundry comes to rest in the drum differently from before. The rotational speed of the drum is changed at intervals, the interval of the first higher rotational speed being longer, for example 6 to 10 times longer than the interval of the lower rotational speed. The drying air can flow axially or radially through the drum which has a horizontal axis of rotation.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2007066863A"><text>W02007066863</text></patcit> discloses a method for controlling an automatic dryer, which can determine a dryness level based on information relating the laundry by an initial average value of a sensing means, to thereby achieve stability and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> reliability in a drying process, the method comprising sensing whether the amount of laundry is small or large by using an average output value in a preset time period of an initial drying stage; detecting a saturation voltage generating point of the sensor; and performing a drying cycle based on each dryness level by using information for the amount of laundry and the saturation voltage generating point.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="DE1924961"><text>DE1924961</text></patcit> discloses a method of drying sensitive tissues, especially wool.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US2005044639A"><text>US2005044639</text></patcit> discloses a washing machine and method of controlling a drying cycle thereof, by which a laundry can be evenly distributed within a drum rotated at a second speed for a low-speed dewatering cycle during the drying cycle to further enhance a drying effect. Once the drying cycle is initiated, a blower fan and heater are driven to circulate hot air within the washing machine via tub and circulation duct. And, the drum is rotated by applying a first rotational speed for a normal drying cycle and a second rotational speed for a low-speed dewatering cycle with a prescribed duty ratio.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="EP0937810A"><text>EP0937810</text></patcit> discloses a process for drying laundry, or the like, in washerdriers and driers, or the like, in which the laundry or the like, which has first undergone removal of a certain amount of water, for example by spinning, is subjected to the action of a stream of hot air while at the same time being agitated/moved to produce a lifting/tumbling of the laundry and greater exposure to the stream of hot air.
