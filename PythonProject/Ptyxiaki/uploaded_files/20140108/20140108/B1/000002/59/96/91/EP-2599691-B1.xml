In the structure, a center portion, in the vehicle width direction, of a base part of the cab back panel is arched toward the rear side of the vehicle body; multiple first beads projecting rearward and extending in the up-down direction are formed in first regions located respectively at the opposite end sides, in the vehicle width direction, of the base part; and multiple second beads projecting rearward and extending in the up-down direction are formed in a second region located at the center, in the vehicle width direction, of the base part.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Meanwhile, in five-door vehicles, a rear end panel forming a rear wall below an opening portion of a trunk at a rear part is coupled at its left and right ends to the rear ends of left and right rear frames, respectively. Thus, in a case where the rear frames undergo deflection as a result of driving on a rough road surface or making a quick turn, the rear end panel receives bending loads from the rear frames.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The rear end panel includes multiple longitudinal edge lines for increasing the surface stiffness thereof. However, when the rear end panel receives the bending loads from the rear frames, the lower end of each longitudinal edge line may act as a point where bending starts, deteriorating the stiffness. Thus, in conventional practices, patches are laid on the lower ends of the longitudinal edge lines to reinforce them. However, since reinforcing with the patches increases the number of components and the man-hours for assembly, it is desirable to increase the stiffness of the rear end panel without using the patches.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Another example of the prior art is shown in Japanese Patent <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2007296879B"><text>JP 2007 296 879</text></patcit>.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing circumstances, and an object thereof is to increase the stiffness of a rear end panel having multiple longitudinal edge lines without using patches.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In order to achieve the above object, according to a first feature of the present invention, there is provided a vehicle body rear part structure in which left and right rear frames are disposed to extend in a front-rear direction along lateral sides of a vehicle body, respectively, and rear ends of the left and right rear frames are connected by a rear end panel standing substantially in a vertical direction and extending in a left-right direction of the vehicle body, <b>characterized in that</b> the rear end panel is bent in the front-rear direction by being bent at at least two longitudinal edge lines extending in an up-down direction, and includes an inclined surface defined between two lateral edge lines extending in the left-right direction one of said two lateral lines connecting lower portions of the two longitudinal edge lines; and the inclined surface comprising a first position which is inclined from the vertical direction in the front-rear direction.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the above configuration, the rear ends of the left and right rear frames disposed to extend in the front-rear direction along the lateral sides of the vehicle body are connected by the rear end panel standing substantially in the vertical direction and extending in the left-right direction of the vehicle body. The rear end panel is bent in the front-rear direction by being bent at at least the two longitudinal edge lines extending in the up-down direction, so that the surface stiffness of the rear end panel is increased. The rear end panel includes the inclined surface defined between the two lateral edge lines extending in the left-right direction in such a manner as to connect the lower portions of the two longitudinal edge lines, and the inclined surface is inclined from the vertical direction in the front-rear direction. Thus, when bending loads are applied to the rear end panel in response to deflection of the left and right rear frames, the inclined surface can prevent deterioration in the stiffness of the rear end panel attributable to the lower portions of the longitudinal edge lines acting as points where bending starts. This makes it possible to improve the stiffness of the rear end panel without using reinforcement members such as patches.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to a second feature of the present invention, in addition to the first feature, there is provided the vehicle body rear part structure, wherein a rear end panel stiffener is joined along an upper edge of the rear end panel.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to the above configuration, the rear end panel stiffener is joined along the upper edge of the rear end panel.

However, in the vicinity of the connecting portion 35 at the upper end, the outer wall 20b is cut in such a manner that as to become narrower toward the upper side; therefore, at the position of the connecting portion 35, the gutter stiffener 20 is formed in an L-shape in cross section by the front wall 20a and the upper inner wall 20c (see <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11A</figref>).

In this state, the front wall 38a of the rear pillar inner 38 projects outward in the left-right direction from the front wall 20a of the gutter stiffener 20 to form a flange 38c.

Since the rear end panel 17 is bent in the front-rear direction at the multiple longitudinal edge lines 17b, 17c, 17d, and 17e for the purpose of increasing the surface stiffness thereof, there is a possibility that when the bending loads are applied, the lower ends of the longitudinal edge lines 17b, 17c, 17d, and 17e may act as points where bending starts, deteriorating the stiffness. However, in the embodiment, the rear end panel 17 includes the inclined surface 17h formed between the two<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> lateral edge lines 17f and 17g extending in the left-right direction in such a manner as to connect lower portions of the two longitudinal edge lines 17b and 17c. Moreover, the inclined surface 17h is inclined from the vertical direction in the front-rear direction. Thus, the inclined surface 17h can prevent the stiffness deterioration attributable to the lower portions of the longitudinal edge lines 17b and 17c acting as points where bending starts. This makes it possible to improve the stiffness of the rear end panel 17 without using reinforcement members such as patches.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Moreover, of the upper and lower lateral edge lines 17f and 17g defining the inclined surface 17h, the upper lateral edge line 17f is located rearward of the lower lateral edge line 17g. Also, the inclined surface 17h is formed in an L-shape with a portion thereof on the outer side of the vehicle body extending upward. Thus, a center portion of the rear end panel 17 bulges rearward farther than a lower portion and left and right end portions thereof.

Further, the recessed portion 17i extending upward from the upper lateral edge line 17f is formed in the rear surface of the rear end panel 17, and the rear bumper 16 is fixed at its lower end to the attachment bracket 26 fixed to this recessed portion 17i.

The first bulk head 33 constraining the closed cross section of the under-opening frame 30 is joined to the lower inner wall 20d at the portion thereof facing the connecting portion 32. Accordingly, as shown in arrow lines in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, a load from the rear frame 22 can be transmitted to the under-opening frame 30 through the lower inner wall 20d of the gutter stiffener 20 without increasing the size of the first<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> bulk head 33.

Accordingly, the first bulk head 33 is joined tightly to the lower rear pillar 21, making it possible to increase the stiffness improving effect further. In the above state, the lower flange 33d obtained by bending the lower end of the first bulk head 33 toward the inner side of the vehicle body is joined to the upper flange 20e obtained by bending the upper end of the lower inner wall 20d of the gutter stiffener 20 toward the inner side of the vehicle body (see <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>).

Accordingly, the longitudinal edge line 17b of the rear end panel 17 can be utilized as a load transmission passage to the first bulk head 33. Further, the bulging portion 17j (see <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>) bulging rearward in conformity with the shape of a rear portion of the first bulk head 33 is formed at the upper edge of the rear end panel 17.

In addition, the outer wall 20b of the gutter stiffener 20 is cut obliquely such that the width thereof becomes smaller toward the upper side.

Thus, when bending loads are applied to the rear end panel (17) in response to deflection of left and right rear frames (22), the inclined surfaces (17) can prevent deterioration in the stiffness of the rear end panel (17) attributable to the lower portions of the longitudinal edge lines (17b, 17c) acting as points where bending starts. This makes it possible to improve the stiffness of the rear end panel (17) without using reinforcement members such as patches.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56984171" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Fahrzeugkarosserieheckteilstruktur, worin<br/>
