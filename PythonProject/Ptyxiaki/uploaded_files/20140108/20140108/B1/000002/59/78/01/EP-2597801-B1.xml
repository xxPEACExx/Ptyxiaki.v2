load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to an optical network unit structure for a passive optical access network having a meshed structure consisting of at least two central nodes and a plurality of optical network units and to a passive optical access network structure using respective optical network units.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Optical access networks are usually realized as passive optical networks (PONs). In a PON, a plurality of optical network units (ONUs) is connected to a central node, often referred to as optical line terminal (OLT), often via one or more remote nodes (RN), which comprise passive optical components, only. Usually, each remote node is coupled to an RN via a single optical fiber that is used for bidirectional optical communication between the respective ONU and the OLT. For this structure of an optical access network, it is known to use an optical wavelength division multiplex (WDM) signal in the transmission path between the OLT and the respective RN or all RNs. If the RNs are connected via an optical bus or ring structure, each RN may be realized as passive optical add/drop multiplexer adapted to extract from and add to the optical WDM signal the respective optical channel signals. In the simplest case, each optical channel signal included in the optical WDM signal may be used for establishing a bidirectional communication between an ONU and the OLT.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Of course, if the optical channel signal at a port of the RN is a time division multiplex (TDM) signal, the TDM signal may be supplied to a plurality of ONUs which are connected to the respective RN via a star structure. This structure or substructure may be realized by using a passive optical splitter or star coupler equally dividing the optical TDM (channel) signal and feeding each of the divided signals to an ONU. In this case, an asymmetrical TDM scheme must be applied as only one ONU may transmit at the same time. As each transmitter unit in an ONU must be silent at times outside of a dedicated time slot (within the asymmetrical TDM signal), it is necessary to turn the laser (or other optical transmitting element) on and off very quickly. This requires expensive active optical components (especially lasers) with extremely low transient<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> times. In such a star structure, the simplest way of providing protection against a single point of failure, e.g. a fiber break between an ONU and the RN, is to connect the ONU to the RN via an additional fiber. However, this duplication of the transmission medium as well as the necessary parts of the RN and ONU causes a disadvantageous redundancy of resources.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1746857A1"><text>EP 1 746 857 A1</text></patcit> discloses a linear bus structure for a PON comprising two OLTs, each OLT connected to the end of a linear bus or chain-like structure of ONUs. The OLTs may be present at the same location so that, in this case, the linear structure becomes an open-ring structure. In both cases, it is proposed to use specific optical coupling/decoupling means having three ports, two of which are used to connect the optical fibers between two neighboring ONUs or between an ONU and a neighboring OLT and the third for connecting the respective ONU. Here, the plurality of three-port coupling means may be considered a distributed RN. In such linear or chain-like PON structures, a symmetric TDM scheme may be used, i.e., the ONU and the OLT may use a dedicated time slot of the TDM scheme to transmit their data.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In practice, customer locations, at which ONUs are necessary, are often connected to the location of an OLT and/or to one or more other customer ONU locations simultaneously using a single optical fiber connecting the respective two locations. It would thus be advantageous to use these existing partially or fully meshed structures to build up a PON or PON structures.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20060228115A1"><text>US 2006/0228115 A1</text></patcit> discloses an add/drop multiplexer for OTN/DWDM rings utilising a pair of muxponders forming a transparent add/drop multiplexer. In one muxponder, transmit signals are sent in a first direction and receive signals are received from a second direction. In the other muxponder, transmit signals are sent in the second direction and receive signals are received from the first direction. The signals transmitted and received are TDM signals according to a predetermined TDM transmission scheme (e.g. as defined for SONET/SDH networks). However, this type of add/drop multiplexer, which has been developed for an optical transport network having a ring structure, is not suitable for use in PON networks also including star structures.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide an optical network unit structure that makes it possible to build up a passive optical access network having a meshed structure consisting of at least two central nodes and plurality of optical network units. It is a further object to provide a passive optical access network structure using respective optical network units.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The invention achieves these objects by the combination of features according to claims 1 and 8, respectively.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The invention is based on the fact that a partially or fully meshed structure of optical fibers between a plurality of customer locations and at least two OLT locations may be<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> used to build up a passive optical access network using an optical network unit structure for realizing an ONU that is able to communicate with a neighboring OLT or ONU using either a symmetrical or an asymmetrical TDM scheme applied signals received at or transmitted from a western or eastern network port. The different TDM schemes may be converted one into the other by the optical network unit. In order to assure this, the optical network unit structure according to the invention comprises two transceiver units (each including a transmitter unit and a receiver unit), one being connected to the western network port and the other one being connected to the eastern network port. The ONU is capable of establishing a communication between either of the network ports and a further ONU or an OLT. The ONU is further capable of passing through the data received at one network port to the respective other network port. As for this purpose, the optical TDM signal received at the respective network port (by the receiver unit of the respective transceiver unit) is processed by the control unit of the ONU in order to extract the data to be passed through and integrated into the optical TDM signal that is output at the respective other network port (by the transmitter unit of the respective other transceiver unit), it is also possible to use different TDM schemes for the TDM signal received and the TDM signal transmitted.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is thus possible to build up a passive optical access network structure using such optical network units which reveal sections having a straight star structure and sections having a straight linear or chain-like structure. The borders between the sections are realized by an ONU of this structure that belongs to both sections (or, expressed in other words, one half of the ONU structure including the respective transceiver unit belongs to one section and the other half including the other transceiver unit belongs to the other section, the connection between the two sections being effected by the control unit of the ONU structure).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The ONU may establish a bidirectional transmission between the at least one local port and a further network unit (which may be an OLT or a remote ONU) using a TDM signal of a suitable scheme either via the western or the eastern network port. If the transmission path that has been chosen as working path is interrupted, the control unit may establish a communication to the same network unit via the other network port using a suitable protection path.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The optical network unit structure according to the invention is a rather simple structure that can be realized at rather low costs and that may be used in network topologies having a straight star or linear structure as well as in meshed structures consisting of star and linear substructures.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The control unit may be manually switched with respect to the TDM scheme to be applied for communicating via the eastern and western network ports. Of course, the information which TDM scheme is to be applied for the communication via the western and/or via the eastern network port may also be determined in an initialization process for the ONU or transmitted to the ONU from a higher order network unit.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to an embodiment of the invention, the control unit uses network topology information to decide which TDM scheme is to be applied for the communication via the western and/or via the eastern network port.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The control unit may include a storage area adapted to store the network topology information, the network topology information at least including information whether at least one of the western and the eastern network ports is directly connected to a port of a passive optical star coupling means or to a network port of a further optical network unit.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The control unit may then apply a symmetrical TDM scheme for processing the signals received from and transmitted via the respective eastern or western network port, if the respective network port is directly connected to a port of a passive optical star coupling means, and apply an asymmetrical TDM scheme for processing the signals received from and transmitted via the respective eastern or western network port, if the respective network port is directly connected to a network port of a further optical network unit.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to a preferred embodiment, the eastern and/or western network port is adapted to connect with a single optical fiber that is used for the bidirectional communication.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In this case, in a first alternative, the optical receive signal and the optical transmit signal use the same optical carrier wavelength. In order to separate the paths for the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> receive signal and the transmit signal, the network port may be connected to a first port of an optical circulator. An output port of the respective transmitter unit may be connected to a second port of the optical circulator, and an input port of the respective receiver unit may be connected to a third port of the optical circulator. In this way, the optical circulator makes it possible to separate the common input/output path defined by the single optical fiber into an input path between the third port of the optical circulator and the input port of the respective receiver unit and an output path between the output port of the respective transmitter unit and the second port of the optical circulator.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In a second alternative, the optical receive signal and the optical transmit signal use different optical carrier wavelengths. The network port may, in this case, be connected to a diplex port of an optical diplexer. An output port of the respective transmitter unit may be connected to a first channel port of the optical diplexer and an input port of the respective receiver unit may be connected to a second channel port of the optical diplexer. In this way, the optical diplexer makes it possible to separate the common input/output path defined by the single optical fiber into an input path between the second channel port of the optical diplexer and the input port of the respective receiver unit and an output path between the output port of the respective transmitter unit and the first channel port of the optical diplexer.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to a further embodiment, the control unit comprises a buffer means for buffering data extracted from a western or eastern electrical receive signal before the data can be integrated into the eastern or western electrical transmit signal transmitted via the respective other port. This may be required if data are to be passed through from one network port to the other and if simultaneously different TDM schemes are used for the communication via the two network ports. Especially, if the signal received at the respective port uses a symmetric TDM scheme and the signal transmitted at the respective other port uses an asymmetrical TDM scheme, a relative large buffer may be required.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A typical structure or substructure of a protected passive optical access network comprises at least<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> -->

If two optical line terminals are provided at the same location (these might also be integrated into one apparatus or equipment), the meshed network structure may be designed and operated<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> such that a path protection between two communicating network units (ONU and/or OLT) is provided, the working path being terminated by either the eastern or western network port of the respective ONU and the protection path being terminated by the respective other network port.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Further embodiments of the invention are apparent from the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the following, a preferred embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to the drawing.

The (original) optical transmit signals at the end points of<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> a transmission link are created by the ONU or the OLT concerned. The communication is effected by using TDM signals carried by the specific optical carrier wavelength.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Within a star domain, i.e. for establishing a communication between network units (ONUs or an OLT) directly connected to a network port of one of the star coupling means 5, 9, an asymmetrical TDM scheme (designated as TDMA scheme) is usually applied. This transmission scheme combines a data transmission scheme in the downstream path (from the OLT to a selected ONU) that uses a transmission signal including address data for addressing the selected unit (here: the selected ONU) with a data transmission scheme in the upstream path (from the selected ONU to the respective OLT) which uses dedicated times lots for "addressing" the data included within the respective time slot to the unit (OLT or ONU) the respective time slot has been associated with. Thus, it is possible to broadcast a signal from the OLT to all ONUs of the respective star domain, simply by using a broadcast address. The transmission signal in the downstream path may, for example, be a packet based signal.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The TDMA scheme that is used in the upstream path assures, that only one single upstream signal (created by an ONU) at the same time arrives at the receiving unit (here: the OLT) in order to avoid signal interference at the receiving port of the receiving unit. This means that all ONUs of the respective star domain, apart from the ONU that is transmitting in the dedicated time slot, must shut off the optical transmitter element (usually a laser).</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">As the distance between various ONUs coupled to the respective star coupling means and the star coupling means itself may be different, it is known to use so-called guard banks (specified time intervals) between the time slots which limit the bandwidth efficiency of this transmission scheme.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Usually, the star coupling means 7, 9 realizing the RNs will be realized as directional coupling means. This means that the downstream signal created by an OLT 3 ,5, which is supplied to a common port of the directional coupling means will be (in general equally) split into a given number of signals (by splitting the optical power of the incoming signal), each being output at one of the splitting ports of the star coupling means.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> Further, each signal fed to one of the splitting ports of the directional coupling means will be output at the common port, only.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Thus, each OLT 3, 5 may transmit an optical network transmit signal in the downstream path independently from the optical network transmit signals being created by one of the ONUs 11_1, 13, 15_1 connected to a splitting port of the (directional) star coupling means 7 or by one of the ONUs 11_3, 13, 15_3 connected to a splitting port of the (directional) star coupling means 9, respectively.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In a more complex alternative, the star coupling means 7, 9 may be realized as fully symmetrical star coupler with a given number N of symmetrical ports. Here, not only the network transmit signal created by an OLT 3, 5 is (preferably equally) split into N-1 signals but also any network transmit signal created by any of the ONUs 11_1, 13, 15_1 or 11_3, 13, 15_3 connected to the respective fully symmetrical star coupling means 7, 9. This, of course, requires that only one of the network units, i.e. an OLT 3, 5 or an ONU 11_1, 13, 15_1 or 11_3, 13, 15_3 attached to the symmetrical ports, creates a network transmit signal if these signals use identical optical carrier wavelengths, as otherwise the split signals, which are received as network receive signal at the respective ports of the other network units, would interfere. The advantage of this alternative is that an ONU connected to the symmetrical star coupling means could communicate not only with the respective OLT but also with one of the other ONUs of this star domain (which, in turn, could, of course also communicate with a respective further neighboring ONU of the respective neighboring domain).</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">This interference problem could be avoided if the OLTs 3, 5 use a carrier wavelength for the transmit signals transmitted in the downstream direction (i.e., the direction from the respective OLT 3, 5 to the respective star coupling means 7, 9) different from the carrier wavelength used by the ONUs attached to the other symmetrical ports of the symmetrical star coupling means. This enables the ONUs to block network receive signals having the same carrier wavelength as used by the ONUs for creating the upstream network transmit signal and to receive only network receive signals having the carrier wavelength as used by the OLT.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The communication within the linear domains is based on a usual symmetric TDM data transmission scheme. This means that the ONUs within a linear domain transmit optical TDM signals in the upstream direction. The data created (not only forwarded) by a specific ONU are included within a time slot dedicated to the respective ONU. In order to make the transmission along the chain within a linear domain possible, each ONU receiving a signal at one of the network ports 17, 19 that is addressed to the OLT (or, as the case may be, to another ONU) which is located at a position "beyond" the respective ONU, converts the optical signal received into an electrical receive signal, if necessary (or at any rate), effects a signal processing (especially a signal recovery) of the electrical receive signal, and re-converts it into an optical transmit signal that is transmitted to the next ONU (in the same direction). Of course, this is necessary within non-dedicated time slots, only. Within the time slot dedicated to the respective ONU the ONU may include data provided at at least one local port 23 (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>) into the network transmit signal that is output at a selected network port, i.e. either the eastern or the western port.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Alternatively, it is also possible to output the signal created at a selected ONU at both network ports so that the signal is transmitted in both directions. This may serve to transmit an identical signal over a protection path (see explanations below).</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">As the ONUs within a linear domain are coupled in a chain-like manner and a signal recovery may be effected at each ONU, practically no restrictions as to the length of the chain exist.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> shows a first embodiment of an optical network unit (ONU) structure 100 suitable to realize an ONU 11, 13, 15.

In order to create a TDM signal by integrating data or information received at the local port 23, the data may be wrapped in suitable packets or VC that may directly be integrated within the respective TDM signal applying a TDMS or a TDMA scheme.

If, for example, a communication between the ONU 15_2 and the OLT 3 is to be established, the SCNP scheme may be designed such that the shorter path via the western network port 17 is defined as working path. In case of a failure within the working path, the SCNP switches to the eastern network port 19 and establishes a communication with the OLT 5. If the OLT 5 is not present at the same location as the OLT 3, a further communication path between the OLT 5 and the OLT 3 must be established<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> in order to provide the desired path protection. This may be effected by means of further network domains between the OLT 5 and the OLT 2 (not shown in the Figures).</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Alternatively, the SNCP may be designed such that identical signals created at the respective ONU (e.g., ONU 15_2) are forwarded to both the eastern and western network port 17, 19 simultaneously, which are forwarded via the working path and the protection path, respectively, to the desired end point (e.g. the OLT 3). The network unit defining the end point (e.g. the OLT 3) may then decide whether the signal transported via the working path or the signal transported via the protection path is chosen as receive signal.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In order to decide which path shall be used as protection path, the control unit 110 may store topology information which characterizes the network or subnetwork in which the respective ONU is located.

The structure 200 is largely identical with the structure according to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> but deviates from the structure shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> in that instead of optical circulators optical diplexers 212 are used in order to separate the optical paths for the optical network transmit signals S<sub>RX,west</sub>, S<sub>RX,east</sub> and the optical network receive signals S<sub>RX,west</sub>, S<sub>RX,east</sub>. Thus, the structure 200 is suitable for building up a network or subnetwork in which different optical carrier wavelengths are used for the upstream and downstream direction, whereas the structure shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is suitable for networks or subnetworks using the same wavelengh for the upstream and downstream paths. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, a wavelength of 1490 nm is used in the path from west to east and a wavelength of 1310 nm is used in the path from east to west.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">As apparent from the above explanations, the optical network unit structure according to the invention reveals a high degree of flexibility as corresponding ONUs may not only be used in networks or subnetworks that use a TDMS or TDMA scheme but also as network unit at the borders of two neighboring networks or subnetworks that use<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> different TDM schemes, irrespective of whether a TDMS or TDMA scheme is used in the neighboring networks.
