The invention is applicable to the field of civil engineering, both in public works and in housing.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Technical Problem to Be Solved and Background of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The construction of mechanically stabilized earth walls is widely known in the state of the art of the technical field, and its development has been remarkable over the last decades.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">These walls are comprised of three elements: flat pieces -i.e. panels-that make up the covering element of the contained earth mass, strips that remain embedded into the embankment, and an element that secures the connection of the strips to the panels.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The elements traditionally used in the construction of mechanically stabilized walls are made up of concrete and metal materials. Concrete is used in the construction of panels, and the strips are made of metal.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The use of metal in the manufacturing of strips poses a major problem, since such strips, once inserted in the embankment, are subject to significant corrosion processes, especially if exposed to chemically aggressive environments. This fact requires a fundamental reorientation of the specific design of the strips; it means moving radically away from the thickness required by the usual calculations, and manufacturing those strips considerably thicker, so as to prevent the loss of section due to local corrosion; thus, considering the significant loss of section suffered by steel during the lifetime of the structure, by manufacturing them thicker the resistant section of the aforementioned strips endures the lifetime of the structure; -the amount of steel that can be lost by the section due to corrosion, while still maintaining a safe structure at the end of the design life, is referred to as 'sacrificial thickness'-.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The use of concrete panels poses the problem of the increase in weight: lifting this heavy weight requires the use of specific machinery, capable of moving heavy weights, since the panels must be moved in order to be able to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> place them in their final position inside the mechanically stabilized wall, these movements cannot be performed without the use of such machinery.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">For the construction of mechanically stabilized walls it is necessary to use the aforementioned specific machinery, e.g. a truck crane, in order to place the panels in their final location, as well as the work force of three operators, who should bring extensive experience in the implementation of this type of walls. In this way we can achieve a high level of execution and the proper technical performance of all related procedures, which make the option of building this type of wall far more advantageous than the construction of other types of walls.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A good contribution to the state of the art in this field is document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="ES1048529U"><text>ES 1048529 U</text></patcit>, which suggests an earth retaining wall consisting of a stackable element provided with a connecting pin, i.e. a metallic tube connecting all the stackable elements, introduced by the same stackable elements and with the connecting pin being in turn fastened to various anchoring wires in order to hold the wall to the earth it retains. Another technical contribution to the state of the art in this technical field is document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2008050876A"><text>JP 2008050876 A</text></patcit>, which proposes a piece of concrete with anchoring elements to the earth it retains, being these attached to each piece of concrete, whose anchoring wires are made of synthetic resin fiber.

Furthermore, these features reduce the weight of the said elements, thus facilitating their proper placement in the building site.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Description of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention refers to the elements that conform a mechanically stabilized wall.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The wall object of the invention is of a mechanically stabilized type, comprising such wall at least two face panels for an earth mass to be contained, at least one strip embedded into the earth mass to be contained, at least one connector that allows for the longitudinal joint between panels, and at least one connecting profile, allowing fastening the strip to the panel.

The contour of the connectors (3) and the connecting profiles (27) has two possible shapes: in a first one the connector (3) and the connecting profile (27) is the same piece, thus engaging the strip (6) in the connecting profile, (27) and, in a second one, the connecting profile (27) is a separate piece from the connector (3), which is fastened to the said connector (3) by means of an adhesive (21).</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The strips (6) are elements used for reinforcement (1) and through the friction generated between them and the soil mass, by means of some surface corrugations included in the strips (6), they increase the stability of the wall (1). The resulting effect is analogous to that of increasing soil cohesion: the thrust exerted by the earth mass is counterbalanced by the frictional forces over the surface of the strip (6).</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The constituent elements of this invention, i.e. the panels (2), connectors (3), connecting profile (27) and strips (6), are made of composite materials made from thermoplastic or thermostable polymers, reinforced with fibers, in the form of yarns and fabrics made of materials such as: glass, carbon, polyparaphenylene terephthalamide, basalt, or others with similar characteristics.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In one embodiment of the invention, the strips (6) have dimensions of 10 cm in width, a thickness of 5.5 mm and variable length.

So that when the wall (1) is completed, the connecting profiles (27) become embedded within the embankment (9) supported by the wall (1). At different heights of the connecting profile (27), the strips are mounted (6); these strips are embedded in the embankment (9), when the wall (1) reaches its final height. There are several possibilities to organize the panels (2) in this way, since they incorporate a greater or lesser number of connecting profiles (27), arranged along the full length of the panel (2).</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The shape of the connecting profiles (27) in this embodiment, whose section is shown in detail 1 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, is a "T"-shape.

A sectional view of the panel (2) of this embodiment is reflected in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 8</figref>.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The fact that the panels (2) have at least one through hole (12) therein, contributes to them being so lightweight, and allows for the manual placement of the panels (2) that make up the wall (1) during the construction of the wall (1), thus being it indispensable the participation of workers capable of handling the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> panels (2), and not requiring the use of machinery for the placement of said panels (2).</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The construction of the wall (1), in any of the embodiments set forth above, follows the following steps:
<ol><li>A) Firstly, it is necessary to prepare the ground wherein the wall (1) is going to be built. This will require performing the necessary excavations. Additionally, the necessary area to fit the leveling screed (19) must be prepared.<br/>
The leveling screed (19), where the wall (1) is placed, serves as a supporting substrate and fixing surface for the installation of the first row of panels (2), its smooth and leveled surface serves to ensure that the panels (2) of the wall (1) are perfectly aligned and horizontal.</li><li>B) Once the leveling screed (19) is finished, and the layout of the wall (1) has been marked, it is made the assembly of the first row of panels (2). The assembly of the first row of panels (2) is done by placing panels (2) of two different heights, one after the other (of 120 cm and 60 cm).<br/>
Once the entire first row is finished, the vertical and horizontal levels of the panels (2) are checked, leaving an inclination inward of 1 cm at the panels (2) of 120 cm, and 0.5 cm in the panels (2) of 60 cm, and then the whole row is underpinning. Similarly is done with the connectors (3), if the wall (1) is executed according to this embodiment.<br/>
In the event that the level of the panels (2) and/or connectors (3) is not the correct one, the following corrective measures may be taken:
<ul><li>Horizontality corrections to the panels (2) are made through the use of wooden wedges.</li><li>Additionally, a few rounds (i.e. steel bars of small diameter) can be installed, which allow to ensure that the panels (2) and connectors (3) remain in place;</li><li>Small displacements have to be provided to the panels (2) once positioned on the leveling screed (19) or over another panels (2); this is performed without damaging the panels (2) themselves.</li></ul></li><li>C) Once the first row of panels (2) for the wall (1) has been completely installed, the next step in the construction of the wall is spread and compact the filling (20) in layers of 30 cm thickness each.<br/>
Once the layers have been extended, the compaction of these layers is<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the next step, following the existing construction procedures. The finishing of each layer is the correct one when the strips (6), if any, are leaning properly and fully over the filling (20). In the areas closest to the face of the wall (1) it is necessary to use smaller compaction rollers than in the compaction of the remainder of the embankment (9) and in the 50 cm closest to the face of the wall (1) it is necessary to use vibrating trays. This is done in order to avoid any possible damages in the face of the<br/>
wall (1) due to the effect of vibration. The strips (6) are placed perpendicular to the face of the wall (1) in the connectors (3).</li><li>D) After the first layer of filling (20) material has been compacted, the first row of strips (6) is laid. As the height of the embankment increases further (9), the panels (2) are laid in order to construct and support the wall (1); at the same time, in the extrados, we continue spreading and compacting soil and placing the strips (6) every 60 cm in a vertical direction. The procedure is continued until the wall (1) is finished.<br/>
In the building of the wall (1) the panels (2) are assembled on each other. Panels (2) of 120 cm are mounted on top of each other, which allows to raise the wall (1) without the need for a particular device, since the geometrical configuration of the panels (2) allows for the compact stacking thereof. The last row of panels (2) installed -the top of the embankment (9)- shall consist of panels (2) of 2 different heights so that at the top of the wall (1) a uniform horizontal alignment (2) is obtained.</li></ol></p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The present invention should not be limited to the embodiment described herein.
