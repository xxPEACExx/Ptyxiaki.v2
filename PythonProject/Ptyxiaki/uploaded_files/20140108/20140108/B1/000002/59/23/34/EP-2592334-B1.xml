The longitudinal direction of the parking spaces is mostly orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the driving lane. The driving lanes have a typical width of about 6m and each parking space has a typical geometry of about 2,5m x 5m. The lanes and the parking spaces need to be lighted, in Europe the lighting must comply with DIN EN 12464-1. For lighting garages mostly ceiling mounted neon tube lamps are in use. These tube lamps are mostly positioned above the border between the driving lane and the parking spaces and tubes are oriented parallel to the longitudinal direction of the driving lane. These tube lamps provide a radial symmetric or elliptic light intensity distribution, thereby lighting the lane brighter as necessary and the farther edges of the parking spaces with a relatively low intensity. Such light distribution is disadvantageous, because the high intensity on the driving lane tends to glare drivers on the driving lane and the relative dark parking spaces make people feel unsafe.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2011042837A"><text>WO 2011/042837</text></patcit> discloses a LED light for lighting a street.

The light should be positioned at the same place as the neon tube lamps, i.e. above the line separating the driving lane and the parking spaces.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A solution of the problem is described by the independent claim. The dependent claims relate to further improvements of the invention.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The light for a car parking comprises at least a support for at least one light source with an optical axis. The light source is preferably a LED. Light from the light source is collected by a light entrance surface of the lens and leaves the lens via an opposed light exit surface. The light entrance surface has at least a concave section forming a dome with a center. The light source is positioned such that its optical axis does not intersect with the center of the dome, thereby a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> part of the light emitted by the LED on the side on which the center of the dome is, enters a section of the light entrance surface located between the optical axis and the dome center. When entering this section of the light entrance surface the light is refracted towards the optical axis, such that at least part of the refracted light crosses the optical axis. Thus, light that would usually leave the lens on a first side of the LED's optical axis can be emitted on an opposite side, without any additional reflection. For example light that was emitted by the light source in a direction towards the driving lane is refracted in a direction towards the parking spaces. The lens or the light, respectively thus permits to "draw" light intensity form the driving lane and direct it to the parking space(s).</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The light exit surface preferably comprises at least a first convex section forming a first lobe with a center at the fist side of the optical axis and a second convex section forming second lobe at a second side of the optical axis. The second lobe has a falling section between its center and the second lobe. The falling section is preferably at least partly at the first side of the optical axis, thereby refracting light exiting the lens via the falling section at the first side of the optical axis to cross the optical axis. Thus part of the light, which propagates in the lens on the first side of the light source's optical axis and having a direction facing away from the optical axis leaves the lens with propagation direction towards the optical axis and faces away from the optical axis at the second side of the optical axis, after passing the optical axis. This permits to direct even more light across the optical axis of the light source.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The entrance surface is at least at the second side of the optical axis Fresnel like stepped. This permits to gain space for the light source and at the same time to keep the lens thin, resulting in reduced production costs and low absorption.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The lens may have a planar mounting surface between the light entry surface and the light exit surface. The mounting surface is preferably parallel to the support and preferably orthogonal to the optical axis of the light source.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the following the invention will be described by way of example, without limitation of the general inventive concept, on examples of embodiment with reference to the drawings.

The light exit surface 20 has a first lobe 21 and a second lobe 22 for refracting light asymmetrically when leaving the lens through the light exit surface. The plane V is parallel to the longitudinal direction of the lens, i.e. as indicated in <figref idrefs="f0005">figure 7</figref> is the plane V parallel to a driving lane 62. Included in a ceiling mounted lamp 1 (cf. <figref idrefs="f0005">fig. 7</figref>) the exit surface faces the floor. The light entrance surface 40 faces a light source, e.g. a LED. The light entrance surface is depicted in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref> and surrounded by a planar mounting surface 12. The light entrance surface is concave and forms a dome 41. The light entrance surface 40 is in its longitudinal direction Fresnel like stepped, i.e. has Fresnel steps 48. This permits to reduce the thickness of the lens and enlarge the space "below" the dome (cf. <figref idrefs="f0004">figures 5 and 6</figref>).<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the cross section as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>, the lens is mounted on a support 11. The concave light entrance surface 40 forms a dome 41. The dome 41 has a center 46, which would correspond to its highest point if one would "unfold" the Fresnel stepping 48 of the dome to its optically equivalent smooth surface. A dome axis 46 intersects the dome's center 46.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Below (with respect to the orientation in <figref idrefs="f0003">figures 3 and 4</figref>) the dome 41 is a light source 14, with lambertian intensity distribution, for example a LED 14. The light source 14 has an optical axis 15, which coincides with the direction of the maximum of the light source's 14 intensity distribution. The light source is positioned relative to the dome 41, such that the optical axis 15 is parallel displaced relative dome axis 45.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The light exit surface 20 has a first lobe 21 and second lobe 22. The first lobe 21 has a first lobe center 23 and the second lobe 22 a second lobe center 24. Between the second lobe center 24 and the first lobe center 21 is falling section 26 of the second lobe 22. A part of the falling section 26 is between the optical axis 15 and the dome axis 45.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The above explained lens and light source geometry yields the optical paths as symbolized by sets of rays 105, 111,112, 115 in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 4</figref>. The rays 105, 111, 112, 115 start from the light source in accordance with Lambert's law. The rays 111,112 and 105 are emitted on a first side 15.1 of the optical axis 15 (with respect to <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 4</figref> the right side). A first set of rays 105 crosses the dome axis 46 and subsequently enters the entrance surface 40. The lens 10 refracts the first set of rays 105 in a first direction 130 pointing away from the optical axis first side 15.1. The first set of rays 105 may preferably be directed towards a driving lane 141 (cf. <figref idrefs="f0005">figure 7</figref>).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The rays 111 and 112 are as well emitted on the first side 15.1 of the optical axis 15 but they enter a section 42 of the light entrance surface 40 which is located<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> between the dome axis 45 and the optical axis 15. This section 42 descends from the dome center 46 towards the optical axis 15 and the rays 111, 112 are thus refracted towards the optical axis 15 when entering the lens 10 via section 42. Ray 111 is refracted in a direction which intersects with the optical axis 15. Rays 111, 112 exit the lens 10 via the falling section 26 of the second lobe 22 and are thus further refracted towards direction 120. When passing the falling section 26 ray 112 is as well directed to cross the optical axis 15. Thus the depicted lens 10 and light source 14 arrangement permits to direct light that was emitted on a first side 15.1 of the optical axis 15 in a direction facing away from the opposite side, i.e. second side 15.2 of the optical axis 15 without reflecting elements.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A fourth set of rays 115 is emitted on the second side 15.2 of the optical axis and leaves the lens 10 in direction facing away from the second side 15.2 pointing at least essentially in the direction 120, e.g. towards a parking surface 142.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the plane V, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">figures 5 and 6</figref> is the lens symmetric to the optical axis 15 and the dome axis 46.
