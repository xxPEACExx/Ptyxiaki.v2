mxw-id="PDES63960494" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present patent application relates to a mounting system of photovoltaic panels such to obtain a watertight covering on roofs of buildings, of integrated self-bearing type.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In the majority of cases, the photovoltaic market offers modules of standard photovoltaic panels, already provided with an aluminum frame that is adapted to increase sturdiness, but is insufficient to withstand the loads provided by the current regulations. Some manufacturers offer laminated modules without the aluminum frame, in such manner to create perimeter structures according to the project requirements.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Most current systems provide for fixing the photovoltaic components on an independent covering system. Some examples of known fixing systems of photovoltaic panels are:
<ul><li>Tile fixing system. Such a system makes use of brackets fixed to a cement slab underneath the tiles. The bracket is shaped as a "C" to generate an anchoring seat for application of a track where photovoltaic panels are fixed by means of fixing means shaped as gull wings.</li><li>Fixing system in replacement of tiles. Such a system provides for fixing tracks directly on the cement slab waterproofed with sheath or corrugated plate.</li><li>Fixing system on industrial covering. Such a system provides for fixing tracks that support the photovoltaic panels directly on the corrugated plate of the covering.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The aforementioned systems of photovoltaic panels are characterized by simple installation, but are they impaired by the fact that they do not provide waterproofing for the roof. Consequently, said panels must be installed on perfectly waterproofed roofs, thus resulting in expensive waterproofing and, sometimes, excessively heavy roof. Moreover, given the fact that they change the profile of the building, said structures have a negative aesthetic impact on the building.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It must be noted that sections used to support photovoltaic panels that are currently available on the market have a rectangular tubular section, i.e. they have a panel support surface and continuous lateral shoulders with 50-60 mm width. Therefore, micro-infiltrations or water leaks percolate along the sides, with consequent dripping.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP2295893A"><text>EP 2 295 893</text></patcit> discloses a modular system for fixing solar panels to a roof, including means for channeling water. The system comprises profiles supported on edges of water outlets and abutted against support tabs of solar panels of another set of profiles. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP2295893A"><text>EP 2 295 893</text></patcit> discloses an integrated structural system having the features of the preamble of claim 1.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The purpose of the present invention is to eliminate the drawbacks of the prior art, by devising a structural mounting system of photovoltaic panels, the surface of which, in addition to generate energy, is provided with the typical characteristics of a roofing, meaning waterproofing, statics and insulation.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Another purpose of the present invention is to provide a mounting system of photovoltaic panels that is versatile, practical, inexpensive and easy to make and install (system for façades or roofing's).</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">These purposes are achieved according to the invention, with characteristics claimed in the independent claim 1. Advantageous embodiments of the invention appear from the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention originates from the idea of using the natural watertight capacity of photovoltaic surfaces (the exposed surface is made of tempered glass) to avoid laying another surface that acts as waterproof covering, in strict accordance with the rules for architectural integration.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The preliminary evaluations have ruled out the use of standard photovoltaic panels with false closing system of spaces between modules for the following reasons:
<ul><li>in standard modules, the fixing of the laminated panel to the aluminum frame does not guarantee waterproofing over time, given the fact that, in the junction with aluminum, due to the stress caused by thermal expansion, and in spite of silicone sealing, conditions for infiltration are created;</li><li>waterproofing of space between panels by means of gaskets applied on the edges and fixed with anchoring strips does not guarantee water tightness for the time period that is usually guaranteed by a standard covering (at least 30 years), given the fact that gaskets are exposed to external weather agents (sunlight, temperature range, etc.).</li></ul></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In view of the preliminary evaluations and with the object of developing a statically self-bearing system that is versatile, inexpensive, and simple, the final choice was to use:
<ol><li>1. laminated photovoltaic modules (without frame);</li><li>2. a structure to support the laminated panels, composed of two parts:
<ul><li>an upper watertight part comprising sections and gaskets, and</li><li>a lower support part, which is the bearing structure of the system and is composed of an infrastructure comprising special double-thickness sections. The upper support part is suitable for practically total water drainage. The lower infrastructure varies according to the type of covering and guarantees all possible variants for water tightness, fixing of photovoltaic part and necessary statics of most coverings. The lower infrastructure can be fixed to different types of coverings, such as for example: pitched roof with cement slab both in residential and industrial buildings; industrial shed roofs; roof with waterproof panels laid on metal or wooden structure; dome-shaped roof; roof on metal or wooden skeleton;</li></ul></li><li>3. a double gasket system comprising:
<ul><li>a first layer of gaskets situated between sections of lower infrastructure and laminated photovoltaic modules; and<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></li><li>a second layer of gaskets situated between laminated photovoltaic modules and sections of upper support part.</li></ul></li></ol></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Optionally, the mounting system of photovoltaic panels according to the invention may provide for:
<ul><li>4. use of a ridge and eaves system, directly fixed to bearing profiles, which allows for ventilation of part underneath the laminated photovoltaic module, to limit overheating of photovoltaic covering and increase waterproofing;</li><li>5. possibility of integrating the structure with a cooling system of photovoltaic modules by means of a forced ventilation system.</li></ul></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Further characteristics of the invention will appear clearer from the detailed description below, which refers to merely illustrative, not limitative, embodiments, illustrated in the attached drawings, wherein:

The photovoltaic panels (2) have a basically rectangular shape and are of laminated type, i.e. without aluminum frame along the perimeter edges.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The choice of laminated photovoltaic modules (2) is due to the following reasons:
<ul><li>it solves the problem of watertight coupling between panel and frame;</li><li>it adopts a more efficacious system for waterproofing function.</li></ul></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Another reason that has determined the choice of laminated modules is that it simplifies the realization of areas where elements that are different from photovoltaic modules must be inserted, such as skylights or service routes. As a matter of fact, in both cases, it is simply necessary to replace the photovoltaic module respectively with a glass plate or a galvanized plate with anti-slip surface, respecting the required thickness (5 mm) or with higher thickness.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The photovoltaic panels (2) are supported, in correspondence of the perimeter edges, by means of a lower support assembly (3, 3') and an upper support assembly (4, 4').<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The lower support assembly comprises a plurality of lower transversal sections (3) in parallel arrangement and a plurality of lower longitudinal sections (3') in parallel arrangement and crossing the lower transversal sections (3) in such manner to form a plurality of rectangular frames, substantially having the same dimensions as the perimeter edges of each photovoltaic panel (2). The longitudinal sections (3') can have the same cross-section as the transversal sections (3). Sections (3, 3') are preferably made of suitable metal for structural application.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Likewise, the upper support assembly comprises a plurality of transversal sections (4) in parallel arrangement and a plurality of longitudinal sections (4') in parallel arrangement and crossing the transversal sections (4) in such manner to form a plurality of rectangular frames, substantially having the same dimensions as the perimeter edges of each photovoltaic panel (2). The longitudinal sections (4') have the same cross-section as the transversal strips (4). Sections (4, 4') are preferably made of weather-resistant metal, with specific surface treatment.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The lower support assembly (3, 3') is adapted to be fixed to the roof of the building, whereas the upper support assembly (4, 4') is adapted to be fixed to the lower support assembly (3, 3'). So, a lower section (3) and an upper section (4) close in sandwich-configuration the areas near the perimeter edges of two adjacent photovoltaic panels. Therefore, panels are firmly held together, in correspondence of the perimeter edges.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A lower gasket (5) is disposed on each lower section (3, 3') and under two adjacent photovoltaic panels (2), in the area near the edge of the panels. Likewise, an upper gasket (6) is disposed above two adjacent photovoltaic panels (2), in the area near the edge of the panels and under each upper section (4). Because of the presence of the two gaskets (5, 6), the coupling area between two adjacent photovoltaic panels is perfectly insulated. The lower gasket (5) and the upper gasket (6) can be shaped as rectangular frames with dimensions similar to the perimeter of the photovoltaic panels. Although <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0002">3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">4</figref> show only one upper gasket (6) disposed under<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> each upper section (4), preferably two upper gaskets (6) can be disposed under one upper section (4).</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The lower gasket (5) can have a higher thickness than the upper gasket (6). In fact, the upper gasket (6) is responsible for first waterproofing and can be subjected to weather agents. Instead, the lower gasket (5) is protected against external agents and is shaped in such manner to create drainage channels for water that is not stopped by the barrier of the upper gasket (6). So, water is conveyed towards an eaves collection system, as described below, with reference to <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 12</figref>.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, the upper transversal sections (4') are situated in such manner to leave a gap (11) of about 5-6 millimeters in the junction with the upper longitudinal sections (4). This avoids water stagnation, especially in presence of coverings with low inclination and dirt that can impair the partial operation of the photovoltaic panels (2).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The photovoltaic panels (2) are mutually spaced in such manner to leave a gap (12) between the adjacent edges.
