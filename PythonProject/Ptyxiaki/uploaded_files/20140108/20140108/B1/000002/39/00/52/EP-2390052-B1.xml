machining process, such as for example, maintaining a perfect perpendicularity of the tool with respect to the work plane.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The deviations induced in the ram and therefore in the head of the tool due to the gravitational effect induced by the weight of the assembly as this assembly moves away from the column of the machine by a transverse movement, cause precision errors in the positioning of the tool on the part to be machined.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">These precision errors can be corrected by means of using devices managed by numerical control (CNC), but when the tool has moved away from the movable elements of the machine, any deviation occurring is multiplied by the distance, being more complicated to correct said error by means of numerical control programming.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Based on this concept, there are different systems for correcting the deviation of the ram in machine tools, such as milling machines, caused by the weight of

movement and a perfect perpendicular position of the working tool.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The system object of the invention is made up of at least one, preferably two, perforated plates which

continuous measuring control controls the drop of the ram by means of checking its transverse movement and the vertical position of its head, sending a signal to an operating assembly acting on the

the drop of the ram used in machine tools, for example in milling machines, to achieve a perfectly horizontal exit of the ram from the column of the machine and a perfectly vertical arrangement of the tool.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As observed in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the system object of the invention is made up of a vertical translation carriage (1) on which there is located at least one perforated plate (2) and preferably two plates (2) which act as a bending counter-guide, a fixed sliding block (3) and at least one movable sliding block being arranged on each of said plates (2), although there will preferably be two movable sliding blocks (4, 5) as depicted in the attached drawings. The fixed sliding block (3) and the movable sliding blocks (4, 5) are linked with a conventional guide (not depicted) for the transverse<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> movement of the ram (6) with respect to the column (7) of the application machine tool according to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The fixed sliding blocks (3) are held to the carriage (1) (see <figref idrefs="f0006">Figures 8 and 8A</figref>) by means of stops (8) which are located halfway between the side profile of the respective plate (2) and a face defined in an inner housing (16) of the carriage (1), preventing any type of movement, these sliding blocks (3) thus being a fixed point on which the entire system swings. The movable sliding blocks (4, 5) are only held to the plates (2) but not to the carriage (1), as can be observed in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figures 9</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">11</figref>, such that they can have a slight rotational movement as a result of a small allowance existing between the side profiles of the plate (2) and the faces of the inner housing (16) of the carriage (1).</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 6 and 7</figref> show how the plates (2) have notches (9) at one end of their side profiles allowing elastic deformation of said plates (2), the bending thereof being favored at said points.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The system object of the invention has a continuous measuring control based, for example, on an absolute encoder reading the actual position of the ram (6) and the head (10) during the translation movement of the assembly with respect to the column (7) of the machine.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The absolute encoder thereby sends a set point signal to an operating assembly (11) which can be made up of a gear motor, followed by a coupling, and a planetary roller screw support or similar solutions, which operating assembly (11) pushes the plates (2) attached to one another by supports (14) by means of a strongly demultiplied movement, i.e., slow but with great force, deforming the plates (2) and driving the movable sliding blocks (4, 5) (approximately 0.1 mm), causing the rise of the ram (6) and correcting the error caused by its drop.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Figure 12</figref>, the continuous measuring control can be made up of a sensor (17) for measuring linear movement,<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> specifically a linear detection device which is arranged on the carriage (1) and is associated with one of the movable sliding blocks (4, 5), it is preferably associated with the movable sliding block (5) furthest away and in a higher position with respect to the head (10) carrying the working tool.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">To prevent the effect of the drop caused by the weight itself of the ram and its head, the transverse movement of the ram is basically interpolated with the vertical movement thereof, different interpolation ramps being achieved depending on the type of head assembled in the machine tool.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Contact parts (12) for contacting with the guide (not depicted) for the transverse movement of the ram (6) through a damping material, for example turcite, minimizing friction are located between the movable sliding blocks (4, 5), a smoother movement being produced, reducing the equipment wear effect.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Likewise, flanges (13) are placed between the movable sliding blocks (4, 5) and the parts (12) for sliding adjustment, which flanges are anchored to the plates (2) by means of bushings having a smaller diameter than the holes in which they are fitted, thus allowing the rotation of the plates (2) but eliminating the deformation and lateral movement.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Sheets (15) of a damping material, preferably turcite the static friction coefficient of which is slightly less than dynamic friction coefficient, can also be placed between the plates (2) and the carriage (1), whereby achieving constant movement during the contact between the surface of the plates (2) and carriage (1), the occurrence of dynamic jerking (known as the stick-slip effect) being minimized.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">It is also possible for the turcite sheets (15) to be provided with grooves for the free circulation of a lubricant (grease or oil) between the plates (2) and the carriage (1), which provides a damping effect to the entire assembly.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Based on the foregoing, a guiding system is thus<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> obtained which allows correcting errors resulting from the drop of the ram and it can in turn work like a damping system.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56986757" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Maschinenwerkzeug, umfassend:
