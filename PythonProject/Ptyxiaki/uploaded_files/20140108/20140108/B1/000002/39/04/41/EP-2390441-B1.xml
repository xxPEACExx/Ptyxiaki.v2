The lock system is characterised in that the lock casing further comprises a second bolt movable between an unlocked position in which the second bolt is substantially fully comprised by the lock casing and a locked position in which the second bolt is partially located outside the casing, the second bolt being movable by operating a spindle if the second bolt and the spindle are connected, the second bolt and the spindle being connectable by a spindle connecting member which is connected<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> to and movable by the bolt blocking member such that movement of the bolt blocking member from the blocked position to the unblocked position causes the spindle connecting member to connect the second bolt and the spindle and movement of the bolt blocking member from the unblocked position to the blocked position causes the spindle connecting member to disconnect the second bolt and the spindle.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">By activating the electromechanical actuator, with the first bolt in the locked position and blocked by the bolt blocking member in the blocking position, the bolt blocking member is moved to the unblocked position by means of the actuating member, allowing the first bolt to freely move. By virtue of the biasing element, the first bolt is subsequently moved to the unlocked position and the lock is opened. The electromechanical actuator only needs to be activated to move the bolt blocking member to the unblocked state to enable the first bolt to be retracted in the casing, in which unlocked or retracted position it is biased. This means that the electromechanical actuator only needs to be energised for a short amount of time. This saves energy compared to having to provide the electromechanical actuator with a current while the lock needs to be locked.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In an embodiment of the lock system according to the invention, the first bolt blocks in the unlocked position the bolt blocking member from moving to the blocked position. This allows the first bolt to remain in its position and prevent the first bolt form potentially being moved or blocked by the bolt blocking member in the locked position.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In a further embodiment of the lock system according to the invention, the electromechanical actuator is further enabled to move the actuating member from the second position to the first position. With the actuating member in the second position, the actuating member may, depending on several factors, block the bolt blocking member from moving to the blocked position, preventing the first bolt to be blocked and hence preventing the lock system from being blocked. By moving the actuating member to the first position, the first bolt blocking is able to move from the unblocked position to the blocked position without interacting with and potentially being blocked by the actuating member.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Another embodiment of the lock system according to the invention comprises a further biasing element for biasing the first bolt locking member to the blocked position enabling the first bolt to be blocked upon moving to the locked position. This embodiment allows the first bolt to be blocked automatically upon moving to the locked position, preventing<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> it to move to the unlocked position by virtue of the biasing force exerted by the first biasing element.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Yet a further embodiment of the lock system according to the invention comprises a sensor arranged to sense whether the actuating member is in the second position and the electromechanical actuator and the sensor are couplable to a control unit that is arranged to control the electromechanical actuator to move to the second position if the sensor senses that the actuating member is not in the second position. The actuating member moving out of the second position may be caused by the bolt blocking member moving out of the unblocked position or result in the bolt blocking member moving out of the unblocked position. Both situations may result in the first bolt moving to the locked position, thus locking a door in which the lock system is fit. The actuating moving the bolt blocking member to the unblocked position is in most cases done with the intention to unlock the door and keep it unlocked. Should, usually by accident, the first bolt move to the lock position, this should be corrected, which can be done with this embodiment.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The invention provides in a second aspect a building locking system comprising: at least one lock system according to claim 1; and a lock control unit couplable to the lock system and enabled to actuate the electromechanical actuator of the lock system. Such building lock system is particularly well suited for buildings where multiple doors need to remain locked and should be opened instantly upon detection of an emergency situation. Such buildings can be prisons where prisoners should be locked in their cells. Deployment of this building locking system in a nightclub can also be envisaged, where the building locking system is used to keep emergency exits well locked and to open them upon detection of an emergency like fire.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">The invention and embodiments thereof will now be further elucidated by means of figures.

Whereas practical embodiments of the lock system according to the invention comprise more elements than disclosed in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1 A, Figure 1 A</figref> primarily discloses the lock system 100 comprising elements that are relevant for describing the invention and embodiments thereof. This applies to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1 B</figref> as well, which discloses the lock system 100 in an open state, whereas <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1 A</figref> discloses the lock system 100 in a closed state. <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1 A and Figure 1</figref> B are presented as examples which are useful for understanding the invention.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The lock system 100 comprises a lock casing 110 comprising a bolt 112. The bolt 112 is slidable between a locked position wherein the bolt is partially located outside the lock casing 110 as shown by <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1 A</figref> and an unlocked position wherein the bolt 112 is located inside the lock casing 110 as shown by <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1 B.</figref> The lock system 100 further comprises a bolt spring 116 acting as a biasing element, a bolt blocking tumbler shaft 120 as a bolt blocking member, a blocking spring 128, a solenoid 130 comprising a plunger 134 and a stationary part 132 comprising a coil (not shown) in which the plunger 134 fits, a lever 136 connected to the plunger 134 and a switch 140. The lock system 100 is preferably fit in a door, with the bolt 112 engaging with a hole in a doorpost for locking the door. The door is locked with the bolt 112 is in the locked position and the door is unlocked with the bolt 112 in the unlocked position or in any case substantially comprised by the lock casing 110 that the bolt 112 is not in the hole of the doorpost anymore.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The blocking tumbler shaft 120 is slidable by virtue of an elongated opening 122 in the blocking tumbler shaft 120 in which a holding pin 124 fits, which holding pin 124 is connected to the lock casing 110. The blocking tumbler shaft 120 is slidable between a blocked position as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1 A</figref> and an unblocked position as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1 B.</figref> The blocking tumbler shaft 120 is biased towards the blocked position by means of the blocking spring 128 that is connected to the blocking tumbler shaft 120 via a blocking spring pin 126 protruding from the side of the blocking tumbler shaft 120.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In a normal state of the lock system 100 corresponding to a state of a larger system like a building in which the lock system 100 is fit, the position of the bolt 112 can be<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> controlled by means of a key, as will be discussed later in further detail. By operating the key in a first direction, preferably by turning it clockwise, viewed from the drawing plane, the blocking tumbler shaft 120 can be slid towards the unblocked position and subsequently the bolt 112 can be slid back to the unlocked position by the same key operation. As the bolt 112 is biased towards the unlocked position by means of the bolt spring 116 acting on a bolt spring pin 114 protruding from the side of the bolt 112, sliding the bolt 112 to the unlocked position will be a relatively light operation.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">By operating the key in a second direction, opposite to the first direction, the bolt 112 can be slid from the unlocked position to the locked position. It is noted that this action involves loading the bolt spring 116. If the bolt 112 has been moved to the locked position, the blocking tumbler shaft 120 is slid towards the blocked position by virtue of the biasing force of the blocking spring 128, thus acting as a bolt blocking member that is blocking the bolt 112 from moving from the locked position to the unlocked position.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As already discussed, the lock system 100 may be opened again by operating a key. Additionally or alternatively, the lock system 100 may be opened remotely by means of the solenoid 130. By applying a first current to the coil of the stationary part 132 of the solenoid 130, the plunger 134 of the solenoid 130, acting as an electromechanical actuator, is pulled inside the stationary part 132. By consequence, the lever 136 is moved towards the stationary part as well. Whereas the solenoid 130 is located outside the lock casing 110, the lever 136, acting as an actuating member, protrudes the lock casing 110 at a location where it is enabled to move the blocking tumbler shaft 120 from the blocked position to the unblocked position. If the blocking tumbler shaft 120 is in the unblocked position, it does not block the bolt 112 anymore, resulting in the bolt 112 to move to unlocked position by virtue of the bolt spring 116.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">With the bolt 112 in the unlocked position, it blocks the blocking tumbler shaft 120 from moving to the blocking position. Therefore, the first current only needs to be applied as a pulse until the bolt 112 blocks the blocking tumbler shaft 120 from moving to the blocked position. A sensor can be added to the lock system 100 for sensing the location of the bolt 112 to determine how long the current pulse should be applied for moving the blocking tumbler shaft 120 to the unblocked position.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Unlocking the lock system 100 remotely is in particular preferred in emergency situations like fire. Upon fire detection, either automatically or by human interaction, the lock system is set from the normal state to an emergency state, upon which transition<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the solenoid 130 is triggered by applying the first current to the coil of the solenoid 130. Subsequently, the lock system 100 is unlocked as discussed above.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In such situations, it is also important that once the lock system 100 is unlocked, it remains unlocked. Therefore, the switch 140 is provided. If the plunger 134 has been pulled into the stationary part 132 of the solenoid 130, an end of the plunger 134 opposite to the end to which the lever 136 is attached contacts and operates the switch 140. Depending on the wiring of the switch 140, a circuit is either closed or opened. In this way, the switch 140 acts as a sensor it can be detected whether the solenoid 130 and with that the lever 136 holds the blocking tumbler shaft 120 in the unblocked position or whether the lever 136 is in the position as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1 A </figref>where the blocking tumbler shaft 120 can move freely between the blocked position and the unblocked position without interacting with and possibly being blocked by the lever 136.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">If the plunger 134 moves to a position where it does not actuate the switch 140 anymore, this means that the lever 136 does not hold the blocking tumbler shaft 120 entirely in its unblocked position anymore. The interrupted actuation of the switch 140 can be detected by a control system as will be discussed later, upon which the coil of the solenoid 130 can be actuated again with the first current to move the plunger 134 back to its position where the lever 136 moves the blocking tumbler shaft 120 back to its unblocking position.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">If the emergency has been resolved, for example because the fire has been put out or the alarm has appeared to be false, the state of the lock system 100 is set back from the emergency state to the normal state. With this transition, the plunger 134 is preferably set back to the position depicted by <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, together with the lever 136 where the blocking tumbler shaft 120 cannot be interfered with anymore by the lever 136. The plunger 134 is moved back by applying a second current to the coil of the solenoid 130 that is opposite to the first current. In this case, the solenoid 130 is preferably a bipolar solenoid. Alternatively, the coil in the solenoid 130 comprises two opposite windings and the first current is applied to a first winding and the second current is applied to the second winding. In this alternative, the second current has the same direction as the first current; the opposite effect - moving the plunger 134 in another direction - is established by the second winding being opposite to the first winding.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Thus far, the bolt 112 and the blocking tumbler shaft 120 have been presented as moving in a linear way, perpendicular to one another.

The bolt 212 is biased towards the unlocked position by a bolt spring 216 that acts on a bolt spring pin 214 that is connected to the bolt 212.

The blocking tumbler shaft 220 is biased by a blocking spring 228 to the blocked position. The blocking spring 228 interacts with the blocking tumbler shaft 220 at the top of the blocking tumbler shaft 220.

The lock cylinder 300 comprises a cylinder housing 302, a key slit 308 and a cylinder cam 304 comprising a cylinder notch 306. For operating the lock cylinder 300, a key is stuck in the key slit 308. If the combination of the key fits the combination of the lock cylinder 300, the key can be turned, resulting in turning the cylinder cam 304 with the cylinder notch 306.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">With the lock cylinder 300 fitted in the lock cylinder opening 270, the cylinder notch 306 is able to interact with the closing tumbler 274, the opening tumbler 272 and in particular with the opening tumbler notch 273. Turning the key of the lock cylinder 300 to the left (counter clockwise) will result in the cylinder notch 306 pushing the closing tumbler 274 to the left, resulting in the connected bolt 212 to be moved to the locked position.

Operating the opening tumbler 272 will also result in the blocking tumbler shaft 220 to be moved to the unblocked position, allowing the bolt 212 to be moved to the unlocked position. The blocking tumbler shaft 220 is moved upwards while turning the key clockwise by interaction of the cylinder notch 306 with the lower left part of the tumbler shaft 220.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Besides being operated by means of a key, the lock system 200 can also be remotely unlocked by means of an electrical pulse. This can for example be done in a case of emergency, where a state of a building in which the lock system 200 is fit is changed from a normal state to an emergency state. To this end, the lock system 200 comprises a solenoid 230 located in a control housing 240. The solenoid 230 comprises a stationary part 232 comprising a coil (not shown) and a plunger 234 that is slidably mounted in the stationary part 232. The plunger 234 has a lever 236 connected to it, protruding the lock casing 210 from the control housing for interacting with the blocking tumbler shaft 220 and in particular the lower part thereof.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Upon receiving an electrical pulse of a first type, preferably a current pulse with a first direction, the coil of the solenoid 130 attracts the plunger 234, resulting in the lever 236 to move in an upward direction. If the blocking tumbler shaft 220 is in the blocked position, the tumbler shaft 220 is moved in the unblocked position, unblocking movement of the bolt 212. Subsequently, by virtue of the bolt spring 216, the bolt 212 slides to the unlocked position. In this unlocked position, the bolt 212 blocks the blocking tumbler shaft 220 from moving to the blocked position.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In the unlocked position, the bolt 212 operates a first micro switch 213, thus either closing or opening a circuit, depending on the wiring of the circuit and/or the first micro switch 213. This enables detection of the position of the bolt 212. The lock system 200 also comprises a second micro switch 242 for detecting the position of the plunger 234 and with that of the lever 236. This allows to detect whether a current pulse applied to the solenoid 130 has been sufficiently long and/or powerful to unlocked the lock system 200. If the pulse has been too short, the plunger 242 may have moved the blocking<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> tumbler shaft 220 to the unblocked position, but possibly not long enough for the bolt 212 to move to the unlocked position, in which position it would block the blocking tumbler shaft 220 in the unblocked position. This may result in the blocking tumbler shaft 220 from moving back to the blocked position, blocking the bolt 212 to move to the unlocked position.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In this case, the second micro switch 242 has been triggered, but not the first micro switch 213. Therefore, the pulse of the first type is preferably applied to the solenoid 130 until the first micro switch 213 is triggered by a fully retracted bolt 212. The triggering of the second micro switch by the plunger 234 may be used to detect any potential issues with the solenoid. If after applying a current to the solenoid 130 for a longer time, for example over two seconds, the second micro switch 242 has not been triggered, this could indicate malfunction of the solenoid 130 or another inability of the solenoid to move the blocking tumbler shaft 220 to the unblocked position.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Additionally or alternatively, detection of the location of the plunger 234 by the second micro switch 242 can be used to apply the first current again to the solenoid to ensure that the blocking tumbler shaft 220 is kept in the unblocked position by means of the lever 236, while the building in which the lock system 200 is placed is in emergency state. If the second micro switch 242 is not triggered anymore by the upper end of the plunger 234, this means that the lever 236 does not hold the blocking tumbler shaft 220 entirely in the unblocked position. To ensure the blocking tumbler shaft 220 is in emergency state always held in the unblocked position by the lever 236, release of the second micro switch 242 could trigger a control circuit to energise the coil of the solenoid 230 to move the plunger 234 back to a position where it holds the blocking tumbler shaft 220 in the unblocked position.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The blocking tumbler shaft 220 could in the emergency state move to the blocked position in case a person would accidentally lock the lock system 200 by means of a key. In such case, the bolt 212 would be moved to the locked position and the blocking tumbler shaft 220 to the blocked position, thus locking the lock system 200. In the emergency state, this is undesirable; hence the triggering of the coil in case the second micro switch 242 is released.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Upon returning to normal state, an electrical pulse of a second type, preferably a second current opposite to that of the first current, is applied to the solenoid 130 to move the plunger back to the location depicted in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The various electrical components of the lock system can be connected to further units by virtue of the socket 241 comprising connections to the various electrical elements of the lock system 200 like the first micro switch 213, the second micro switch 242 and the solenoid 230.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The lock system 200 further comprises a spring latch 262 as a second bolt that is biased in a locked position by means of a spring latch spring 266 that interacts with spring latch protrusion 264. The spring latch 262 can be operated by inserting a handle in the square spring latch operating hole 247. This enables the spring latch operating hole 247 to be swivelled, resulting in retracting the spring latch 262 in the lock casing 210, in an unlocked position. The spring latch operating hole 247 is fitted with a flange 246 that swivels with the spring latch operating hole 247 and is couplable to a spring latch swivel arm 248. If the flange 246 is coupled to the spring latch swivel arm 248, operation of a handle fitted in the spring latch operating hole 247 by turning the handle clockwise results in the spring latch swivel arm 248 moving to the right, thus retracting the spring latch 262 in the lock casing 210.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Coupling of the flange 246 and the spring latch swivel arm 248 is done by means of a coupling catch 254 fitted on a coupling tumbler 250.
