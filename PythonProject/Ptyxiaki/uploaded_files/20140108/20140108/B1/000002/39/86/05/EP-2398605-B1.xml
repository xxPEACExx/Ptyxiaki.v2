In particular, each of the bars may be purposely deformed, or so formed, into certain twisted pattern along its longitudinal axis resulting in a twisted or helical spiral for aesthetics or ornamentation.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">An example of such twisting imparted to a bar or strip by an apparatus is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5107694A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,107,694 (Kemp</text></patcit><b>).</b> As the strip of material or thin bar is solid, this prior art apparatus may use roll-milling to form the helical twists on the bar. Often it is not necessary for the bar to be solid in order to provide the necessary tensile strength such as that demonstrated by I- beam (or H-beam) cross-section. It is also known that while the flanges (horizontal elements) of the I-beam is very efficient in carrying both bending and shear in the plane of the web (vertical element), it is inefficient in carrying torsion for which hollow structural sections are preferred.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Methods for twisting hollow or tubular elements known in the art includes that disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5410808A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,410,808 (Geppelt et al.</text></patcit>) for twisting a hollow double wall tube (i.e. bar having cylindrical cross-section).

Apart from the telescopic feature allowing the curtain rod to be lengthened with the same twisting aesthetics at the ends, this Bibby reference also mentions the problem of open-seam bars as having greater resilence to twisting due to the tendency of such bars to spring back partially or wholly to its untwisted state upon release from the twisting apparatus, or when the moment of force is removed, compared to close-seam or seam-less or tubular bars.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP55165227A"><text>JP-A-55165227</text></patcit> discloses a method of longitudinally twisting a hollow elongate member without suffering from undesirable deformation, by placing the extruded shapes under a coupled condition, and simultaneously applying the bending work to all shapes utilizing a slip at each fitting joint.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For tubular bars, the twisting is often irreversible and once twisted the material becomes permanently deformed once its elasticity point is breached. Any subsequent working on the bar would thus lead to material fatigue or material failure. It is thus desirable to maintain certain resilience in fabricating twisted bars so that the twisting may be reversed to a certain extent and retwisted to adjust for fitting length, asthetics as well as without compromising tensile or structural strength and so that the bar being worked on need not be discarded if a slight workmanship error occurs or a small specification readjustment is required. Of course, it is well-known that material resilience and recovery from deformity depends on the material employed, such as whether the hollow bar is made of metal, alloy or polymers (including plastics) and its material properties such as its elasticity, torsional, shearing and tensile strengths, etc.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><u>SUMMARY OF DISCLOSURE</u></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">We have in this invention endeavoured to provide for the fabrication of a hollow bar which configuration offers an increased resilience to torsional stress. Due to the resilience, we have also endeavoured to provide for various means and methods for twisting and bracing the twisted form of the bar depending on the nature of the material used to fabricate the hollow bar or its parts and components, e.g. whether the metal profile are extruded or the hollow bar part is profiled from metal sheets or strips that are stamped, pressed or bent to shape, roll-milled, extruded plastic profile, etc.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Our inventive concept is to provide separate longitudinally parts that may be assembled to comprise the hollow elongate member so that each of the parts may be twisted without breaching the material's fatigue limit. Upon releasing the twisting stress or removal of moment of force, the part may revert back to much of its original shape due to its material elasticity. Hence, in addition to increasing spiral turns for each hollow bar, one may release the twisted bar for reuse or re-twisting for adjustments or re-installation.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">To these ends, our invention comprises of a method of longitudinally twisting a hollow elongate member to a desired spiral form comprising fabricating a plurality of longitudinal parts integral with joint means that are complementarily fastenable each other into forming the hollow elongate member. Upon fastening the plurality of longitudinal parts with the joint means to assemble the hollow elongate member, the assembled hollow elongate member is then twisted to the desired spiral form.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">One feature of the invention is the presence of the joint means that accommodate limited pivotal movement due to moment of force arising from the twisting of the hollow elongate member. The joint means may be provided along the connecting edges of each of the longitudinal parts and thus enabling a continuous longitudinal joint. The joint means may be selected from any one<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> or combination of tongue-in-groove type including hinge joint, ball-and-socket joint, pivot joint and uniaxial joint.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Another feature of the invention is that the longitudinal parts may be fabricated by any one or combination of extrusion and stamping, pressing, bending or roll-milling processes. Preferably, the hollow elongate member comprises a pair of identical longitudinal parts complementarily forming the hollow elongate member. Preferably still, the hollow elongate member has a cross-section profile selected from a polygon including any one of triangle, tetragon including rectangle, square, rhomboid, cuboid, parallelogram, ellipse, oval and the like.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">One aspect of our invention is to provide bracing to maintain the hollow elongate member in the desired twisted spiral form. In one embodiment, the bracing includes integrally fabricating features with the longitudinal parts which features, upon assembly, forming internal bracing features within the hollow elongate member. Preferably, the internal bracing features include a sleeve formed by complementary semi-cylindrical halves integral with each of the longitudinal parts, wherein the semi-cylindrical halves may be joined to each other by sleeve joints. More preferably, a rod is insertable into the sleeve, and retaining pins transfixing the sleeve and rod at each ends of the hollow elongate member to keep the desired spiral form from unraveling.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In another embodiment, the bracing step includes providing a rod affixed with a plurality brace plates disposed therealong at suitable intervals and orientation to internally support the desired twisted spiral form of the hollow elongate member. The brace plate is preferably provided with a slot for insertion of the seam formed by the edges of roll-milled longitudinal parts.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Yet another embodiment of our bracing feature comprises providing end bracing means at each of the hollow elongate member's ends to keep the desired twisted spiral form from unraveling.

<ul><li>"hollow bar" may include hollow elongate member, tubular member and like shapes which may be employed as hollow bar elements of a railing, grille, grating and similar metalwork; and</li><li>"twisting" includes action or force imparted to twist a hollow bar along its longitudinal axis to produce a twisted, spiral distortion of the bar, and</li><li>"moment" or "moment of force" is to be interpreted as that imparted to the bar to result in such twisting or spiral distortion.</li></ul></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">To increase the hollow bar's resilience to torsional stress while the hollow bar is twisted to a desired spiral form, we have now proposed to fabricate the hollow bar, such as one exemplary one shown in cross-sectional view in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref>, in a plurality of longitudinal parts (100, 102) which are complementarily fastenable to each other to form the complete hollow bar or elongate member (10). Each of the parts (100, 102) is fabricated joint means (106, 108) which may complementarily fasten onto the other part's joint means, whereby tying the longitudinal parts (100, 102) to form the complete hollow bar (10).</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Each of the longitudinal parts (100, 102) may be fabricated by mass production (e.g. by roll-milling or extrusion) so that the mass-produced parts may then be assembled elsewhere using hand-operable machines or automated machines to slot in or snap-joint them into the hollow bar although the assembly may also be manually done. The completed hollow bar may also be twisted by hand or assisted by machine or operator-controlled, or by automated machine. For manual assembly and manual twisting, it is therefore possible for the longitudinal parts (100, 102) to be produced and sold as spare parts in hardware shops so that a DIY ("do-it-yourself") user may purchase them in small quantities to be cut to the desired lengths before slotting in or<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> snapping in at the joints to complete the bar and manually twist it to the desired spiral form, together with other accessories to be described later.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Once the longitudinal parts (100, 102) are assembled and joined to form the hollow bar (10), the completed hollow bar (10) may then be twisted or applied with torsional stress to achieve the desired spiral form. Due to the multiple joints (106, 108) between the plurality of longitudinal parts (100, 102), limited pivotal movement is allowed at the joints or along the seams or joined edges of adjacent longitudinal parts to provide some stress relief from moment of force arising from the twisting. Thus, in this configuration, the hollow bar as a whole is able to withstand greater torsional stress without reaching material fatigue or permanent deformity.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The joint means (106, 108) may be selected from any one or combination of tongue-in-groove type including hinge joint, ball-and-socket joint, pivot joint and uniaxial joint.

For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 10</figref>, the hollow bar may comprise of two longitudinal parts (301, 302) which have been formed by roll-milling process, and a bracing means which may be made by extrusion, disposed in the hollow part of the bar. In the example of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the bracing means may be formed integral with the longitudinal parts by extrusion.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">For ease of fabrication and assembly, the longitudinal parts may be designed such that the plurality of the longitudinal parts are identical so that a<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> plural number of the identical parts may be complementarily assembled to form the hollow bar. For example, the wavy parallelogram cross-section of the hollow bar of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> may be formed by two identical longitudinal parts (100, 102) which also provides for complementary and integral extension into the hollow part of the completed bar to provide for internal bracing means.

Although increasing the number of longitudinal parts may increase the flexibility and resilience of the hollow bar to twisting, it is best to limit the number is two parts for ease of fabrication and assembly.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">As have been introduced in the above, some form of bracing to maintain the hollow bar in its rectangular and twisted form may preferably be provided to prevent collapse and unraveling of the twisted or spiral form. Exemplary of these bracing - both internal bracing and external bracing are to be described in the following with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">As previously described, <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref> shows a hollow bar (10) with a parallelogram-like cross-section comprising 2 identical longitudinal parts (100, 102) which may be joined to each other along the longitudinal edges by hinge joint means (106, 108). In this embodiment, internal bracing means is provided in the form of semi-cylindrical halves or semi-cylindrical wall integrally linked to the inner surface of longitudinal parts by tie wings.
