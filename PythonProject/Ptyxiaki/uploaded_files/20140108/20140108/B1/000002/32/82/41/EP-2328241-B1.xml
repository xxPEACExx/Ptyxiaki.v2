The technical solutions are as follows.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention provides a data card with a rotatable connector, which includes a data card body and a rotatable connector. The rotatable connector includes an external port for connecting with an external device. The rotatable connector is rotatably connected with the data card body. The data card further includes an antenna set in the rotatable connector, wherein the shape of the cavity of the rotatable connector is designed at will as requires, and the shape of the antenna is changed with the shape of the inner wall of the cavity of the rotatable connector.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The technical solutions of the present invention have the following beneficial effects.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the present invention, through setting the antenna in the rotatable connector, no matter what angle the data card body of the data card is rotated, the distance between the antenna and an edge of the external device and the relative position of the antenna to the edge of the external device are not changed, and thus the antenna is maintained in the same state. In this way, the distance between the antenna and the external device is fixed, and only the relative position of the data card body to the external device is changed. Thus, the performance of the antenna can be modulated in advance, so as to eliminate the interference on the performance of the antenna caused by the external device. Meanwhile, since the antenna is placed in the rotatable connector, the available space of the rotatable connector is much larger than the space occupied by the antenna when being placed at the tail portion, which is quite beneficial to the performance of the antenna. Moreover, since the antenna is moved from the tail portion to the rotatable connector, the antenna does not need to occupy the space of the data card body, the length of the data card is greatly reduced, and thus the overall size of the data card is further reduced.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">To illustrate the technical solutions according to the embodiments of the present invention more clearly, the accompanying drawings for describing the embodiments are introduced briefly in the following.
