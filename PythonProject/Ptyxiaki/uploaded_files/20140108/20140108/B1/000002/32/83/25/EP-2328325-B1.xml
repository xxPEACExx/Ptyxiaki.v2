Invention</b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">Where sensors have been integrated in a network, it can be advantageous to make them accessible to potential data customers by advertising the sensors' presence and capabilities in some standardized way. SensorML is a mark-up language that was designed to allow such standardized advertisements and descriptions of networked sensors, as a means to enable third-party usage of these sensors.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Markup languages are well known. The extensible Markup Language (XML) is a widely used standard for such markup languages, ensuring a maximum degree of interoperability among systems designed to handle information in the form of XML documents. SensorML is a particular XML dialect intended for the description of the characteristics of sensors, and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> data acquired by sensors. The sensorML language was developed in the context of global research programs, including highly sophisticated satellite-based and earth-based sensors, wherein a reuse of the obtained data by multiple organizations improves the scientific return of the equipment investment.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Where sensors are being integrated in a home network, for instance as part of a home automation system, it is generally not desirable to give third parties indiscriminate access to the data obtained or processes controlled by these sensors.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Embodiments of the invention are based on the insight that it may nevertheless be advantageous to provide directed advertisements of the presence and capabilities of the different sensors in the home to a centralized system that is adapted to provide services using the sensors' data and processes. Such a centralized system may be present in the home or in a service provider's premises.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A problem with providing services based on sensors present in the home network is the fact that the availability of sensors may vary over time, especially as sensors are being added to the home network. A particular problem is that there typically may not be appropriate software or firmware installed to correctly interact with newly installed sensors.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention pertains to the provision of services on the basis of networked sensors, and to the use of sensorML for directing network elements towards software enabling interaction with networked sensors.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The article "<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Internet Metadata Framework for Plug and Play Wireless Sensor Networks" by Jongwoo Sung et al.

It states that they are used for detections, identifications, and configurations of sensor nodes in a running time. The metadata is formatted in a proprietary format, different from sensorML.
