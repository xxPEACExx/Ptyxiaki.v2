Various configurations of computer program products, mobile devices and systems for achieving the above are described.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The mobile device is configured to allow a determination of its location data using one or more of a plurality of location techniques. Quality information including a designation of the location technique used for determining the location data and at least partly a quality of the location data, is obtained. The quality information is integrated at least partly with the service to allow a modification of the service based on the quality information.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, quality information 140 is obtained 130 from location data 110 and optionally other additional data 120. The quality information 140 is at least partly integrated 150 with the service 160 to allows its modification 155 based on the quality information 140. In embodiments, the quality information 140 may be optionally provided to a user 105 who in turn modifies 155 the service 160 accordingly.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Exemplarily, the service may be a camera-geotagging service which is configured to associate images with location data. The geotagging aspects of the camera-geotagging service may be modified depending on the quality information 140 obtained from the location data 110.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Acts associated with the method described herein can be implemented as coded instructions in a computer program product. In other words, the computer program product is a computer-readable medium upon which software code is recorded to execute the method when the software code is loaded into a memory and executed on an operatively associated microprocessor, exemplarily of the mobile device or a system.</p><heading id="h0007">Location Techniques</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">As noted earlier, the mobile device of the invention may be configured to allow a determination of its location data using one or more of a plurality of location techniques. The term 'location technique' as used herein refers to a technology, a methodology or a combination thereof, for determining the location data for the mobile device.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The location data may be determined based on device-based, network-based or hybrid location techniques. Such systems can collect power and timing measurements, broadcast positioning information and other collateral information for various location methodologies, including but not limited to device-based time-of-arrival (TOA), forward link-trilateration (FLT), Advanced-forward-link-trilateration (AFLT), Enhanced-forward-link-trilateration (E-FLT), Enhanced Observed Difference of Arrival (EOTD), Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA), Observed Time Difference of Arrival (O-TDOA), Global Positioning System (GPS) and Assisted GPS (A-GPS). A worker skilled in the art will readily understand that some location techniques may determine location data based on the arrival times of received signals with respect to a reference time, or may utilize ranging, timing or signal strength (i.e., power) measurements.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Network-based location techniques include those using POA, PDOA, TOA, TDOA, or AOA or combinations of these. Device-based location techniques may include those using TOA, TDOA, POA, PDOA, GPS, or A-GPS. Hybrid location techniques combine multiple network-based location techniques, multiple device-based location techniques, or a combination of network and device based location techniques. Such hybrid location techniques may be designed appropriately to achieve specified accuracy, yield, and latency requirements for the acquisition of the location data.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In embodiments, the mobile device may be configured to allow a determination of its location data using one or more of the following technologies: GPS, cell-tower trilateration, cell-tower triangulation, wireless access points and Internet Protocol (lP) addressing schemes. lP addresses may be used to determine position either when the allocation of lP addresses to Internet Service Providers (ISP's) is known, or the network latency to landmark nodes is observed. Exemplarily, in a notebook environment, lP addresses can be used in trilateration or triangulation approaches utilizing packet latencies.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A worker skilled in the art will readily understand that different location techniques will have differing degrees of location accuracy. For example, GPS-based location techniques typically provide higher accuracy than location techniques based on Wi-Fi access point triangulation or trilateration, which in turn typically provide higher accuracy than location techniques based on cell tower trilateration or cell-tower triangulation. In an embodiment, a GPS-based technique may acquire a location to within five meters,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> while a location technique based on cell tower trilateration or cell tower triangulation may acquire a location to within a few hundred meters.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The specific location technique used at any given instant may be chosen based on a variety of factors including but not limited to a location latency, a location accuracy, user preferences and battery power consumption. Location latency as used herein may be understood by a worker skilled in the art as at least partly including the time of acquisition for the location data. The location technique employed may be dependent on the service area deployed. In embodiments, the user may manually choose the location technique for location data acquisition. For example, a user may choose to use a GPS-based location technique while being outdoors, and a Wi-Fi access point based location technique while indoors.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In embodiments, the mobile device may be configured in one or more operating modes. Exemplarily, the mobile device may be configured in a 'conserve battery power' operating mode, or in a 'speed up acquisition' operating mode. The mobile device may be configured to automatically choose a location technique based on a current operating mode or an anticipated future operating mode.</p><heading id="h0008"><i>Quality Information</i></heading><p id="p0026" num="0026">Quality information as used herein refers generally to a data set that allows a modification of a service accessible via a mobile device of the disclosure. In embodiments, the integration of the quality information at least partly with the service may serve to enhance the quality of the service accessible via the mobile device.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The quality information may comprise one or more different types of data. In embodiments, the quality information includes a designation of the location technique used for determining the current (exemplarily, the most recently acquired) location data. The quality information further comprises an indication of the quality of the location data (hereinafter referred to as 'location quality').</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The location quality may be indicative of one or more aspects of the location data including but not limited to a location accuracy, a location precision, a location availability, a location latency, a location yield, or a combination thereof. Quality information may also be indicative of a velocity accuracy, a time accuracy, a response<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> time, an information update rate, an age of location, dilution of precision (DOP) (exemplarily for GPS-based location techniques) or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In embodiments, the location quality may include the accuracy of a compass direction. The compass direction may be obtained using a digital compass operatively associated with the mobile device, or using estimation techniques that account for the path being traveled as tracked by a location technique (e.g. a GPS-based location technique).</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Location accuracy as used herein may be understood as being indicative of the difference between the location data obtained and the actual position of the mobile device, and may comprise a horizontal location accuracy value and a vertical location accuracy value. As noted earlier, different location techniques typically have differing degrees of location accuracy.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Location precision as used herein may at least partly indicate the differences between a plurality of successive samples of location data. Exemplarily, location precision may be low if the differences in the location data information for successive samples of location data is high, wherein the term 'high' would be readily understood by a worker skilled in the art as being defined having regard to the velocity of the mobile device.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In embodiments, location precision may be indicative of a variance of a plurality of samples of location data obtained. Location precision may also be indicative of other relevant statistical parameters that would be readily known to a worker skilled in the art. The plurality of samples of location data may be previously stored exemplarily in a memory module operatively associated with the mobile device.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Location latency at least partly indicates a time required for acquiring the location data. A worker skilled in the art will readily understand that the location latency is dependant on the location technique used for determination of the location data. For example, GPS-based systems may have a location latency of several minutes, while systems based on cell tower triangulation or cell tower trilateration may have shorter location latencies. When awaiting a location update, it can be beneficial for a user to understand the currently attained level of location accuracy.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Location availability may at least partially indicate whether an acquisition of location data information has been successful. Location yield may at least partially indicate the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> percentage of a pre-determined or a user-defined number of location data acquisition attempts that have been successful. Location yield may be different depending on whether the mobile device is indoors or outdoors. Exemplarily, a mobile device utilizing GPS-based location techniques while indoors may have unsuccessful acquisition attempts, if there arises difficulties in establishing communication with the GPS satellites.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Quality information may be obtained by processing the location data and additional data. Such additional data may include time data, or various other data (e.g. network information regarding locations of cell towers) that would be readily known to a worker skilled in the art. Previously stored data (e.g. historical samples of location data) may be used to obtain the quality information.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In embodiments, the processing of the quality information may be performed when the mobile device is idle in order to reduce power consumption. In embodiments, quality information associated with one location technique may be used at least partially to predict the quality information for one or more other location techniques.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The processing required for the determination of the quality information may be performed by the mobile device, by a server managed exemplarily by a service and application provider, or by a combination of both. Information required for the processing may at least partly be stored on the mobile device, on the server of the service and application provider, or on a server of a data and content provider communicatively linked with the appropriate processing entities, such as described above. ln embodiments, the distribution of the processing burden may be based on the amount of data available for processing and the available communication bandwidth for data transfer between the various processing entities.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The quality information may be updated automatically, or may be updated when requested by the user. The quality information may be obtained periodically or continuously. The update procedure for automatic updates may be chosen by a user and may be distinct for different services. Automatic quality information updates may be obtained on a regular basis with time or based on a change in location data or other data.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In embodiments, a mobile device may be configured to obtain the quality information continuously. A user of the mobile device may either query for the quality information when desired, or may subscribe to updates on the quality information when the quality information changes over time.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In embodiments, the quality information is obtained for each update of the location data. In embodiments, the update rate for the quality information is less than the update rate for the location data. In embodiments, the update rate for the quality information is not fixed, but is dependant on the location data, location technique or other factors. For example, the quality information may be updated if the location data indicates a significant movement. In one embodiment, the quality information may be updated more frequently if the mobile device enters an area where a GPS-based location technique is bounded to be less accurate (e.g. indoors).</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In embodiments, the quality information may be delivered to a mobile device using a push-configuration or alternately using a pull-configuration.
