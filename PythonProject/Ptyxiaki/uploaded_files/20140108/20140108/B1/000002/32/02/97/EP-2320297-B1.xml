The concaves 2031 may be distributed evenly or not distributed evenly on a circle of a certain diameter. The diameter depends on the size and the practical application of the concave washer 203. The diameter is not limited here. The concave washer 203 may be a thin slice in a round, square, or rhombic shape with a round hole in the center. The diameter of the round hole is slightly larger than that of the cylinder 2012, so that the concave washer 203 can be disposed around the cylinder 2012 and move to and fro along the axial direction of the cylinder 2012 but not rotate around the cylinder 2012. In the embodiment of the invention, the concave washer 203 is preferably a round slice with a round hole in the center.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Accordingly, a number of protrusions 2041 are disposed on the end-surface of the movable support 204 that contacts the concave washer 203 to mate the concaves 2031.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Particularly, when the movable support 204 is rotated around the cylinder 1012, the protrusions 2041 can be rotated into or out of the concaves 2031. Through the cooperation of the protrusions 2041, concaves 2031, and elastic force of the elastic body 202, the elastic body 202 and concave washer 203 can move to and fro along the axial direction of the cylinder 2012. The number and distribution of the protrusions 2041 may depend on the number and distribution of the concaves 2031. Generally, the number of protrusions 2041 is smaller than or equal to the number of concaves 2031. For example, if 12 concaves 2031 are distributed evenly on a circle of a certain diameter with an angle of 30 degrees between each two adjacent concaves 2031, 12 protrusions 2041 can be designed accordingly with an angle of 30 degrees between each two adjacent protrusions 2041, or 4 protrusions 2041 can be designed with an angle of 90 degrees between each two adjacent protrusions 2041. If the concaves 2031 on the concave washer 203 are not evenly distributed on a circle of a certain diameter, the number of protrusions 2041 may only be 1.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In the embodiment of the invention, the protrusions 2041 are rotated into the concaves 2031 initially; when the protrusions 2041 on the movable support 204 are rotated relatively to the concaves 2031 on the concave washer 203, with the cooperation of the elastic force<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> provided by the elastic body 202, the protrusions 2041 are rotated into the concaves 2031 and rotated out of the concaves 2031 constantly. That is, the protrusions 2041 and the concaves 2031 are constantly interlocked and separated and such changes produce a hand feeling. The angle of each move of the movable support 204 relative to the concave washer 203 (the process where protrusions 2041 are moved out of the concaves 2031 and moved into the concaves 2031 again) can be adjusted by changing the number and positions of the concaves 2031 on a circle of a certain diameter. For example, if the angle between each two adjacent concaves 2031 is 30 degrees, the angle of each move of the movable support 204 relative to the concave washer 203 is 30 degrees. The angle of each move of the movable support 204 relative to the concave washer 203 may be described as a working range angle. Changing the number and distribution of the concaves 2031 on the concave washer 203 can adjust the working range angle of the rotation axis. In addition, the torque that enables the protrusions 2041 of the movable support 204 to move completely out of the concaves 2031 of the concave washer 203 is the maximum torque of the rotation axis. The maximum torque can be controlled by changing the elasticity coefficient of the elastic body 202 and the size of the protrusions 2041 and concaves 2031. To help the protrusions 2041 to move into and move out of the concaves 2031, the depth of the concaves 2031 is generally not large and the diameter of the protrusions 2041 is larger than the depth of concaves 2031.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The movable support 204 may be a thin slice in a round, square, or rhombic shape with a round hole in the center and the diameter of the round hole is larger than the diameter of the cylinder 2012 so that the movable support 204 can be disposed around the cylinder 2012 and can rotate around the cylinder 2012. In the embodiment of the invention, the movable support 204 is a round slice with a round hole in the center. In addition, when the rotation axis provided according to the embodiment of the invention is applied to other devices, to help the connection with the other devices, at least one positioning hole 2042 may be disposed on the movable support 204. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, a pair of positioning holes 2042 is disposed on two sides of the movable support 204.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">A stop groove 2051 is disposed on the stop ring 205 and a positioning rod 2042 is disposed on the end-surface of the movable support 204 that contacts the stop ring 205.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">When the positioning rod 2042 on the movable support 204 contacts the edge of the stop groove 2051 on the stop ring 205, the movable support 204 cannot move in the previous moving direction. Thereby, the stop groove 2051 on the stop ring 205 will limit the move of the positioning rod 2042 on the movable support 204 to a certain angle range. That is, the angle of the stop groove 2051 on the stop ring 205 decides the rotation angle range of the movable support 204. For example, if the angle of the stop groove 2051 on the stop ring 205 is 270 degrees, the rotation angle range of the movable support 204 is from 0 to 270 degrees.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Note when no stop ring 205 is disposed, the invention can still be implemented but, in this case, the movable support 204 can rotate by any angle clockwise or anticlockwise.

The design can be flexible according to the practical conditions. In addition, when no positioning support 206 is disposed, the invention can still be implemented. In this case, when the rotation axis is applied in another device, the rotation axis is fastened through other parts in the axis, for example, a positioning hole disposed on the lip 2011 of the sleeve 201.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The locking washer 207 can compress and dispose the elastic body 202, concave washer 203, movable support 204, stop ring 205, and positioning support 206 around the cylinder 2012 of the sleeve 201 and force the elastic body 202 to be compressed in the initial state to provide an initial pressing force.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Note, when no locking washer 207 is disposed, the invention can still be implemented in various methods in the prior art. For example, the elastic body 202, concave washer 203, movable support 204, stop ring 205, and positioning support 206 can be compressed around the cylinder 2012 of the sleeve 201 and the end of the cylinder 2012 is turned outward and fixed to the positioning support 206; or, after the elastic body 202, concave washer 203, movable support 204, stop ring 205, and positioning support 206 are compressed around the cylinder 2012 of the sleeve 201, the stop ring 205 and positioning support 206 are welded to the cylinder 2012.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The working principle of the rotation axis provided according to the embodiment of the invention is as follows:
<ul><li>In the initial state, the protrusions 2041 on the movable support 204 are rotated in the concaves 2031 on the concave washer 203 and the elastic body 202 is compressed to provide an initial pressing force. When the movable support 204 is rotated, the protrusions 2041 on the movable support 204 are rotated out of the concaves 2031 on the concave washer. In this case, the concave washer 203 is pressed by the protrusions 2041 on the movable support 204 and moves toward the elastic body 202 to compress the elastic body 202. The elastic body 202 is compressed by a larger force and the elastic force is greater. When the movable support 204 is rotated again, the protrusions 2041 on the movable support 204 are moved into the next concaves 2031 and the concave washer 203 moves away from the elastic body 202 under the elastic force of the elastic body 202. Thus, the elastic body 202 is less compressed and the elastic force is weaker. During the rotation of the movable support 204, as a protrusion 2041 is moved out of a concave 2031 and moved into the next concave 2031, the concave washer<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> 203 moves to and fro along the axial direction of the cylinder 2012 and the compression of the elastic body 202 is larger and smaller accordingly. Such changes produce a hand feeling. When the movable support 204 is rotated so that the positioning rod 2042 contacts the edge of the stop groove 2051 of the stop ring 205, the rotation of the movable support 204 is stopped and the maximum rotation angle is reached.</li></ul></p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The material of the rotation axis is not limited and the material may be metal or plastic.
