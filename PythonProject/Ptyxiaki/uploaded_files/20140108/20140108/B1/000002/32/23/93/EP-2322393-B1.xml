The retainer comprises a body having a substantially rectangular bottom surface and substantially rectangular frame-shaped side walls, and hook members for engaging the body with a support member. At this time, the body and the hook members are integrally constructed with substantially the same thickness by a series of extrusion molding processes using one piece of sheet metal, for example. As a result, the weight of the retainer can be reduced, compared to the case where the body is formed by connecting multiple separate members by welding and the hook members are formed by connecting separate members with the body. Also, since welding is not required for connection, the strength of the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> retainer can be increased, and the manufacturing process can be simplified and the cost reduced. Additionally, the strength of the hook members can be increased by providing a first rib on the hook members. As a result, the strength of the hook members is not unsatisfactory even when they are integrally molded as described above. Also, due to the fact that the body and hook members have the same thickness, the deviation in rigidity of the retainer as a whole can be reduced, and the strength of the retainer can be increased.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In addition, when the airbag inflates and expands, stress operates such that the inflated airbag spreads the body from the inside toward the outside, and deformation of the opening of the body (so-called "fishmouth") may occur. In particular, the larger the height dimension of the body, the more easily it is affected by the above-described stress, and the greater the tendency for fishmouth to occur.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the invention, due to the fact that the body and hook members are integrally constructed with substantially the same thickness, the strength of the retainer can be increased as described above, and in addition, the above-described stress can be distributed when the airbag inflates and expands. As a result, the above-described fishmouth can be reduced. Also, by using the above-described extrusion molding technique, the body can be molded such that the height dimension of the body is small. Therefore, the above-described fishmouth when the airbag expands can be further reduced. As a result, it is possible to avoid the problem that when an inflated and expanded airbag is replaced with a new airbag, it is difficult to remove the retainer which holds the inflated and expanded airbag from inside the panel, or it cannot be removed from inside the panel and the panel itself must be replaced. Therefore, costs can be reduced.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to the invention, the body further includes a flange having a shape that widens toward an edge side, on an upper end portion of an entire periphery of the substantially rectangular frame-shaped side walls.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the invention, due to the fact that a flange is provided on the side walls of the body which is constructed integrally by extrusion molding, the flange can be provided so as to connect to the entire periphery of the top opening of the body.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to further aspects, the first rib portion of the hook members extends along a direction of protrusion of the hook member; and the body further includes second rib portions formed so as to be continuous respectively with the first rib portions of the hook members.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The body has a second rib, such that it connects with the first rib of the hook members. Thus, the strength of the retainer can be further increased by providing long, integrally-constructed ribs.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The body has the same height dimension along the entire periphery of the substantially rectangular frame-shaped side walls.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The deviation in rigidity of the body can be reduced due to the fact that the height dimension is the same around the entire periphery of the side walls of the body. As a result, the strength of the retainer can be increased.</p><heading id="h0001">The invention is further described with reference to the drawings:</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are side sectional views of a passenger airbag apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref> is a top view and <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2B</figref> is a bottom view illustrating the exterior of a passenger airbag apparatus.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref> is a view looking from direction A in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B</figref> is a view looking from direction B in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is an exploded perspective view of a passenger airbag apparatus.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5A</figref> is a top view and <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5B</figref> is a bottom view of a body of a retainer.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6A</figref> is a view looking from direction C in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5A</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6B</figref> is a view looking from direction D in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5A</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7A</figref> is a transverse sectional view along section VIIA-VIIA in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5A</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7B</figref> is a view showing the transverse sectional view along section VIIB-VIIB in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5A</figref> rotated 90°.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8A</figref> is a transverse sectional view along section VIIIA-VIIIA in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6A</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8B</figref> is a view showing the transverse sectional view along section VIIIB-VIIIB in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6A</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> are explanatory diagrams schematically illustrating an example of the manufacturing process of a retainer by extrusion molding.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> are explanatory diagrams schematically illustrating an example of the manufacturing process of a retainer by extrusion molding.</li></ul></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">An embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the attached drawings.

This retainer 16 comprises a body 26 and a plurality of hooks 28 (hook members). The body 26 comprises a substantially rectangular bottom surface 26a and substantially rectangular frame-shaped side walls 26b, and an opening 30 (refer to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> and so forth) on the side opposite the bottom surface 26a. The hooks 28 are provided in the vehicle front and rear directions on the body 26, in a state where they attach the retainer 16 to the vehicle.

When the inflator 20 operates (the state shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1B</figref>), a breakable tear line (not illustrated) formed between the lid member 34 and opening 10a breaks, and the lid member 34 rotates (in the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1B</figref>, the passenger M side is opened), and the airbag 14 inflates and comes out toward the passenger M side.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In the passenger airbag apparatus 12 configured in this way, normally, the airbag 14 is stored folded inside the retainer 16, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref>. When an emergency occurs, such as collision of the vehicle, the inflator 20 operates by a control signal being input from a control device (not illustrated). As a result, an ignition agent inside is ignited and gas is emitted, and as a result, internal pressure rises, and the airbag 14 that was in the folded state begins to inflate and expand. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1B</figref>, by the force of its expansion, the airbag 14 breaks the tear line and causes the lid member 34 to open, and expands to the outside of the retainer 16 and instrument panel 10, inflating and expanding toward the passenger M seated in the passenger seat S.

It is structured by extrusion molding, for example, from a single metal sheet. The body 26 and hooks 28 are integrally formed with substantially the same thickness by the extrusion molding process described above.

On the body 26, ribs 26c are provided, of which the inside of the side walls 26b has an indented shape and the outside of the side walls 26b has a protruding shape. The ribs 26c (second ribs, appropriately called "second ribs 26c" hereinafter) are formed so as to be continuous with the first ribs 28a. Therefore, the first ribs 28a and second ribs 26c are integrally provided in the long direction along the body 26 from the hooks 28.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Also, the body 26 has the same height dimension along the entire periphery of the side walls 26b (dimension H in the illustrated example). On the upper end portion of the entire periphery of the side walls 26b of the body 26 (in other words, the rim of the opening 30), a flange 26d is provided, which has a shape that widens toward the edge side. Also, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, in the center of the bottom surface 26a of the body 26, an opening 32 is formed, for guiding the inflator 20 inside the airbag 14.

In the center of the pressure ring 38, an opening 38a is formed for guiding the inflator 20 inside the airbag 14. Surrounding the opening 38a, a plurality of bolt holes (not illustrated) are provided, and a bolt 38b is inserted through each bolt hole (or the pressure ring 38 can be integrally equipped with bolts 38b). After the bolts 38b are inserted in the bolt holes 36 of the retainer 16 and the bolt holes 20c of the inflator 20 in that order, they are finally tightened by nuts 38c (refer also to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2B</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0003">3A and 3B</figref>).</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The passenger airbag apparatus 12 of the above configuration is affixed inside the instrument panel 10 (refer to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) by the bolts 38b and arm members 18.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref> are diagrams schematically illustrating an example of the manufacturing process of the retainer 16 by the extrusion molding technique.

Extrusion molding is a processing method by which products of the same shape are continuously molded by extruding a material having a long shape.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">That is, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9A</figref>, the prescribed metal sheet P0 which is the material for manufacturing the retainer 16 is sheared to the prescribed size by shearing. Subsequently, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9B</figref>, by performing drawing using a prescribed die on the metal sheet P0 that was sheared to the above-described prescribed size, a body 26 comprising the side walls 26b having a substantially rectangular frame shape and the bottom surface 26a having a substantially rectangular shape is formed. Furthermore, although not illustrated, the above-described opening 30 (refer to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>, etc.) is formed on the top side of the body 26 (in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIGS. 9</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0010">10</figref>, the bottom side of the body 26 is on top). By using the drawing process, the body 26 can be molded seamlessly into a box shape. Also, in the drawing process, at the same time, the above-described second ribs 26c and first ribs 28a are formed so as to be continuous, on predetermined portions<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> of the body 26 and on predetermined portions formed subsequently as the hooks 28.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10A</figref>, the periphery of the opening 30 of the body 26 formed as described above is shaped into a prescribed shape by trimming. As a result, a flange 26d is formed so as to be continuous with the upper end portion of the entire periphery of the side walls 26b (in other words, with the entire periphery of the opening 30), and the hooks 28 are also formed. Furthermore, at this time, the flange 26d does not have a shape which widens sufficiently on the edge side as described above, and the hooks 28 do not have a hook shape as described above. The body 26 and hooks 28 formed in this way are integrally constructed with substantially the same thickness.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10B</figref>, the flange 26d formed as described above is bent outward from the edge of the opening 30 of the body 26 by a bending process, and as a result, it is made into a shape which widens toward the edge side. Additionally, the hooks 28 formed as described above are bent to the outside of the side surface of the body 26 by a bending process, and as a result, they are made into a hook shape. Also, by drilling, an opening 32 is formed in the center of the bottom surface of the body 26, and a plurality of bolt holes 36 are formed surrounding this opening 32. Also, appropriately, if shaving or the like is performed, it results in the retainer 16 described by <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008">FIGS. 4-8</figref>, etc.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">According to the passenger airbag apparatus 12 of this embodiment configured as described above, the following advantages are obtained.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">That is, in this embodiment, the retainer 16 which houses the airbag 14 in the folded state is stored inside the instrument panel 10. The body 26 and hooks 28 are provided in this retainer 16, and this body 26 and hooks 28 are integrally constructed with substantially the same thickness by extrusion molding described above. As a result, the weight of the retainer 16 can be reduced, compared to the case where the body 26 is formed by connecting multiple separate members by welding and the hooks 28 are formed by connecting separate members with the body 26. Also, since welding is not required for connection, the strength of the retainer 16 can be increased, and the manufacturing process can be simplified and the cost reduced. Additionally, the strength of the hooks 28 can be increased by providing a first rib 28a on the hooks 28. As a result, the strength of the hooks 28 is not unsatisfactory even when they are integrally molded as described<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> above. Also, due to the fact that the body 26 and hooks 28 have the same thickness, the deviation in rigidity of the retainer 16 as a whole can be reduced, and the strength of the retainer 16 can be increased.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In addition, when the airbag 14 inflates and expands, stress operates such that the inflated airbag 14 spreads the body 26 from the inside toward the outside, and deformation of the opening 30 of the body 26 (so-called "fishmouth") may occur. In particular, the larger the height dimension of the body 26, the more easily it is affected by the stress, and the greater the tendency for fishmouth to occur.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In this embodiment, due to the fact that the body 26 and hooks 28 are integrally constructed with substantially the same thickness, the strength of the retainer 16 can be increased as described above, and in addition, the stress can be distributed when the airbag 14 inflates and expands, and fishmouth can be reduced. Also, by using the extrusion molding technique as described above, the body 26 can be molded such that the height dimension of the body 26 is small. Therefore, fishmouth when the airbag 14 expands can be further reduced. As a result, it is possible to avoid the problem that when an inflated and expanded airbag 14 is replaced with a new airbag, it is difficult to remove the retainer 16 which holds the inflated and expanded airbag 14 from inside the instrument panel, or it cannot be removed from inside the instrument panel 10 and the relevant instrument panel 10 itself must be replaced. Therefore, costs can be reduced.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Also, in this embodiment, in particular, the flange 26d can be provided so as to be continuous with the entire periphery of the opening 30 due to the fact that the flange 26d is provided on the upper end portion of the side walls 26b of the body 26 which is integrally constructed by extrusion molding as described above.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In addition, in this embodiment, in particular, the first ribs 28a of the hooks 28 extend along the direction of protrusion of the applicable hook 28. Also, the body 26 has second ribs 26c formed so as to be continuous with the first ribs 28a of the hooks 28. Thus, the strength of the retainer 16 can be further increased by providing this type of long, integrally-constructed ribs.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Additionally, in this embodiment, in particular, the body 26 has the same height dimension<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> along the entire periphery of the side walls 26b. As a result, the deviation in rigidity of the body 26 can be reduced.
