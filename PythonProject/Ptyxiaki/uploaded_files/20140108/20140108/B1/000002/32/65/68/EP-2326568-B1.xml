From the partially assembled position of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the first side flaps 22, 42 are folded inward causing the top end flap 12 to raise and the extension panels 62, 64 to fold inward at the oblique fold lines 72, 74 to partially close the first end 51 of the carton 5 (<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>). The extension panels 62, 64 are in generally face-to-face contact with portions of the top end flap 12 which has been raised by the inward<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> folding of the side and flaps 22, 42. The top end flap 12 is then folded downward at fold line 58 forcing the extension panels 62, 64 to be downwardly folded at fold lines 66, 68. In the downwardly folded position of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, the handle flap 131 is aligned with the curved cutouts 162, 164 (<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>). When lowered from the position of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, the top end flap 12 contacts the extension panels 62, 64 of the first side panels 22, 42 to fold the extension panels 62, 64 downward along the respective lateral fold lines 66, 68 so that the extension panels 62, 64 overlap a respective upper portion of each of the main panels 26, 46 between the lateral fold lines 66, 68 and the cutouts 162, 164 (<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>). The top panel 12 is then further folded downward and secured in the position shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> so that the handle flap 131 is aligned with the handle cutouts 162, 164. With the top end flap 12 lowered, the bottom end flap 32 is raised (<figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>) to further close the end 51 of the carton 5. In one embodiment, the exterior surface of the downwardly folded extension panels 62, 64 will typically be in opposing face-to-face contact with a portion of the exterior surface of the side end flaps 22, 42. Specifically, the portion of the exterior surface of the side end flaps 22, 42 that is in face-to-face contact with the exterior surface of the downwardly folded extension panels comprises a respective upper portion of the main panels 26, 46 below the fold lines 66, 68 and above the cutouts 162, 164. In one embodiment, at the closed end 51 of the carton a portion of the interior surface of the top end flap 12 is in face-to-face contact with the interior surface of the extension panels 62, 64 and a portion of the interior surface of the top end flap is in face-to-face contact with the exterior surface of the main panels 26, 46 of the side end flaps 22. The downwardly folded extension panels 62, 64 may be secured to the main panels 26, 46 of the side end flaps 22, 42 by adhesive such as glue. Also, the extension panels 62, 64 may be respectively secured to one or both of the top end flap 12 and a respective one of the side end flaps 22, 42. Further, the bottom end flap 32 can be secured to one or more of the top end flap 12, and side end flaps 22, 42.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The side end flaps 24, 44, top end flap 14, and bottom end flap 34 at the second end 53 of the carton 5 can be positioned in a similar manner as described above to close the second end of the carton. Alternatively, the end flaps 24, 44, 14, 34 can be alternatively shaped, arranged, and/or positioned without departing from the scope of the disclosure.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The handle 11 may be used to grasp the carton 5 by pressing against the elongate handle flap 131 to create the handle opening 170 (<figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>) in the closed end 51 of the carton 5. The downwardly folded extension panels 62, 64 of the side end flaps 22, 42 provides an extra layer of material above the handle 11 to reinforce the carton 5 when the carton is lifted at the handle. In the area above the handle 11, the carton 5 has four layers of material (e.g., side end flaps 22, 42, extension panels 62, 64, top end flap 12, and the inwardly folded flap 131) above the handle opening 170 to increase the strength of the carton in the area of the handle. The second handle 13 is similar to the handle 11 and is for grasping at the second end (not shown) of the carton in a similar manner as the first handle. The handle 11 is shaped and positioned in the carton so that multiple fingers of a user may be placed through the handle opening 170 in the overlapped top end panel 12 and first side panels 22, 42 and the thumb of a user may be placed on the top panel 10 for grasping and lifting the carton 5 The extension panels 62, 64 increases the strength and rigidity of the carton 5 in the area above the handle 11 to prevent the carton from tearing or otherwise failing when lifted. As illustrated, the extension panels 62, 64, side end flaps 22, 42, and top end flap 12 together form a reinforced region above the handle 11 that has a thickness of three-ply's of material.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The blank 3 according to the present disclosure can be, for example, formed from coated paperboard and similar materials. For example, the interior and/or exterior sides of the blank 3 can be coated with a clay coating. The clay coating may then be printed over with product, advertising, price coding, and other information or images. The blank 3 may then be coated with a varnish to protect any information printed on the blank. The blank 3 may also be coated with, for example, a moisture barrier layer, on either or both sides of the blank. In accordance with the above-described embodiments, the blank 3 may be constructed of paperboard of a caliper such that it is heavier and more rigid than ordinary paper. The blank 3 can also be constructed of other materials, such as cardboard, hard paper, or any other material having properties suitable for enabling the carton 5 to function at least generally as described herein. The blank 3 can also be laminated or coated with one or more sheet-like materials at selected panels or panel sections.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In accordance with the above-described embodiments of the present disclosure, a fold line can be any substantially linear, although not necessarily straight, form of weakening that facilitates folding therealong. More specifically, but not for the purpose of narrowing the scope of the present disclosure, fold lines include: a score line, such as lines formed with a blunt scoring knife, or the like, which creates a crushed portion in the material along the desired line of weakness; a cut that extends partially into a material along the desired line of weakness, and/or a series of cuts that extend partially into and/or completely through the material along the desired line of weakness; and various combinations of these features.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As an example, a tear line can include: a slit that extends partially into the material along the desired line of weakness, and/or a series of spaced apart slits that extend partially into and/or completely through the material along the desired line of weakness, or various combinations of these features. As a more specific example, one type tear line is in the form of a series of spaced apart slits that extend completely through the material, with adjacent slits being spaced apart slightly so that a nick (e.g., a small somewhat bridging-like piece of the material) is defined between the adjacent slits for typically temporarily connecting the material across the tear line. The nicks are broken during tearing along the tear line. The nicks typically are a relatively small percentage of the tear line, and alternatively the nicks can be omitted from or torn in a tear line such that the tear line is a continuous cut line. That is, it is within the scope of the present disclosure for each of the tear lines to be replaced with a continuous slit, or the like. For example, a cut line can be a continuous slit or could be wider than a slit without departing from the present disclosure.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The above embodiments may be described as having one or more panels adhered together by glue during erection of the carton embodiments.
