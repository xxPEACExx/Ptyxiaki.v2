proposes a particular Hybrid Riser Tower (HRT) consisting of an empty central core, supporting a bundle of (usually rigid) riser pipes, some used for oil production some used for injection of water, gas and/or other fluids, some others for oil and gas export. This type of tower has been developed and deployed for example in the Girassol field off Angola. Further background has been published in paper "Hybrid Riser Tower: from Functional Specification to Cost per Unit Length" by J-F Saint-Marcoux and M Rochereau, DOT XIII Rio de Janeiro, 18 October 2001. Updated versions of such risers have been proposed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO02053869A1"><text>WO 02/053869 A1</text></patcit>. The contents of all these documents are incorporated herein by reference, as background to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">At present, Hybrid Riser Tower structures need to be fabricated close to the installation site, as the towing of an assembled Hybrid Riser Tower over significant distances carries with it many risks. In particular the surface waves and currents may result in significant fatigue and damage to the structure. Also, the simple act of transporting such a large structure proposes great logistical difficulties.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As a result of this, it is necessary to have a fabrication yard close to the installation site. Furthermore, the fabrication yard also requires a site having a long sheltered body of water directly in line with it, so that the Hybrid Riser Tower structure can be progressively fabricated and assembled. Such a suitable location is generally difficult to find.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">British Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="GB1375969A"><text>1375969</text></patcit> discloses an arrangement for fabrication of an offshore structure.

Said welding chamber may be provided with a plurality of guide means, each providing a guide for one of the elongate elements of the riser tower structure. Preferably there are two groups of such guide means, provided on opposite sides of said welding chamber, such that when two sections of riser tower structure that are to be welded together are each introduced into the welding chamber via one of the groups of guide means, the corresponding elongate elements of each section are substantially aligned for welding. Preferably, each of said guide means provides a watertight opening into said welding chamber when said elongate element is in place. The groups of guide means may be replaceable and specifically chosen to correspond with the riser tower structure's cross sectional dimensions. Each of said groups of guide means may be provided on a door of said welding chamber.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Said assembly of sections of riser tower structure may be undertaken with said welding chamber floating on the sea surface. Ballasting tanks may be provided to selectively ballast the welding chamber accordingly.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">An alignment frame may be used for fine alignment of the two sections to be connected.

These are located in an oil field on the seabed 110.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Vertical riser towers are provided at 112 and 114, for conveying production fluids to the surface, and for conveying lifting gas, injection water and treatment chemicals such as methanol from the surface to the seabed. The foot of each riser, 112, 114, is connected to a number of well heads/injection sites 100 to 108 by horizontal pipelines 116 etc.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Further pipelines 118, 120 may link to other well sites at a remote part of the seabed. At the sea surface 122, the top of each riser tower is supported by a buoy 124, 126. These towers are pre-fabricated at shore facilities, towed to their operating location and then installed to the seabed with anchors at the bottom and buoyancy at the top.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A floating production unit (FPU) 128 is moored by means not shown, or otherwise held in place at the surface. FPU 128 provides production facilities, storage and accommodation for the fluids from and to the wells 100 to 108. FPU 128 is connected to the risers by flexible flow lines 132 etc. arranged in a catenary configuration, for the transfer of fluids between the FPU and the seabed, via riser towers 112 and 114.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Individual pipelines may be required not only for hydrocarbons produced from the seabed wells, but also for various auxiliary fluids, which assist in the production and/or maintenance of the seabed installation. For the sake of convenience, a number of pipelines carrying either the same or a number of different types of fluid are grouped in "bundles", and the riser towers 112, and 114 in this embodiment comprise each one a bundle of conduits for production fluids, lifting gas, water and gas injection, oil and gas export, and treatment chemicals, e.g. methanol. All the component conduits of each bundle are arranged around a central core, and are held in place relative to each other (in the two lateral dimensions, longitudinal<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> movement not being prevented) by guide frames attached to the central core.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Individual sections of riser tower structures, or bundles are fabricated such that individual sections of pipe, umbilicals, etc. are made and arranged around similar length sections of central core, the pipes and umbilicals being held in place around the core by one or more guide frames. As such, each bundle section is simply a short version of the whole riser structure, having the same cross section, such that the whole riser tower structure can be assembled by assembling together similar bundle sections, end on end (The top and bottom bundle sections will differ slightly in that they will have provisions for attachment to a top buoyancy module or anchor, as appropriate). This assembly is conventionally done as each section is fabricated, each section then being attached to the main riser tower structure extending out from the fabrication yard towards the nearby installation site.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Unlike conventional methods, the method describes herein separates the fabrication step and section assembly step. This allows the fabrication to take place anywhere in the world, remote from the installation site. The actual fabrication of each section differs little from present and therefore no further description of this step is necessary. However, instead of assembling together each section as it is fabricated, each section is simply stored until ready to be transported to the installation site. Eventually, the fabricated bundle sections are transported by any suitable heavy cargo vessel to the installation site.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">It is at, or near, the installation site, that the individual bundle sections are assembled together to make the complete riser tower structure. In order<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> to do this, a floating welding chamber, or cofferdam, is provided to connect together each section.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> shows the cofferdam 200 with its alignment frame 210. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> shows an exploded view of the same cofferdam 200, without the alignment frame 210. The cofferdam comprises a chamber 220 formed from walls 230 floor 240 and doors 250. Each door 250, has a plurality of openings 260 each opening 260 providing an entry into the cofferdam 200 for of the ends of the elongate elements (pipe, umbilical and central core) that make up each section of the riser tower structure. Ballast tanks 270 are also provided to selectively ballast the cofferdam as required. The openings 260 are grouped on a hub inset 265 in such a way as to match the cross sectional profile of the riser bundle sections. Accordingly these hub insets 265 are removable and replaceable, and will be manufactured for specific bundle designs.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Also shown (on <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>) are holding means 280 for holding the guide frames which form part of each bundle section, when the pipes etc. are introduced into the cofferdam; and an alignment frame 210 which include claws 290 for gripping the core pipe of the two sections and precisely aligning them together for welding.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As the chamber 220 is designed to float on the sea surface the top of the chamber can remain open. Therefore it can be seen that the alignment frame 210 can be lowered into the chamber from above, as required, as can any other tool.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> shows the cofferdam 200 from above, with one of the sections of the riser tower 300a being introduced into the welding chamber 220. As you can see the holding means 280 interacts with one of the guide frames<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> 310 of the riser tower structure so as to hold the section 300a into position for introduction into the chamber 220. The guide frame is then able to slide along the holding means 280, along the core pipe's axis, as the core pipe 320 and then the other individual pipes/umbilicals 330, are introduced through the openings 260.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Also shown is another section of the riser tower structure, 300b, being lined up such that its guide frame 310 will be held by the holding means 280 on the other side of the chamber 200.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 5a</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">5b</figref> show the two riser tower sections 300a, 300b having both been introduced into the welding chamber 220. The seals around each individual pipe 330 and core 320 etc. have been made watertight and the welding area 220 has been de-watered.
