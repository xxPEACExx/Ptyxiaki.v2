load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><u>Field of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to the field of electronically controlled valves which are suitable for regulating the flow of fluid between a manifold and a working chamber of a fluid-working machine. The invention is applicable to fluid-working machines which have a rotating shaft, including but not limited to a crankshaft.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Background to the invention</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">It is known to provide fluid-working machines, such as pumps, motors and machines which operate as either a pump or a motor, which Include a rotating shaft and one or more working chambers which are in mechanical communication with the rotating shaft such that their volume varies cyclically with rotation of the shaft, In which the flow of fluid between the working chambers and one or more manifolds is regulated by electronically controlled valves. Such fluid working machines comprise at least one rotary to linear motion linking mechanism such as an eccentric cam, wobble plate or hollow cam, including separable hollow cams.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, fluid-working machines are known which comprise a crankshaft and a plurality of working chambers of cyclically varying volume, in which the displacement of fluid through the working chambers is regulated by electronically controllable valves, on a cycle by cycle basis and in phased relationship to cycles of working<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> chamber volume, to determine the net throughput of fluid through the machine. For example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP0361927A"><text>EP 0 361 927</text></patcit> disclosed a method of controlling the net throughput of fluid through a multi-chamber pump by opening and/or closing electronically controllable poppet valves, in phased relationship to cycles of working chamber volume, to regulate fluid communication between individual working chambers of the pump and a low pressure manifold. As a result, individual chambers are selectable by a controller, on a cycle by cycle basis, to either displace a predetermined fixed volume of fluid or to undergo an idle cycle with no net displacement of fluid, thereby enabling the net throughput of the pump to be matched dynamically to demand. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP0494236A"><text>EP 0 494 236</text></patcit>, which represents the closest prior art, developed this principle and included electronically controllable poppet valves which regulate fluid communication between individual working chambers and a high pressure manifold, thereby facilitating the provision of a fluid-working machine which functions as a motor or which functions as either a pump or a motor in alternative operating modes. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP1537333A"><text>EP 1 537 333</text></patcit> introduced the possibility of part cycles, allowing individual cycles of individual working chambers to displace any of a plurality of different volumes of fluid to better match demand. Instead of dedicated high pressure and low pressure ports, a fluid working machine may have interchangeable ports, for example, as disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6651545B"><text>US 6,651,545</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Fluid-working machines of this type require rapidly opening and closing electronically controllable valves capable of regulating the flow of fluid into and out of a working chamber from the low pressure manifold, and in some embodiments, the high pressure manifold. The electronically controllable valves are typically actively controlled, for example, actively opened, actively closed, or actively held open or closed against a pressure differential, under the active control of the controller. Although all opening or closing of an actively controlled valve may be under the active control of a controller, it is usually preferable for at least some opening or closing of the actively controlled valves to be passive. For example, the actively controlled low pressure valve disclosed in the fluid-working machines described above may open passively when the pressure in a working chamber falls below the pressure of the low pressure manifold, but be optionally actively held open to create an idle cycle or actively closed during a motoring cycle, just before top dead centre, to build up sufficient pressure within the working chamber to enable the high pressure valve to open.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The active control can consume a significant amount of electrical power. In the type of fluid-working machine described above, actively controlled opening or closing of a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> valve requires the valve member, which has a significant mass, to be moved between a first position and a second position in a very short period of time, for example, a few milliseconds, which can consume a significant amount of energy.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Thus, the invention aims to provide electronically controlled valves and fluid-working machines including electronically controlled valves which consume less electrical energy than would otherwise be the case, thereby providing fluid-working machines which are, as a whole, more energy efficient and easier to control.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the present invention, this is achieved by receiving energy from a fluid-working machine crankshaft and using the energy received from the crankshaft to provide a valve member moving force to urge the valve member from the first position to the second position. A difficulty with the implementation of this strategy is that, in some embodiments, the availability of energy from the crankshaft does not coincide with the time when the valve member is to be urged from the first position to the second position. Accordingly, some embodiments of the invention address the further problem of the difference in timing between availability of energy from the crankshaft and the requirement for this energy.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a pump, motor, or pump-motor, comprising a working chamber of cyclically varying volume, a manifold and a rotatable shaft, the working chamber being coupled to the rotatable shaft so that the volume of the working chamber varies cyclically with rotation of the rotatable shaft, an electronically controlled valve arranged to regulate fluid flow between said working chamber and said manifold,<br/>
wherein said electronically controlled valve comprises a valve body, a valve member moveable between a first position and a second position, wherein one of the first position and the second position is a position in which the valve is open and the other is a position in which the valve is closed, and wherein the electronically controlled valve is controlled to determine whether the valve member moves from the first position to the second position during a given period of time, wherein the electronically controlled valve is characterised by a valve member moving mechanism operable to receive energy discontinuously from a reciprocator coupled to the rotatable shaft to provide a valve member moving force to urge the valve member from the first position to the second position using the received energy, the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> valve member moving mechanism being operable to store energy received from the rotatable shaft and to use said stored energy to provide the valve member moving force.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Thus, energy from the rotation of the rotatable shaft, received discontinuously from a reciprocator coupled to the rotatable shaft, is used to urge the valve member from the first position to the second position. This is typically more energy efficient than, for example, moving the valve member using only a solenoid, particularly where it is necessary to move the valve member against a substantial pressure difference or very rapidly. However, as the valve is electronically controlled, the valve retains some or all of the controllability of valves in which the valve member is moveable from a corresponding first position to a corresponding second position only by the action of a solenoid.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">By a rotatable shaft we refer to a shaft which rotates during operation of the fluid working machine, the working chamber being coupled to the rotatable shaft so that the volume of the working chamber varies cyclically with rotation of the rotatable shaft in use. The rotatable shaft may be a crankshaft. The rotatable shaft may, for example, be coupled to the reciprocator by way of an eccentric cam, wobble plate or hollow cam, including a hollow cam having a roller cam follower.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The valve member moving mechanism is also operable to store energy received from a rotatable shaft of fluid-working machine by way of the reciprocator and to use said stored energy to provide the valve member moving force to urge the valve member from the first position to the second position. Thus, energy received discontinuously from the rotation of the rotatable shaft is stored and then used to urge the valve member from the first position to the second position. This allows the time of the movement of the valve from the first position to the second position to be controlled relative to the phase of rotatable shaft rotation. This addresses the problem that, otherwise, the availability of energy from the rotatable shaft may not coincide with the time when the valve is to be urged from the first position to the second position using energy received from the rotatable shaft.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Typically, the valve member moving mechanism comprises or consists of a first resilient component arranged to store energy received from the rotatable shaft of the fluid-working machine as elastic potential energy and to provide the valve member moving force using said stored elastic potential energy. The or each resilient<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> component is typically an elastic member, for example, a spring. However, the resilient component may, for example, include a compressible fluid within a rigid body, for example a cylinder, or within a deformable body.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Elastic potential energy may be stored by compression or extension of the first resilient member, or both compression and extension, for example in embodiments where the first resilient component is an elastic member which is flexed in use.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Typically, energy received discontinuously from the reciprocator is received periodically. The reciprocator typically moves cyclically. The said reciprocator may be coupled to the rotatable shaft to reciprocate with rotation of the rotatable shaft and thereby provide a periodic source of energy to the valve member moving mechanism.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The valve member moving mechanism may be operable to receive energy discontinuously (e.g. periodically) from the reciprocator during each cycle of reciprocator movement in which the valve is in a specific state, for example cycles in which the valve is closed or in which the valve is open. The valve member moving mechanism may be operable to receive energy discontinuously (e.g. periodically) from the reciprocator at least during each cycle of reciprocator movement during which energy is not stored by the first resilient component which is sufficient to provide the valve member moving force using said stored elastic potential energy. The valve member moving mechanism may be operable to receive energy from the reciprocator during each cycle of reciprocator movement. The cycles of reciprocator movement typically have the same period as a rotation of the rotatable shaft although alternative arrangements to drive a reciprocator at an integer multiple of the frequency of a rotatable shaft are known, such as a ring cam.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Typically, the electronically controllable valve is controllable to determine whether the valve member moves from the first position to the second position during a given period of time. For example, the electronically controllable valve may be controllable by a controller on a cycle by cycle basis to determine whether the valve member moves from the first position to the second position during a given period of time. It may be that the electronically controllable valve is controllable by a controller on a cycle by cycle basis to determine the time-averaged displacement of fluid between a low pressure manifold and a high pressure manifold of a fluid working machine. The electronically controllable valve may be controllable to determine when the valve member moves from the first position to the second position during a given period of<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> time. However, it may be that when the valve member moves from the first position to the second position during a given period of time depends on factors such as the pressure difference across or flow past the valve member. Where the electronically controllable valve is provided in a fluid-working machine, the said given period of time typically corresponds to a particular cycle of working chamber volume, which typically coincides with an entire rotation of the rotatable shaft or an integer fraction of an entire rotation of the rotatable shaft. Typically, the reciprocator moves cyclically backwards and forwards and said given period of time corresponds with the period of a cycle of movement of the reciprocator.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Preferably, the electronically controlled valve further comprises an electronically controllable latch which is engageable when the valve member is in the first position. The electronically controllable latch is typically disengageable (and in some embodiments engageable) under the control of a fluid-working machine controller.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The electronically controllable latch may facilitate the storage of energy, for example, by retaining the valve member in a first position after a resilient component stores elastic potential energy. Importantly, engaging and disengaging a latch typically consumes very little energy. Furthermore, in contrast to solenoid actuated valves in which coil rise time limits the speed of operation, latches can typically be disengaged very quickly, minimising latency.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The electronically controllable latch may be operable on the valve member to prevent the valve member moving from the first position to the second position while the electronically controllable latch is engaged. However, the electronically controllable latch may be operable on the valve member moving mechanism to prevent the valve member moving mechanism from applying the valve member moving force to the valve member, or to reduce the magnitude of the valve member moving force, while the latch is engaged. Thus, when engaged, the latch may prevent a movement which could otherwise occur during at least one portion of the rotation of a rotatable shaft.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The latch may comprise an electromagnet which retains the valve member or which retains the valve member moving mechanism. The electronically controllable latch may comprise a permanent magnet operable to retain the valve member, or the valve member moving mechanism, when the valve member is in the first position, and an electromagnet operable to provide a force to overcome the attractive force of the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> permanent magnet to disengage the latch, or to provide an opposing magnetic field that reduces or eliminates the attractive force of the electromagnet.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In some embodiments, the valve member is biased from the first position to the second position by the first elastic member, and the electronically controllable latch (and, where relevant, the power supply to the electronically controllable latch) is capable of providing sufficient force to retain the valve member in the first position but not sufficient force to move the valve member from the second position to the first position against the first resilient component. Thus, much less electrical energy may be required to retain the valve member in the first position than would be required to move the valve member from the second position to the first position simply using an electromagnet.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The reciprocator and the valve member may be resiliently coupled through the first resilient component. The rotatable shaft may be a crankshaft comprising a crankshaft eccentric and the reciprocator may reciprocate with movement of the crankshaft eccentric. The reciprocator may be slidably mounted on or to the rotatable shaft (for example, slidably mounted on a crankshaft eccentric). The reciprocator may comprise a pushrod. The reciprocator may in part define the working chamber. For example, the reciprocator may be a piston, or part thereof which in part defines the working chamber.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The valve member may be resiliently coupled to the reciprocator through the first resilient component. The reciprocator may be a part, for example, an end, of the first resilient component.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The valve, or a fluid working machine to which the valve is connected, may comprise phase altering means to cause the phase of the energy received discontinuously from the reciprocator to be different to the phase of cycles of working chamber volume.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Thus, the reciprocator may reciprocate with a different phase to cycles of working chamber volume. The coupling between the reciprocator and the valve moving mechanism may comprise phase altering means.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">It may be that cycles of working chamber volume and the reciprocator are driven by the rotatable shaft with different phases. For example, it may be that the rotatable shaft is a crankshaft comprising a first crankshaft eccentric which determines cycles<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> of working chamber volume (for example, which drives a reciprocating piston which forms part of a piston cylinder working chamber), and a second crankshaft eccentric which is angularly displaced from the first crankshaft eccentric and the reciprocator may be coupled to the second crankshaft eccentric. This provides an alternative or additional mechanism to allow for a time difference between the availability of energy from crankshaft eccentric which determines cycles of working chamber volume and the requirement for that energy to urge the valve member from the first position to the second position.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The first resilient component may extend between the valve body and the valve member. The first resilient component may extend between the reciprocator and the valve member. The valve member moving mechanism may comprise a valve moving member and the first resilient component. The first resilient component may extend between the valve moving member and the reciprocator. The first resilient component may extend between the valve moving member and the valve body.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">It may be that the first resilient component extends between the valve body and a valve moving member and the first resilient component is operable to provide the valve member moving force by exerting a force on the valve moving member so as to cause the valve moving member to exert the valve member moving force on the valve member, the valve further comprising a coupling (for example, a mechanical linkage) between the reciprocator and the valve moving member to store energy from the rotatable shaft as elastic potential energy in the first resilient component. Energy may be stored in the first resilient component independently of movement of the valve moving member or as a result of movement of the valve moving member from the second position to the first position.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The electronically controlled valve may further comprise an electronically controllable latch which is engageable to retain the valve moving member to prevent the valve moving member from providing the valve member moving force until the latch is released.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The electronically controlled valve may further comprise a second resilient component (for example, a second elastic member) operable to bias the valve member from the second position to the first position, or to bias the valve moving member to a position which enables the valve member to move from the second position to the first position. A coupling (for example a mechanical linkage) between<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the reciprocator and the valve moving member may store energy from the rotatable shaft as elastic potential energy in both the first resilient component and the second resilient component. In some embodiments, this enables the second resilient component to urge the valve moving member away from the valve member, to enable the valve member to move to the first position, prior to movement of the valve member from the first position to the second position. The second resilient component may extend between the valve body and the valve member. The second resilient component may extend between the valve body and the valve moving member. The second resilient component may extend between the valve moving member and the valve member.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In some embodiments, the first and second resilient components are different regions of the same component, such as different regions of the same elastic member. For example, the first resilient component may be the radially inward portion of a flat spring and the second resilient component may be the radially outward portion of the same flat spring, with the valve member attached to the flat spring between the first and second resilient components.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The reciprocator may comprise or be coupled to (for example by way of a mechanical linkage) a disengageable valve moving coupling operable to engage with the valve member to move the valve member from the second position to the first position and to subsequently disengage from the valve member to enable the valve member to move from the first position to the second position. The disengageable valve moving coupling may engage with a valve moving member, which may in turn engage with the valve member.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The reciprocator may comprise, or be mechanically linked to, a disengageable valve moving coupling which pulls the valve member in the same direction as the reciprocator (for example, to open the valve) when the reciprocator moves in one direction (for example, towards the rotatable shaft).

The net throughput of fluid is determined by the active control of electronically controllable valves, in phased relationship to cycles of working chamber volume, to regulate fluid communication between individual working chambers of the machine and fluid<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> manifolds. Individual chambers are selectable by a controller, on a cycle by cycle basis, to either displace one of a number of predetermined volumes of fluid, including an infinite number of predetermined volumes of fluid, or to undergo an idle cycle with no net displacement of fluid, thereby enabling the net throughput of the pump to be matched dynamically to demand.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, an individual working chamber 2 has a volume defined by the interior surface of a cylinder 4 and a piston 6, functioning as the reciprocator, which is driven from a crankshaft 8 by a crank mechanism 9 and which reciprocates within the cylinder to cyclically vary the volume of the working chamber. A shaft position and speed sensor 10 determines the instantaneous angular position and speed of rotation of the shaft, and transmits shaft position and speed signals to a controller 12, which enables the controller to determine the instantaneous phase of the cycles of each individual working chamber. The controller is typically a microprocessor or microcontroller which executes a stored program in use.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The working chamber comprises an actively controlled low pressure valve in the form of an electronically controllable face-sealing poppet valve 14, which faces inwards toward the working chamber and is operable to selectively seal off a channel extending from the working chamber to a low pressure manifold 16. The working chamber further comprises a high pressure valve 18. The high pressure valve faces outwards from the working chamber and is operable to seal off a channel extending from the working chamber to a high pressure manifold 20.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">At least the low pressure valve is actively controlled so that the controller can determine whether the lower pressure valve is actively opened, or in some embodiments, actively held open, during each cycle of working chamber volume. In some embodiments, the high pressure valve is actively controlled and in some embodiments, the high pressure valve is a passively controlled valve, for example, a pressure delivery check valve. The fluid-working machine may be a pump, which carries out pumping cycles, or a motor which carries out motoring cycles, or a pump-motor which can operate as a pump or a motor in alternative operating modes and can thereby carry out pumping or motoring cycles.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">A full stroke pumping cycle is described in <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="EP0361927A"><text>EP 0 361 927</text></patcit>. During an expansion stoke of a working chamber, the low pressure valve is open and hydraulic fluid is received from the low pressure manifold. At or around bottom dead centre, the controller<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> determines whether or not the low pressure valve should be closed. If the low pressure valve is closed, fluid within the working chamber is pressurised and vented to the high pressure valve during the subsequent contraction phase of working chamber volume, so that a pumping cycle occurs and a volume of fluid is displaced to the high pressure manifold. The low pressure valve then opens again at or shortly after top dead centre. If the low pressure valve remains open, fluid within the working chamber is vented back to the low pressure valve and an idle cycle occurs, in which there is no net displacement of fluid to the high pressure manifold.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">In some embodiments, the low pressure valve will be biased open and will need to be actively closed by the controller if a pumping cycle is selected. In other embodiments, the low pressure valve will be biased closed and will need to be actively held open by the controller if an idle cycle is selected.

During a contraction stroke, fluid is vented to the low pressure manifold through the low pressure valve. An idle cycle can be selected by the controller in which case the low pressure valve remains open. However, if a full stroke motoring cycle is selected, the low pressure valve is closed before top dead centre, causing pressure to build up within the working chamber as it continues to reduce in volume. Once sufficient pressure has been built up, the high pressure valve can be opened, typically just after top dead centre, and fluid flows into the working chamber from the high pressure manifold. Shortly before bottom dead centre, the high pressure valve is actively closed, whereupon pressure within the working chamber falls, enabling the low pressure valve to open around or shortly after bottom dead centre.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">In some embodiments, the low pressure valve will be biased open and will need to be actively closed by the controller if a motoring cycle is selected. In other embodiments, the low pressure valve will be biased closed and will need to be actively held open by the controller if an idle cycle is selected. Although the low pressure valve could potentially open passively, it typically opens under active control to enable the timing of opening to be carefully controlled. Thus, the low pressure valve may be actively opened, or, if it has been actively held open this active holding open may be stopped. As the low pressure valve typically has to open against a significant pressure difference, opening is typically active. The high pressure valve<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> may be actively or passively opened. Typically, the high pressure valve will be actively closed.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">In some embodiments, instead of selecting only between idle cycles and full stroke pumping and/or motoring cycles, the fluid-working controller is also operable to vary the precise phasing of valve timings to create partial stroke pumping and/or partial stroke motoring cycles.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">In a partial stroke pumping cycle, the low pressure valve is closed later in the exhaust stroke so that only a part of the maximum stroke volume of the working chamber is displaced into the high pressure manifold. Typically, closure of the low pressure valve is delayed until just before top dead centre.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">In a partial stroke motoring cycle, the high pressure valve is closed and the low pressure valve opened part way through the expansion stroke so that the volume of fluid received from the high pressure manifold and thus the net displacement of fluid is less than would otherwise be possible.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">In each type of pumping or motoring stroke, energy is consumed in either actively opening, or actively closing, or actively holding open or closed one or both of the low pressure valve and the high pressure valve. In known valves this energy is provided by electromagnets. Energy consumption can be especially high during partial pumping or motoring strokes as, in each case, a valve must be closed rapidly whilst fluid is flowing through the valve. In a partial pumping stroke, the low pressure valve is closed while fluid is flowing out through the low pressure valve at a high velocity. In a partial motoring stroke, the high pressure valve must be closed while fluid is flowing through the high pressure valve at a high velocity.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">The invention is particularly applicable where movement of the valve member from the first position to the second position is to occur when fluid is flowing past the valve member in a direction which is generally opposite the direction in which the valve member moves from the first position to the second position. More energy is typically required to move valve members in these circumstances as the flow of fluid past the valve member exerts forces on the valve member in the direction of fluid flow.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">The precise timing of the opening and/or closing of the primary low pressure valve and the high pressure valve may also be varied in specific circumstances, such as<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> start-up, operation while still relatively cold, and shut down of the device.

The axially slidable rod exerts a valve moving force on the poppet valve, by virtue of the elastic potential energy stored in the closing spring and the action of the flange on the poppet, to cause the poppet valve to move from the first position to the second position.

The flat spring has substantial fluid passages therethrough. The axially slideable rod has a radially extending flange 327, having an inner surface 321 and an outer surface 329 at a second end, and an axial bore 323 providing a path for fluid to flow between a working chamber and an inner chamber 325. The axially slidable rod is slidable on outer and inner bearings 322, 324 between a first position (shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4C</figref>) and a second position in which the rod is displaced inwards (upwards in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4B</figref>).

The outer bearing 322 of non-magnetic material isolates an electromagnet coil 332 from hydraulic fluid within the valve, and joins the valve body to a cap 334 which holds the valve in place through thread 336 which screws into the steel body of the fluid working machine 338.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">In operation, the poppet is held open by the opening spring region providing an opening force exceeding the closing force provided by the closing spring region.

High pressure fluid in the inner chamber acts on the inner surface of the axially slidable rod, but the inner and outer bearings restrict the flow of high pressure fluid into the restricted flow region. Thus, the pressure acting on the inner surface of the axially slidable rod flange exceeds the pressure acting on the outer surface, creating a net outwards force on the axially slidable rod. Any high pressure fluid leaking past the bearings into the restricted flow region can exit through the drain channel to the low pressure manifold. Thus, the axially slidable rod moves outwards until it seats in the first position, at which point the controller engages the electromagnet to latch the axially slidable rod in the first position after the working chamber pressure falls. During this movement, energy received discontinuously from the reciprocating movement of the piston, driven by the crankshaft, by way of the compression of fluid within the working chamber, is stored.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">Now that the axially slidable rod is returned to its first position (<figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4C</figref>), the opening spring region provides a greater opening force on the poppet than the closing force provided by the closing spring, thereby providing a net outwards force that will open the valve (i.e. move the poppet to its first position) when the working chamber pressure falls as the working chamber expands past top dead centre.</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">In the present embodiment the fluid flow that resets the axially slidable rod into the first position passes through the centre of the valve on the upstroke of the working chamber to which the valve is associated.

For example, in a pumping cycle of a radial piston pump, force from the crankshaft is available during the contraction stroke of each working chamber. A spring compressed by this movement would have a peak of stored energy, and peak available force, at top dead centre.

As the arms and/or detents are resilient, the detents may disengage from the poppet as the piston moves towards bottom dead centre. While the poppet is dragged from the closed position to the open position, the armature is brought into contact with the valve body, where it seats and is latched in place by magnetic flux from the electromagnet.
