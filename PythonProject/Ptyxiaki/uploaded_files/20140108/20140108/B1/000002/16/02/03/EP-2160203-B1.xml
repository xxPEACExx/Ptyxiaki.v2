In particular the present invention relates to a UV steriliser for oral appliances.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background of the invention</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In this specification where a document, act or item of knowledge is referred to or discussed, this reference or discussion is not an admission that the document, act or item of knowledge or any combination thereof was at the priority date, publicly available, known to the public, part of common general knowledge; or known to be relevant to an attempt to solve any problem with which this specification is concerned.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">While the following specification is directed to sterilisation of pacifiers or teats, the skilled person will appreciate that the invention is not so limited but includes other types of oral appliances such as mouthguards, orthodontic retainers and dentures.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Ultraviolet (<b><i>UV</i></b>) light refers to all electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the range of 10 to 400 nanometres, or frequencies from 7.5E14 to 3E16 Hz. UV light is often used for sterilisation both in large scale industrial applications and in smaller, commercial and domestic applications. It is particularly effective for control of microorganisms such as bacteria, moulds, fungi and viruses which are readily made airborne and settle on exposed surfaces where they rapidly multiply.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In order to inactivate or kill microorganisms, UV light must actually strike the microorganism. UV energy penetrates the outer cell membrane, passes through the cell body, and disrupts its DNA, preventing reproduction of the microorganism. Depending on its wavelength, UV light may also interact with oxygen and other species to create ozone, a radical molecule that attacks and destroys microorganisms, and in the process breaks down to harmless oxygen.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In domestic applications UV has been used in applications such as toothbrush sterilisation. For example the Orasafe™ toothbrush sterilizer uses a UV/ozone lamp to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> eliminate up to 99.99% of germs from toothbrushes, which helps to address problems such as tooth decay, gum disease and halitosis. The Orasafe™ device comprises a rectangular, hinged lid box into which a toothbrush is placed with the bristles adjacent a UV lamp. The UV lamp is activated by closing the hinged lid. The UV lamp emits a specific range of UV radiation which kills the microorganisms or damages their DNA so that they cannot reproduce.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">UV has also been used to sterilise pacifiers and teats. A pacifier (as it is called in the USA) is also known as a 'dummy' in the UK, New Zealand and Australia or a 'soother' in Canada and Ireland and consists of a rubber or plastic nipple that is given to an infant or young child to suck upon. A teat is a rubber or plastic nipples that are attached to bottles for feeding babies.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Korean company Esenscia provides the 'Pacifier Steriliser™' product which comprises a small essentially rectangular container having a hinged door which encloses a space in which pacifier can be located. The UV source is activated by a switch.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The Orasafe™ 'portable teat steriliser' is a UV device that can be attached to a feeding bottle. By turning a switch on the steriliser the UV source is activated, and automatically turns off in approximately 5 minutes after sterilisation is complete. The pacifier has a mostly transparent body.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In another pacifier steriliser product, The Ultra-Clean Pacifier Sterilizer from UV Solutions comprises a container into which the pacifier is fitted until it 'clicks into place' to close off one end of the sterilizer.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Some of the UV sterilisers of the prior art suffer from drawbacks such as the potential for the dummy or steriliser to fall or be knocked out of the device during use. Furthermore many dummy sterilisers of the prior art are not sufficiently robust to be tossed into a handbag or tote bag whilst in use.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the invention</b></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention provides a UV steriliser for oral appliances as defined in claim 1.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Typically the oral appliance is a pacifier, teat, oral prosthetic (such as a full or partial denture), mouthguard or oral orthotic (such as an orthodontic retainer). In a particularly preferred embodiment the oral appliance is a pacifier or a teat.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In a preferred embodiment, the appliance holder is adapted to hold the oral appliance by interference fit, so that the oral appliance may be manually inserted and removed. This could be achieved for example, by having a recess corresponding closely to the shape of the oral appliance or alternatively, a recess lined or bordered with soft material that elastically deforms to the shape of the oral appliance. The latter arrangement is particularly preferred because it allows oral appliances of different shapes and conformations to be located in a single appliance holder.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The lid of the UV steriliser may also be adapted to cooperate with the appliance holder and secure the oral appliance so that it is not displaced if the UV steriliser is moved. Preferably the oral appliance is held so securely in the appliance holder that the UV steriliser can, for example, be thrown into a handbag or tote bag and treated quite roughly, yet the oral appliance remains in place adjacent the UV source. Preferably the lid is hingedly attached to the base. Alternatively, the lid may be attached to the base by a screw fitting, a bayonet fitting or other convenient connection.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The UV source may be of any type known in the industry to be suitable for sterilisation of this type. The UV source typically comprises a quartz tube lamp, a copper transformer for controlling power to the lamp, a timer, a toggle switch including an on/off actuator, terminals for connection to a power source and a silicon chip for overall control of UV output. For example, a low voltage cold cathode fluorescent lamp may be suitable. The UV source may be activated and subsequently deactivated by pressure on the appliance<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> holder, or it may automatically deactivate. The UV source may be powered by any convenient means, but preferably it is battery powered by commonly available AA or AAA size batteries to facilitate transportability.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The UV source is activated by pressure upon the oral appliance holder. In a preferred embodiment the UV source is supported on the base by biasing means and the actuator is outwardly projecting. Pressure on the appliance holder opposes the force of the biasing means so that the actuator contacts the base and is depressed, which in turn operates a switch to turn the UV source on or off. The appliance holder thus acts like a "plunger" on the activator of the UV source. Typically the pressure is manual pressure, or pressure applied by the lid when it is closed.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the UV sterilisation device is generally spherical in shape, and includes a stand so that the device can remain steady on a flat surface such as a table or shelf. The lid is generally hemispherical in shape and of complimentary fit to a generally hemispherical shaped base. The hemispherical lid has a peripheral edge that seals against a complementary shaped surface on the base when the lid is closed. The seal is preferably water tight, however this is not essential to the invention.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Accordingly, in a particularly preferred embodiment, the present invention is a portable UV steriliser for oral appliances comprising,
<ol><li>(a) a generally hemispherical base including a low voltage UV source,</li><li>(b) a generally hemispherical lid having a peripheral edge adapted to form a seal with a complementary shaped surface of the base when the lid is close, and</li><li>(c) an appliance holder intermediate the lid and the base, the lid and the appliance holder cooperating to hold the oral appliance adjacent the UV source,</li></ol>
wherein manual pressure exerted on the appliance holder can activate and deactivate the UV source.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In a particularly preferred embodiment, when the generally hemispherical lid is in the closed configuration the peripheral edge of the lid forms a seal with a complementary shaped surface of the generally hemispherical base and, overall, the UV steriliser is generally spherical in shape. Thus, the steriliser is a convenient shape to handle and push into a carrier such as a tote bag, sports bag or handbag.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The base may be of unitary construction, but typically it includes several interconnecting sub-units. Similarly the appliance holder may be of unitary construction, but typically it includes several interconnecting sub-units. The sub-units may be connected by any convenient means such as screw fitting or bayonet fitting.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The UV sterilisation device may be made of any convenient material such as polymers, preferably polymers which do not degrade rapidly when exposed to UV light. In a particularly preferred embodiment at least the lid and appliance retainer are constructed of transparent or translucent polymer.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The present invention further provides a method of sterilising an oral appliance using a UV sterilisation device according to the present invention.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>Drawings</b></heading><p id="p0024" num="0024">Various non-limiting embodiments/aspects of the invention will now be described with reference to the following drawings in which,

The UV steriliser (1) includes a generally hemispherical shaped base (5) having three sub-sections - a mid-section (5a), a stand (5b) and a rim (5c). The base is adapted to enclose a UV source (not visible), and a generally hemispherical shaped hinged lid (10) with a latch (12a) that fits into a corresponding catch (12b) on the steriliser (1). In this view, the lid is open. But when the lid is in the closed configuration the base (5) and lid (10) fit together to form a generally spherical shaped UV steriliser device; the peripheral edges of the lid (10) and the rim (5c) are of complementary scalloped shapes so that they seal to form a wavelike split line horizontally around the circumference of the sphere. The base (5b) has a similar scalloped edge.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">An appliance holder (25a, 25b) is located intermediate the lid (10) and the base (5), hidden from view when the lid (10) is closed. The plunger (25b) has a hollow central shaft (27) that opens at a port (30) in the top of the plunger. The lid (10) can be held closed by a latch/catch (12a,12b) combination which is located diametrically opposite a hinge about which the lid pivots.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">This embodiment has the advantage that the UV steriliser has no external features such as buttons, switches, hinges, latches, screws, bolts and the like. All such features are concealed within the lid and the base. This makes the UV steriliser particularly robust with no protrusions or loose parts on the outside.</p><heading id="h0006"><b><u>Figure 2</u></b></heading><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is an exploded view of the UV steriliser of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In this view the base mid-section (5a), stand (5b) and rim (5c) can clearly be seen, including the hinge (11) about which the lid (10) can pivot. In this view a further part of the base - the battery holder (20) - is visible. In use, the battery holder (20) is located on top of two small batteries, such as AAA batteries, and keeps them in electrical contact with the UV source (not shown). In use the UV source is located on top of the battery<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> holder (20), with its electrical contacts projecting through recesses in the battery holder (20) to the electrical contacts on the batteries.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In this view, the appliance holder (25a, 25b) can clearly be seen. The appliance holder comprises a collar (25a) and a plunger (25b). In use the collar (25a) rests on a flange located around the perimeter of the interior surface of the base. The plunger (25b) includes a hollow central shaft (27) which in use projects through a port in the collar (25a) and contacts the UV source located on top of the battery holder (20).</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The UV source is activated and deactivated by pressure upon the plunger (25b) of the oral appliance holder. In this embodiment the UV source (not shown) is supported on the top of the battery holder (20) by springs and the actuator is outwardly projecting. Manual pressure on the plunger (25b) contracts the springs so that an actuator on the UV source contacts the base and is depressed, which in turn operates a switch to turn the UV source on or off.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The hollow central shaft (27) of the plunger (25b) opens at a port (30) in the top of the plunger. The oral appliance, such as a pacifier or teat can be located in the port (30). In order to accommodate the differing sizes and conformations of pacifiers and teats, the circumference of the port supports a soft polymeric flange, so that the pacifier can be pushed into the port and held in place by interference fit with the soft flange. When closed, the lid of the UV steriliser helps to urge the pacifier or teat against the soft flange and thus ensure that it is not displaced from the appliance holder if the UV steriliser is moved.</p><heading id="h0007"><b><u>Figure 3</u></b></heading><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3a</figref> is a top perspective view of the UV steriliser of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, clearly showing the lid (10), the port (30) and the plunger (25b).
