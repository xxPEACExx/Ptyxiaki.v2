num="0002">Reactive resins are used in various fields. Ethylenically unsaturated group-containing isocyanate compounds are useful in producing such resins. The ethylenically unsaturated group-containing isocyanate compounds can react with, for example, functional groups on the main chains of resins, whereby ethylenically unsaturated groups or isocyanate groups are introduced into the resins. Alternatively, the ethylenically unsaturated group-containing<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> isocyanate compounds can react with compounds containing active hydrogen to form various bonds such as urethane bonds, thiourethane bonds, urea bonds and amide bonds, whereby the compounds are converted into reactive monomers having unsaturated groups in their molecules.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In particular, an unsaturated group-containing isocyanate compound having an ether bond in its molecule is expected to be useful for materials having good flexibility. However, any method for efficiently synthesizing the compound has not yet been developed because of the difficulty to synthesizing the compound.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Patent Document 1 discloses a method in which an aminoalcohol having an ether bond is converted into a carbamoyl compound using urea and alcohol, an ester compound is synthesized by the reaction of the carbamoyl compound with an unsaturated carboxylic acid or the chloride thereof, and an ethylenically unsaturated group-containing isocyanate compound having an ether bond is finally produced by thermally decomposing the carbamoyl compound.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A reactive monomer produced by urethanizing the ethylenically unsaturated group-containing isocyanate<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> compound obtained by the method is useful in producing a compound having high flexibility. The method has room for improvement because the carbamoyl compound is thermally decomposed at an extremely high temperature, about 400°C, unsaturated groups are possibly polymerized depending on an apparatus or another factor, and tin contained in a catalyst may have a negative influence on the product.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Patent Document 2 discloses a method in which a specific (poly)amine compound having an ether bond is converted into a corresponding (poly)isocyanate with phosgene.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In this method, phosgene is used to perform the isocyanate-producing reaction and therefore this reaction is very simple. However, this reaction is performed at a high temperature of 100°C to 500°C. Accordingly, the application of an unsaturated compound to the isocyanate-producing reaction possibly causes polymerization and therefore is not preferred.
