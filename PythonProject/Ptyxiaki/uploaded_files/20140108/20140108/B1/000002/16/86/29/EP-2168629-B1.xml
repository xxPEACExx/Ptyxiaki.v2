Such electrodes typically include a conductive composition adherable to or otherwise contactable with, the skin of the patient, and a conductor, which is electrically connected to the conductive composition and to the external equipment. A known electrode is shown in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20060276741A"><text>US2006/0276741</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The degree of effectiveness and/or responsiveness of the electrode is related to the characteristics of the under-lying skin of the patient. The skin naturally has a high impedance level. Typically, the higher the impedance, the more difficult it is for the electrical signal to penetrate the stratum corneum. The more difficult it is for the electrical signal to traverse the stratum corneum the more time is required for the electrical signal to be delivered and received and the quality of the electrical signal is reduced.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In practice, clinicians may prepare the skin by removing dead layers of stratum corneum prior to placing an electrode on the skin of a patient. Common procedures include the use of alcohol swabs, cleansing the skin with water, soaps, or detergents, and using an abrasive agent like pummus.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Accordingly, it is desirable to treat the skin of a patient in a manner which would reduce the impedance thereof, where improved signal acquisition and/or energy delivery may be achieved.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A further need exists for an electrode which reduces impedance.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, a need exists for a system of treating the skin of a patient, prior to and/or during application of an electrode thereto, in order to reduce the level of impedance of the skin and thereby improve signal acquisition and/or energy delivery.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>SUMMARY</u></b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention relates to biomedical electrodes of preparing the surface of the skin of a patient prior to an application of an electrode thereto.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the present invention, there is provided an electrode according to claim 1.

Electrode 100 includes a conductive member 102 defining a first or skin side 102a relative to a subject and a second side 102b, opposite first side 102a. Conductive member 102 may be made from a conductive carbon, aluminum, tin or any other suitable conductive material. As an alternative, conductive member 102 may comprise a conductive plastic material. Conductive member 102 may include silver (Ag) or silver/silver-chloride (Ag/AgCl) material deposited on at least a portion of first side 102a or second side 102b. Either first side 102a or second side 102b may also have a coating of silver (Ag) or silver/silver-chloride (Ag/AgCl) composition or ink 106 on either first side 102a or second side 102b thereof.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Alternatively, as seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 3</figref>, electrode 100 may be free of the coating of silver (Ag) or silver/silver-chloride (Ag/AgCl) composition or ink 106.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Turning back to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, electrode 100 further includes a conductive composition 104 disposed adjacent first side 102a of the conductive member 102 for application/adhesion to or contact with the skin of the subject. Conductive composition 104 may be made from, for example, but not limited to, Promeon RG-63B hydrogel (TycoHealthcare Group LP d/b/a Covidien). As seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> conductive composition 104 may incorporate a reinforcement member. The reinforcement member may be a woven or non-woven cloth or gauze material (e.g., scrim) 105 embedded therewithin or supporting the structure of the hydrogel. The reinforcement member may be made from a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> conductive material. The conductive composition 104 may be any different commercially available conductive hydrogel. Conductive composition 104 is generally hydrophilic.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Conductive composition 104 has a therapeutically effective amount of an exfoliant incorporated therein. For example, conductive composition 104 may be provided with an alphahydroxy acid (AHA) incorporated therein. Conductive composition 104 may alternatively or further be provided with glycolic acid, citric acid, and/or boric acid incorporated therein. The exfoliant is added to conductive composition 104 in an amount sufficient to exfoliate the skin of the subject without or with minimal subsequent skin irritation to the patient. In an example, the exfoliant has a concentration of about 0.01-5%.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">By providing conductive composition 104 with a therapeutically effective quantity of an exfoliant, upon application of electrode 100 to the skin of the subject, at least some dead skin cells in the stratum corneum may be cleaned away or otherwise more easily penetrated. By reducing the thickness of the dead skin cells in the stratum corneum or by removing the dead skin cells in the stratum corneum, an impedance level of the skin may be reduced. As compared to the untreated skin of a subject, treated skin of the subject exhibits a reduced level of impedance, thereby reducing a relative time it takes for electrode 100 to acquire a signal for a sensing procedure and/or reducing a level of resistance encountered by electrode 100 for a stimulating procedure.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">A first side release liner 114 is releasably secured to conductive composition 104. Release liner 114 can be made from a film or paper substrate having a release coating on one or both sides, such as, for example silicone. Release liner 114 protects and/or preserves conductive composition 104 (e.g., the hydrogel) and is removed prior to application on the skin of the subject. Release liner 114 may be applied to conductive composition 104 after use of electrode 100 to preserve the conductive composition 104 for subsequent use.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Release liner 114 may be a release paper or film of a waxed or coated plastic, such as a silicone coated polyethylene terephthalate film, which may be used to protect electrode 100 before application of the electrode to the skin of the subject.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Electrode 100 may further include a backing member 108 disposed adjacent second side 102b of conductive member 102. Backing member 108 may overlie silver coating 106. Backing member 108 is fabricated from a non-conductive material such as a cloth, fabric, plastic material or the like.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Electrode 100 further includes an electrical lead or lead wire 112, e.g., a lead wire having a pig tail configuration that is in electrical communication with at least conductive member 102 and a power supply (not shown). Electrical communication extends from lead wire 112 through the conductive member 102 (and silver coating 106) and through conductive composition 104 to the subject.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In use, release liner 114 is removed from electrode 100. Electrode 100 is then applied to the skin of the subject, such that conductive composition 104 is adhered to the skin of the subject. Electrode 100 is then electrically connected to external medical equipment (not shown) by any connection means well known in the art, such as, for example, via lead wire 112. Other leads are well known in the art, including and not limited to snap style, tab style, rivet-post style, etc. Electrode 100 may, by way of example, be connected to a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit by means known to one having skill in the art.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Turning now to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>, a cross-section of a snap-style electrode 200, in accordance with the present invention is shown.

Stem 208a of eyelet 208 is covered by a snap 222 which is securely connected thereto. Together snap 222 and eyelet 220 define at least part of a conductive pathway to provide an electrical connection between conductive composition 204 and the external medical equipment (not shown).<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">A release liner 214 may be provided to protect conductive composition 204 prior to use.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Similar to electrode 100, conductive composition 204 of electrode 200 includes a quantity of a therapeutically effective amount of an exfoliant therein. For example, conductive composition 204 may be provided with an alphahydroxy acid (AHA) incorporated therein.

Electrode 300 includes a non-conductive backing member 308, and a conductive composition 304 supported thereon. Backing member 308 includes a portion 308a extending beyond a perimeter or edge of conductive member 202 thereby defining a tab.
