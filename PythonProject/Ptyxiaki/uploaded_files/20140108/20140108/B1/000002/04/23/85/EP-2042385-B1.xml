The airbag has a first portion and a second portion, and is folded such that the first portion approaches the second portion. The thus folded airbag has an elongated shape. The airbag has an inlet. When supplied with gas through the inlet, the folded airbag is inflated while being deployed along a predetermined deployment direction, such that the first portion separates from the second portion. The inlet is arranged in a portion of the folded airbag that is located in a trailing side in the deployment direction.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004058849A"><text>2004-058849</text></patcit> discloses in paragraphs 0010, 0021 through 0023, and 0029, and <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004">Figs. 3 through 5</figref> a configuration in which a folded airbag having an elongated shape is accommodated between a roof panel and a roof headlining so as to extend in the width of a vehicle. More specifically, the folded airbag is accommodated in a space between rearmost sections of the roof panel and the roof headlining. The roof panel and the roof headlining are bent downward at the rear end of the vehicle, such that the rearmost sections of the roof panel and the roof headlining are substantially parallel to a vertical plane. Attachment portions are provided at an upper portion of the folded airbag. The attachment portions are used to attach the airbag to an inner panel. The inner panel is arranged between the roof panel and the roof headlining and is bent accordingly. In the airbag apparatus disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2004058849A"><text>2004-058849</text></patcit>, gas is<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> supplied from above to the folded airbag, which inflates the airbag while deploying the airbag downward. When deployed and inflated, the airbag intervenes between the rear seats and the rear window.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">When the airbag is supplied with gas so that it is deployed and inflated, the momentum of the supplied gas applies a downward urging force, or a force in the deployment direction, to the airbag. However, the airbag is prevented from being displaced downward by the urging force since the airbag is attached to the inner panel at the attachment portions. Further, a tension applying portion extends downward from each end of the folded airbag. The tension applying portions apply outward tension along the width of the vehicle to the airbag. This allows the airbag to be deployed and inflated in a favorable manner from the folded state.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In recent years, to meet the demands for larger spaces of passenger compartments, it has become difficult to secure a space for accommodating a folded airbag in a vehicle rear portion. Therefore, it has become necessary to accommodate a folded airbag in a part closer to the front side of the vehicle, in other words, between sections of the roof panel and the roof headlining that are substantially parallel to the horizontal plane, or in the ceiling of the vehicle. In such a case, an airbag is attached to the inner panel from below. When supplied with gas, an airbag accommodated in the ceiling of a vehicle is inflated while being deployed rearward and downward in the vehicle, so as to intervene between the rear seats and the rear window.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, in the case where an airbag is accommodated in the ceiling of a vehicle, the desirable deployment and inflation of the airbag are likely to be hindered for the following reasons [1] and [2].<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> [1] Since the folded airbag is attached to the inner panel from below, the ends of the folded airbag might hang down because of the tension applying portions. When gas is supplied to the airbag in this state, the airbag is inflated while being deployed along an unexpected path. [2] In the initial stage of the deployment and inflation of the airbag, the airbag receives an urging force due to its own inflation, which urging force acts to pivot the airbag about the attachment portions in a certain directions (for example, forward). If the airbag is pivoted by the urging force, the airbag is inflated while being deployed along an unexpected path.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The above problem that desirable deployment and inflation of an airbag accommodated in the ceiling of a vehicle might be hindered is not unique to airbag apparatuses in which an airbag accommodated in the vehicle ceiling is inflated while being deployed rearward and downward in the vehicle. However, the problem is also found in airbag apparatuses in which an airbag accommodated in the vehicle ceiling is inflated while being deployed outward along the direction of the width of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further airbag apparatuses with an airbag accomodated in the ceiling of a vehicle are known from <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US2004239084A1"><text>US 2004/239084 A1</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US2003230878A1"><text>US 2003/230878 A1</text></patcit>.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide an airbag apparatus that allows an airbag accommodated in the ceiling of a vehicle to be deployed and inflated in a favorable manner.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">To achieve the foregoing objective and in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, an airbag apparatus including an airbag is provided. The airbag has a first<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> portion and a second portion. A folded airbag is formed by folding the airbag such that the first portion approaches the second portion. The folded airbag has an elongated shape extending along a first direction. The airbag has an inlet. When receiving supply of gas through the inlet, the folded airbag is inflated while being deployed in a second direction perpendicular to the first direction, such that the first portion moves away from the second portion. In the folded airbag, the inlet is arranged in a trailing position in the second direction, and a first attachment portion is provided substantially at a center portion of the upper edge of the second portion of the folded airbag. A second attachment portion is provided in each of the ends of the folded airbag. The folded airbag is configured to be accommodated between a roof panel and a roof headlining in a ceiling of a vehicle and configured to be installed in the ceiling of the vehicle from below by means of the first attachment portion and the second attachment portions. The second attachment portion is configured to be fixed to the ceiling. When the airbag is being deployed and inflated, the second attachment portions is adapted to apply an outward tension along the first direction to the airbag.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.</p><heading id="h0003">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The invention, together with objects and advantages thereof, may best be understood by reference to the following description of the presently preferred embodiments together with the accompanying drawings in which:

Specifically, the airbag 5 is accommodated between a roof panel 3 and a roof headlining 4 located below the roof panel 3, or in the ceiling of the automobile 2. The airbag 5 and the roof headlining 4 are located above a pair of rear pillars 31, which extend vertically in a rear portion of the automobile 2. An inflator 6 for supplying gas to the airbag 5 is located between the roof panel 3 and the roof headlining 4, at a position in front of the airbag 5.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In a rear portion of the automobile 2, for example, in a rear bumper 7, a sensor 8 is provided that outputs a signal when an impact greater than or equal to a predetermined value is applied to the rear of the automobile 2. Signals from the sensor 8 are sent to a controller 9. When receiving a signal from the sensor 8, the controller 9 outputs an actuation signal to the inflator 6. When receiving an actuation signal from the controller 9, the inflator 6 supplies gas to the airbag 5. When receiving the gas in this manner, the folded airbag 5 accommodated in the ceiling of the automobile 2 is inflated while being deployed rearward in the automobile 2, more specifically, toward a space behind rear seats 10. After being deployed and inflated, the airbag 5 is located between the rear seats 10 and a rear window 11 as shown by two dot chain lines in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs 1 and 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The space between the rear pillars 31 increases toward its bottom. Accordingly, the space in the rear portion of the passenger compartment 19 increases in size along the width of the automobile 2 toward its bottom. To conform to the shape of the space in the rear portion of the passenger compartment<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> 19, the deployed and inflated airbag 5 has a size that increases from the upper end toward the lower end with respect to a direction along the width of the automobile 2.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The airbag 5 will now be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The airbag 5 is formed by sewing a pair of fabric sheets and has a connection portion 12, a lateral inflatable cell 13, and left and right vertical inflatable cells 14, and a pair of center vertical inflatable cells 15. The connection portion 12 extends upward from the center of the lateral inflatable cell 13 as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>. The connection portion 12 has an inlet 12a and is connected to the inflator 6. Each of the left and right vertical inflatable cells 14 extends downward from one of the ends of the lateral inflatable cell 13 as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>.

The second attachment portions 27 allow the folded airbag 5 to be attached to the ceiling while outward tension along the first direction is applied to the folded airbag 5.

The airbag 5 is rearward of the inflator 6. The inner panel 20 is formed to have a high rigidity so as to be hardly deformed when an impact is applied to the automobile 2 from behind, and the airbag 5 and the inflator 6 are attached to the inner panel 20. The airbag 5 is attached to the inner panel 20 in the following manner. First, the first attachment portion 16 and the second attachment portions 27 of the airbag 5 are placed on the inner panel 20 from below. Then the first attachment portion 16 is fixed with a bolt 25 and a nut 26 (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>), and the second attachment portions 27 are fixed with bolts 30 (see <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5A</figref>).</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As described above, the airbag 5 is folded such that the first portion (the lower portion as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>) approaches the second portion (the upper portion as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>). More specifically, the first portion is accordion-folded, and the second portion is rolled, so that an elongated folded intermediate is formed. Thereafter, each end of the folded intermediate is accordion-folded at an even number (for example, two) of folding lines. The folding of the airbag 5 is thus complete. The thus folded airbag 5 is arranged over the roof headlining 4 such that folded-back portions 38 of the airbag 5, which are formed by accordion-folding the ends of the folded intermediate, are downward of the remainder of the airbag 5. The folded airbag 5 is bound by means of binding tape (not shown) at positions including the folded-back portions 38. Due to the difference in the ways of folding, gas supplied from the inflator 6 is more likely to flow into the first portion of the airbag 5, which is accordion folded, compared to the second portion of the airbag 5 in the rolled state. On the other hand, the rolled second section of the airbag 5 is unfolded by rolling on the inclined roof headlining 4 when the roof headlining 4 pivots downward.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5A</figref>, the roof headlining 4 is located above upper ends 32a of a pair of rear pillar garnishes 32 located at the side ends of the automobile 2 in the rear portion of the automobile 2. Each of left and right ends 4a of the roof headlining 4 is located outside of the upper end 32a of the corresponding rear pillar garnish 32 with respect to the direction of the width of the automobile 2. Since the airbag 5 has a shape that corresponds to the space in the rear portion of the passenger compartment 19, the length of the folded intermediate is greater than the space between the upper ends 32a of the rear pillar garnishes 32. Therefore, the folded intermediate cannot be accommodated on the roof headlining 4 as-is.

When attaching the airbag 5 to the inner panel 20 by means of the second attachment portions 27, the coupling portion 28 of each second attachment portion 27 is expanded outward in the width direction of the automobile 2. As a result, the folded airbag 5, which is attached to the inner panel 20, contacts the lower surface of the inner panel 20. Further, the space between two parts of the inner panel 20 to which the fixation portions 29 of the second attachment portions 27 are attached is slightly greater than the space between the fixation portions 29 of the airbag 5 before being attached to the inner panel 20. Therefore, the folded airbag 5, which is attached to the inner panel 20, receives an outward tension along a direction perpendicular to the deployment direction of the airbag 5, that is, an outward tension along the first direction.

The proximal end of each coupling portion 28 is joined to one of the ends of the folded airbag 5 over a width that is greater than or equal to half the width of the folded airbag 5 (or over a width that is greater than or equal to half the vertical dimension of the folded airbag 5 as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5B</figref>).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The folded airbag 5, which is accommodated in the ceiling of the automobile 2 in the above described manner, is deployed and inflated as described below.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">When gas is supplied from the inflator 6 to the airbag 5 through the inlet 12a, the tape binding the airbag 5 is broken. Then, mostly due to the inflation of the folded-back portions 38 of the airbag 5, a substantially downward pressing force is applied to the roof headlining 4. This causes each of the left and right ends 4a of the roof headlining 4 to extend beyond the upper end 32a of the corresponding rear pillar garnishes 32, and is located downward of the upper end 32a. In this manner, the roof headlining 4 is pivoted downward about the front end of the roof headlining 4. As a result, the rolled portion of the airbag 5 is inflated while being deployed to exit rearward from the space between the roof<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> panel 3 and the roof headlining 4.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">When the airbag 5 is deployed and inflated in this manner, the momentum of the gas supplied from the inflator 6 through the inlet 12a applies to the airbag 5 a force acting rearward (rightward as viewed I <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>) of the automobile 2. However, the airbag 5 is prevented from being displaced rearward by the attachment of the airbag 5 to the inner panel 20 by means of the first attachment portion 16. At the initial stage of the deployment and inflation of the airbag 5, the airbag 5 receives a force represented by arrow Y1 in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>, which acts to pivot the airbag 5 forward (leftward as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>) about the first attachment portion 16, due to the own inflation.

That is, the primary factors that hinder favorable deployment and inflation of the airbag 5 in the case where the airbag 5 is accommodated in the ceiling of the automobile 2 are all eliminated. Thus, the airbag 5 is inflated while being deployed along a previously assumed path shown, for example, by broken lines in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>, and is prevented from being inflated while being deployed along an unexpected path shown, for example, by two-dot chain line in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The above described embodiment has the following advantages. (1) When attaching the folded airbag 5 to the inner panel 20 by means of the second attachment portions 27, the coupling portion 28 of each second attachment portion 27 is expanded outward in the width direction of the automobile 2. As a result, the folded airbag 5, which is attached to the inner panel 20, receives an outward tension the direction of which is perpendicular to the deployment direction of the airbag 5. This prevents the ends of the folded airbag 5 from hanging down. Further, an urging force that acts on the airbag 5 attached to the inner panel 20 in the initial stage of the deployment and inflation of the airbag 5 to pivot the airbag 5 about the first attachment portion 16 is prevented by the structure in which the airbag 5 is attached to the inner panel 20 at the first attachment portion 16. Thus, reliable deployment and inflation of the airbag 5 is not hindered by hanging down of the ends of the folded airbag 5 and pivoting motion of the airbag 5 about the first attachment portion 16 in the initial stage of the deployment and inflation. (2) The coupling portion 28 of each second attachment portion 27 extends perpendicularly to the deployment direction of the airbag 5. That is, the tension applied to the airbag 5 by the coupling portions 28 is perpendicular to the deployment direction of the airbag 5. This further improves the deployment and inflation of the airbag 5. (3) The distal end of each coupling portion 28 is joined to the fixation portion 29 over the entire width of the coupling portion 28. The proximal end of each coupling portion 28 is joined to one of the ends of the folded airbag 5 over a width that is greater than or equal to half the width of the folded airbag 5. Thus, the airbag 5 does not easily<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> separate from the inner panel 20, and the ends of the folded airbag 5 are reliably prevented from hanging down. (4) Major part of the gas supplied from the inflator 6 through the inlet 12a is guided to the ends of the folded airbag 5 by the inner tube 18. Therefore, the inflation at the ends of the folded airbag 5 progresses quickly, which tends to pivot the ends about the first attachment portion 16. However, since the second attachment portions 27 are provided at the ends of the folded airbag 5, the second attachment portions 27 reliably prevent the ends from being pivoted about the first attachment portion 16.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The above embodiment may be modified as follows.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">There are cases where a wiring harness 33 passes through a space rearward (leading side in the deployment direction) of an airbag 5 accommodated in the ceiling of an automobile 2 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 7</figref>.

The fixation portion 29 shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 10</figref> has a bushing 41. The bushing 41 has a base portion 42 and a projection 44 projecting from the base portion 42. The bushing 41 is attached to the distal end of the coupling portion 28 by passing the projection 44 through a hole 43 formed in the coupling portion 28, such that the base portion 42 contacts a surface of the coupling portion 28 opposite to a surface of the coupling portion 28 that faces the inner panel 20. The projection 44 has an axial hole 45 that extends along the direction in which the projection 44 extends. A pair of hooks 46 are formed opposite wall surfaces of the projection 44. The hooks 46 are elastic so as to approach and separate from each other. A pin 47 is inserted into the axial hole 45 of the projection 44. An engagement groove 49 is formed in a distal end (the upper end as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 10</figref>) of the pin 47, and an engagement step 50 is formed in a proximal end (the lower end as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 10</figref>) of the pin 47.

At this time, the section 51 of the pin 47 is located between the hooks 46, and prevents the hooks 46 from being deformed to approach each other. Thus, the projection 44 cannot come off the hole 53 of the inner panel 20, so that the fixation portion 29 is fixed to the inner panel 20.
