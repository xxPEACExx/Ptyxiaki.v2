dnum="CN101119410"><text>CN 101119410</text></patcit>, entitled "A Method and System for an Advice of Charging Supplementary Service", filed on 1st Aug. 2006.</p><heading id="h0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of communication; and in particular to a method, system and device for an advice of charging supplementary service.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">With the rapid development of communication technologies, various communication mechanism and service are more widely used. Faced with so many telecommunication services, users need to know the charge of the communication in time so as to control the charge effectively. On the other hand, lawbreakers intrigue some uninformed users to make phone calls or use data service with very high charges by tricks, which would unwarily cause lots of lost of communication charge. If the user may be advised of the rate of the communication service before using the service and the charge for it during and at the end of the service delivery, unnecessary account consuming can be greatly reduced. The telecommunication operators also want to provide communication service charging information to the user timely, which on one hand can improve the user experience, on other hand can bring extra revenue through such supplementary service. Users would also enjoy the service more freely with the transparency of the service charge improved.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In a communication system, a user may be provided with charging information, such as call rate, duration time and cost of each call, through a supplementary service named Advice of Charging (AoC). The user can also get a rate information when the rate changes. The charging information is generally presented to the user at the start of a call, or during a call or at a certain time after ending a call, through audio prompt or by displaying the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> information on the screen of the user device through short message. Other than that, the service can also provide the user with a total charge within a certain period of time (such as one month, one week or one day). The balance of the subscriber card to the user can also be provided.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The AoC supplementary service makes it possible for the user to learn the service charging information before using the service, which prevents unnecessary high communication expenditure caused by a user's unawarenss of the charge. After using the service, the user can be informed of the cost of the service consumed timely, therefore effectively manages his account.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">AoC service has been existing in voice call for a long time; however, it is not supported very well in data service.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an online charging architecture defined by 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Charging Trigger Function (CTF) is a logic function section implemented on various network elements in a telecommunication network. CTF collects charging-related information from core network element, service element and subsystem, and transmits the charging information to the online charging system via a charging interface (such as Ro, CAP). The online charging system receives the charging request message and processes it, such as rating, margin reservation, and returns the processed result to the CTF through a charging response message. The CTF controls the service usage according to the charging response.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A prior art method for implementing the AoC supplementary service makes use of Intelligent Network Application Part (INAP) to realized the AoC function, the structure of which is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. When the user terminal uses the intelligent network service, a service control point (SCP) transmits AoC information to a mobile switching center through INAP protocol, the mobile switching center then transmits the AoC information to the user terminal.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The above solution realizes the transmission of the AoC information in the intelligent voice calls through SS7.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">However, firstly, the solution above is essentially based on voice call and it's decided by the charging system on whether it is necessary to present AoC to the user, therefore the user can not set or choose whether to accept the AoC information. This can not satisfy the requirement of the flexible packet switch (PS) domain service.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Secondly, in the intelligent network solution which is mainly used for voice call, the charging system generates fixed format AoC, for example, a text message including call duration time. In using the currently available flexible data service, a charging system can serve several application servers, thus, fixed-format AoC can not satisfy the AoC requirement of the PS domain any more. The application server can not customize AoC format, neither can the user customize AoC format to fit his requirement, or customize the trigger condition.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">To address the problem in the above prior art solution, another prior art method for implementing the AoC supplementary service will be discussed in the following.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, in this solution, the charging system informs the user of the service charging information through short message or audio prompt after the service is finished or during the service.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The charging system can send the AoC information to the user directly by means of short message or audio prompt. The AoC information can also be sent to the application server (here the application server is an application server providing the service) by means of other interfaces (non-charging interface). However, this charging presentation method is relatively simple in that it can not present to the user the service promotion related to the user's subscription stored in the charging system or other operator management system as well as the user's balance promptly.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Furthermore, in this solution, the application server and user acquire the AoC information from a charging system through other interfaces. This requires a third party communication mechanism and makes the acquisition and transmission of the AoC information more complicated.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>HARRI HAKALA LEENA MATTILA ERICSSON JUHA-EKKA KOSKINEN MARCO STURA JOHN LOUGHNEY NOKIA: "AAA Working Group Diameter Credit-Control Application; draft-ietf-aaa-diameter-cc-06.txt" IETF STANDARD-WORKING-DRAFT, INTERNET ENGINEERING TASK FORCE, IETF, CH, vol. aaa, no. 6, 2004-08-12</text></nplcit>, discloses a diameter credit-control (CC) application, in which a CC server interacts with a CC client to push cost information to an end user.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">ETSI TS 132 296, version 6.2.0, 2005-09, discloses a online charging system (OCS) which includes charging function for performing charging and credit control, rating function for performing both monetary and non-monetary unit determination, and account balance management function.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO9859504A1"><text>WO98/59504A1</text></patcit> discloses a method of providing advice of charge service, which includes: informing a control point of a call involving the mobile station and a switching node currently serving the mobile station; determining at the control point one or more advice of charge parameters for the call; and sending the one or more advice of charge parameters to the serving switching node for delivery to the mobile station.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">The objective of the present invention is to provide a method, system and device for implementing an Advice of Charging supplementary service, so as to transmit more enriched AoC information by using the established channel for the charging session.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The technical solutions of the embodiments of the present disclosure are as follows:</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A method for implementing an Advice of Charge (AoC) supplementary service includes the following:</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">receiving, by an application server, a service request initiated by a user terminal, and establishing, by the application server, a charging session with a charging system; transmitting, by the application server, an AoC information content customization request and/or a trigger condition customization request to the charging system, according to a customization request from the terminal, wherein the customization request is the AoC information content customization request or the trigger condition customization request or both,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> verifying, by the charging system, the AoC information content customization request and/or trigger condition customization request; and acquiring the AoC information according to the AoC information content customization request and/or trigger condition customization request when the verification is successful, and</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">transmitting the AoC information to the application server through a channel for the charging session; transmitting, by the application server, the AoC information to the user terminal.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A charging system includes the following:
