This is a schematic exploded perspective view of a cam mechanism 10 described in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2003223776A"><text>JP-A-2003-223776</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic front view of the cam mechanism 10 of a disk device described in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2003223776A"><text>JP-A-2003-223776</text></patcit>. The cam mechanism 10 is constituted of a follower 20, disposed on the traverse chassis (not shown), a cam plate 30, moved forward and in reverse as indicated by arrows X in a direction orthogonal to a direction of reciprocal movement of another end of the traverse chassis, a cam groove 31, formed in the cam plate 30 and making the follower 20 slide to make the other end of the traverse chassis move reciprocatingly along a rectilinear path, and an auxiliary guiding member 40, having straight guiding surfaces 41 that make the follower 20 slide when the cam plate 30 is moved forward and in reverse to guide the reciprocal movement of the follower 20. The cam groove 31 of the camplate 30 includes a horizontal first riding surface 32, onto which the follower 20 rides at its onward movement limit position, a horizontal second riding surface 33, onto which the follower 20 rides at its return movement limit position, and an inclined surface 34, making the first and second riding surfaces 32 and 33 continuous.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the disk device, including the cam mechanism 10, when the turntable, mounted on the traverse chassis, and the clamper coact to clamp a disk, the follower 20 of the cam mechanism 10<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> that rides on the first riding surface 32 of the cam groove 31 is clamped by the guiding surfaces 41 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>. The follower 20 and the other end of the traverse chassis provided with the follower 20 are thus provisionally positioned in the reciprocal movement direction (vertical direction), indicated by arrows A in the figure, and a direction (left/right direction), indicated by arrows B in the figure and orthogonal to the reciprocal movement direction of the traverse chassis.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">With the cam mechanism 10 described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, for a vibration absorbing action by an elastic member 23 of the follower 20 to be exhibited with good efficiency, the follower 20 of the cam mechanism 10, riding on the first riding surface 32 of the cam groove 31, is desirably clamped by the guiding surfaces 41 and positioned accurately in the mutually orthogonal directions indicated by the arrows A and B.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, because gaps that are essential for allowing smooth movement of the follower 20 and gaps, etc., due to manufacturing errors are present between the guiding surfaces 41 and the follower 20 of the cam mechanism 10 riding on the first riding surface 32 of the cam groove 31 and between the follower 20 and the cam groove 31, the follower 20 is not accurately positioned without play in the mutually orthogonal directions indicated by the arrows A and B.

The follower is thus accurately positioned without play in two mutually orthogonal directions and helps to suppress self-induced vibration of the traverse chassis. A disk device can thus be provided, which resolves the problem of a rotating disk vibrating and causing optical reading errors by the optical pickup to occur readily and thus with which image distortion, sound skipping, etc., do not occur readily.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The follower may include: a protrusion, formed on the traverse chassis; an elastic member, provided on the protrusion; and a cover, provided on the elastic member and fitted with the cam groove. With the follower having this configuration, when by the follower sliding along the cam groove and reaching the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> onward movement limit position, the disk is clamped by the turntable and the clamper, the cylindrical cover of the follower, riding on the riding surface of the cam groove, is elastically pressed by both the riding surface of the cam groove and the guiding surface of the auxiliary guiding member. The cover of the follower is thus accurately positioned without play in two mutually orthogonal directions and lowering of a vibration absorbing property of the elastic member that exhibits the damper action is prevented. The self-induced vibration of the traverse chassis is thus absorbed efficiently by the elastic member and this helps in making optical reading errors by the optical pickup less likely to occur. Also, deformation of the riding surface of the cam groove, the guiding surface of the auxiliary guiding member, etc., caused by influence of heat generated by the vibration of the follower accompanying the self-induced vibration of the traverse chassis, is suppressed and optical reading errors are made less likely to occur.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The urging member may be configured to urge the cam follower in an oblique direction with respect to both the inner wall and the guide face. The urging member may be monolithically formed with the guide member. The urging member may be comprised of resin. By thus integrally molding the urging member together with the auxiliary guiding member from resin, a merit of making it unnecessary to add the urging member as an extra part is provided.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The guide member may be monolithically formed with a fixed frame supporting the traverse chassis, and guide member may be comprised of resin.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As described above, with the disk device according to the present invention, even when the traverse chassis undergoes self-induced vibration during rotation of the disk clamped by the turntable and the clamper, vibration of the follower of the cam mechanism, riding on the riding surface of the cam groove, is suppressed and optical reading errors by the optical pickup are thus made less likely to occur. In particular, in a disk device that includes a cam mechanism, with which a follower is provided with a vibration absorbing action based on an action of an elastic member, the vibration absorbing action by the elastic member is improved and optical reading errors by the optical pickup are made less likely to occur. Furthermore, the present invention provides an effect of enabling the vibration of the follower due to self-induced vibration of the traverse chassis to be suppressed and enabling the action of making optical reading errors by the optical pickup less likely to occur to be obtained by simply improving the configuration of a portion of the cam mechanism and without adding extra parts.</p><heading id="h0001"><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0023" num="0023">Embodiment may be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> -->

Although not illustrated, a mounting portion for a circular disk is formed in a recessed<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> manner on an upper surface of the disk tray 70, and a disk mounted on the mounting portion is inserted and ejected with respect to a set position substantially at a center of the fixed frame 60 by movement of the disk tray 70 in the direction of the arrows L.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In addition to an optical pickup 61 or other optical element, a traverse chassis 50, carrying a turntable 62, is attached to the fixed frame 60.

Thus with the cam mechanism 10 having just the above configuration, when the traverse chassis 50 undergoes self-induced vibration during disk rotation, the entirety of the follower 20 may vibrate and the vibration absorbing action by the elastic member 23 of the follower 20 may not be exhibited efficiently.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Thus with the present embodiment, a urging member is provided that presses the follower 20, riding onto the first riding surface 32 of the cam groove 31, and thereby makes the first riding surface 32 and the guiding surfaces 41 of the auxiliary guiding member 40 elastically press the follower 20. The urging member is a urging member 80, shown in <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>.

By the inclined surface 81 pressing a single location of an outer circumferential surface of the cover 22 of the follower 20, riding on the first riding surface 32 of the cam groove 31,<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> the cover 22 is pressed in a direction inclined with respect to both the first riding surface 32 and the guiding surface 41 as indicated by an arrow M. Thus by an elastically pressing action of the urging member 80, the follower 20, riding on the first riding surface 32 of the cam groove 31, is elastically pressed by both the first riding surface 32 and the guiding surface 41 and the cover 22 is thereby positioned accurately without play in the two mutually orthogonal directions. Consequently, a possibility for an entirety of the follower 20 vibrating and the vibration absorbing action of the elastic member 23 of the follower 20 not being exhibited efficiently when the traverse chassis 50 undergoes self-induced vibration during disk rotation is lessened, and the vibration absorbing property of the elastic member 23 of the follower 20 when the traverse chassis 50 undergoes self-induced vibration is thus improved. By such improvement of the vibration absorbing property of the elastic member 23, the problem of optical reading errors by the optical pickup occurring readily due to vibration of the disk during rotation is resolved, and image distortion, sound skipping, etc., are made less likely to occur, especially even when a disk with a mass eccentricity is handled. A possibility of optical reading errors occurring due to deformation of the first riding surface 32 of the cam groove 34, the guiding surface 41 of the auxiliary guiding member 40, etc., caused by influence of heat generated by the vibration of the follower 20 accompanying the self-induced<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> vibration of the traverse chassis 50, is also eliminated.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Although with the present embodiment, the follower 20 includes the elastic member 23 that exhibits the vibration absorbing property, the elastic member 23 is not necessarily required.
