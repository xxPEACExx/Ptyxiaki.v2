Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a solar cell module, and more particularly, to a solar cell module which has a light weight and is capable of being molded in a free shape.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally, solar cell modules have a transparent cover material arranged on a surface into which the sunlight enters and a rear substrate arranged on a side opposite to the surface into which the sunlight enters. A transparent filler is filled between the transparent cover material and the rear substrate. Solar cells are arranged in the filler, and the cells are connected with each other through lead wires.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As the transparent cover material, a tempered glass having high transmittance to sunlight and relatively excellent mechanical strength has been employed. As a cover material formed of glass, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2000226228A"><text>2000-226228</text></patcit> discloses a cover material for a solar cell which has such a glass characterized in that the material can be formed in a microsheet by stretching and has substantially a composition of, expressed in terms of oxides in wt%, 56 to 69% of SiO<sub>2</sub>, 6.5 to 8.5% of ZnO, 8.5 to 14% of B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> 0.25 to 3% of CeO<sub>2</sub>, 2 to 2.5% of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, 0 to 1% of TiO<sub>2</sub>, 5.5 to 12.5% of Na<sub>2</sub>O, 0.5 to 4% of CeO<sub>2</sub> + TiO<sub>2</sub>, 0 to 8% of K<sub>2</sub>O, and 0 to 0.5% of Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In addition, a transparent resin sheet has also been studied in recent years with a view to reducing the weight. For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2005277187A"><text>2005-277187</text></patcit> discloses a solar cell module including a front surface cover member provided on a side into which the sunbeam enters, a rear surface cover member provided on a side opposite to the side which the sunbeam enters so as to face the front surface cover member, the rear surface cover being formed of the same material as that of the front surface cover member, a fillingmember filledbetween the front surface cover member and the rear surface cover member, and a solar cell body provided in the filling member so as to be sealed by the filling member, in which the front surface cover member and the rear surface cover member are each formed of any one of polycarbonate, polyethylene, and polyethylene terephthalate.<br/>
However, the cover glass for a solar cell disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2000226228A"><text>2000-226228</text></patcit> is relatively heavy compared to a cover member formed of a resin material, and hence the cover glass has disadvantages in promoting reduction of weight when mounted on a vehicle as an exterior device, for instance. In addition, a glass material has disadvantages in mass production, because when the glass material is molded in a curved shape, the heating step<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> for the glass material is more complicated than that for a resin material, and careful handling is required to prevent the glass material from cracking.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">On the other hand, a resin material such as polycarbonate, polyethylene, or polyethylene terephthalate is used in the front surface cover member and rear surface cover member of the solar cell module disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2005277187A"><text>2005-277187</text></patcit>. The resin material has a linear expansion coefficient of about 7 to 11 (× 10<sup>-5</sup>/°C), and hence there may be problems, particularly when the resin material is incorporated in an exterior material of a vehicle, in that a gap occurs in a boundary portion to the steel plate due to the difference between the linear expansion coefficient of the resin material and that of the steel plate, or the exterior material cannot absorb and resist deflection, resulting in a flaw.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2002231990A"><text>JP-A 2002-231990</text></patcit> discloses solar battery panels comprising a solar cell between front and rear surface cover members formed of glass-filler containing thermoplastic resin.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a solar cell module, which can be reduced in thickness and weight, is applicable to a curve shape, and can be applied to an exterior material or the like of a vehicle.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The inventors of the present invention extensively studied<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> with a view to solving the above-mentioned problems. As a result, the inventors found that a glass filler-containing thermoplastic resin molded product, which has high transparency, and is excellent in stiffness, heat resistance, and weather resistance, could be obtained by molding a glass filler-containing resin composition including a glass filler having a specific glass composition and a thermoplastic resin. The inventors also found that the glass filler-containing thermoplastic molded product is suitable for a cover member of the solar cell module, and the present invention was thus completed.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">That is, the present invention provides a solar cell module including a front surface cover member provided on a side into which sunlight enters, a rear surface cover member provided on a side opposite to the side into which sunlight enters to face the front surface cover member, and a solar cell provided between the front surface cover member and the rear surface cover member, in which the front surface cover member and the rear surface cover member are each formed of a glass filler-containing thermoplastic resin molded product; characterized in that:

The front surface cover member employs the glass filler-containing amorphous polyamide resin molded product having transparency in order to transmit sunlight. It is required for the front surface cover member to have a parallel light transmittance of 65% or higher and a haze of less than 30%. Although the wavelength range showing good power generation efficiency varies depending on the raw material of the solar cell, the parallel light transmittance is required to be 65% or higher at a wavelength from a visible ray region to a near infrared rayregion, i.e., 400nm to 1,100nm. It is preferred that the parallel light transmittance be 70% or higher and the haze be less than 25%.
