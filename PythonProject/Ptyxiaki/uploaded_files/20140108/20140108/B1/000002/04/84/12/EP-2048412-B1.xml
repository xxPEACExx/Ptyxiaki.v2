the ring shaft, and a plurality of planetary shafts disposed between the sun shaft and the ring shaft to extend in the same direction as do the sun shaft and the ring shaft. A female thread is formed on the inner circumference of the ring shaft and a male thread is formed on the outer circumference of the sun shaft and on the outer circumference of the planetary shaft. The male thread of the planetary shaft is mated with the male thread of the sun shaft and the female thread of the ring shaft.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the conversion mechanism configured as above, a rotational motion of the ring shaft will cause the planetary shaft to make a planetary motion, i.e., to rotate about its own axis while rotating about the axis of the sun shaft. The planetary motion of the planetary shaft in turn produces an axial linear motion of the sun shaft. The aforementioned<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> conversion mechanism thus converts the rotational motion of the ring shaft to the linear motion of the sun shaft.

The planetary shaft is possibly tilted in this manner for the following reason.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the conversion mechanism, the number of threads of each component is set to a different value. Accordingly, engagements between the female thread of the ring shaft, the male thread of the sun shaft, and the male thread of each planetary shaft would produce backlash therebetween. The magnitude of backlash may vary depending on the setting of each number of threads. For this reason, in the process of fabricating the conversion mechanism, force acting radially upon the planetary shaft would cause the planetary shaft to displace and tilt with respect to the sun shaft by the amount of the backlash. Under this condition, each component of the conversion mechanism is fabricated.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the conversion mechanism having the planetary shaft tilted with respect to its parallel position, the threads of each component are mated unevenly with each other, thereby accelerating local wearing of the threads with loss of service life. This also causes an increase in friction between the components, resulting in a decrease in the efficiency of conversion from rotational to linear motion.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Another conversion mechanism with the features according to the preamble of claim 1 is described in Patent Document 2.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for fabricating a rotational-to-linear motion conversion mechanism which can avoid the planetary shaft from being tilted with respect to the sun shaft when the conversion mechanism is assembled.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In order to achieve the aforementioned object, the present invention provides a method for fabricating a rotational-to-linear motion conversion mechanism as defined in claim 1. The conversion mechanism includes a pipe-shaped ring shaft having a female thread on its inner circumferential surface at its longitudinal center portion; a sun shaft disposed inside the ring shaft to extend coaxially with the ring shaft, the sun shaft having a male thread on its outer circumferential surface at its longitudinal center portion; a plurality of planetary shafts disposed between the outer circumferential surface of the sun shaft and the inner circumferential surface of the ring shaft to extend in the same direction as do the sun shaft and the ring shaft, each of the planetary shafts having a male thread on its outer circumferential surface at its longitudinal center portion, the male thread being mated with the female thread of the ring shaft and the male thread of the sun shaft; a first ring gear secured to an inner circumferential surface of a first longitudinal end portion of the ring shaft; a first sun gear integrated on an outer circumferential surface of a first longitudinal end portion of the sun shaft; a first planetary gear integrated on an outer circumferential surface of a first longitudinal end portion of the planetary shaft, the first planetary gear being mated with the first ring gear and the first sun gear; a second ring gear secured to an inner circumferential surface of a second longitudinal end portion of the ring shaft; a second sun gear secured to an outer circumferential surface of a second longitudinal end portion of the sun shaft; and a second planetary gear attached to an outer circumference of a second longitudinal<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> end portion of the planetary shaft, the second planetary gear being circumferentially rotatable about its own axis and mated with the second ring gear and the second sun gear. The method includes fabricating a subassembly while the planetary shaft is being held in parallel to the sun shaft, the subassembly including the sun shaft having the first and second sun gears, the planetary shaft having the first planetary gear, the ring shaft, and the first and second ring gears. The method includes mating the second planetary gear with the second sun gear and the second ring gear while the second planetary gear is being fitted over the outer circumferential surface of the second end portion of the planetary shaft in the subassembly.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">To smoothly fit the second planetary gear over the second end portion of the planetary shaft, it is preferable that the phases of the first sun gear and the second sun gear around the axis of the sun shaft be the same and that the phases of the first ring gear and the second ring gear around the aforementioned axis be the same. In this case, the relative phase of the first ring gear around the aforementioned axis with respect to the first sun gear is equal to the relative phase of the second ring gear around the aforementioned axis with respect to the second sun gear.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">However, at the time of the fitting, the phases of the first sun gear and the second sun gear around the axis of the sun shaft are not always the same but may be different from each other. Even in this situation, the second planetary gear can be rotated about its own axis, or around the axis of the planetary shaft, by an amount of phase shift of the second sun gear around the axis of the sun shaft with respect to the first sun gear. This makes it possible to mate the second planetary gear with the second sun gear while the second planetary gear is being fitted over the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> outer circumferential surface of the second end portion of the planetary shaft.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Furthermore, at the time of the fitting, whether the phases of the first sun gear and the second sun gear around the axis of the sun shaft are the same or different, the relative phase of the second ring gear around the aforementioned axis with respect to the second sun gear will be different from the relative phase of the first ring gear around the aforementioned axis with respect to the first sun gear, depending on the phase of the first ring gear and that of the second ring gear around the axis of the sun shaft. Even in this situation, it is possible to mate the second planetary gear with the second sun gear and the second ring gear while the second planetary gear is being fitted over the outer circumferential surface of the second end portion of the planetary shaft. That is, when mated with the second sun gear, the second planetary gear can rotate about its own axis by an amount of backlash therebetween. Accordingly, even when the relative phase of the second ring gear around the axis of the sun shaft with respect to the second sun gear is different from the relative phase of the first ring gear around the aforementioned axis with respect to the first sun gear, the second planetary gear can be mated with the second ring gear through the rotation of the second planetary gear about its own axis within the range of the aforementioned backlash.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The reason for the planetary shaft being tilted with respect to the sun shaft when the conversion mechanism is fabricated is, for example, that the second planetary gear is displaced in the circumferential direction of the sun shaft relative to the first planetary gear which is at the first end portion of the planetary shaft when the second planetary gear is fitted over the second end portion of the planetary shaft. However, when the second planetary gear is<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> fitted over the outer circumferential surface of the second end portion of the planetary shaft, the second planetary gear, while rotating about its own axis as appropriate around the axis of the planetary shaft, moves axially to mate only with the second sun gear and the second ring gear. Accordingly, when fabricated, the second planetary gear will not be pushed in the circumferential direction of the sun shaft, and the sun shaft will not be displaced circumferentially, either. Accordingly, upon fabrication, it is possible to prevent the planetary shaft from being tilted with respect to the sun shaft due to the second planetary gear being displaced in the circumferential direction of the sun shaft relative to the first planetary gear which is at the first end portion of the planetary shaft.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to an aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that the method further includes, prior to the step of fabricating the subassembly, the step of integrating the first sun gear and the second sun gear with the sun shaft so that the first and second sun gears are in phase around the axis of the sun shaft.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">To stabilize the rotational motion of the planetary shaft about its own axis and the sun shaft when the conversion mechanism is actuated, the conversion mechanism is preferably adapted to eliminate the phase shift between the first sun gear and the second sun gear around the axis of the sun shaft and the difference in the timing between the first sun gear and the second sun gear at which force is transferred between the planetary shaft and the sun shaft. The aforementioned fabrication method can preferably eliminate such a difference in the transfer timing, thereby stabilizing the rotational motion of the planetary shaft about its own axis and the sun shaft when the conversion mechanism is actuated.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to another aspect of the present invention, the method further includes, prior to the step of fabricating the subassembly, the steps of disposing each of the planetary shafts circumferentially around the sun shaft and then engagedly attaching a jig extending in parallel to the planetary shaft to each adjacent first planetary gear of the planetary shafts, and removing the jig after the step of mating the second planetary gear.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the aforementioned fabrication method, each planetary shaft placed along the circumference of the sun shaft can be precisely held in parallel to the sun shaft using the jig. The subassembly is fabricated in this arrangement, and the second planetary gear is fitted over the outer circumferential surface of the second end portion of the planetary shaft in the subassembly. After the fitting, the jig is removed. Accordingly, when the subassembly is fabricated and when the second planetary gear is fitted over to the outer circumferential surface of the second end portion of the planetary shaft, the inclination of the planetary shaft relative to the sun shaft is prevented with the jig.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the internal structure of a rotational-to-linear motion conversion mechanism according to an embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the cross-sectional structure of a ring shaft of the conversion mechanism, taken along the center line of the ring shaft, and <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2B</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the ring shaft when disassembled;<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a side view illustrating a sun shaft of the conversion mechanism;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4A</figref> is a side view illustrating a planetary shaft of the conversion mechanism, <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4B</figref> is a side view illustrating the planetary shaft when disassembled, and <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4C</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the cross-sectional structure of a rear planetary gear, taken along its center line;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the cross-sectional structure of conversion mechanism, taken along its center line;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the cross-sectional structure of the conversion mechanism, taken along line 6-6 of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the cross-sectional structure of the conversion mechanism, taken along line 7-7 of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 8</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the cross-sectional structure of the conversion mechanism, taken along line 8-8 of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 9</figref> is a schematic perspective view illustrating the process in step A of a method for fabricating the conversion mechanism;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 10</figref> is an schematic view illustrating another example of step A;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 11</figref> is a view illustrating the process in step B of the method for fabricating the conversion mechanism;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 12</figref> is a view illustrating the process in step C of the method for fabricating the conversion mechanism;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 13</figref> is a view illustrating the process in step D of the method for fabricating the conversion mechanism;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 14</figref> is a front view illustrating a retainer jig used in step D;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 15</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the ring shaft body, the planetary shaft body, the sun shaft, and the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> retainer jig of <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 13</figref>, when viewed from the direction of arrows 15-15;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 16</figref> is a view illustrating the process in step E of the method for fabricating the conversion mechanism;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 17</figref> is a view illustrating the process in step F of the method for fabricating the conversion mechanism;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 18</figref> is a view illustrating the process in step G of the method for fabricating the conversion mechanism;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0013">Fig. 19</figref> is a view illustrating the process in step H of the method for fabricating the conversion mechanism;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0013">Fig. 20</figref> is an enlarged view illustrating the rear planetary gear mated with a rear ring gear and a rear sun gear;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0014">Fig. 21</figref> is a view illustrating the process in step I of the method for fabricating the conversion mechanism;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0014">Fig. 22</figref> is a view illustrating the process in step J of the method for fabricating the conversion mechanism;

The sun shaft 3 is also inserted into a rear collar 52 secured onto the inner circumferential surface which forms a second longitudinal end opening portion of the ring shaft 2. The sun shaft 3 is supported by a bearing 51A provided on the front collar 51 and a bearing 52A provided on the rear collar 52.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The first longitudinal end opening portion of the ring shaft 2 is blocked with the front collar 51, and the second longitudinal end opening portion is blocked with the rear collar 52. An O-ring 53 is mounted in each portion of the front collar 51 and the rear collar 52, which faces the inner circumferential surface forming each opening portion and makes contact with the inner circumferential surface to seal the ring shaft 2. The front collar 51 also includes a lubricant inlet 51H through which a lubricating oil is supplied into the ring shaft 2.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Inside the ring shaft 2, the thread and gear provided on each planetary shaft 4 are mated with the thread and gear provided on the ring shaft 2 and the thread and gear provided on the sun shaft 3. This mating allows the planetary shaft 4 to be supported so that the axis of the sun shaft 3 and the axis of each planetary shaft 4 are parallel to each other, and each planetary shaft 4 is disposed at regular intervals along the entire circumference of the sun shaft 3. The support with the front collar 51 and the rear collar 52 and the aforementioned mating between the threads and between the gears allows the sun shaft 3 to be positioned so that the axis of the ring shaft 2 and the axis of the sun shaft 3 are aligned with each other.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In this embodiment, the position of the ring shaft 2 at which the axis of the ring shaft 2 is aligned with the axis of the sun shaft 3 as described above is referred to as the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> aligned position of the ring shaft 2. Also, the position of each planetary shaft 4 at which the axis of each planetary shaft 4 is parallel to the axis of the sun shaft 3 as described above is referred to as the parallel position of planetary shaft 4.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the conversion mechanism 1, the engagement of the thread and gear of the ring shaft 2 with the thread and gear of each planetary shaft 4 allows for transferring force from one component to the other component between the ring shaft 2 and each planetary shaft 4. Also, the engagement of the thread and gear of the sun shaft 3 with the thread and gear of each planetary shaft 4 allows for transferring force from one component to the other component, i.e., between the sun shaft 3 and each planetary shaft 4.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">When one component, i.e., either the ring shaft 2 or the sun shaft 3 rotates, each planetary shaft 4 performs a planetary motion through the transfer of force from that component to each planetary shaft 4. That is, while rotating about its own axis, the planetary shaft 4 rotates about the axis of the sun shaft 3. Such a planetary motion of each planetary shaft 4 further allows for transferring force from each planetary shaft 4 to the other component, i.e., either the ring shaft 2 or the sun shaft 3. In this situation, preventing displacement of the other component in its rotational direction would cause the other component to move axially relative to each planetary shaft 4 through the aforementioned transfer of force.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Thus, the conversion mechanism 1 can convert the rotational motion of one of the ring shaft 2 and the sun shaft 3 to the linear motion of the other.

That is, the relative phase of the rear ring gear 23 around the axis with respect to the rear sun gear 33 may be different from the relative phase of the front ring gear 22 around the axis with respect to the front sun gear 32.

As such, assembly of the conversion mechanism 1 has been completed.<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --></p><p id="p0076" num="0076">The above embodiment has the following advantageous effects.
<ul><li>(1) Provided that force acts upon the rear planetary gear 43 in the circumferential direction of the sun shaft 3 when the rear planetary gear 43 is attached to the rear shaft 41R in step H. In that case, even if each fork portion 69 of the retainer jig 66 is inserted between the adjacent front planetary gears 42 of the planetary shaft bodies 41, the rear planetary gear 43 is unavoidably displaced in its circumferential direction. In other words, each fork portion 69 of the retainer jig 66 is in contact only with the front planetary gear 42 of the planetary shaft body 4 and thus, when force acts upon the rear planetary gear 43 in the circumferential direction of the sun shaft 3, the point on which the force is exerted is apart from the fork portion 69. It is therefore difficult for the fork portions 69 to prevent displacement of the rear planetary gear 43 in the circumferential direction of the sun shaft 3 due to the applied force. A displacement of the rear planetary gear 43 in the circumferential direction of the sun shaft 3 relative to the front planetary gear 42 would cause the planetary shaft body 41 to be tilted with respect to the sun shaft 3, thereby losing the parallel position of the planetary shaft body 41.</li></ul></p><p id="p0077" num="0077">For example, when the rear planetary gear 43 is attached to the rear shaft 41R, force acts on the rear planetary gear 43 in the circumferential direction of the sun shaft 3 as follows. The rear sun gear 33, separate from the sun shaft body 31, the rear ring gear 23, and the rear planetary gear 43 are assembled into a gear assembly 99 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 23</figref>. The gear assembly 99 is attached to the sun shaft body 31, the ring shaft body 21, and each planetary shaft body 41. When the gear assembly 99 is attached, the rear sun gear 33 is fitted over the outer<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> circumferential surface of the sun shaft body 31, the rear ring gear 23 is fitted into the inner circumferential surface of the ring shaft body 21, and each rear planetary gear 43 is fitted over the planetary shaft body 41, i.e., the outer circumferential surface of the rear shaft 41R, at the same time. In this situation, there may be a difference in out-of-roundness between the inner circumferential surface of the rear sun gear 33 and the outer circumferential surface of the sun shaft body 31 as well as a difference in out-of-roundness between the outer circumferential surface of the rear ring gear 23 and the inner circumferential surface of the ring shaft body 21. These differences may cause the entire gear assembly 99 to be twisted in the circumferential direction of the sun shaft body 31. This would cause force to act on the rear planetary gear 43 in the circumferential direction of the sun shaft 3, resulting in displacement of the rear planetary gear 43 in the circumferential direction.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">However, in the above step H, only the rear planetary gear 43 is fitted over the outer circumferential surface of the rear shaft 41R. While rotating about the axis of the rear shaft 41R as appropriate, the rear planetary gear 43 moves in the direction of the axis to only mate with the rear sun gear 33 and the rear ring gear 23. Accordingly, when the rear planetary gear 43 is fitted over the rear shaft 41R, no force acts on the rear planetary gear 43 in the circumferential direction of the sun shaft 3, and thus the rear planetary gear 43 will not be displaced in the circumferential direction of the sun shaft 3 due to the force that would otherwise act thereon. Thus, upon installation of the rear planetary gear 43, the gear 43 does not displace relative to the front planetary gear 42 in the circumferential direction of the sun shaft 3. It is thus possible to avoid the inclination of the planetary shaft 4 with respect to the sun shaft 3, thereby preventing<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> fabrication of the conversion mechanism 1 with the planetary shaft 4 tilted.
<ul><li>(2) To stabilize the rotational motion of each planetary shaft 4 about its own axis and the sun shaft 3 when the conversion mechanism 1 is actuated, it is preferable to eliminate the phase shift between the front sun gear 32 and the rear sun gear 33 around the axis of the sun shaft 3. This is because the elimination of the phase shift and thus elimination of the difference between the front sun gear 32 and the rear sun gear 33 in the timing at which force is transferred between the planetary shaft 4 and the sun shaft 3 enables a smooth rotational motion of the planetary shaft 4 about its own axis and the sun shaft 3. Here, the front sun gear 32 and the rear sun gear 33 may be formed on the sun shaft body 31 by the rolling of step A. This makes it possible to readily form the sun shaft 3 including the front sun gear 32 and the rear sun gear 33 being in phase around the axis of the sun shaft 3.</li><li>(3) Upon preparing the subassembly S in steps E to G, each planetary shaft body 41 arranged around the sun shaft 3 is held precisely in parallel to the sun shaft 3 with the retainer jig 66. Accordingly, upon preparation of the subassembly S, the use of the retainer jig 66 may prevent the inclination of the planetary shaft body 41 with respect to the sun shaft 3.</li></ul></p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The above embodiment can be changed as follows.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">The rear sun gear 33 may be separate from the sun shaft body 31 so that the rear sun gear 33 is fixedly attached to the sun shaft body 31 in step G.

Depending on the phases of the front ring gear 22 and the rear ring gear 23 around the axis, the relative phase of the rear ring gear 23 and that of the front ring gear 22 around the axis with respect to the rear sun gear 33 become different.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">Even in that situation, while being fitted over the outer circumferential surface of the rear shaft 41R, the rear planetary gear 43 can be mated with the rear sun gear 33 and the rear ring gear 23. That is, the rear planetary gear 43 may be rotated (about its own axis) around the axis of the rear shaft 41R by such an amount as corresponding to the phase shift of the rear sun gear 33 around the axis with respect to the front sun gear 32. While being fitted over the outer circumferential surface of the rear shaft 41R, the rear planetary gear 43 can be thereby mated with the rear sun gear 33. Further, for the reason described in relation to step H, the rear planetary gear 43 can also be mated with the rear ring gear 23.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">The rear sun gear 33 and the front sun gear 32 of the sun shaft 3 need not to be necessarily integrated by rolling.
