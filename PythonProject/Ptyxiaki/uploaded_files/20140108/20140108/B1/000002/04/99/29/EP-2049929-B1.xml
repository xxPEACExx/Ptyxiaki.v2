Mach-Zehnder<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> structures are widely utilized in optical transmission systems and a number of types are known and understood.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">With continued reference to that <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIG 1</b></figref><b>,</b> it may be observed that the apparatus' structure includes one or more an input waveguides <b>103, 105</b> and one or more output waveguides <b>107, 109</b> optically connected by a pair of waveguide arms <b>110,</b> and <b>120.</b> Accordingly, an optical signal applied to an input waveguide will exit through an output waveguide after traversing the apparatus via upper arm <b>110</b> and/or lower arm <b>120.</b></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Also shown in this <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIG 1</b></figref><b>,</b> are a plurality of ring resonators <b>130[1]...130[6],</b> certain ones of which are optically coupled to either the upper arm <b>130</b> or the lower arm <b>140</b> of the apparatus.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">At this point it should be noted that the resonator structures <b>130[1]...130[6]</b> are shown as being outside of the Mach-Zehnder structure. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that such resonators (either ring resonators or others) may be within the Mach-Zehnder structure(s) as well. For the purposes of the present invention, it is only required that such resonator structures be optically coupled to the Mach-Zehnder arms of the apparatus.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">When configured in this manner, the apparatus depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIG 1</b></figref> acts as a 6<sup>th</sup> order pole/zero filter. This apparatus (filter) employs the resonators <b>130[1]...130[6]</b> to engineer the phase(es) in the arms <b>110, 120</b>. Advantageously, such a filter may emulate the various passband characteristics of other known filter types, including Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Elliptical.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">While such a prior art filter configuration like that shown in <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIG 1</b></figref> does achieve a somewhat narrow, box-like response with an arrangement of relatively low order (in this example 6<sup>th</sup> order) it unfortunately is susceptible to waveguide losses as sharp ring resonance group delay responses are required (large <i>Q</i> = <i>d</i>λ/λ, where <i>Q</i> is the amount of optical power within an individual ring). Such an understanding may be appreciated with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIG 2</b></figref><b>,</b> which shows a graph of Insertion Loss (dB) vs. Normalized Frequency and illustrates the impact of loss on the in-band loss and filter shape. The data used in this <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIG 2</b></figref> is that for a 4<sup>th</sup> order filter and 10% passband. As can be readily appreciated, loss has a significant impact on the passband.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Advantageously, and according to the present invention, two pole/zero filters may be concatenated such that an ultra-narrow passband frequency response is realized - without the attendant loss which plagues the prior art. More particularly, the frequency response of each of the two filters that comprise the overall apparatus overlap nominally less than 50% at each side of the desired passband. Consequently, by varying the component filters that comprise the apparatus, nearly any required frequency slice may be produced. In this manner, the resulting passband is the multiplication of the two filter responses.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Turning now to <figref idrefs="f0003"><b>FIG 3</b></figref><b>,</b> there is shown a concatenated filter <b>300</b> according to the present invention comprising two individual multiple-order filters 370, and <b>380.</b> The first filter <b>370,</b> includes one or more input waveguides <b>303, 305</b> and one or more output waveguides <b>307, 309</b> optically connected respectively by a pair of waveguide arms <b>320,</b> and <b>310.</b> Accordingly, an optical signal applied to an input waveguide will exit through an output waveguide after traversing the apparatus via upper arm 320 and/or lower arm <b>310.</b> Finally, the first filter <b>370</b> includes a plurality of ring resonators <b>330[1]...330[6],</b> certain ones of which are optically coupled to either the upper arm <b>320</b> or the lower arm <b>310</b> of the filter.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The second filter <b>380</b> is similarly configured and includes one or more input waveguides <b>313, 315</b> and one or more output waveguides <b>317, 319</b> optically connected respectively by a pair of waveguide arms <b>350,</b> and <b>340.</b> As such, an optical signal applied to an input waveguide will exit through an output waveguide after traversing the apparatus via upper arm <b>340</b> and/or lower arm <b>350.</b> Like the first filter <b>370,</b> this second filter <b>380</b> includes a plurality of ring resonators <b>360[1]...360[6],</b> certain ones of which are optically coupled to either the upper arm <b>350</b> or the lower arm <b>340</b> of this second filter.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The filters <b>370, 380</b> are concatenated such that an output waveguide <b>309</b> of the first filter <b>370</b> is optically connected to an input waveguide <b>313</b> of the second filter <b>380.</b> Of course those skilled in the art will appreciate that this optical connection is merely exemplary, and alternatively the other output of the first filter may be connected to the other input of the second filter.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As can be observed from <figref idrefs="f0003"><b>FIG 3</b></figref><b>,</b> an optical signal entering the first filter <b>370</b> is output at an output waveguide <b>309</b> and then introduced into an input waveguide <b>313</b> of the second filter <b>380.</b> Advantageously, filtered through signals <b>390</b> are output at<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> output waveguide <b>317</b> while filtered cross (drop) signals <b>395</b> are output at output waveguide <b>319.</b> Those skilled in the art will quickly recognize the advantages associated with having both through and drop signals available at outputs of a single filter structure wherein the through signals are those output signals which fall within the passband of the overall cascaded filter and the drop signals are those output signals which fall outside of the passband of the overall cascaded filter.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">This concatenated configuration results in the interleaving of the frequency responses of the individual filters. As noted earlier the frequency response of each of the individual filters overlaps the desired passband by an amount substantially less than 50%. As depicted in <figref idrefs="f0004"><b>FIG 4</b></figref><b>,</b> when such overlap is achieved, the filter response of the concatenated structure is the multiplication of each of the individual filters.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">More specifically, <b>4(A)</b> shows a graph of the total passband relative to the narrow passband of the present invention (Circled Region). The narrow passband is shown in a more detailed graph in <b>4(B),</b> showing the relationship between the narrow passband of the cascaded filter of the present invention, relative to the passband(s) of component filters <b>F1</b> and <b>F2.</b> Finally, <b>4(C)</b> shows diagrammatically that the overall response of a filter constructed according to the present invention is a multiplication of the two component filters <b>F1</b> and <b>F2,</b> wherein <b>PassBand = F1(x)F2.</b></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">To configure the concatenated filter, each individual filter passband response is configured separately. As can be appreci ated, the filter passband for each may be set to allow a relatively wide range of frequencies which - in turn - minimize filter loss.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Subsequently - and according to the present invention - an individual filter passband is overlapped by the other filter's passband (See, e.g., <figref idrefs="f0004"><b>FIG 4(B)</b></figref>). The width of the overlap determines the width of the desired cascaded filter frequency response, i.e., passband.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As can now be appreciated, a particular advantage of the present invention is the relief if waveguide loss constraints are needed in a single stage filter. Also, the total optical power throughput is significantly improved and therefore improves the signal to noise ratio of the device. In addition, a broad range of passband widths may be implemented without introducing variation of the filter access loss. Finally, any crosstalk associated with neighboring channels is significantly reduced.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">It should be noted that if a narrow passband such as that according to the instant invention were attempted using a single MZ structure, extremely high <i>Q</i> values for the resonators (∼&gt;100,000) would be required. In addition, very low loss ring resonators would be required as well.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In contrast, devices constructed according to the present invention substantially relax these requirements thereby enhancing their reproducibility, manufacturing ease, and relatively low cost. More particularly, <i>Q</i> values substantially less than the 100,000 previously mentioned are effective with the present invention. In fact, <i>Q</i> values on the order of 20,000 - 50,000 are particularly useful and effective. A particular advantage of the instant invention is that the overall passband may be changed - without changing the individual <i>Q</i> characteristics of the individual resonators.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In addition, while the present invention has been shown and described using an exemplary number of ring resonators (i.e., 3 in each arm of an individual MZ structure) those skilled in the art will appreciate that the number of resonators may be varied, depending upon the particular passband requirements. In particular, as few as three (3) resonators total or as many as ten (10) for each MZ structure are useful for foreseeable applications. Of course, when the total number of resonators in a MZ structure is an odd number, then the MZ structure is "unbalanced" - that is there is an unequal number of resonators in each of the arms comprising the particular MZ structure. Lastly, the number of resonators in the two cascaded filters comprising the overall apparatus need not be equal as well. Consequently, the present invention is quite flexible in its implementation and application.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Finally, and a particular advantageous aspect of the present invention, is that it may be constructed from a variety of known materials including, but not limited to Silicon, Lithium Niobate, etc. More particularly, it may be constructed from any material having a core index which is different from a cladding index - or even where the "cladding index" is provided by air or other environmental ambient.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">At this point, while the present invention has been shown and described using some specific examples, those skilled in the art will recognize that the teachings are not so limited. Accordingly, the invention should be only limited by the scope of the claims attached hereto.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56985107" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Optisches Filter, umfassend:
