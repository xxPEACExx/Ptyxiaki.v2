The methods of the invention include measuring special biomarker at some time following the initiation of immunotherapy treatment to evaluate the clinical outcome of the said treatment. The invention thus has applications to the field of medicine.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Traditional vaccination techniques involving the introduction into an animal system of an antigen (e.g. peptides, proteins) which can induce an immune response, and thereby protect said animal against infection for example, have been known for many years. These techniques have further included the development of both live and inactivated vaccines. Live vaccines are typically attenuated non-pathogenic versions of an infectious agent that are capable of priming an immune response directed against a pathogenic version of the infectious agent.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In recent years there have been advances in the development of recombinant vaccines, especially recombinant live vaccines, in which foreign antigens of interest are encoded and expressed from a vector. Among them, vectors based on recombinant viruses have shown great promise and play an important role in the development of new vaccines. Many viruses have been investigated for their ability to express proteins from foreign pathogens or tumor tissue, and to induce specific immunological responses against these<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> antigens in <i>vivo.</i> Generally, these gene-based vaccines can stimulate potent humoral and cellular immune responses and viral vectors may be an effective strategy for both the delivery of antigen-encoding genes and the facilitation and enhancement of antigen presentation. In order to be utilized as a vaccine carrier, the ideal viral vector should be safe and enable efficient presentation of required pathogen-specific antigens to the immune system. Furthermore, the vector system must meet criteria that enable its production on a large-scale basis. Several viral vaccine vectors have thus emerged to date, all of them having relative advantages and limits depending on the proposed application (for a review on recombinant viral vaccines see for example <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Harrop and Carroll, 2006, Front Biosci., 11, 804-817</text></nplcit> ; <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Yokoyama et al., 1997, J Vet Med Sci.,59, 311-322</text></nplcit>). The use of the said recombinant vaccines is commonly named targeted immunotherapy or antigen specific and active immunotherapy.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Following the observation in the early 1990's that plasmid DNA vectors could directly transfect animal cells in vivo, significant research efforts have also been undertaken to develop immunotherapy techniques based upon the use of DNA plasmids to induce immune response, by direct introduction into animals of DNA which encodes for antigens. Such techniques which are widely referred as DNA vaccination, or DNA immunotherapy, have now been used to elicit protective immune responses in large number of disease models. For a review on DNA vaccines, see <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Reyes-Sandoval and Ertl, 2001 (Current Molecular Medicine, 1, 217-243</text></nplcit>).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A general problem in immunotherapy field however has been the identification of a means of inducing a sufficiently strong immune response in treated individuals to protect against infection and disease.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Therefore there has been for example major effort in recent years, to discover new drug compounds that act by stimulating certain key aspects of the immune system which will serve to increase the immune response induced by immunotherapies. Most of these compounds, referred as immune response modifiers (IRMs) or adjuvants, appear to act through basic immune system mechanisms via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to induce various important cytokines biosynthesis (e.g. interferons, interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, etc. see for example <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Schiller et al., 2006, Exp Dermatol., 15, 331-341</text></nplcit>). Such compounds have been shown to stimulate a rapid release of certain dendritic cell, monocyte/macrophage-derived cytokines and are also capable of stimulating B cells to secrete antibodies which play an important role in the antiviral and antitumor activities of IRM compounds.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Alternatively, immunotherapy strategies have been proposed, most of them being based on a prime-boost vaccination regimen. According to these "prime-boost" immunotherapy protocols, the immune system is first induced by administering to the patient a priming composition and then boosted by administration of a boosting second composition (see for example <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1411974A"><text>EP1411974</text></patcit> or <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20030191076A"><text>US20030191076</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Moreover, it has been shown in the health care context that one treatment can be effective only in specific group of patients. It is thus desirable to provide to physicians tools and methods that will enable them to tailor optimal personalized patient therapies, i.e. to prescribe the right therapy to the right patient at right time, to provide a higher treatment success rate, to monitor the response to the treatment, to increase drug efficacy and safety, to eliminate the unnecessary treatment of patients for whom therapy is not appropriate, to spare the patient unnecessary toxicity and side effects, to reduce the cost to patients and insurers of<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> unnecessary or dangerous ineffective medication, and to improve patient quality of life, eventually making cancer a managed disease, with follow up assays as appropriate.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">With these regards, literature proposes various tools and methods, such as for example :
<ul><li>Pharmacogenetics, which consist in the study of individual response to drugs as a function of genetic differences. These responses relate to how a drug functions in any given individual, how it is metabolized, its toxicity and dosage requirements. With the human genome project, pharmacogenetics has expanded into pharmacogenomics. Pharmacogenomics goes beyond pharmacogenetics, with the potential to find uses from drug discovery and development, target discovery and validation, and clinical trials;</li><li>Metabolomics can also be applied to the field of predictive medicine. Unlike pharmacogenetics, which is limited to genetic factors, pharmaco-metabolomics is able to predict an individual's response to a drug based not only on genetic factors, but also non-genetic factors, such as other drugs in the patient's body, the patient's current state of health, etc.</li><li>The role of biomarkers is becoming increasingly important in the clinical development of therapeutics. A biomarker can be an indicator of normal biological processes, disease processes, or pharmacological responses to therapeutic intervention. Their role ranges from, stratifying the patient population in helping to identify responders versus non-responders to determining the efficacy of the therapeutic. Biomarkers can be a valuable tool in making better decisions that will reduce the cost for drug development and enable therapies to reach the right patient population faster.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Several publications describe the determination of levels of CD3+ and/or CD69+ T cells in patients in connection with different disease states or different treatments, e. g.<nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text> Rossi et al.

A non-oncogenic HPV-16 E7 variant which is suitable for the purpose of the present invention is deleted of one or more amino acid residues located from approximately position 21 to approximately position 26 (+1 representing the first amino acid of the native HPV-16 E7 polypeptide, with a special<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> preference for the complete deletion of residues 21 to 26 (DLYCYE). According to a preferred embodiment, the one or more HPV-16 early polypeptide(s) in use in the invention is/are further modified so as to improve MHC class I and/or MHC class II presentation, and/or to stimulate anti-HPV immunity. HPV E6 and E7 polypeptides are nuclear proteins and it has been previously shown that membrane presentation permits to improve their therapeutic efficacy (see for example <patcit id="pcit0019" dnum="WO9903885A"><text>WO99/03885</text></patcit>). Thus, it may be advisable to modify at least one of the HPV early polypeptide(s) so as to be anchored to the cell membrane. Membrane anchorage can be easily achieved by incorporating in the HPV early polypeptide a membrane-anchoring sequence and if the native polypeptide lacks it a secretory sequence (i.e. a signal peptide). Membrane-anchoring and secretory sequences are known in the art. Briefly, secretory sequences are present at the N-terminus of the membrane presented or secreted polypeptides and initiate their passage into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). They usually comprise 15 to 35 essentially hydrophobic amino acids which are then removed by a specific ER-located endopeptidase to give the mature polypeptide. Membrane-anchoring sequences are usually highly hydrophobic in nature and serves to anchor the polypeptides in the cell membrane (see for example <nplcit id="ncit0018" npl-type="s"><text>Branden and Tooze, 1991, in Introduction to Protein Structure p. 202-214, NY Garl</text></nplcit>and).</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The choice of the membrane-anchoring and secretory sequences which can be used in the context of the present invention is vast.

The membrane anchoring and/or secretory sequences inserted in each of the<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> early HPV-16 polypeptides used according to the invention may have a common or different origin.

According to another special embodiment, said heterologous nucleotide sequence encodes one or more fusion protein wherein the configuration is not native in the sense that at least one of the NS polypeptides appears in an order which is distinct from that of the native configuration. Thus, if the fusion protein comprises a NS3 polypeptide, a NS4A polypeptide and a NS5B polypeptide, the native configuration would be NS3-NS4A-NS5B with NS3 at the N-terminus and NS5B at the C-terminus.

As used herein, the term "regulatory sequence" refers to any sequence that allows, contributes or modulates the expression of a nucleic acid in a given host cell, including replication, duplication, transcription, splicing, translation, stability and/or transport of the nucleic acid or one of its derivative (i.e. mRNA) into the host cell. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the choice of the regulatory sequences can depend on factors such as the host cell, the vector and the level of expression desired. The nucleic acid encoding the antigen is operatively linked to a gene<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> expression sequence which directs the expression of the antigen nucleic acid within a eukaryotic cell. The gene expression sequence is any regulatory nucleotide sequence, such as a promoter sequence or promoter-enhancer combination, which facilitates the efficient transcription and translation of the antigen nucleic acid to which it is operatively linked. The gene expression sequence may, for example, be a mammalian or viral promoter, such as a constitutive or inducible promoter. Constitutive mammalian promoters include, but are not limited to, the promoters for the following genes: hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT), adenosine deaminase, pyruvate kinase, b-actin promoter and other constitutive promoters. Exemplary viral promoters which function constitutively in eukaryotic cells include, for example, promoters from the cytomegalovirus (CMV), simian virus (e.g., SV40), papilloma virus, adenovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Rous sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, the long terminal repeats (LTR) of Moloney leukemia virus and other retroviruses, and the thymidine kinase promoter of herpes simplex virus. Other constitutive promoters are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The promoters useful as gene expression sequences of the invention also include inducible promoters. Inducible promoters are expressed in the presence of an inducing agent. For example, the metallothionein promoter is induced to promote transcription and translation in the presence of certain metal ions. Other inducible promoters are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In general, the gene expression sequence shall include, as necessary, 5' non-transcribing and 5' non-translating sequences involved with the initiation of transcription and translation, respectively, such as a TATA box, capping sequence, CAAT sequence, and the like.
