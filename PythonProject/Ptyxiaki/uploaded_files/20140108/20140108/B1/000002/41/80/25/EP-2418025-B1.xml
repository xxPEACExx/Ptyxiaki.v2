Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, an articulated robot 2 is mounted on a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> machine base 1. A later-described bending mechanism 30 that bends a longitudinal workpiece 4 such as a pipe is attached to the articulated robot 2. The articulated robot 2 includes three bending joints, i.e., first to third bending joints 6, 8 and 10, of which bending axes extend in a direction orthogonal to a direction of a link between two members connected with a joint, and two pivoting joints, i.e., first and second pivoting joints 12 and 14, of which pivoting axes extend in the same direction as the direction of the link between the two members connected with the joint.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The articulated robot 2 is provided with a fixing portion 16 mounted on the machine base 1. The fixing portion 16 and a first turning base 18 are connected by the first rotating joint 12. The first pivoting joint 12 has a known mechanism that rotationally drives the first turning base 18 at a predetermined angle around a vertical axis CV1.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">One end of a first arm 20 is connected to the first turning base 18 via the first bending joint 6. The first bending joint 6 has a known mechanism that rotationally drives the first arm 20 at a predetermined angle around a horizontal axis CH1. The horizontal axis CH1 of the first bending joint 6 and the vertical axis CV1 of the first pivoting joint 12 cross at right angles.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">An other end of the first arm 20 and one end of a second arm 22 is connected via the second bending joint 8. The<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> second bending joint 8 has a known mechanism that rotationally drives the second arm 22 at a predetermined angle around an axis CH2 parallel to the horizontal axis CH1 of the first bending joint 6.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A second turning base 24 is connected to an other end of the second arm 22 via the second pivoting joint 14. The second pivoting joint 14 has a known mechanism that rotationally drives the second turning base 24 at a predetermined angle around an axis CV2 orthogonal to the horizontal axes CH1 and CH2 of the first and second bending joints 6 and 8. One end of a front arm 26 is connected to the second turning base 24 via the third bending joint 10. The third bending joint 10 rotates the front arm 26 around an axis CH3 parallel to the horizontal axes CH1 and CH2 of the first and second bending joints 6 and 8.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, a supplemental joint 28 is provided at a front end of the front arm 26. The bending mechanism 30 is attached to the supplemental joint 28. The supplemental joint 28 is mechanically synchronized with the third bending joint 10. When the third bending joint 10 rotates the front arm 26 by 360°, the supplemental joint 28 rotates the bending mechanism 30 by 360°. The supplemental joint 28 may rotate independently of the third bending joint 10.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The bending mechanism 30, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGS. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">6</figref>, includes a bending die 32. The bending die 32 is formed of three grooves 34, 36 and 38 stacked in an axial direction of the bending die 32. The three grooves 34, 36 and 38 correspond to three different bending radii. The bending mechanism 30 also includes a clamping die 42 that is driven by a cylinder 40 to move toward the bending die 32 and clamps the workpiece 4 together with the bending die 32. The clamping die 42 is configured to be able to move around the bending die 32 with the workpiece 4 being clamped. Bending can be achieved by rotating the clamping die 42 at a predetermined angle. A pressure die 44 that receives a reaction force upon bending is provided in line with the clamping die 42. Bending is not limited to compression bending but can be draw bending.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a chuck mechanism 46 that grips a rear end of the workpiece 4 is provided. The chuck mechanism 46 is attached to the fixing table 48. The chuck mechanism 46 is configured to grip the workpiece 4 to be horizontal, and to be orthogonal to the vertical axis CV1 of the first pivoting joint 12. Further, on both sides of the articulated robot 2, a receiving table for carry-in 50 and a receiving table for carry-out 52 are respectively provided.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The articulated robot 2 can control a posture and a moving position of the bending mechanism 30, as shown in<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> <figref idrefs="f0011">FIGS. 11A, 11B</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0012">12A to 12E</figref>, by rotating the first to third bending joints 6, 8 and 10 and the first and the second pivoting joints 12 and 14.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0011">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, the articulated robot 2 can move the bending mechanism 30 so that a bending direction of the workpiece 4 coincides with a direction of the groove 34 of the bending die 32 according to the bending direction of the workpiece 4. In the present embodiment, the third bending joint 10 and the supplemental joint 28 are in a certain synchronizing relation. Thus, if the bending direction is defined, positions of the front arm 26 and the third bending joint 10 are defined by causing the groove 34 to abut on the workpiece 4.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A position of the second bending joint 8 is on an arc around the first bending joint 6, of which radius is a distance between the first bending joint 6 and the second bending joint 8. The position of the second bending joint 8 is also on an arc around the third bending joint 10, of which radius is a distance between the second bending joint 8 and the third bending joint 10. Accordingly, if the second bending joint 8 is in an intersection between the two arcs, a position of the bending die 32 is defined. There may be a case in which two intersections exist. In that case, one of the intersections is selected which does not cause the second arm 22 to interfere with the workpiece 4, and which does not cause a front end<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> of the workpiece 4 after bent to interfere with the second arm 22.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In this manner, the positions of the respective first to third bending joints 6, 8 and 10 are defined. As a result, an angle formed between the fixing portion 16 and the first arm 20, an angle formed between the first arm 20 and the second arm 22, and an angle formed between the second arm 22 and the front end arm 26 are respectively calculated. According to the respective angles calculated, the first arm 20, the second arm 22 and the front arm 26 are rotated at predetermined angles by the respective first to third bending joints 6, 8 and 10. Thereby, the groove 34 of the bending die 32 is moved to abut on the workpiece 4.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12A</figref>, when the first arm 20, the second arm 22 and the front arm 26 of the articulated robot 2 are within a plane orthogonal to the workpiece 4, the bending mechanism 30 can be moved around the workpiece 4 by rotating the first to third bending joints 6, 8 and 10 so that the bending direction is set to a predetermined direction, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0011">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12B</figref>, when a bending position is on the front end side of the workpiece 4, the bending mechanism 30 is moved such that the first pivoting joint 12 is driven and the second pivoting joint 14 is driven to the side opposite to the first pivoting joint 12, so that an axial direction of the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> front arm 26 is orthogonal to the workpiece 4. Also, the first to third bending joints 6, 8 and 10 are driven. When the first pivoting joint 12 is rotated, the bending mechanism 30 is moved away from the workpiece 4. Thus, the first to third bending joints 6, 8 and 10 are driven to make the groove 34 of the bending die 32 abut on the workpiece 4. A bending shape can be changed by making the other grooves 36 and 38 abut on the workpiece 4.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12C</figref>, also in the case of bending the workpiece 4 at the bending position close to the chuck mechanism 46, the first pivoting joint 12 is driven to move the bending mechanism 30 to the bending position.
