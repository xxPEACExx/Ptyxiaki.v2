multi-dimensional filtering of ultrasound scan data for antialiasing or reconstruction for the purpose of re-sampling with the aim of scaling, interpolation and decimation.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background of the invention</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Ultrasound diagnostic imaging systems are in widespread use by cardiologists, obstetricians, radiologists and others for examinations of the heart, a developing fetus, internal abdominal organs and other anatomical structures.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Conventional ultrasound imaging systems comprise an array of ultrasonic transducers which transmit waves of ultrasound energy into the body, receiving ultrasound echo signals that have been scattered from tissue upon which the waves impinge. The transmitted waves are shaped and timed from each transducer so that they form ultrasound beams (also called 'lines of sight') that radiate from the transducer array surface (this process is called 'beam forming'): the received echo signals are also processed to reinforce the effect of beam forming, so that the received signals represent the ultrasound scattering measured along the lines of sight.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The received signals are sampled and digitized to provide an array of samples that represent the ultrasound scattering at spatial locations within the scanned volume. The samples provide measurements of the signal at specific positions (usually positions in space and time) separated by intervals (usually intervals of time, spatial distance or angle).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Co-ordinate systems that are common or convenient for analysis, processing or rendering of ultrasound data are often different from the co-ordinate systems that are defined by the original scan geometry. So the original sample data must be re-sampled and processed to provide an' array of samples at uniformly spaced positions along the new target coordinate axes.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For example the most common co-ordinate system for processing and rendering of the ultrasound data is rectangular Cartesian (because displays tend to be rectangular and because most processing algorithms assume a rectangular Cartesian input) so the data must be re-sampled to be evenly spaced within a rectangular Cartesian co-ordinate system in preparation for processing or rendering. A rectangular Cartesian sampled data co-ordinate system is also convenient for processing and analysis because each sample<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> represents the same volume. So in this case the original sample data must be re-sampled to provide an array of samples at uniformly spaced positions along rectangular Cartesian co-ordinate axes.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A method according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4471449A"><text>US 4,471,449</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is common to desire that a set of samples of an ultrasound image be used to calculate a larger or smaller set whose sample spacings may be smaller or larger than those of the original set, and whose sample positions may lie between the input samples, and where some original samples may no longer be desired, and this requires re-sampling.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The process of re-sampling should satisfy the requirements of Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theory (hereinafter called Sampling Theory), which defines the conditions under which a set of samples can completely determine the underlying continuous signal. In particular Sampling Theory requires that during re-sampling, input samples must be filtered using filters whose characteristics depend on the original and the new sample spacings.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Current methods of designing filters for re-sampling in ultrasound use filters that cannot be shown to satisfy the requirements of Sampling Theory. Current methods of filtering and re-sampling in ultrasound design filters relative to the target co-ordinate system, where the original samples are not uniformly spaced so Sampling Theory cannot be directly applied.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Current methods of designing filters for re-sampling in ultrasound have the aim of producing a pleasing visual display. There is no formal definition of 'pleasing' but this usually means a visual display tends to show smooth areas and well-defined boundaries. The genuine underlying data are distorted in order to render this visually pleasing display, so valuable information is lost and false artifacts may be introduced. Such filters are designed through arguments on ill-defined effects such as 'smoothing' and are not characterized by direct applications of Sampling Theory. In particular the mathematical requirements of Sampling Theory are not satisfied, because a pleasing visual display does not require that the underlying signal be completely determined.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Some current methods of filtering for re-sampling in ultrasound use non-linear filters (such as 'median' filters') whose characteristics cannot be calculated directly as applied to Sampling Theory and so which cannot be shown to satisfy the requirements of Sampling Theory.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">There is therefore a need to develop new methods for designing and implementing linear filters for re-sampling ultrasound data, respecting the requirements of Sampling Theory so that the data are not distorted and so that valuable information is not lost. It is accordingly, an object of the present invention to provide a novel method and system for designing and implementing linear filters for re-sampling of ultrasound scan data. It is also an object of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the art, or to provide a useful alternative thereto.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the invention</b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention relates to filtering and re-sampling of ultrasound scan data that spans an n-dimensional volume (hereafter called "nD"), for example (but not limited to) a 3D spatial volume. In particular, the present invention relates to re-sampling the ultrasound scan data from co-ordinate geometries in which the samples are uniformly spaced along each axis in the units appropriate to that axis, into a different co-ordinate space where the original samples are not uniformly spaced, but where the new target samples will be uniformly spaced. For example, the invention relates to re-sampling from samples that are uniformly distributed along the axes of a non-Cartesian co-ordinate system that naturally matches the scan geometry, to samples that are uniformly distributed along the axes of a rectangular Cartesian co-ordinate system. In an embodiment, this re-sampling uses anti-alias and reconstruction filters that are designed in the original scan co-ordinate system.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The present invention relates to a method of re-sampling ultrasound scan data in such a way that the underlying signal remains completely determined according to the requirements of Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theory, and whose effects may be calculated readily using linear mathematical models.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In particular, the present invention relates to a method of re-sampling ultrasound scan data according to claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The present method has the advantage that the underlying signal remains completely determined and may be further processed and analyzed without distortion or loss of information. This is because the method allows the filters to be designed by direct application of Sampling Theory.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In contrast with the present invention, prior art methods design re-sampling filters in the desired target co-ordinate system, in which the original samples are spaced non-uniformly and so filter design using Sampling Theory (which assumes uniform sample spacing) is not possible: so these filters cannot be shown not to result in distortion or loss of information. The present inventors have shown that by directly applying Sampling Theory and Shannon's method for reconstruction the underlying signal remains completely determined and may be further processed and analyzed without distortion or loss of information.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The present method has the further advantage that it can retain maximum information for minimum data size, and so allows storage requirements and computation to be kept to a minimum. This is because the minimum number of samples necessary to completely determine the underlying signal, and the necessary filter designs, can be calculated directly by application of Sampling Theory and filter length estimation (for example Kaiser's method).</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In contrast with the present invention, prior art cannot directly apply Sampling Theory to calculate the minimum number of samples necessary to completely determine the underlying signal, so that either more samples may be used than are necessary, or the signal may be distorted or information may be lost.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In addition, the present method has the advantage of being mathematically correct and satisfying Sampling Theory, and so can be subject to rigorous mathematical analysis.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Also, the present method has the advantage of offering a computationally efficient implementation by direct application of an nD filter kernel using a polyphase implementation, because of the uniform spacing of the target samples.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">By contrast, prior art methods have a non-uniform spacing of original samples relative to the filter kernel which complicates the filter implementation.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The present invention also provides an apparatus and system for re-sampling ultrasound scan data from various original n-dimensional scan geometries and sample spaces, to a uniform n-dimensional sample grid (often, but not only, rectangular Cartesian) that is convenient for further processing and that reduces the amount of data while retaining the original information according to the measures of Sampling Theory and the physical characteristics of the ultrasound scanning process. The present invention greatly simplifies the display, extraction of features from, and analysis of n-dimensional ultrasound scan data by providing an n-dimensional sample space that is convenient to process and that reduces the amount of data to be processed without undue loss of genuine information.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The present invention in particular provides an apparatus for re-sampling ultrasound scan data according to claim 14.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The present invention also provides an ultrasound processing system according to claim 15.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><heading id="h0004"><b>Detailed description of the invention</b></heading><p id="p0026" num="0026">The present invention relates to a method of re-sampling ultrasound scan data in such a way that the underlying signal remains completely determined according to the requirements of Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theory, and whose effects may be calculated readily using linear mathematical models. For example standard methods of sample rate conversion may be used. Suitable standard methods of sample rate conversion are described in <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Crochiere and Rabiner, "Multirate Digital Signal Processing", ISBN 0-13-605162-6</text></nplcit>).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Shannon's Sampling Theorem (<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Claude E Shannon, "Communication in the presence of noise", Proc IRE, vol 37, No 1, Jan 1949</text></nplcit>, reprinted in <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Proc IEEE, Vol 86, No. 2, February 1998</text></nplcit>) states that a band-limited signal is completely determined by samples spaced at uniform intervals (<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="b"><text>Oppenheim and Schafer, 'Discrete Time Signal Processing, Prentice Hall, ISBN 0-13-216771-9</text></nplcit>).That is, if the signal is represented by a function f(t) whose Fourier Transform contains no frequencies higher than W, then the signal is completely determined by its ordinates (samples) at a series of points spaced W/2 apart. The spacing W/2 is called the Nyquist interval and is the largest spacing between samples for which the signal is completely determined. Thus the Nyquist interval spacing represents the sample spacing for which the minimum number of samples, and hence the minimum amount of data, completely determine the signal. Moreover, Sampling Theory is proved for the case where the sample spacing is uniform (that is, all samples are spaced an equal distance apart). As used herein the term "band-limited" means the signal's Fourier transform or power spectral density is zero above a certain finite frequency (that is, the signal's Fourier Transform or power spectral density has finite support). As used herein the term "Completely determined" means that the value of the original signal at any coordinate may be reconstructed from the samples.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">According to the invention during re-sampling, input samples are filtered using reconstruction filters whose characteristics depend on the original and the new sample spacings, and whose design must follow Shannon's specification. Suitable reconstruction filters are described for example in<nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text> Claude E Shannon, Proc IRE, vol 37, No 1, Jan 1949</text></nplcit>, and in <nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="b"><text>Oppenheim and Schafer, 'Discrete Time Signal Processing, Prentice Hall, ISBN 0-13-216771-9</text></nplcit>.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As used herein the term "re-sampling" refers to the process of calculating (from the original data samples) the samples that would have been obtained at the new desired sample positions.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In an embodiment, the present method comprises (a) the step of obtaining sampled ultrasound scan data acquired from a beam forming system.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The sample positions and units are determined by the probe and scan geometry, and are most easily described using a co-ordinate system that matches the scan geometry and within which the samples are uniformly spaced along each of the co-ordinate axes, according to the units that are natural to that axis. For example a probe and scan geometry that generates beams radiating in three dimensions from a common center is most easily described using a spherical polar co-ordinate system: the radial dimension<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> being aligned with the axis of the ultrasound lines of sight (also referred herein as the 'axis' dimension) and with the two angular dimensions representing the angular positions of the beams within a frame (also referred herein as the 'azimuth' dimension) and the angular position of frames (also referred herein as the 'elevation' dimension).</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The next steps in the present method comprise: (b) defining desired target sample positions in a target n-dimensional co-ordinate system, that are uniformly spaced along each axis when measured in units appropriate to that axis; and (c) mapping the target sample positions into the original co-ordinate system.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As used herein the term "mapping" means expressing the target sample positions using the coordinate system of the original sample co-ordinate system. The original signal at each of these mapped target sample positions may now be reconstructed using a reconstruction filter designed according to Shannon's or another standard method. The reconstruction filter is designed in the original scan co-ordinate system.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The next step in the present method comprises: (d) quantizing the positions of the mapped target samples so that they fall on simple exact integer sub-spacings between the original sample positions and so may be described as having uniform spacings along each axis of the original scan co-ordinate system when measured in units that are appropriate to that axis. Each target sample now has a position relative to its neighbors ('relative position' means the difference between the target co-ordinates and the coordinates of each of its nearest neighbors). Each position of the target sample relative to its neighbors may require a different reconstruction interpolating filter. This means that potentially a large number of reconstruction filters would be needed - one for each unique relative target sample position. However if the calculated target sample positions are quantized (meaning, approximated to a finite numeric precision) in the original co-ordinate system then the number of unique relative positions, and thus the number of unique reconstruction filters required, may be limited. For example if the original scan coordinates are spaced at integer multiples of a separation d, then if the target sample coordinates are quantized to a numeric precision of one decimal place then there will be only 10 relative positions and thus only 10 required interpolation filters.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">As used herein the term "quantizing" means converting the position, expressed as a set of co-ordinates in some numeric precision, to a lower numeric precision. "Quantizing the positions" here means, calculating the co-ordinates of the target samples (in the original scan geometry) to some numeric precision, and then converting to a lower numeric precision. For example if the co-ordinates are calculated to 32-bit IEEE floating point<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> numeric precision then they may be quantized to 16-bit integer, or to 16-bit fractional fixed point precision.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The quantizing of position of step (d) reduces the number of different reconstruction filter kernels of step (e) that are required. Each position of the target sample relative to its neighbors requires a different reconstruction interpolating filter.
