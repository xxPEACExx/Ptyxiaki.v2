More particularly, the present invention relates to a strength member for an automobile body which is manufactured by carrying out bending in which the bending direction varies two-dimensionally such as S-bending or bending in which the bending direction which varies three-dimensionally, a front side member which is a strength member of an automobile body, and a side construction of an automobile body, and specifically a side structure of an automobile body having an A-pillar, a B-pillar, and a roof rail side member. The application is further directed to a manufacturing method of such a strength member bent product.</p><heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In the past, automobiles employed a so-called frame construction in which parts such as an engine, a radiator, a suspension, a transmission, a differential, a fuel tank, and the like were mounted on a frame formed by assembling members with a box-shaped cross section in the form of a ladder, and then mounting a body having an engine compartment, a passenger compartment, and a trunk atop the body. However, a frame construction always uses a heavy frame which is a separate member from the body, so it is difficult to decrease the weight of the body. In addition, since a process of joining the frame to the body is unavoidable, productivity is poor. Therefore, almost all automobiles manufactured in recent years have a monocoque body (unit construction body) in which the frame and the body are integral with each other.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A monocoque body supports a load atop an integral body shell comprising a body side formed by combining a side sill, an A-pillar, a B-pillar, a roof rail side member, and in some cases a C-pillar with an underbody (also referred to as a platform) which is the most important part and forms the base of the body structure and is the bottom surface, namely the floor portion of a monocoque body. When portions of the body contract or collapse under an externally applied impact load, the impact energy is absorbed by the body parts as a whole.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A monocoque body does not have a clearly defined frame as is the case with a frame construction, but in portions where loads and stress concentrate such as<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> mounting portions for the engine and a suspension, the body shell is reinforced by suitable installation of automobile body strength members formed from tubular members with a closed cross section such as side members, suspension members, various pillars, cross members, roof rail side members, and side sills. The body side and the underbody not only greatly affect the bending stiffness and torsional stiffness of an automobile body, but at the time of a side impact, they have the function of minimizing damage to the passenger compartment and increasing the safety of passengers. In particular, compared to a front impact, it is difficult to adequately guarantee space for protecting passengers during a side impact, so it is important to increase the stiffness of the body side.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Among strength members which are disposed in this manner are "side members" (also referred to as the subframe). These members form the skeleton which is interposed when mounting the suspension, the engine, the transmission, or the like on the underbody. The underbody greatly affects the various types of stiffness (such as the bending stiffness and the torsional stiffness) of the body for supporting the suspension and the drive train, so by suitably installing side members and other reinforcing members in various portions of the underbody, the underbody is given sufficient stiffness. One such side member is a front side member which extends generally horizontally in the fore and aft direction on the left and right sides of the engine compartment and is welded in place.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Normally, a front side member has a body comprising a tube having a closed cross section having a shape such as a rectangle, a hexagon, a circle, or the like. The body has a front end portion which extends in the axial direction of the body from one end of the body towards the other end of the body in the fore and aft direction of the vehicle body, a sloping portion which is continuous with the front end portion and which is sloped along the dash panel which is a wall between the engine compartment and the passenger compartment, and a rear end portion which is continuous with the sloping portion and extends along the floor panel is connected to the dash panel. Although it depends upon the size of the vehicle body, the overall length of the front side member is around 600 - 1200 mm.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As stated above, a front side member is a strength member, the most important requirement of which is to maintain the strength of the underbody. Therefore, it is designed so as to have adequate strength. It is also the main member which bears an impact load applied at the time of a front impact collision.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> -->Accordingly, it is designed so that if a front impact collision occurs, it has impact absorbing properties such that it can absorb impact energy by plastic deformation of its front end by buckling into an accordion shape. In this manner, a front side member must have the mutually opposite properties that it have adequate strength and that its front end portion easily undergo plastic deformation into the shape of an accordion when an impact load is applied.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">As stated above, a front side member is welded to other panels as a reinforcing member for the underbody, so it is also required to have excellent weldability and excellent workability such that it can have a complicated shape from its front end portion to its rear end portion and such that it can be subjected to punching or cutting.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Patent Application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP0449599A1"><text>EP 0 449 599 A1</text></patcit> discloses a bumper bar for a vehicle comprising a formed sheet of high tensile strength steel of at least 413.7 MPa and less than 2.54 mm thickness the formed sheet having side edges and being roll-formed to cause the side edges of the sheet to abut one another the side edges being connected together by a weld seam to form an integral tube.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Patent Document 1 discloses an invention pertaining to an energy absorbing member which comprises a hollow aluminum alloy extrusion having a plate thickness which locally varies. Patent Document 2 discloses an invention pertaining to a front side member which has a closed cross section with an arch-shaped portion disposed parallel to the fore and aft direction of a vehicle body and which has a plate thickness which locally varies. Patent Document 3 discloses an invention pertaining to a front side member having a weak portion provided in its front end portion. Patent Document 4 discloses an invention pertaining to a front side member in which the shape of its front end portion is such that it can more uniformly deform by buckling over its entire cross section. Patent Document 5 discloses an invention pertaining to a front side member having a closed cross section and comprising a lower member with a U-shaped cross section comprising a casting of a light alloy and an upper member comprising a plate of a light alloy.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Patent Document 6 discloses an invention which prevents buckling of the A-pillar at the time of rollover by installing a reinforcing tube inside the A-pillar for the body side.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for decreases in weight and increases in strength of strength members for automobile bodies in order to increase fuel efficiency so as to decrease discharge of CO<sub>2</sub> in order to suppress global warming as well as to increase the safety of passengers at the time of a collision. In order to cope with such demands, high strength materials such as high tensile strength steel plates having a tensile strength of at least 780 MPa or even at least 900 MPa which is considerably higher than conventional strength<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> levels are now much used.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">At the same time that such materials are being increased in strength, the structure of strength members for automobile bodies is being reconsidered. For example, in order to enable application to various automobile parts, there is a strong demand for the development of bending techniques which can work strength members for automobile bodies having a widely varying bent shape such as those which are manufactured by bending with a bending direction which varies 2-dimensionally such as S-bending or bending with a bending direction which varies three-dimensionally with high accuracy.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Various working techniques have been proposed in order to cope with such demands. For example, Patent Document 7 discloses an invention pertaining to a method of bending while performing heat treatment of a metal pipe or the like by gripping the end portion of a material being worked such as a metal pipe with a rotatable arm, and while heating with a heating device, gradually moving the heated portion in the axial direction to produce bending deformation and then immediately thereafter performing cooling. Patent Document 8 discloses an invention pertaining to a method of bending while performing heat treatment of a metal pipe or the like by gripping a metal pipe and applying a twisting force and a bending force to a heated portion carry out bending deformation while twisting the metal pipe.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Taking into consideration decreases in the weight of products formed by bending (referred to below as bent products), the tensile strength of the products is preferably set to be at least 900 MPa and more preferably at least 1300 MPa. Up to now, in order to achieve such a strength, as disclosed in Patent Documents 7 and 8, a pipe having a tensile strength of 500 - 700 MPa was used as a starting material and subjected to bending, after which its strength was increased by heat treatment to manufacture a bent product having a desired high strength.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The inventions disclosed in Patent Documents 7 and 8 both use working method classified as so-called grip bending. In order to carry out either invention, it is necessary to grip the end of a material being worked with a rotatable arm. Furthermore, each time the material being worked is regripped by the arm, it is necessary to return the arm to its original position, so the feed speed of the material being worked greatly varies, it becomes difficult to perform complicated control of the cooling rate, and a desired quenching accuracy cannot be obtained. Therefore,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the speed of heating and cooling must be controlled in a complicated manner and which high accuracy in order to produce non-uniform strains, and it is extremely difficult to obtain a desired quenching accuracy. Therefore, variations in the bent shape develop, and particularly in the case of high strength materials, delayed fracture caused by residual stresses develop, and it is difficult to manufacture a strength member for automobiles requiring high reliability.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Patent Document 9 discloses an invention pertaining to a bending apparatus with high frequency heating in which a material to be worked which is supported by a support means is fed from an upstream side towards a downstream side by a feed device while bending is carried out downstream of the support means, and a roller is supported so as to move three-dimensionally. According to the bending apparatus with high frequency heating disclosed in Patent Document 9, the roller straddles the material being worked and moves to opposite side surfaces of the material being worked, contacts the side surfaces, and performs bending. Therefore, even when bending is carried out in which the bending direction varies two-dimensionally such as with S-bending, it is no longer necessary to perform a tooling operation of rotating the material being worked by 180 degrees, so working can be efficiently carried out.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">However, the bending apparatus with high frequency heating disclosed in Patent Document 9 does not have any means for clamping the material being worked on both sides.

As a result, bending of the metal material into a wide variety of bent shapes can be achieved, and bending in which the bending direction varying two-dimensionally or three-dimensionally can be efficiently carried out.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">The movable roller die preferably has a moving mechanism for movement in the axial direction of the metal material. Due to the provision of this moving mechanism, even when the bending radius of the metal material is small, bending can be carried out while guaranteeing an optimal arm length L. Therefore, the working apparatus can be prevented from becoming large in size and as a result, the accuracy of bending can be increased.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">In this apparatus, the heating means and/or the cooling means preferably has at least one mechanism selected from a shifting mechanism for shifting in the vertical direction, a shifting mechanism for shifting to the left and right perpendicular to the axial direction of the metal material, a tilting mechanism for tilting with respect to the vertical direction, and a tilting mechanism for tilting with respect to a horizontal direction perpendicular to the axial direction of the metal material. As a result, the operation of the roller die and that of the heating means and the cooling means can be synchronized, and due to this synchronization,<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> uniform bending of higher accuracy can be carried out.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">In this case, the heating means and/or the cooling means preferably has a moving mechanism for moving in the axial direction of the metal material. Due to the heating means and the like having such a moving mechanism, in addition to synchronization with the movable roller die, the front end of a metal pipe can be heated at the start of bending, and operability and maneuverability at the time of mounting and dismounting of a metal pipe can be increased.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">In this apparatus, the movable roller die preferably has a rotating mechanism for rotation in the circumferential direction around the axis of the metal material. In addition to a bent shape in which the bending direction of the metal material varies two-dimensionally or three-dimensionally, it is possible to impart a twisted shape.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">In this apparatus, the feed device preferably has a mechanism which grips the metal material and rotates it in the circumferential direction around its axis. Even when the rotating mechanism of the movable roller die is not used, it is possible to impart a twisted shape in addition to giving the metal material a bent shape which varies two-dimensionally or three-dimensionally.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">In this case, the support means preferably has a rotating mechanism which rotates the metal material in the circumferential direction around its axis in synchrony with rotation of the feed device. At the time of twisting deformation of the metal material, by twisting the rear end of the metal material with the rotating mechanism of the feed device in synchrony with the support apparatus without rotating in the circumferential direction of the movable roller die, a twisted shape of higher accuracy can be imparted. Of course, it is possible to impart a twisted shape of even higher accuracy by relatively twisting the rear end of the metal material by the rotating mechanism of the feed device in synchrony with the support apparatus while rotating the roller die in the circumferential direction around its axis.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">In this apparatus, the movable roller die preferably has a rotational drive mechanism for each pair of rolls which rotatably drives the rolls by a drive motor or the like in accordance with the amount of feed by the feed device. If the movable roller die does not have a rotational drive mechanism, rotation of these rolls is driven only by frictional resistance, and there is the possibility of a compressive stress acting on the bent portion of the metal material, of the wall thickness<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> increasing on the inner side of the bent portion, or of buckling taking place. In particular, if the material being worked is a thin-walled material, working may become difficult and the working accuracy may worsen due to this phenomenon.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">In contrast, if the movable roller die has a rotational drive mechanism, compressive stresses which act on the bent portion can be reduced, and the rotational speed of the rolls of the movable roller die can be varied in accordance with and in synchrony with the feed amount of the feed device. Therefore, even a tensile stress can be imparted to the bent portion. As a result, the range of possible shapes of bending is expanded, and the working accuracy of a product is increased.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">A movable roller die in this apparatus preferably has two, three, or four pairs of rolls, and the metal material preferably is a hollow member having a closed transverse cross section, a hollow member having an open transverse cross section, or a hollow member having a profile transverse cross section. The type of rolls of the movable roller die can be suitably selected in accordance with the cross-sectional shape of the metal material being worked.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">In this apparatus, by providing at least one preheating means on the upstream side of the heating means, it is preferable to carry out heating of the metal material a plurality of times or non-uniform heating in which the degree of heating is non-uniform in the circumferential direction around the axis of the metal material. When using the preheating means for multistage heating, the heating load on the metal material can be dispersed, and the bending efficiency can be increased. When a preheating means is used for non-uniform heating of the metal material, in accordance with the bending direction of the metal material by the movable roller die, it is possible to control heating such that the temperature on the inner side of a bent portion in a heated portion of the metal material is lower than the temperature on the outer side of the bent portion. As a result, wrinkles which develop on the inner side of a bent portion and cracks which develop on the outer side of a bent portion can both be prevented.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">In this apparatus, a mandrel is preferably inserted inside the metal material as a cooling means while supplying with a cooling medium. Doing so is effective for ensuring the cooling rate particularly when the metal material is a thick-walled material.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">In this apparatus, the cooling medium which is supplied from the cooling means preferably is a water-based medium and contains a rust preventing agent<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> and/or a quenching agent. When a sliding portion is wet by cooling water supplied from a cooling device, rust develops when the cooling water does not contain a rust preventing agent. Therefore, the cooling water preferably contains a rust preventing agent. A cooling medium which is supplied from the cooling means may be of a water-based medium containing a quenching agent. An example of a known quenching agent contains an organic polymer. By incorporating a quenching agent in an appropriate concentration in a cooling medium, the cooling rate can be adjusted and stable quenching performance can be obtained.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">In this apparatus, a lubricant and/or a cooling fluid is preferably supplied to the movable roller die. If a lubricant is supplied to the movable roller die, even if scale which develops on a heated portion of a metal material becomes caught on the movable roller die, due to the lubricating action, the occurrence of seizing can be decreased. In addition, if a cooling fluid is supplied to the movable roller die, the movable roller die is cooled by the cooling fluid, so a decrease in the strength of the movable roller die, a decrease in the working accuracy due to thermal expansion of the movable roller die, and the occurrence of seizing on the surface of the movable roller die can all be prevented.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">In this apparatus, operation of the movable roller die, the heating means, or the cooling means by at least one of a shifting mechanism, a tilting mechanism, and a moving mechanism is preferably carried out by an articulated robot which supports the movable roller die, the heating means, or the cooling means and which has at least one joint which can rotate about at least one axis.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">By using an articulated robot, when performing bending of a steel pipe, shifting in the vertical direction or to the left and right, tilting operation by sloping in the vertical direction or to the left and right, or frontwards and backwards movement which are necessary for the movable roller die, the heating means, and the cooling means and which are carried out by a manipulator can easily be carried out by a series of operations in response to control signals. Therefore, an increase in bending efficiency and a decrease in the size of the working apparatus can be achieved.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">From another standpoint, a strength member for an automobile body, a front side member, and a side reinforcing member in a side structure of an automobile body according to a further aspect related to the present invention is manufactured by a manufacturing line for a bent product having a seam welded pipe<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> manufacturing line which comprises an uncoiler which continuously pays off a steel strip, a forming means which forms the uncoiled steel strip into a pipe having a desired cross-sectional shape, a welding means which welds both abutted edges of the steel strip and forms a continuous pipe, a post-treatment means which cuts off a weld bead and if necessary performs post-annealing and sizing, and a manufacturing apparatus for a bent product according to any aspect related to the present invention as described above disposed on the exit side of the post-treatment means.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">A strength member for an automobile body, a front side member, and a side reinforcing member in a side structure in an automobile body according to a further aspect related to the present invention is also manufactured by a manufacturing line for a bent product having a roll-forming line which comprises an uncoiler which continuously pays off a steel strip and a forming means which forms the uncoiled steel strip into a prescribed cross-sectional shape, and a manufacturing apparatus for a bent product according to any aspect related to the present invention as described above disposed on the exit side of the forming means.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">A strength member for an automobile body, a front side member, and a side reinforcing member of a side structure for an automobile body according to any aspect related to the present invention can use a steel pipe having a round transverse cross section However, the present invention is not limited to a steel pipe, and it can be similarly applied to any elongated tubular member having any type of transverse cross section.

Therefore, if the arm length L is set to a large value when working a metal material 1 having a small radius of curvature, when working is performed on a metal material having a large radius of curvature, a large stroke is necessary for the shifting mechanism and the tilting mechanism of the movable roller die 4, and the apparatus becomes large.</p><p id="p0129" num="0129">On the other hand, taking into consideration the stopping accuracy and the allowable error of the manufacturing apparatus 0, the working accuracy worsens when the arm length L is small.

Specifically, by entirely or partially closing off the holes in a water cooling jacket of the water cooling device 6 using solenoid valves, for example, it is possible to provide portions which are not water cooled. Since the cooling rate varies with the surrounding temperature, experiments can be previously carried out based on the manufacturing conditions to determine a method of water cooling.</p><p id="p0247" num="0247">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0019">Figure 28(c)</figref>, by heating to at most the Ac<sub>1</sub> point and then cooling at a cooling rate which is the same as the cooling rate for normal quenching, a desired strength which is somewhat higher than the strength of the base metal can be obtained (for example, a strength slightly higher than 500 - 600 MPa for a quench-hardenable steel of ferrite and pearlite two phase structure, a strength slightly higher than 550 MPa for a 550 MPa steel, and a strength slightly higher than 450 MPa for a 450 MPa steel). In the case of an untreated pipe having a large strain produced during pipe forming, the strength after heat treatment is sometimes lower than that of the untreated pipe, but in general the strength is slightly increased by dissolution of cementite. Taking into consideration the responsiveness of control of the high frequency heating coil 5 when carrying out the above-described on-off control, variations in the output of the power supply for heating are reduced by this heat treatment method. Therefore, the response to temperature variations is rapid, and the transition zone of changes in strength become small, so this method is effective from a practical standpoint.</p><p id="p0248" num="0248">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0019">Figure 28(d)</figref>, by heating to at least the Ac<sub>1</sub> point and at most the Ac<sub>3</sub> point and then cooling at the same cooling rate as for usual quenching, a strength between the ultra-high strength obtained by usual quenching and the strength of an untreated pipe can be obtained (600 - 1400 MPa for quench-hardenable steel, 550 - 1300 MPa for 55k steel, and 450 - 1200 MPa for 450 MPa steel).
