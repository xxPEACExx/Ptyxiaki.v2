load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b><u>Field of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to turbulent fluid flow, and more particularly to a baffle for generating multiple helical vortices in a fluid stream beneficial in a wide variety of industrial applications.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>Background of the invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The creation of turbulence within a fluid stream has many industrial applications. For example, the creation of turbulence generally enhances the mixing of two fluid streams. The mixing of fluids has applicability to a wide range of industrial processes including for example burner designs that rely on the mixing of a fuel with air. In such burner designs, as well as many other industrial processes that rely on the mixing of two fluid streams, the mixing of the fluid streams may be achieved or enhanced by channeling the streams through a static mixer. A static mixer typically includes one or more baffle plates or other similar elements that create or generate turbulent flow zones within the static mixer that facilitate mixing of the fluid streams. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE3618062A1"><text>DE 36 18 062 A1</text></patcit>, for instance, discloses a baffle plate for mixing pasty or jellylike components.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The creation of turbulence within a flow stream may also be desirable in applications where contact or near contact between a fluid and a surface results in some benefit. By way of example, heat exchangers generally rely on the contact or near contact between a fluid stream and a surface to effectuate heat transfer to or from the surface via the fluid stream. One such heat exchanger is a shell-and-tube heat exchanger wherein one fluid stream<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> flows through one or more inner tubes and another fluid stream flows through an outer tube or shell containing the inner tubes. Heat transfer between the two fluid streams is across the wall on the inner tube(s) and thus contact or near contact between the fluid streams and the wall of the inner tube(s) enhances heat transfer therebetween. In this regard, shell-and-tube heat exchanges may include one or more baffle plates or other similar elements (typically on the shell side of the heat exchanger, for example) that create or generate turbulent flow zones within the heat exchanger that enhance heat transfer between the fluid streams.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">One particular industrial application where creating turbulence so as to bring a fluid stream in contact with or adjacent to a surface occurs in the water treatment industry. In this industry, for example, ultraviolet light reactors are used to treat contaminated water. Typically, ultraviolet light reactors include an inner tube and an outer tube concentrically disposed about the inner tube. A UV light source is typically disposed within the inner tube and the inner tube is formed from a suitable material that allows UV light to pass therethrough. Contaminated water flows through the passage between the inner and outer tubes and is exposed to the UV light to effect treatment of the water.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">One or more baffle plates may be located along the axis of the reactor. In conventional designs, the baffle plates are configured as generally flat or planar disc plates having an outer periphery and an aperture formed therethrough that defines an inner periphery (e.g., a washer). The planar disc plates are positioned so that the outer periphery engages the inner surface of the outer tube and the inner tube is disposed through the aperture such that the outer surface of the Inner tube is adjacent, but spaced from the inner periphery in the plate to form a gap therebetween. In this way, as the contaminated water<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> flows along the passage between the inner and outer tubes it has to pass through the gap between the inner tube and inner periphery of the baffle plate(s). The reduction in cross-sectional area as the water flows through the gap results in an increase in the local fluid velocity of the water. When this relatively fast moving fluid contacts the relatively slow moving fluid behind or downstream of the baffle plate, the shear created by the differential velocity forms toroidal vortices (e.g., similar to smoke rings) that move in the downstream direction.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">While generally successful for certain water treatment applications, there are a number of drawbacks to conventional ultraviolet light reactors that limit their use in a broader range of water treatment applications. For example, the ultraviolet light reactors are generally effective for high UV transmittance fluids but lose their effectiveness as the ability of the UV light to penetrate the water diminishes. Accordingly, ultraviolet light reactors are most effective for water with low solids content. For water with relatively high solids content, the UV light will penetrate into the fluid only a short distance (as little as 0.1 mm in some applications). Thus, some of the water borne particles may have little or no exposure to the UV light. For effective treatment in these high solids content applications then, it is necessary to bring the water borne particles near the inner tube from where the UV light emanates.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Planar disc plates as described above and the toroidal vortices they generate provide relatively low improvement to the treatment of high solids content contaminated water. In this regard, it is believed that toroidal vortices are relatively unstable and do not permit different water borne particles to enter and leave the toroidal vortex as it moves downstream. As a result, relatively few water borne particles are brought into proximity to the inner tube, even<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> though turbulent vortex generation occurs. Moreover, because relatively few water borne particles are brought into proximity to the inner tube, effective treatment of high solids content water via UV treatment may not be achieved.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In addition to the above, planar disc plates are often currently utilized in ultraviolet light reactors to direct at least a component of the fluid flow transversely across the inner tube. Such transverse flow results in a lateral loading force and associated bending moments on the inner tube. In current designs, the inner tubes are typically formed from rather brittle quartz tubes that are susceptible to fracture induced by the bending moments. As a result, attempts to increase the turbulence and vortex shedding to improve water treatment by increasing the flow rate through the reactor Is limited by the allowable bending stress limitations of the inner tube.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Accordingly, there is a need for an improved baffle design and apparatus utilizing such baffles that address these and other drawbacks of existing devices.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Summary of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">In one embodiment, a baffle that addresses the shortcomings of existing baffles includes a body member having a first surface, a second opposed surface, and an outer peripheral edge.

The ultraviolet light reactor 10 includes an inner tube 12 and an outer tube 14 concentrically disposed about the inner tube 12 and generally extending along a longitudinal axis 16. The inner tube 12 defines a space 18 wherein at least one ultraviolet (UV) light source, illustrated schematically at 20, is disposed. As recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, such UV light sources are readily commercially available. A fluid channel 22 is defined between the inner and outer tubes 12, 14 and receives contaminated water 24 therethrough, such as from a reservoir 26 in fluid communication with the fluid channel 22. The inner tube 12 is formed from a suitable material that allows ultraviolet light, generated by light source 20, to pass through the wall of tube 12 from an inner surface 28 to an outer surface 30 and into the fluid channel 22 so as to treat the contaminated water 24 flowing therethrough. For example, the inner tube 12 may be formed from quartz or other suitable materials.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">To overcome many of the drawbacks of conventional ultraviolet light reactors as detailed above, especially for high solids content contaminated water, the number of water borne particles brought into proximity to the outer surface 30 of inner tube 12 should be increased relative to existing reactors. To this end, the ultraviolet light reactor 10 includes at least one, and preferably a plurality of baffles 32 disposed in the fluid channel 22 in spaced-apart relation<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> along longitudinal axis 16. As described in greater detail below, each of the baffles 32 generate a plurality of helical vortices that increase the number of water borne particles that are brought into proximity to the outer surface 30 of the inner tube 12.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Each of the baffles 32 is substantially the same and a description of one such baffle 32 will suffice for a description of the remaining baffles. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 3</figref>, a baffle 32 includes a first surface 34, a second opposed surface 36, and an outer peripheral edge 38. Moreover, the baffle 32 includes a central aperture 40 extending between the first and second surfaces 34, 36 that defines an inner peripheral edge 42. As best shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, the baffle 32 has an outer cross-dimension sized relative to an inner cross-dimension of the outer tube 14 and is closely received therein to effectively prevent water from flowing around the outer peripheral edge 38 of the baffle 32. The outer peripheral edge 38 may also be sealed to the inner surface 48 of the outer tube 14 using sealants or gaskets as generally known in the art. In addition, the central aperture 40 in the baffle 32 has a cross-dimension that is greater than an outer cross-dimension of the inner tube 12. Thus, the inner tube 12 may extend through the central aperture 40 such that the inner peripheral edge 42 of the baffle 32 is spaced from the outer surface 30 of the inner tube 12 to define a gap 52 therebetween. In this configuration, for the contaminated water 24 to flow past the baffle 32, the water must flow through the gap 52 between the inner tube 12 and the inner peripheral edge 42. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the baffles 32 may be supported in outer tube 14 by a plurality of rivets. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize other types of fasteners suitable for supporting the baffles 32 in outer tube 14. Moreover, while the plurality of baffles 32 are shown as separate elements, the plurality of baffles 32 may be coupled by one<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> or more legs or posts so as to spatially fix each baffle relative to the other baffles. Such a configuration allows the plurality of baffles 32 to be disposed in outer tube 14 as a unitary structure.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, the cross-sectional area of the fluid flow path through the gap 52 is reduced, and may be significantly reduced, as compared to the cross-sectional area of the fluid channel 22. As recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, such a reduction in cross-sectional area results in a local increase in the fluid velocity of the contaminated water 24 as it passes through the gap 52. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, however, the cross-sectional area of the fluid flow path immediately downstream of the baffle 32 quickly expands back to that of fluid channel 22, causing the local fluid velocity of the water 24 to decrease. As explained above, the shear created by this difference in fluid velocities causes vortices to form downstream of the baffle 32. As explained below, however, the configuration of the vortices produced by baffle 32 is significantly different than the toroidal vortices produced by planar disc baffle plates in current designs.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">To this end and in an advantageous aspect of the invention, at least the inner peripheral edge 42 of baffle 32 has a non-planar configuration, i.e., the points that define the inner peripheral edge 42 do not lie in a single plane. Instead, and as best shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 3</figref>, the inner peripheral edge 42 has a plurality of undulations that generally define a plurality of crests 54 and troughs 56 along the inner peripheral edge 42. For example, as schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 4A</figref>, the inner peripheral edge 42 may be generally sinusoidal with smooth transitions between the crests and troughs. The invention is not so limited, however, as the inner peripheral edge 42 may have other configurations that generally define peaks and valleys. For example, the inner peripheral edge<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> 42a may have relatively sharp transitions between the peaks and valleys, as schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 4B</figref>. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize a wide variety of inner peripheral edge configurations that generally define peaks and valleys within the scope of the invention. Those shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 4A and 4B</figref> are exemplary and therefore do not limit the invention to these particular configurations.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The number of crests and troughs 54, 56 along inner peripheral edge 42 may vary depending on the particular application. For example, the inner peripheral edge 42 may include four sinusoids resulting in four such crests and troughs 54, 56. Other applications may have more or less as dictated by the requirements or desires in those applications. Thus, the invention is not limited to a specific number of crests or troughs 54, 56. Moreover, the amplitude of the crests and troughs 54, 56 may also vary depending on the particular application. Furthermore, the distortion of the inner peripheral edge 42 to form the crests and troughs 54, 56 may extend outwardly along baffle 32 toward outer peripheral edge 38. For example, the distortion of the inner peripheral edge 42 extends to the outer peripheral edge 38 so that the outer peripheral edge 38 also defines a plurality of crests and troughs (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 3</figref>). Alternatively, the distortion of the inner peripheral edge 42 may extend only partially toward the outer peripheral edge 38 so that an outer portion of the baffle 32 remains generally planar (not shown).</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">By configuring the inner peripheral edge 42 with a plurality of undulations provides improved mixing of the contaminated water 24 in the fluid channel 22 that brings an increased number of water borne particles in proximity to the outer surface 30 of the inner tube 12. In particular, the undulations in the inner peripheral edge 42 form pairs of counter-rotating helical<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> vortices having rotational axes generally parallel to the longitudinal axis 16 of the reactor 10 as will now be explained.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As shown schematically in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 5A</figref>, as the water 24 moves toward the baffle 32, the water contacts the crests 54 of the baffle 32 and is redirected to flow along the converging surfaces 58, 60 and toward the troughs 56. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 5B</figref>, this redirection of the flow toward the troughs 56 results in a pair of counter-rotating vortices 62a, 62b downstream of the baffle 32 for each of the troughs 56. Moreover, as a result of the undulations in the inner peripheral edge 42 and as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 5C</figref>, each of the vortices 62a, 62b also has a helical configuration that define an axis 64 that is generally parallel to the longitudinal axis 16. it is believed that the helical vortices 62a, 62b generated by baffle 32 are stable and allow water borne particles to continually enter and leave the vortices 62a, 62b. As a result, an increased number of water borne particles get swept up in the vortices 62a, 62b so as to be brought into proximity to the outer surface 30 of the inner tube 12. Consequently, more water borne particles are exposed to the UV light emanating from the light source 20 and through the wall of the inner tube 12. This results in improved treatment of contaminated water. More particularly, for high solids content contaminated water, wherein penetration of the UV light through the fluid channel 22 may be limited, the efficacy of UV treatment may be significantly improved.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Some of the aspects of the vortices 62a, 62b may be manipulated depending on the specific application. For example, the cross-dimension of the vortices 62a, 62b may be varied by varying the pitch (wavelength) 68 of the undulations along the inner peripheral edge 42 (i.e., the distance between adjacent crests 54 or peaks in the configuration of the inner peripheral edge<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> 42). The rotational velocity of the vortices 62a, 62b may also be varied by varying the pitch 68. Additionally, the rotational velocity of the vortices 62a, 62b may also be varied by varying the peak fluid velocity as the water moves through the gap 52. This may be done, for example, by varying the bulk flow rate of the water moving through the reactor 10. Alternatively, the peak fluid velocity may be varied by varying the cross-sectional area of the fluid flow path through the baffle 32. For example, decreasing the width of the gap 52 will generally increase the peak fluid velocity through the baffle 32, and increasing the width of the gap 52 will generally decrease the peak fluid velocity through the baffle 32. The pitch, peak velocity, and other aspects may be manipulated to achieve the desired characteristics for vortices 62a, 62b.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In addition to that noted above concerning the increased number of water borne particles baffle 32 brings in proximity to the outer surface 30 of the inner tube 12, baffle 32 provides additional benefits relative to existing reactor designs. By way of example, baffle 32 results in substantially no lateral loading and the associated bending stresses on the inner tube 12. This in turn allows the fluid velocity to be increased without a limitation imposed by the fracture limits of the inner tube 12. Thus, the reactor 10 incorporating baffle(s) 32 may operate at higher fluid velocities as compared to current reactors. At higher fluid velocities, the reactor 10 is capable of treating a greater volume of contaminated water relative to current reactors in a given period of time. Moreover, due to the higher operating velocities, the number of water borne particles that flow near or adjacent the inner tube 12 so as to expose or reexpose the particles to the UV light emanating therefrom is even further increased. Thus, the efficacy of the UV treatment may be improved.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">For clarity of disclosure and discussion, aspects of the invention have been discussed herein primarily in the context of an ultraviolet light reactor for water treatment applications. It will be understood and appreciated that the baffle 32 and the resulting vortex generation associated therewith are applicable to a wide variety of industrial processes and are not limited to the water treatment application described above. Additional applications of the baffle will now be described.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">For example, the baffle 32 may be used in a static mixer to mix two fluid streams.

The tube 82 defines a flow channel 90 that receives at least two fluid streams 92, 94 from, for example, fluid reservoirs 96, 98, respectively, in fluid communication with the first end 84. The fluid streams 92, 94 may be completely separated or only partially mixed upon entering the static mixer 80.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The outer cross-dimension of the baffle 32 is sized relative to an inner cross-dimension of the tube 82 and closely received therein to effectively prevent fluid from flowing around the outer peripheral edge 38 of the baffle 32. An inner tube may be omitted such that the two fluid streams 92, 94 pass through the central aperture 40 In baffle 32. As described in detail above, the undulating configuration of at least the inner peripheral edge 42 of the baffle 32 generates counter-rotating helical vortices similar to vortices 62a, 62b shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 5B and 5C</figref> that enhance the mixing of the fluid streams 92, 94. In this way, when the fluid streams 92, 94 reach the second end 86 of the tube 82, the fluid streams 92, 94 are substantially uniformly mixed.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In one exemplary application, the static mixer 80 may be used in industrial processes utilizing gas or liquid burners. In these applications, effective mixing of a fuel stream with an air stream is important for efficient operation of the burner. The static mixer 80, however, is not limited to such an application as the mixer may be beneficial in virtually any situation where two or more fluid streams are to be mixed together for industrial or commercial purposes.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">An inner tube may extend through the central apertures in the baffles 32, much like that shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.

Holes may be formed in the inner tube just downstream of each of the baffles 32 that essentially inject the first fluid stream 92 into the second fluid stream 94. Locating the holes in the inner tube just downstream of the baffles 32 provides mixing of streams 92, 94 in a high velocity, high shear and low pressure zone that enhances mixing.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Another application that may gain the benefit of the baffle 32 is in heat exchangers, and more particularly, shell-and-tube heat exchanges which are used in a wide range of industrial applications.

Additionally, the first fluid stream 120 may have a temperature higher than that of the second fluid stream 126, or vice versa. In any event, to enhance heat transfer between the two streams 120, 126, one or more baffles 32 may be disposed within the second fluid channel 124, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref>.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Similar to that shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the outer cross-dimension of the baffle 32 is sized relative to an inner cross-dimension of the outer tube 114 and closely received therein to effectively prevent fluid from flowing around the outer peripheral edge 38 of the baffle 32.
