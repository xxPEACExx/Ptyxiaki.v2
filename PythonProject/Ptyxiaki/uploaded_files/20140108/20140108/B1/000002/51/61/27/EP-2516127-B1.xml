apparatus for the injection moulding of containers in plastic material, such as, e.g., single-dose bottles for pharmaceutical, medicinal and cosmetic products.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Background Art</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Moulds are known for moulding containers composed essentially of a female matrix die wherein are obtained one or more cavities inside which can be inserted corresponding male elements, the cavities being in the same number as the containers moulded at each cycle.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Between the inner surface of the above cavities and the outer surface of the relevant male elements an inter-space is defined wherein is injected under pressure a plastic material to be moulded, of the thermoplastic, thermosetting type, etc.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The shape or the thickness of the inter-space defines both the shape and the thickness of the walls of the containers to be made.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In this respect, it must be noted that the thickness of the walls of the containers of the type of the single-dose bottles for pharmaceutical or cosmetic products is very thin, e.g., around 0.6 ÷ 0.8 mm, and requires very narrow tolerance intervals.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">On the one hand in fact, the container must have characteristics of deformability and flexibility such as to allow the user to extract all the product contained inside, while on the other it must ensure the storage of the product in integral and unaltered conditions.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The moulds of known type are not without their drawbacks, including the fact that they do not guarantee the centring between the male element and the female matrix die.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The male element in fact, takes on misaligned and inflexed configurations with respect to the matrix die and this causes a change in the thickness of the inter-space defined between them and therefore in the thickness of the walls of the moulded container which, not only can take on values outside the acceptable<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> tolerance interval, but can be interrupted by hollows and/or cavities. Consequently, there is an increase in production rejects and, considering the retrieval of the rejected material is often difficult and costly, this results in obvious wastes of materials and energy, time extensions and increase in production costs.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">To overcome these drawbacks, the document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20010015512A"><text>US 2001/0015512</text></patcit> describes the use of a particular injection-moulding apparatus having specific automatic centring means of the male elements in the corresponding matrix die.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Such centring means are composed of a pair of stems arranged inside corresponding holes obtained in the matrix die on opposite sides of each male element.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Inside the holes, the stems are moving closer to and away from the male elements between a backward configuration and a forward configuration.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the backward configuration, in point of fact, the stems are positioned flush with the matrix die cavities and complete its profile, while in the forward configuration they are stopped up against the male elements, centring them and fixing them with respect to the matrix die and interrupting the continuity of the inter-space.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">During moulding, the plastic material is injected into the mould until the inter-space is nearly totally filled (e.g., 90%) and, as long as this remains in fluid state, the stems are taken to the backward configuration restoring the continuity of the profile of the inner cavities of the mould.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In this configuration, the injection of the residual fraction of plastic material allows completing the moulding of the container walls.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">This particular moulding apparatus is not without its drawbacks however including the fact that the alternate sliding of the stems in the corresponding holes of the matrix die soon determines the arising of serious problems tied to material wear.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The coupling between stems and holes, in fact, is achieved by adopting very narrow tolerances and the sliding is such as to cause fast surface wear, with the formation of small metal scraps which often end up inside the inter-space during moulding.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The containers thus formed therefore have inconvenient metal inclusions inside the walls which are visible from the outside, above all if the plastic material is white or transparent.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">These containers inevitably end up by being rejected because not in compliance with the required project specifications from a technical and/or aesthetic and/or hygienic viewpoint.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In this respect, it must be underlined that in the medical, pharmaceutical and/or cosmetic field, the use of containers in imperfect aesthetic conditions produces in users the doubt that the fluid products contained in them have been contaminated and, consequently, their refusal to use them.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The apparatus according to the document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20010015512A"><text>US 2001/0015512</text></patcit>, is also therefore susceptible to further upgrading aimed at reducing the rejects and production times, limiting material and energy waste, and cutting manufacturing costs, with the possibility of lowering the retail prices and making the products more interesting for consumers.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Document <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP09155933A"><text>JP-A-09155933</text></patcit> discloses an apparatus in accordance with the preamble of claim 1.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Description of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">The main aim of the present invention is to eliminate the drawbacks complained of above affecting the moulds of known type and to provide an apparatus for the injection moulding of containers in plastic material which allows reducing the thickness of the inter-space defined between male and female within the required tolerance interval, to successfully centre the male elements with respect to the corresponding female matrix die, to maintain the males in aligned configuration during container moulding and, at the same time, considerably reduce the number of rejects, waste and manufacturing costs, thereby becoming more competitive from an economic viewpoint.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for the injection moulding of containers in plastic material which allows overcoming the mentioned drawbacks of the state of the art within the ambit of a simple, rational, easy and effective to use as well as low cost solution.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The above objects are all achieved by the present apparatus for the injection moulding of containers in plastic material in accordance with claim 1, comprising at least a mould having at least a female matrix die and at least a corresponding male element that can be<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> coupled to one another, between said female matrix die and said male element being defined a forming inter-space of at least a container, and at least a centring stem for centring said male element

alternative embodiments cannot however be ruled out in which, instead, only one cavity 6, only one male element 4 and only one forming inter-space 5 are provided.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Each cavity 6 has, at one extremity, an opening 7 for the entry of the corresponding male element 4 and, at the opposite extremity, a mouth 8 for the introduction of plastic material P to be moulded, which can be connected to a supply circuit 9 of the plastic material P under pressure, of the type e.g. comprising an injector unit suitable for heating the plastic material P to bring it<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> to the plastic state and convey it in the cavities 6.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The apparatus 1 has automatic centring means 10 of the male elements 4 with respect to the female matrix die 3 which are associated with the mould 2 and have alternate operation with respect to the injection of the plastic material P into the forming inter-spaces 5.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In the particular embodiment of the invention shown in the illustrations, the automatic centring means 10 are composed of two centring stems for each male element 4, which are arranged with their longitudinal axes at right angles with respect to the longitudinal dimension of the male elements 4 and are axially sliding with reciprocal motion along a sliding direction D substantially transversal with respect to the male elements 4 inside the corresponding centring holes 11 obtained in the female matrix die 3.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">For each male element 4, the centring stems 10 are arranged diametrically opposite with respect to the forming inter-space 5, i.e., they are opposite at 180°; alternative embodiments cannot however be ruled out in which, for each male element 4 three centring stems 10 are provided, e.g., displaced by 120°, or four centring stems 10, e.g., displaced by 90°, or other combinations still.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The centring stems 10 comprise a first extremity 12, turned towards the corresponding male element 4, and a second extremity 13, opposite the first. The first extremity 12 has a locator surface 12a for the male elements 4, shaped substantially complementary to the shape of the male elements 4 in the proximity of the centring holes 11; taking into account that the male elements 4 have a substantially cylindrical and/or truncated cone shape, the locator surfaces 12a are at least in part concave.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Inside the corresponding centring hole 11, each centring stem 10 is moving with reciprocating motion between a backward configuration, wherein the locator surface 12a is arranged substantially in correspondence to the inner surface of the female matrix die 3, and a forward configuration wherein the locator surface 12a is up against the corresponding male element 4: in point of fact, the work stroke of the centring stems 10, i.e., that completed to move from backward to forward configuration, is substantially equal to the thickness of the forming inter-spaces 5 in the proximity of the centring hole 11.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0040" num="0040">To operate each centring stem 10 between the backward configuration and the forward configuration, control means 14, 15 are provided comprising a cylinder 14 with fluid-dynamic operation (hydraulic or pneumatic) associated with the mould 2, wherein slides a piston 15 associated with the second extremity 13 of the centring stem 10; alternatively, the control means 14, 15 can be of the electric type.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The centring stems 10 have a substantially axial-symmetric shape but have a prismatic portion 16 suitable for prismatically coupling with a corresponding seat 17 of the centring holes 11 and which, in point of fact, acts as an antirotation system and allows the centring stems 10 to slide in the centring holes 11 without turning around their own axes.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Advantageously, the first extremity 12 of the centring stems 10 has a cross section substantially decreasing towards the corresponding locator surface 12a, i.e., the closer one comes to the locator surface 12a, the more the section of the centring stems 10 is reduced.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">More in detail, the first extremity 12 of the centring stems 10 has a side surface 12b which, with respect to the sliding direction D, is sloped by an angle substantially between 0.05° and 2° and which is preferably equal to 0.5°.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In point of fact, the first extremity 12 has a truncated-cone shape (<figref idrefs="f0002">figure 7</figref>), with taper between 0.1° and 1° and preferably equal to 0.5°; that the first extremity 12 have a truncated pyramid shape (<figref idrefs="f0002">figure 8</figref>), or still differently, have the same inclination as the side surface 12b cannot however be ruled out.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">For reasons of clarity of representation, in the figures from 7 to 10, the inclination of the side surface 12b of the centring stems 10 is considerably accentuated with respect to the real dimensions.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In correspondence to the cavity 6, the centring holes 11 comprise an end section 11a shaped at least partially complementary to the first extremity 12 of the centring stems 10.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In forward configuration, therefore, the side surface 12b of the first extremities 12 is perfectly stopped up against the end section 11a of the centring holes 11 (<figref idrefs="f0003">figure 9</figref>).</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In backward configuration, instead, the side surface 12b does not contact the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> end section 11a and, due to the tapered shape of the centring stems 10, between them a slit 18 forms that emerges in correspondence to the cavity 6 between the locator surface 12a of the centring stems 10 and the inner surface of the female matrix die 3 (<figref idrefs="f0003">figure 10</figref>).</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">It is however emphasised that in this configuration, the locator surface 12a and the inner surface of the female matrix die 3 are less than 50 µm the one from the other, e.g., for a distance of about 5 µm, which is a distance small enough to prevent the passage of the plastic material P.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The plastic material P in fluid state which is injected into the mould 2, in fact, is able to flow inside the inter-spaces and slots which have not too small thicknesses because otherwise by effect of capillarity, its transit is obstructed despite the considerable injection pressures.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">By virtue of the inclination of the side surface 12b, in the movement between the backward configuration and the forward configuration the first extremity 12 of the centring stems 10 does not slide against the end section 11a of the centring holes 11 and, consequently, it does not produce wear phenomena that could cause the formation of scrap in the proximity of the forming
