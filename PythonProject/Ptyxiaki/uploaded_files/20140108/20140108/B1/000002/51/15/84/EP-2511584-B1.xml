The particular design described in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP0664866B1"><text>EP 0664866 B1</text></patcit> demands, unfortunately, certain manual steps in its assembly due to the configuration of the pawl elements, making it difficult or impossible to assemble the female coupler-half using a robot.

This collar prevents inadvertent pulling back of the sleeve should the sleeve stick to something or become obstructed when the coupled hose is pulled. Such a collar completely covering the sleeve end has, in the prior art designs, not been possible except with long neck nipples due to the lack of space.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Fluid medium couplers, such as pneumatic couplers, typically connect a nipple on the tool side with a female half on the supply side, containing a valve, which opens only when a nipple is inserted, and a spring loaded sleeve, which can be retracted to decouple the two parts. It is often desirable, if not required, to consider two safety aspects when developing a coupler of this type:
<ul><li>Firstly, retracting the sleeve to decouple the two parts should not permit the nipple part to fly off, due to residual pressure, and cause personal injury or damage. There should be an intermediate holding stage in which residual pressure is let out before full separation of the two parts is possible.</li><li>Secondly, it is desirable to have a protective collar around the end of the sleeve of the female half. This protective collar prevents the sleeve from being accidentally retracted, with decoupling as a result. The protective collar prevents an axial, sleeve retracting, force from being applied to the end of the sleeve when the hose is pulled across a floor, for example, or through an environment with obstacles.</li></ul></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">These two desirable features are difficult to achieve with known designs for a nipple with a short distance between the circumferential groove and the abutment face of the nipple, such as is the case in the CEJN 315 Series standard nipple [shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>], or the Nitto Kohki Co. Ltd. Hi-Cupla plug,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> which will be referred to in the following as the Asian standard compressed air nipple. It has not been possible to achieve these safety features in the short space available according to Asian standard, nor has it been possible to achieve satisfactory strength and wear resistance in this short coupling. The female coupling half should be no longer than existing Asian standard female coupling halves. None of these desirable features is achieved at present in any female coupling-half design applicable to the short neck Asian nipples for compressed air couplings. A female hose coupling-half as described in the preamble to the accompanying claim 1 which has the characterizing features of the accompanying claim 1 achieves both of these advantages in an inventive manner.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention will be described with reference to a non-limiting example shown in the accompanying drawings, of which:

Only a single exemplary embodiment of the female coupling-half of the invention is shown in the drawings and there is uniform numbering of each element throughout the drawings.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> shows a female hose coupling-half suitable for use with a short neck Asian standard nipple. A valve 1 has a hollow body 2 [shown in longitudinal section in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 6</figref>] with openings 23 and at its end a rubber O-ring 21. There is a surrounding ring 20 against which the rubber O-ring 21 seals to close the valve. The valve 1 is also provided with a cylindrical socket for receiving the end of a short-neck Asian standard nipple 3. The valve is spring-biased 22 to the right in the drawing to keep the valve 1 of female hose coupling-half, which is connected to the supply of compressed air, closed when no nipple has been completely inserted.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A tube 4 slidably holds the valve 1 and is integral in this example with a protective collar 5, to protect against inadvertent release, as will be explained in more detail below. The tube is in turn surrounded by a manually operated spring 24 biased sleeve 10. Said tube 4 is shown alone in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 5</figref> and is provided in this example with two longitudinal slots 6, disposed in diametric opposition. (See <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 12</figref> as well). Each of these slots 6 holds a pawl 7, with a distal (to the right in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0002 f0006">4-11</figref>) detent 8 which engages a circumferential nipple groove to hold the nipple in either a fully coupled compressed air<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> delivery position or an intermediate holding position for pressure relief prior to complete disengagement, as will be described below. Each pawl 7 has a proximal (to the left in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0002 f0006">4-11</figref>) detent 15, which is rounded to be able to slide, when not held down by the interior of the sleeve 10, between a distal and a proximal depression 16 and 17 respectively crossing each slot 6. Each pawl has a central projection 13, which rests in a circumferential groove 14 in the valve body 1 and forms a fulcrum about which the pawl can see-saw to bring the detents 8,15 in and out of engagement, as will be described in more detail below. This see-saw action is crucially important in significantly increasing the wear strength and life of the components over previous designs, particularly in view of the interaction between brass and steel components. Each pawl is also provided with a radially outward heel 18 near its distal end.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The spring-biased 24 sleeve 10 surrounding the tube 4 can be manually actuated for decoupling. The interior of the sleeve is provided with two circumferential cavities 11 and 12 [see <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 6</figref>], which permit the detents to see-saw in and out of engagement, in various axial positions of the sleeve 10.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The inventive female coupling-half functions as follows together with the short neck hose nipple of Asian standard. A hose nipple 3 is seen in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref> being inserted into the female coupling-half of the invention. The sleeve 10 is still in its forward spring-biased position, as is the valve 1, keeping the compressed air supply closed. The incoming (see arrow B1) head of the nipple pushes the distal detent 8 of each pawl 7 radially outwards. This is permissible because the sleeve 10 is in its completely forward position with its distal cavity 11 aligned with each heel 18, which can now enter the distal cavity 11, permitting the nipple to enter the cylindrical socket in the body 2 of the valve 1. As the user continues to push the nipple 3 into the female coupling-half, the valve body 2 is forced to the left in the drawing against the force of the spring 22, thereby opening the supply of compressed air into the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> nipple and its hose (not shown). [See <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 9</figref>.] The movement of the valve body 2 also brings with it the two pawls 7 because of the engagement between the groove 14 and the projection 13 on each pawl 7. This movement of each pawl is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 8</figref> with the proximal rounded detent 15 sliding from the distal depression 16 towards the proximal depression 17 in the outer surface of the tube 4. The interior proximal cavity 12 in the sleeve 10 has a circumferential oblique surface 19 at its proximal end. The sleeve 10 will move slightly to the left as shown in the figures but this oblique surface will force the proximal detent 15 into the proximal depression 17 in the tube 4 and the sleeve will return (Arrow A1) to its original extended position as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 9</figref>, which shows the coupling in its fully engaged locked position, holding the proximal detent 15 and thus the pawl 7 in its locked position. This locked position utilises both of the detents and the projection 13, all securely held in a firm locking position by the interior surfaces of the sleeve 10.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The person skilled in the art will of course understand that the cavities 11 and 12 can be altered in diameter and shape within the scope of the appended claims, achieving the same effects.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">To decouple, the user must pull back on the sleeve 10, whereby the proximal detent 15 of the pawl 7 can slide up and into the distal depression 16 of the tube 4 and the spring 22 of the valve will push the body 2 of the valve forward thus closing the valve as shown now in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 10</figref>. In this position [<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 10</figref>], the nipple has moved in the direction of the arrow B2 but is still held by the sleeve 10, the pawl 7 and the distal detent 8 of the pawl 7, while the residual pressure is released since the nipple has moved slightly out of sealing engagement with the valve socket. This prevents high residual pressure from launching the hose nipple or the female coupling half at high speed, resulting in possible injury to persons or damage. The final extraction of the nipple is only possible when the sleeve 10 has been let go of, after pressure relief, and it returns to its original extended position as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 11</figref>, permitting<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the nipple to exit from the female part. As a further safety feature, the sleeve 10 will not return to its original position as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 11</figref> until there is no longer high pressure trying to expel the nipple, even though the operator has released the sleeve 10 from his grip. The nipple will be held in the intermediate pressure relief position, even if the operator lets go of the sleeve as long as there is high pressure in the system. This function can be understood by viewing <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 10</figref>, wherein we suppose there is a strong residual pressure pushing the nipple in the direction of the arrow B2. The edge of the circumferential grove will press against the distal detents 8 thus keeping the heels 18 of each pawl 7 in contact with the sleeve 10, keeping the sleeve from advancing to its extended original position [<figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 11</figref>], where the interior circumferential cavity 11 now gives space to the heels 18 so that the distal detents 8 will completely release the nipple.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">For better understanding of the components of the exemplary coupler half of the invention, <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 12</figref> shows an exploded view. The tube 4 is provided with a threaded portion 4a at its end for screwing into interior threads 21 a in pipe fitting 25, to thus hold the entire coupling-half assembly together for use. The spring 22, mounted between the sleeve 10 and the pipe fitting 25, biases the sleeve 10 to its position to the right in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> for example.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">This novel arrangement with the projections engaging the body of the valve permits the arrangement of a protective collar 5 on the tube. The protective collar prevents inadvertent retraction of the sleeve, and decoupling, should the hose and coupling be pulled and become stuck in some impediment on the floor for example.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Although the present invention has been illustrated here as used with a pneumatic system, the skilled art worker will recognize that it can, with proper adaptation, be applied, within the scope of the appended claims, in different types of fluid medium delivery systems, i.e. gas and liquid delivery systems,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> such as for breathing air and oxygen, high pressure systems and hydraulic systems.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56983442" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Eine aufnehmende Kupplungshälfte, die zum Zusammenkuppeln mit einem Standardfluidmediumnippel (3) mit einer Umfangsnippelrille geeignet ist, wobei die aufnehmende Kupplungshälfte Folgendes beinhaltet:
