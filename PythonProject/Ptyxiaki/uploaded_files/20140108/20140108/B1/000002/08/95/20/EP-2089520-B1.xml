mxw-id="PDES63960722" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b><u>Summary of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">Described herein is a novel method for exporting vector-expressed RNAi molecules. Currently, shRNA and miRNAs that are expressed from viral or plasmid vectors use the export pathway mediated in part by Exportin -V. It is now known that this pathway can be saturated, leading to deleterious effects on the cells' native microRNA processing pathway. The present invention uses the nxf-export pathway for RNAi. This pathway is more amenable to RNAi because it is less saturable, and therefore is more favorable to the cell.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">The present invention provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule containing a first portion, wherein the first portion is no more than 30 nucleotides in length; a second portion, wherein the second portion has a sequence that is complementary to the first portion; and a loop portion consisting of 12 to 50 nucleotides and comprising between 12 and 32 contiguous nucleotides of SEQ ID NO:1, wherein the loop portion is a sequence designed to circumvent exportin-5 mediated export; wherein the first portion and the second portion are operably linked by means of the loop portion to form a hairpin structure comprising a duplex structure that is 10 to 29 base pairs in length and a loop structure.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In certain embodiments, the loop portion is about 20 to 40 nucleotides long, or is about 25 to 35 nucleotides long, or is about 30 nucleotides long. In certain embodiments, the loop portion is a 32 nucleotide L1 motif. In certain embodiments, the loop portion consists of SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:6.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In certain embodiments, the duplex is from 19 to 25 nucleotides in length.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid molecule further comprises an overhang region, such as a 3' overhang region, a 5' overhang region, or both a 3' and a 5' overhang region. In certain embodiments, the overhang region is from 1 10 nucleotides in length.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid molecule is a short hairpin RNA (shRNA).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention also provides an expression cassette comprising a sequence encoding a nucleic acid molecule containing a first portion, wherein the first portion is no more than 30 nucleotides in length; a second portion, wherein the second portion has a sequence that is complementary to the first portion; and a loop portion consisting of 12 to 50 nucleotides and comprising between 12 and 32 contiguous nucleotides of SEQ ID NO:1, wherein the loop portion is a sequence designed to circumvent exportin-5 mediated export; wherein the first portion and the second portion are operably linked by means of the loop portion to form a hairpin structure comprising a duplex structure that is 10 to 29 base pairs in length and a loop structure. The expression cassette further contains a promoter. In certain embodiments, the promoter is a regulatable promoter. In certain embodiments, the promoter is a constitutive promoter. In certain embodiments, the promoter is a CMV, RSV, or polIII promoter. In certain embodiments, the promoter is not a polIII promoter.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention provides a vector containing the expression cassette described above. In certain embodiments, the vector is a viral vector. In certain embodiments, the viral vector is an adenoviral, lentiviral, adeno-associated viral (AAV), poliovirus, HSV, or murine Maloney-based viral vector.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention also provides methods of reducing the expression of a gene product in a cell by contacting a cell <i>in vitro</i> with a nucleic acid molecule containing a first person, wherein the first portion is no more than 30 nucleotides in length; a second portion, wherein the second portion has a sequence that is complementary to the first portion; and a loop portion consisting of 12 to 50 nucleotides and comprising between 12 and 32 contiguous nucleotides of SEQ ID NO:1, wherein the loop portion is a sequence designed to circumvent exportin-5 mediated export; wherein the first portion and the second portion are operably linked by means of the loop portion to form a hairpin structure comprising a duplex structure that is 10 to 29 base pairs in length and a loop structure.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Described herein is a method of suppressing the accumulation of a target protein in a cell by introducing a nucleic acid molecule described above into the cell in an amount sufficient to suppress accumulation of the target protein in the cell. In certain embodiments, the accumulation of target protein is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> suppressed by at least 10%. The accumulation of target protein is suppressed by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% 95%, or 99%.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Described herein is a method to inhibit expression of a target protein gene in a cell by introducing a nucleic acid molecule described above into the cell in an amount sufficient to inhibit expression of the target protein, and wherein the RNA inhibits expression of the target protein gene. The target protein is inhibited by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% 95%, or 99%.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As used herein, the term "overhang region" means a portion of the RNA that does not bind with the second strand. Further, the first strand and the second strand encoding the duplex can be operably linked by means of an RNA loop strand to form a hairpin structure comprising a duplex structure and a loop structure. Such RNAi molecules with hairpin stem-loop structure are referred to sometimes as short hairpin RNAs or shRNAs.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The reference to "siRNAs" herein is meant to include shRNAs, microRNAs and other small RNAs that can or are capable of modulating the expression of a target gene via RNA interference. Such small RNAs include without limitation, shRNAs and miroRNAs (miRNAs).</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">These cassettes and vectors may be contained in a cell, such as a mammalian cell. A non-human mammal may contain the cassette or vector.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">"Neurological disease" and "neurological disorder" refer to both hereditary and sporadic conditions that are characterized by nervous system dysfunction, and which may be associated with atrophy of the affected central or peripheral nervous system structures, or loss of function without atrophy. A neurological disease or disorder that results in atrophy is commonly called a "neurodegenerative disease" or "neurodegenerative disorder." Neurodegenerative diseases and disorders include, but are not limited to, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), hereditary spastic hemiplegia, primary lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, Kennedy's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and repeat expansion neurodegenerative diseases, <i>e.g.,</i> diseases associated with expansions of trinucleotide repeats such as polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat diseases, <i>e.g.,</i><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). An example of a disabling neurological disorder that does not appear to result in atrophy is DYT1 dystonia. The gene of interest may encode a ligand for a chemokine involved in the migration of a cancer cell, or a chemokine receptor.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Described herein is a method of substantially silencing a target gene of interest or targeted allele for the gene of interest in order to provide a therapeutic effect. As used herein the term "substantially silencing" or "substantially silenced" refers to decreasing, reducing, or inhibiting the expression of the target gene or target allele by at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85% to 100%. As used herein the term "therapeutic effect" refers to a change in the associated abnormalities of the disease state, including pathological and behavioral deficits; a change in the time to progression of the disease state; a reduction, lessening, or alteration of a symptom of the disease; or an improvement in the quality of life of the person afflicted with the disease. Therapeutic effect can be measured quantitatively by a physician or qualitatively by a patient afflicted with the disease state targeted by the RNAi molecule. In certain embodiments wherein both the mutant and wild type allele are substantially silenced, the term therapeutic effect defines a condition in which silencing of the wild type allele's expression does not have a deleterious or harmful effect on normal functions such that the patient would not have a therapeutic effect.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one embodiment, the selected nucleotide sequence is operably linked to control elements that direct the transcription or expression thereof in the subject in vivo. Such control elements can comprise control sequences normally associated with the selected gene. Alternatively, heterologous control sequences can be employed. Useful heterologous control sequences generally include those derived from sequences encoding mammalian or viral genes. Examples include, but are not limited to, the SV40 early promoter, mouse mammary tumor virus LTR promoter; adenovirus major late promoter (Ad MLP); a herpes simplex<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> virus (HSV) promoter, a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter such as the CMV immediate early promoter region (CMVIE), a rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter, pol II promoters, pol III promoters, synthetic promoters, hybrid promoters, and the like. In addition, sequences derived from nonviral genes, such as the murine metallothionein gene, will also find use herein. Such promoter sequences are commercially available from, e.g., Stratagene (San Diego, Calif.).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In one embodiment, both heterologous promoters and other control elements, such as CNS-specific and inducible promoters, enhancers and the like, will be of particular use. Examples of heterologous promoters include the CMB promoter. Examples of CNS-specific promoters include those isolated from the genes from myelin basic protein (MBP), glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), and neuron specific enolase (NSE). Examples of inducible promoters include DNA responsive elements for ecdysone, tetracycline, hypoxia and aufin.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Methods of delivery of viral vectors include, but are not limited to, intraarterial, intra-muscular, intravenous, intranasal and oral routes. Generally, rAAV virions may be introduced into cells of the CNS using either in vivo or in vitro transduction techniques. If transduced in vitro, the desired recipient cell will be removed from the subject, transduced with rAAV virions and reintroduced into the subject. Alternatively, syngeneic or xenogeneic cells can be used where those cells will not generate an inappropriate immune response in the subject.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Suitable methods for the delivery and introduction of transduced cells into a subject have been described. For example, cells can be transduced in vitro by combining recombinant AAV virions with CNS cells e.g., in appropriate media, and screening for those cells harboring the DNA of interest can be screened using conventional techniques such as Southern blots and/or PCR, or by using selectable markers. Transduced cells can then be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions, described more fully below, and the composition introduced into the subject by various techniques, such as by grafting, intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Any convection-enhanced delivery device may be appropriate for delivery of viral vectors. In one embodiment, the device is an osmotic pump or an infusion pump. Both osmotic and infusion pumps are commercially available<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> from a variety of suppliers, for example Alzet Corporation, Hamilton Corporation, Aiza, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.). Typically, a viral vector is delivered via CED devices as follows. A catheter, cannula or other injection device is inserted into CNS tissue in the chosen subject. In view of the teachings herein, one of skill in the art could readily determine which general area of the CNS is an appropriate target. For example, when delivering AAV vector encoding a therapeutic gene to treat PD, the striatum is a suitable area of the brain to target. Stereotactic maps and positioning devices are available, for example from ASI Instruments, Warren, Mich. Positioning may also be conducted by using anatomical maps obtained by CT and/or MRI imaging of the subject's brain to help guide the injection device to the chosen target. Moreover, because the methods described herein can be practiced such that relatively large areas of the brain take up the viral vectors, fewer infusion cannula are needed. Since surgical complications are related to the number of penetrations, the methods described herein also serve to reduce the side effects seen with conventional delivery techniques.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In one embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions will comprise sufficient genetic material to produce a therapeutically effective amount of the RNAi molecule of interest, i.e., an amount sufficient to reduce or ameliorate symptoms of the disease state in question or an amount sufficient to confer the desired benefit. The pharmaceutical compositions will also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Such excipients include any pharmaceutical agent that does not itself induce the production of antibodies harmful to the individual receiving the composition, and which may be administered without undue toxicity.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include, but are not limited to, sorbitol, Tween80, and liquids such as water, saline, glycerol and ethanol. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be included therein, for example, mineral acid salts such as hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates, sulfates, and the like; and the salts of organic acids such as acetates, propionates, malonates, benzoates, and the like. Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering substances, and the like, may be present in<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> such vehicles. A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients is available in <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Pub. Co., N.J. 1991</text></nplcit>).</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As is apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the teachings of this specification, an effective amount of viral vector which must be added can be empirically determined. Administration can be effected in one dose, continuously or intermittently throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosages of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the viral vector, the composition of the therapy, the target cells, and the subject being treated. Single and multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>Brief Description of the Figures</u></b></heading><p id="p0025" num="0025"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Figure 1</b></figref><b>:</b> Exportin-5 Mediated Export of microRNA and shRNA.

Techniques have been developed to trigger RNA interference (RNAi) against specific targets in mammalian cells by introducing exogenously produced or intracellularly expressed siRNAs. These methods have proven to be quick, inexpensive and effective for knockdown experiments in <i>vitro</i> and <i>in vivo.</i> The ability to accomplish selective gene silencing has led to the hypothesis that siRNAs might be employed to suppress gene expression for therapeutic benefit.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The potential for RNAi as a therapeutic tool for treating dominant genetics disorders, chronic viral infections, and cancer is immense. However, recent work by <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Grimm, et al. (Nature, 441(7092):537-41 (2006</text></nplcit>)) and the inventors' own data suggest that the microRNA processing pathway can be saturated by over-expression of shRNAs, leading to cellular toxicity. Current data suggest that saturation of the nuclear export factor exportin-5 is the primary cause of shRNA-induced toxicity. The inventors incorporated specific sequences designed to circumvent exportin-5 mediated export into the shRNA<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> loop to relieve this toxicity. To do this, the inventors used a repeated sequence motif derived from the ORF2 transcript of an L1 retrotransposon that mediates Nxf-1 mediated nuclear export of viral mRNAs (<figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The inventors found that shRNAs and microRNAs in which the standard 10 nucleotide (nt) loop sequence was replaced by the 32 nt L1 motif (L1 loop) were functional and elicited equivalent levels of gene silencing of artificial luciferase targets (<figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3A and 3B</figref>). A reporter vector was generated containing the siRNA target in the 3' UTR of Renilla luciferase. For this experiment, the siRNA target allowed silencing by shHD2.4, but not shlacZ. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3B</figref>, the standard shHD2.4, which is exported via exportin-5 from the nucleus, silences the R-luc activity by greater than 90%, even at very low shRNA to target ratios. Unexpectedly, placing the L1 sequences into the loop (shHD2.4L1) for redirecting export to the UAP56/ALY/NXF1pathway allowed for export and processing. Silencing was nearly as efficient as for shHD2.4.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The inventors examined if there was reduced toxicity with retargeted nuclear export (<figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>). As outlined in the cartoon in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, cells were transfected with plasmids expressing miR34a and the shRNAs encoding HD2.4, HD30.a or shLacZ (LZ) as indicated above, and luciferase activity measured. With no miR-34a activity (<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, far right) luciferase is set to 100%. Plasmids expressing luciferase with a miR34a target sequence in the 3' UTR was silenced approximately 90% by miR34a in the absence of exogenous shRNA expression vectors. While the shRNA expression plasmids 2.4, 30.1 and LZ inhibited miR34a export, inclusion of the L1 loop alleviated this depression. The data in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref> show that the shRNAs with L1 sequences in the loop can support silencing, and that these sequences are likely not exported through exportin 5 and therefore do not inhibit processing of miRNAs.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Disclosed herein is a strategy that results in substantial silencing of targeted alleles <i>via</i> RNAi. However, this strategy was not known to be successful, since inhibitory RNAs have not been shown to use this export pathway. Indeed, it was not known what level of silencing to expect from shRNAs containing L1 sequences in their loops. Impressively, the inventors found that the L1 sequence was tolerated, and silencing was as efficacious as a<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> standard miRNA loop. Also importantly, the L1 loop did not suppress miRNA processing.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Use of this strategy results in markedly diminished expression of targeted alleles. This strategy is useful in reducing expression of targeted alleles in order to model biological processes or to provide therapy for human diseases. For example, this strategy can be applied to a major class of neurodegenerative disorders, the polyglutamine diseases, as is demonstrated by the reduction of polyglutamine aggregation in cells following application of the strategy. As used herein the term "substantial silencing" means that the mRNA of the targeted allele is inhibited and/or degraded by the presence of the introduced RNAi molecule, such that expression of the targeted allele is reduced by about 10% to 100% as compared to the level of expression seen when the RNAi molecule is not present. Generally, when an allele is substantially silenced, it will have at least 40%, 50%, 60%, to 70%, <i>e.g</i>., 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, to 79%, generally at least 80%, e.g., 81%-84%, at least 85%, <i>e.g.,</i> 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or even 100% reduction expression as compared to when the RNAi molecule is not present. As used herein the term "substantially normal activity" means the level of expression of an allele when an RNAi molecule has not been introduced to a cell.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">One of skill in the art can select target sites for generating specific RNAi molecules. Such RNAi molecules may be designed using the guidelines provided by Ambion (Austin, TX). Briefly, the target cDNA sequence is scanned for target sequences that had AA di-nucleotides. Sense and anti-sense oligonucleotides are generated to these targets (AA + 3' adjacent 19 nucleotides) that contained a G/C content of 35 to 55%. These sequences are then compared to others in the human genome database to minimize homology to other known coding sequences (BLAST search).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">To accomplish intracellular expression of the therapeutic RNAi, an RNAi molecule is constructed containing a hairpin sequence (such as a 21-bp duplex) representing sequences directed against the gene of interest.

The RNAi molecule reduces target mRNA and protein expression.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The construct encoding the therapeutic RNAi molecule can be configured such that one or more strands of the RNAi molecule are encoded by a nucleic acid that is immediately contiguous to a promoter. In one example, the promoter is a pol II promoter. If a pol II promoter is used in a particular construct, it is selected from readily available pol II promoters known in the art, depending on whether regulatable, inducible, tissue or cell-specific expression of the RNAi molecule is desired. The construct is introduced into the target cell, such as by injection, allowing for diminished target-gene expression in the cell.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Described herein is an expression cassette containing an isolated nucleic acid sequence encoding a RNAi molecule targeted against a gene of interest. The RNAi molecule forms a hairpin structure that contains a duplex structure and a loop structure. The duplex is less than 30 nucleotides in length, such as from 19 to 25 nucleotides. The RNAi molecule may further contain an overhang region. Such an overhang may be a 3' overhang region or a 5' overhang region. The overhang region may be, for example, from 1 to 6 nucleotides in length. The expression cassette may further contain a pol II promoter, as described herein. Examples of pol II promoters include regulatable promoters and constitutive promoters. For example, the promoter may be a CMV or RSV promoter. The expression cassette may further contain a polyadenylation signal, such as a synthetic minimal polyadenylation signal.

As used herein, the term "siRNA" is a generic term that encompasses the subset of shRNAs. A "RNA duplex" refers to the structure formed by the complementary pairing between two regions of a RNA molecule. An RNAi molecule is "targeted" to a gene in that the nucleotide sequence of the duplex portion of the RNAi molecule is complementary to a nucleotide sequence of the targeted gene. In certain embodiments, the siRNAs are targeted to the sequence encoding huntingtin. In some embodiments, the length of the duplex of siRNAs is less than 30 base pairs. In some embodiments, the duplex can be 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11 or 10 base pairs in length.

For example, the amount of protein may be reduced by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, or 99%. In some embodiments, the expression is reduced by about 90% (<i>i.e.,</i> only about 10% of the amount of protein is observed a cell as compared to a cell where RNAi molecules have not been administered). Knock-down of gene expression can be directed by the use of dsRNAs or siRNAs.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">"RNA interference (RNAi)" is the process of sequence-specific, post-transcriptional gene silencing initiated by RNAi molecules.

The term "suppressing" refers to the diminution, reduction or elimination in the number or amount of transcripts present in a particular cell. For example, the accumulation of mRNA encoding huntingtin can be suppressed in a cell by RNA interference (RNAi), e.g., the gene is silenced by sequence-specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is also called short interfering RNA (siRNA). These siRNAs can be two separate RNA molecules that have hybridized together, or they may be a single hairpin wherein two portions of a RNA molecule have hybridized together to form a duplex.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0047" num="0047">A mutant protein refers to the protein encoded by a gene having a mutation, <i>e.g.,</i> a missense or nonsense mutation in one or both alleles of huntingtin.

An isolated DNA molecule, RNA molecule or polypeptide may exist in a purified form or may exist in a non-native environment such as, for example, a transgenic host cell. For example, an "isolated" or "purified" nucleic acid molecule or protein, or biologically active portion thereof, is substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. In one embodiment, an "isolated" nucleic acid is free of sequences that naturally flank the nucleic acid (<i>i.e.,</i> sequences located at the.5' and 3' ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb, or 0.1 kb of nucleotide sequences that naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. A protein that is substantially free of cellular material includes preparations of protein or polypeptide having less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, or 5% (by dry weight) of contaminating protein. When the protein , or biologically active portion thereof, is recombinantly produced, culture medium represents less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, or 5% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or non-protein-of-interest chemicals.

"Genes" also include nonexpressed DNA segments that, for example, form recognition sequences for other proteins. "Genes" can be obtained from a variety of sources, including<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> cloning from a source of interest or synthesizing from known or predicted sequence information, and may include sequences designed to have desired parameters.

"cDNA" refers to a single- or a double-stranded DNA that is complementary to and derived from mRNA.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">"Regulatory sequences" and "suitable regulatory sequences" each refer to nucleotide sequences located upstream (5' non-coding sequences), within, or downstream (3' non-coding sequences) of a coding sequence, and which influence the transcription, RNA processing or stability, or translation of the associated coding sequence. Regulatory sequences include enhancers, promoters, translation leader sequences, introns, and polyadenylation signal sequences. They include natural and synthetic sequences as well as sequences that may be a combination of synthetic and natural sequences. As is noted above, the term "suitable regulatory sequences" is not limited to promoters. However, some suitable regulatory sequences useful in the present invention will include, but are not limited to constitutive promoters, tissue-specific promoters, development-specific promoters, regulatable promoters and viral promoters. Examples of promoters that may be used in the present invention include CMV, RSV, pol II and pol III promoters.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">"5' non-coding sequence" refers to a nucleotide sequence located 5' (upstream) to the coding sequence. It is present in the fully processed mRNA upstream of the initiation codon and may affect processing of the primary transcript to mRNA, mRNA stability or translation efficiency.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">"3' non-coding sequence" refers to nucleotide sequences located 3' (downstream) to a coding sequence and may include polyadenylation signal sequences and other sequences encoding regulatory signals capable of affecting mRNA processing or gene expression. The polyadenylation signal is usually characterized by affecting the addition of polyadenylic acid tracts to the 3' end of the mRNA precursor.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">The term "translation leader sequence" refers to that DNA sequence portion of a gene between the promoter and coding sequence that is transcribed into RNA and is present in the fully processed mRNA upstream (5') of the<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> translation start codon. The translation leader sequence may affect processing of the primary transcript to mRNA, mRNA stability or translation efficiency.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">The term "mature" protein refers to a post-translationally processed polypeptide without its signal peptide. "Precursor" protein refers to the primary product of translation of an mRNA. "Signal peptide" refers to the amino terminal extension of a polypeptide, which is translated in conjunction with the polypeptide forming a precursor peptide and which is required for its entrance into the secretory pathway. The term "signal sequence" refers to a nucleotide sequence that encodes the signal peptide.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">"Promoter" refers to a nucleotide sequence, usually upstream (5') to its coding sequence, which directs and/or controls the expression of the coding sequence by providing the recognition for RNA polymerase and other factors required for proper transcription. "Promoter" includes a minimal promoter that is a short DNA sequence comprised of a TATA-box and other sequences that serve to specify the site of transcription initiation, to which regulatory elements are added for control of expression. "Promoter" also refers to a nucleotide sequence that includes a minimal promoter plus regulatory elements that is capable of controlling the expression of a coding sequence or functional RNA. This type of promoter sequence consists of proximal and more distal upstream elements, the latter elements often referred to as enhancers. Accordingly, an "enhancer" is a DNA sequence that can stimulate promoter activity and may be an innate element of the promoter or a heterologous element inserted to enhance the level or tissue specificity of a promoter. It is capable of operating in both orientations (normal or flipped), and is capable of functioning even when moved either upstream or downstream from the promoter. Both enhancers and other upstream promoter elements bind sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that mediate their effects. Promoters may be derived in their entirety from a native gene, or be composed of different elements derived from different promoters found in nature, or even be comprised of synthetic DNA segments. A promoter may also contain DNA sequences that are involved in the binding of protein factors that control the effectiveness of transcription initiation in response to physiological or developmental conditions.<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --></p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The "initiation site" is the position surrounding the first nucleotide that is part of the transcribed sequence, which is also defined as position +1. With respect to this site all other sequences of the gene and its controlling regions are numbered. Downstream sequences (<i>i.e.,</i> further protein encoding sequences in the 3' direction) are denominated positive, while upstream sequences (mostly of the controlling regions in the 5' direction) are denominated negative.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Promoter elements, particularly a TATA element, that are inactive or that have greatly reduced promoter activity in the absence of upstream activation are referred to as "minimal or core promoters." In the presence of a suitable transcription factor, the minimal promoter functions to permit transcription. A "minimal or core promoter" thus consists only of all basal elements needed for transcription initiation, e.g., a TATA box and/or an initiator.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">"Constitutive expression" refers to expression using a constitutive or regulated promoter. "Conditional" and "regulated expression" refer to expression controlled by a regulated promoter.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">"Operably-linked" refers to the association of nucleic acid sequences on single nucleic acid fragment so that the function of one of the sequences is affected by another. For example, a regulatory DNA sequence is said to be "operably linked to" or "associated with" a DNA sequence that codes for an RNA or a polypeptide if the two sequences are situated such that the regulatory DNA sequence affects expression of the coding DNA sequence (<i>i.e.,</i> that the coding sequence or functional RNA is under the transcriptional control of the promoter). Coding sequences can be operably-linked to regulatory sequences in sense or antisense orientation.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">"Expression" refers to the transcription and/or translation of an endogenous gene, heterologous gene or nucleic acid segment, or a transgene in cells. For example, in the case of RNAi molecule constructs, expression may refer to the transcription of the RNAi molecule only. In addition, expression refers to the transcription and stable accumulation of sense (mRNA) or functional RNA. Expression may also refer to the production of protein.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">"Altered levels" refers to the level of expression in transgenic cells or organisms that differs from that of normal or untransformed cells or organisms.<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --></p><p id="p0085" num="0085">"Overexpression" refers to the level of expression in transgenic cells or organisms that exceeds levels of expression in normal or untransformed cells or organisms.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">"Antisense inhibition" refers to the production of antisense RNA transcripts capable of suppressing the expression of protein from an endogenous gene or a transgene.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">"Transcription stop fragment" refers to nucleotide sequences that contain one or more regulatory signals, such as polyadenylation signal sequences, capable of terminating transcription. Examples include the 3' non-regulatory regions of genes encoding nopaline synthase and the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">"Translation stop fragment" refers to nucleotide sequences that contain one or more regulatory signals, such as one or more termination codons in all three frames, capable of terminating translation. Insertion of a translation stop fragment adjacent to or near the initiation codon at the 5' end of the coding sequence will result in no translation or improper translation. Excision of the translation stop fragment by site-specific recombination will leave a site-specific sequence in the coding sequence that does not interfere with proper translation using the initiation codon.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">The terms "<i>cis</i>-acting sequence" and "<i>cis</i>-acting element" refer to DNA or RNA sequences whose functions require them to be on the same molecule.

Where genes are not "chromosomally integrated" they may be "transiently expressed." Transient expression of a gene refers to the expression of a gene that is not integrated into the host chromosome but functions independently, either as part of an<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> autonomously replicating plasmid or expression cassette, for example, or as part of another biological system such as a virus.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">The following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between two or more nucleic acids or polynucleotides: (a) "reference sequence," (b) "comparison window," (c) "sequence identity," (d) "percentage of sequence identity," and (e) "substantial identity."
<ol><li>(a) As used herein, "reference sequence" is a defined sequence used as a basis for sequence comparison. A reference sequence may be a subset or the entirety of a specified sequence; for example, as a segment of a full-length cDNA or gene sequence, or the complete cDNA or gene sequence.</li><li>(b) As used herein, "comparison window" makes reference to a contiguous and specified segment of a polynucleotide sequence, wherein the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (<i>i.e.,</i> gaps) compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. Generally, the comparison window is at least 20 contiguous nucleotides in length, and optionally can be 30, 40, 50, 100, or longer. Those of skill in the art understand that to avoid a high similarity to a reference sequence due to inclusion of gaps in the polynucleotide sequence a gap penalty is typically introduced and is subtracted from the number of matches.</li></ol></p><p id="p0093" num="0093">Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well-known in the art. Thus, the determination of percent identity between any two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. Computer implementations of these mathematical algorithms can be utilized for comparison of sequences to determine sequence identity. Such implementations include, but are not limited to: CLUSTAL in the PC/Gene program (available from Intelligenetics, Mountain View, California); the ALIGN program (Version 2.0) and GAP, BESTFIT, BLAST, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Version 8 (available from Genetics Computer Group (GCG), 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Alignments using these programs can be performed using the default parameters. The CLUSTAL program is well-known in the art.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --></p><p id="p0094" num="0094">Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (<i>see</i>, the World-wide-web at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold. These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always &gt; 0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always &lt; 0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value, the cumulative score goes to zero or below due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments, or the end of either sequence is reached.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">In addition to calculating percent sequence identity, the BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences. One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a test nucleic acid sequence is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid sequence to the reference nucleic acid sequence is less than about 0.1, less than about 0.01, or even less than about 0.001.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST (in BLAST 2.0) can be utilized. Alternatively, PSI-BLAST (in BLAST 2.0) can be used to perform an iterated search that detects distant relationships between molecules. When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, PSI-BLAST, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g. BLASTN for nucleotide sequences,<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> BLASTX for proteins) can be used. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of 10, a cutoff of 100, M=5, N=-4, and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 3, an expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix. <i>See,</i> the World-wide-web at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Alignment may also be performed manually by inspection.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">For purposes of the present invention, comparison of nucleotide sequences for determination of percent sequence identity to the promoter sequences disclosed herein is made using the BlastN program (version 1.4.7 or later) with its default parameters or any equivalent program. By "equivalent program" is intended any sequence comparison program that, for any two sequences in question, generates an alignment having identical nucleotide or amino acid residue matches and an identical percent sequence identity when compared to the corresponding alignment generated by the preferred program.
<ul><li>(c) As used herein, "sequence identity" or "identity" in the context of two nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences makes reference to a specified percentage of residues in the two sequences that are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence over a specified comparison window, as measured by sequence comparison algorithms or by visual inspection. When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to proteins it is recognized that residue positions which are not identical often differ by conservative amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are substituted for other amino acid residues with similar chemical properties (<i>e.g.,</i> charge or hydrophobicity) and therefore do not change the functional properties of the molecule. When sequences differ in conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences that differ by such conservative substitutions are said to have "sequence similarity" or "similarity." Means for making this adjustment are well known to those of skill in the art. Typically this involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch, thereby increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an identical amino acid<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> is given a score of 1 and a non-conservative substitution is given a score of zero, a conservative substitution is given a score between zero and 1. The scoring of conservative substitutions is calculated, e.g., as implemented in the program PC/GENE (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, California).</li><li>(d) As used herein, "percentage of sequence identity" means the value determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison, and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.</li><li>(e)(i) The term "substantial identity" of polynucleotide sequences means that a polynucleotide comprises a sequence that has at least 70%, 71 %, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, or 79%, or at least 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, or 89%, or at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, or 94%, or even at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity, compared to a reference sequence using one of the alignment programs described using standard parameters. One of skill in the art will recognize that these values can be appropriately adjusted to determine corresponding identity of proteins encoded by two nucleotide sequences by taking into account codon degeneracy, amino acid similarity, reading frame positioning, and the like. Substantial identity of amino acid sequences for these purposes normally means sequence identity of at least 70%, at least 80%, 90%, or even at least 95%.
<br/>
Another indication that nucleotide sequences are substantially identical is if two molecules hybridize to each other under stringent conditions. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5°C lower than the thermal melting point (T<sub>m</sub>) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. However, stringent conditions encompass temperatures in the range of about 1 °C<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> to about 20°C, depending upon the desired degree of stringency as otherwise qualified herein. Nucleic acids that do not hybridize to each other under stringent conditions are still substantially identical if the polypeptides they encode are substantially identical. This may occur, <i>e.g.,</i> when a copy of a nucleic acid is created using the maximum codon degeneracy permitted by the genetic code. One indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially identical is when the polypeptide encoded by the first nucleic acid is immunologically cross reactive with the polypeptide encoded by the second nucleic acid.
</li><li>(e)(ii) The term "substantial identity" in the context of a peptide indicates that a peptide comprises a sequence with at least 70%, 71 %, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, or 79%, or 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, or 89%, or at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, or 94%, or even, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%, sequence identity to the reference sequence over a specified comparison window. An indication that two peptide sequences are substantially identical is that one peptide is immunologically reactive with antibodies raised against the second peptide. Thus, a peptide is substantially identical to a second peptide, for example, where the two peptides differ only by a conservative substitution.</li></ul></p><p id="p0098" num="0098">For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are input into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence(s) relative to the reference sequence, based on the designated program parameters.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">As noted above, another indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially identical is that the two molecules hybridize to each other under stringent conditions. The phrase "hybridizing specifically to" refers to the binding, duplexing, or hybridizing of a molecule only to a particular nucleotide sequence under stringent conditions when that sequence is present in a complex mixture (<i>e.g.,</i> total cellular) DNA or RNA. "Bind(s) substantially" refers to complementary hybridization between a probe nucleic acid and a target nucleic<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> acid and embraces minor mismatches that can be accommodated by reducing the stringency of the hybridization media to achieve the desired detection of the target nucleic acid sequence.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">"Stringent hybridization conditions" and "stringent hybridization wash conditions" in the context of nucleic acid hybridization experiments such as Southern and Northern hybridizations are sequence dependent, and are different under different environmental parameters. Longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. The T<sub>m</sub> is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of the target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched probe. Specificity is typically the function of post-hybridization washes, the critical factors being the ionic strength and temperature of the final wash solution. For DNA-DNA hybrids, the T<sub>m</sub> can be approximated from the equation of Meinkoth and Wahl: T<sub>m</sub> 81.5°C + 16.6 (log M) +0.41 (%GC) - 0.61 (% form) - 500/L; where M is the molarity of monovalent cations, %GC is the percentage of guanosine and cytosine nucleotides in the DNA, % form is the percentage of formamide in the hybridization solution, and L is the length of the hybrid in base pairs. T<sub>m</sub> is reduced by about 1°C for each 1% of mismatching; thus, T<sub>m</sub>, hybridization, and/or wash conditions can be adjusted to hybridize to sequences of the desired identity. For example, if sequences with &gt;90% identity are sought, the T<sub>m</sub> can be decreased 10°C. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5°C lower than the thermal melting point (T<sub>m</sub>) for the specific sequence and its complement at a defined ionic strength and pH. However, severely stringent conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 1, 2, 3, or 4°C lower than the thermal melting point (T<sub>m</sub>); moderately stringent conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10°C lower than the thermal melting point (T<sub>m</sub>); low stringency conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 20°C lower than the thermal melting point (T<sub>m</sub>). Using the equation, hybridization and wash compositions, and desired T, those of ordinary skill will understand that variations in the stringency of hybridization and/or wash solutions are inherently described. If the desired degree of mismatching results in a T of less than 45°C (aqueous solution) or 32°C (formamide<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> solution), the SSC concentration may be increased so that a higher temperature can be used. Generally, highly stringent hybridization and wash conditions are selected to be about 5°C lower than the thermal melting point (T<sub>m</sub>) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">An example of highly stringent wash conditions is 0.15 M NaCl at 72°C for about 15 minutes. An example of stringent wash conditions is a 0.2X SSC wash at 65°C for 15 minutes. Often, a high stringency wash is preceded by a low stringency wash to remove background probe signal. An example medium stringency wash for a duplex of, <i>e.g.,</i> more than 100 nucleotides, is 1X SSC at 45°C for 15 minutes. An example low stringency wash for a duplex of, e.g., more than 100 nucleotides, is 4-6X SSC at 40°C for 15 minutes. For short probes (<i>e.g.,</i> about 10 to 50 nucleotides), stringent conditions typically involve salt concentrations of less than about 1.5 M, about 0.01 to 1.0 M, Na ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3, and the temperature is typically at least about 30°C and at least about 60°C for long probes (<i>e.g.,</i> &gt;50 nucleotides). Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. In general, a signal to noise ratio of 2X (or higher) than that observed for an unrelated probe in the particular hybridization assay indicates detection of a specific hybridization. Nucleic acids that do not hybridize to each other under stringent conditions are still substantially identical if the proteins that they encode are substantially identical.

RNAi is seen in a number of organisms such as <i>Drosophila,</i> nematodes, fungi and plants, and is believed to be involved in anti-viral defense, modulation of transposon activity, and regulation of gene expression. During RNAi, siRNA induces degradation of target mRNA with consequent sequence-specific inhibition of gene expression.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">As used herein, the term siRNA is meant to be equivalent to other terms used to describe nucleic acid molecules that are capable of mediating sequence specific RNAi, for example, an RNAi molecule, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), micro-RNA (miRNA), short hairpin RNA (shRNA), short interfering oligonucleotide, short interfering nucleic acid, post-transcriptional gene silencing RNA (ptgsRNA), and others. In addition, as used herein, the term RNAi is meant to be equivalent to other terms used to describe sequence specific RNA interference, such as post transcriptional gene silencing, translational inhibition, or epigenetic silencing. For example, siRNA molecules described herein can be used to epigenetically silence genes at both the post-transcriptional level or the pre-transcriptional level. In a non-limiting example, epigenetic modulation of gene expression by siRNA molecules of the invention can result from siRNA mediated modification of chromatin structure or methylation pattern to alter gene expression. In another non-limiting example, modulation of gene expression by siRNA molecules of the invention can result from siRNA mediated cleavage of RNA (either coding or non-coding RNA) via RISC, or alternately, translational inhibition as is known in the art.</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">The RNAi molecule can be encoded by a nucleic acid sequence, and the nucleic acid sequence can also include a promoter. The nucleic acid sequence can also include a polyadenylation signal. In some embodiments, the polyadenylation signal is a synthetic minimal polyadenylation signal.<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --></p><p id="p0118" num="0118">"Treating" as used herein refers to ameliorating at least one symptom of, curing and/or preventing the development of a disease or a condition.</p><p id="p0119" num="0119">"Neurological disease" and "neurological disorder" refer to both hereditary and sporadic conditions that are characterized by nervous system dysfunction, and which may be associated with atrophy of the affected central or peripheral nervous system structures, or loss of function without atrophy. A neurological disease or disorder that results in atrophy is commonly called a "neurodegenerative disease" or "neurodegenerative disorder." Neurodegenerative diseases and disorders include, but are not limited to, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), hereditary spastic hemiplegia, primary lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, Kennedy's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and repeat expansion neurodegenerative diseases, <i>e.g.,</i> diseases associated with expansions of trinucleotide repeats such as polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat diseases, <i>e.g.,</i> Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). An example of a neurological disorder that does not appear to result in atrophy is DYT1 dystonia.</p><p id="p0120" num="0120">The siRNAs described herein can be generated by any method known to the art, for example, by in vitro transcription, recombinantly, or by synthetic means. In one example, the siRNAs can be generated in vitro by using a recombinant enzyme, such as T7 RNA polymerase, and DNA oligonucleotide templates.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>II. Nucleic Acid Molecules of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0121" num="0121">Sources of nucleotide sequences from which the present nucleic acid molecules can be obtained include any vertebrate, such as mammalian, cellular source.</p><p id="p0122" num="0122">As discussed above, the terms "isolated and/or purified" refer to in <i>vitro</i> isolation of a nucleic acid, <i>e.g.,</i> a DNA or RNA molecule from its natural cellular environment, and from association with other components of the cell, such as nucleic acid or polypeptide, so that it can be sequenced, replicated,<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> and/or expressed. For example, "isolated nucleic acid" may be a DNA molecule containing less than 31 sequential nucleotides that is transcribed into an RNAi molecule. Such an isolated RNAi molecule may, for example, form a hairpin structure with a duplex 21 base pairs in length that is complementary or hybridizes to a sequence in a gene of interest, and remains stably bound under stringent conditions (as defined by methods well known in the art). Thus, the RNA or DNA is "isolated" in that it is free from at least one contaminating nucleic acid with which it is normally associated in the natural source of the RNA or DNA and is substantially free of any other mammalian RNA or DNA. The phrase "free from at least one contaminating source nucleic acid with which it is normally associated" includes the case where the nucleic acid is reintroduced into the source or natural cell but is in a different chromosomal location or is otherwise flanked by nucleic acid sequences not normally found in the source cell, e.g., in a vector or plasmid.</p><p id="p0123" num="0123">In addition to a DNA sequence encoding an RNAi molecule, the nucleic acid molecules of the invention include double-stranded interfering RNA molecules, which are also useful to inhibit expression of a target gene. In certain embodiment of the invention, siRNAs are employed to inhibit expression of a target gene. By "inhibit expression" is meant to reduce, diminish or suppress expression of a target gene. Expression of a target gene may be inhibited via "gene silencing." Gene silencing refers to the suppression of gene expression, e.g., transgene, heterologous gene and/or endogenous gene expression, which may be mediated through processes that affect transcription and/or through processes that affect post-transcriptional mechanisms. In some embodiments, gene silencing occurs when an RNAi molecule initiates the degradation of the mRNA transcribed from a gene of interest in a sequence-specific manner via RNA interference, thereby preventing translation of the gene's product.</p><p id="p0124" num="0124">As used herein, the term "recombinant nucleic acid", e.g., "recombinant DNA sequence or segment" refers to a nucleic acid, e.g., to DNA, that has been derived or isolated from any appropriate cellular source, that may be subsequently chemically altered <i>in vitro,</i> so that its sequence is not naturally occurring, or corresponds to naturally occurring sequences that are not<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> positioned as they would be positioned in a genome which has not been transformed with exogenous DNA. An example of preselected DNA "derived" from a source, would be a DNA sequence that is identified as a useful fragment within a given organism, and which is then chemically synthesized in essentially pure form. An example of such DNA "isolated" from a source would be a useful DNA sequence that is excised or removed from said source by chemical means, e.g., by the use of restriction endonucleases, so that it can be further manipulated, e.g., amplified, for use in the invention, by the methodology of genetic engineering.</p><p id="p0125" num="0125">Thus, recovery or isolation of a given fragment of DNA from a restriction digest can employ separation of the digest on polyacrylamide or agarose gel by electrophoresis, identification of the fragment of interest by comparison of its mobility versus that of marker DNA fragments of known molecular weight, removal of the gel section containing the desired fragment, and separation of the gel from DNA. Therefore, "recombinant DNA" includes completely synthetic DNA sequences, semi-synthetic DNA sequences, DNA sequences isolated from biological sources, and DNA sequences derived from RNA, as well as mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p0126" num="0126">Nucleic acid molecules having base substitutions (i.e., variants) are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the nucleic acid molecule.</p><p id="p0127" num="0127">Oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis is a method for preparing substitution variants. This technique is known in the art. Briefly, nucleic acid encoding an RNAi molecule can be altered by hybridizing an oligonucleotide encoding the desired mutation to a DNA template, where the template is the single-stranded form of a plasmid or bacteriophage containing the unaltered or native gene sequence. After hybridization, a DNA polymerase is used to synthesize an entire second complementary strand of the template that will thus incorporate the oligonucleotide primer, and will code for the selected alteration<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> in the nucleic acid encoding the RNAi molecule. Generally, oligonucleotides of at least 25 nucleotides in length are used. An optimal oligonucleotide will have 12 to 15 nucleotides that are completely complementary to the template on either side of the nucleotide(s) coding for the mutation. This ensures that the oligonucleotide will hybridize properly to the single-stranded DNA template molecule. The oligonucleotides are readily synthesized using techniques known in the art.</p><p id="p0128" num="0128">The DNA template can be generated by those vectors that are either derived from bacteriophage M13 vectors (the commercially available M13mp18 and M13mp19 vectors are suitable), or those vectors that contain a single-stranded phage origin of replication. Thus, the DNA that is to be mutated may be inserted into one of these vectors to generate single-stranded template. Alternatively, single-stranded DNA template may be generated by denaturing double-stranded plasmid (or other) DNA using standard techniques.</p><p id="p0129" num="0129">For alteration of the native DNA sequence (to generate amino acid sequence variants, for example), the oligonucleotide is hybridized to the single-stranded template under suitable hybridization conditions. A DNA polymerizing enzyme, usually the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, is then added to synthesize the complementary strand of the template using the oligonucleotide as a primer for synthesis. A heteroduplex molecule is thus formed such that one strand of DNA encodes the mutated form of the DNA, and the other strand (the original template) encodes the native, unaltered sequence of the DNA. This heteroduplex molecule is then transformed into a suitable host cell, usually a prokaryote such as <i>E<b>.</b> coli</i> JM101. After the cells are grown, they are plated onto agarose plates and screened using the oligonucleotide primer radiolabeled with 32-phosphate to identify the bacterial colonies that contain the mutated DNA. The mutated region is then removed and placed in an appropriate vector, generally an expression vector of the type typically employed for transformation of an appropriate host.</p><p id="p0130" num="0130">The method described immediately above may be modified such that a homoduplex molecule is created wherein both strands of the plasmid contain the mutations(s). The modifications are as follows: The single-stranded<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> oligonucleotide is annealed to the single-stranded template as described above. A mixture of three deoxyribonucleotides, deoxyriboadenosine (dATP), deoxyriboguanosine (dGTP), and deoxyribothymidine (dTTP), is combined with a modified thiodeoxyribocytosine called dCTP-(*S) (which can be obtained from the Amersham Corporation). This mixture is added to the template-oligonucleotide complex. Upon addition of DNA polymerase to this mixture, a strand of DNA identical to the template except for the mutated bases is generated. In addition, this new strand of DNA will contain dCTP-(*S) instead of dCTP, which serves to protect it from restriction endonuclease digestion.</p><p id="p0131" num="0131">After the template strand of the double-stranded heteroduplex is nicked with an appropriate restriction enzyme, the template strand can be digested with ExoIII nuclease or another appropriate nuclease past the region that contains the site(s) to be mutagenized. The reaction is then stopped to leave a molecule that is only partially single-stranded. A complete double-stranded DNA homoduplex is then formed using DNA polymerase in the presence of all four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, ATP, and DNA ligase. This homoduplex molecule can then be transformed into a suitable host cell such as <i>E. coli</i> JM101.</p><heading id="h0006"><b>III. <u>Expression Cassettes of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0132" num="0132">To prepare expression cassettes, the recombinant DNA sequence or segment may be circular or linear, double-stranded or single-stranded. Generally, the DNA sequence or segment is in the form of chimeric DNA, such as plasmid DNA or a vector that can also contain coding regions flanked by control sequences that promote the expression of the recombinant DNA present in the resultant transformed cell.</p><p id="p0133" num="0133">A "chimeric" vector or expression cassette, as used herein, means a vector or cassette including nucleic acid sequences from at least two different species, or has a nucleic acid sequence from the same species that is linked or associated in a manner that does not occur in the "native" or wild type of the species.<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --></p><p id="p0134" num="0134">Aside from recombinant DNA sequences that serve as transcription units for an RNA transcript, or portions thereof, a portion of the recombinant DNA may be untranscribed, serving a regulatory or a structural function.

Such elements may or may not be necessary for the function of the DNA, but may provide improved expression of the DNA by affecting transcription, stability of the RNAi molecule, or the like. Such elements may be included in the DNA as desired to obtain the optimal performance of the RNAi molecule in the cell.</p><p id="p0136" num="0136">Control sequences are DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotic cells, for example, include a promoter, and optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.</p><p id="p0137" num="0137">Operably linked nucleic acids are nucleic acids placed in a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, operably linked DNA sequences are DNA sequences that are linked are contiguous. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accord with conventional practice.</p><p id="p0138" num="0138">The recombinant DNA to be introduced into the cells may contain either a selectable marker gene or a reporter gene or both to facilitate identification and selection of expressing cells from the population of cells sought to be transfected or infected through viral vectors.

Both selectable markers and reporter genes may be flanked with<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> appropriate regulatory sequences to enable expression in the host cells. Useful selectable markers are known in the art and include, for example, antibiotic-resistance genes, such as <i>neo</i> and the like.</p><p id="p0139" num="0139">Reporter genes are used for identifying potentially transfected cells and for evaluating the functionality of regulatory sequences. Reporter genes that encode for easily assayable proteins are well known in the art. In general, a reporter gene is a gene that is not present in or expressed by the recipient organism or tissue and that encodes a protein whose expression is manifested by some easily detectable property, <i>e.g.,</i> enzymatic activity. For example, reporter genes include the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene (cat) from Tn9 of <i>E. coli</i> and the luciferase gene from firefly <i>Photinus pyralis.</i> Expression of the reporter gene is assayed at a suitable time after the DNA has been introduced into the recipient cells.</p><p id="p0140" num="0140">In order to prevent any packaging of AAV genomic sequences containing the rep and cap genes, a plasmid containing the rep and cap DNA fragment can be modified by the inclusion of a stuffer fragment into the AAV genome which causes the DNA to exceed the length for optimal packaging. Thus, in certain embodiments, the helper fragment is not packaged into AAV virions. This is a safety feature, ensuring that only a recombinant AAV vector genome that does not exceed optimal packaging size is packaged into virions. An AAV helper fragment that incorporates a stuffer sequence can exceed the wild-type genome length of 4.6 kb, and lengths above 105% of the wild-type will generally not be packaged. The stuffer fragment can be derived from, for example, such non-viral sources as the Lac-Z or beta-galactosidase gene.</p><p id="p0141" num="0141">The general methods for constructing recombinant DNA that can transfect target cells are well known to those skilled in the art, and the same compositions and methods of construction may be utilized to produce the DNA useful herein.

Various expression vectors <i>(i. e.,</i> vehicles for facilitating delivery of exogenous nucleic acid into a target cell) are known to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p0166" num="0166">As used herein, "transfection of cells" refers to the acquisition by a cell of new nucleic acid material by incorporation of added DNA. Thus, transfection refers to the insertion of nucleic acid into a cell using physical or chemical methods. Several transfection techniques are known to those of ordinary skill in the art including: calcium phosphate DNA co-precipitation; DEAE-dextran; electroporation; cationic liposome-mediated transfection; and tungsten particle-facilitated microparticle bombardment. Strontium phosphate DNA coprecipitation is also a transfection method.</p><p id="p0167" num="0167">In contrast, "transduction of cells" refers to the process of transferring nucleic acid into a cell using a DNA or RNA virus. A RNA virus (i. e., a retrovirus) for transferring a nucleic acid into a cell is referred to herein as a<!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --> transducing chimeric retrovirus. Exogenous nucleic acid material contained within the retrovirus is incorporated into the genome of the transduced cell. A cell that has been transduced with a chimeric DNA virus (e.g., an adenovirus carrying a cDNA encoding a therapeutic agent), will not have the exogenous nucleic acid material incorporated into its genome but will be capable of expressing the exogenous nucleic acid material that is retained extrachromosomally within the cell.</p><p id="p0168" num="0168">The exogenous nucleic acid material can include the nucleic acid encoding the RNAi molecule together with a promoter to control transcription. The promoter characteristically has a specific nucleotide sequence necessary to initiate transcription. The exogenous nucleic acid material may further include additional sequences (<i>i.e.,</i> enhancers) required to obtain the desired gene transcription activity. For the purpose of this discussion an "enhancer" is simply any non-translated DNA sequence that works with the coding sequence (in <i>cis)</i> to change the basal transcription level dictated by the promoter. The exogenous nucleic acid material may be introduced into the cell genome immediately downstream from the promoter so that the promoter and coding sequence are operatively linked so as to permit transcription of the coding sequence. An expression vector can include an exogenous promoter element to control transcription of the inserted exogenous gene. Such exogenous promoters include both constitutive and regulatable promoters.</p><p id="p0169" num="0169">Naturally-occurring constitutive promoters control the expression of essential cell functions. As a result, a nucleic acid sequence under the control of a constitutive promoter is expressed under all conditions of cell growth. Constitutive promoters include the promoters for the following genes which encode certain constitutive or "housekeeping" functions: hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), adenosine deaminase, phosphoglycerol kinase (PGK), pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerol mutase, the beta-actin promoter, and other constitutive promoters known to those of skill in the art. In addition, many viral promoters function constitutively in eukaryotic cells. These include: the early and late promoters of SV40; the long<!-- EPO <DP n="52"> --> terminal repeats (LTRs) of Moloney Leukemia Virus and other retroviruses; and the thymidine kinase promoter of Herpes Simplex Virus, among many others.</p><p id="p0170" num="0170">Nucleic acid sequences that are under the control of regulatable promoters are expressed only or to a greater or lesser degree in the presence of an inducing or repressing agent, (e.g., transcription under control of the metallothionein promoter is greatly increased in presence of certain metal ions). Regulatable promoters include responsive elements (REs) that stimulate transcription when their inducing factors are bound. For example, there are REs for serum factors, steroid hormones, retinoic acid, cyclic AMP, and tetracycline and doxycycline. Promoters containing a particular RE can be chosen in order to obtain an regulatable response and in some cases, the RE itself may be attached to a different promoter, thereby conferring regulatability to the encoded nucleic acid sequence. Thus, by selecting the appropriate promoter (constitutive versus regulatable; strong versus weak), it is possible to control both the existence and level of expression of a nucleic acid sequence in the genetically modified cell. If the nucleic acid sequence is under the control of an regulatable promoter, delivery of the therapeutic agent <i>in situ</i> is triggered by exposing the genetically modified cell <i>in situ</i> to conditions for permitting transcription of the nucleic acid sequence, e.g., by intraperitoneal injection of specific inducers of the regulatable promoters which control transcription of the agent. For example<i>, in situ</i> expression of a nucleic acid sequence under the control of the metallothionein promoter in genetically modified cells is enhanced by contacting the genetically modified cells with a solution containing the appropriate (<i>i.e.,</i> inducing) metal <i>ions in situ.</i></p><p id="p0171" num="0171">Accordingly, the amount of RNAi molecules generated <i>in situ</i> is regulated by controlling such factors as the nature of the promoter used to direct transcription of the nucleic acid sequence, <i>(i.e.,</i> whether the promoter is constitutive or regulatable, strong or weak) and the number of copies of the exogenous nucleic acid sequence encoding a RNAi molecule sequence that are in the cell.</p><p id="p0172" num="0172">In addition to at least one promoter and at least one heterologous nucleic acid sequence encoding the RNAi molecule, the expression vector may include a<!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --> selection gene, for example, a neomycin resistance gene, for facilitating selection of cells that have been transfected or transduced with the expression vector.</p><p id="p0173" num="0173">Cells can also be transfected with two or more expression vectors, at least one vector containing the nucleic acid sequence(s) encoding the RNAi molecule(s), the other vector containing a selection gene.

Currently, efficient delivery of compounds into cells <i>in vivo</i> can be achieved only when the molecules are small (usually less than 600 Daltons). Gene transfer for the correction of inborn errors of metabolism and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), and for the treatment of cancer has been accomplished with recombinant adenoviral vectors.</p><p id="p0178" num="0178">The selection and optimization of a particular expression vector for expressing a specific RNAi molecules in a cell can be accomplished by obtaining the nucleic acid sequence of the RNAi molecule, possibly with one or more appropriate control regions (<i>e.g</i>., promoter, insertion sequence); preparing<!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --> a vector construct comprising the vector into which is inserted the nucleic acid sequence encoding the RNAi molecule; transecting or transducing cultured cells <i>in vitro</i> with the vector construct; and determining whether the RNAi molecule is present in the cultured cells.</p><p id="p0179" num="0179">Vectors for cell gene therapy include viruses, such as replication-deficient viruses (described in detail below). Exemplary viral vectors are derived from Harvey Sarcoma virus, ROUS Sarcoma virus, (MPSV), Moloney murine leukemia virus and DNA viruses (e.g., adenovirus).</p><p id="p0180" num="0180">Replication-deficient retroviruses are capable of directing synthesis of all virion proteins, but are incapable of making infectious particles. Accordingly, these genetically altered retroviral expression vectors have general utility for high-efficiency transduction of nucleic acid sequences in cultured cells, and specific utility for use in the method described herein. Such retroviruses further have utility for the efficient transduction of nucleic acid sequences into cells <i>in vivo.</i> Retroviruses have been used extensively for transferring nucleic acid material into cells. Standard protocols for producing replication-deficient retroviruses (including the steps of incorporation of exogenous nucleic acid material into a plasmid, transfection of a packaging cell line with plasmid, production of recombinant retroviruses by the packaging cell line collection of viral particles from tissue culture media, and infection of the target cells with the viral particles) are well known in the ark.</p><p id="p0181" num="0181">An advantage of using retroviruses for gene therapy is that the viruses insert the nucleic acid sequence encoding the RNAi molecule into the host cell genome, thereby permitting the nucleic acid sequence encoding the RNAi molecule to be passed on to the progeny of the cell when it divides. Promoter sequences in the LTR region have been reported to enhance expression of an inserted coding sequence in a variety of cell types. Some disadvantages of using a retrovirus expression vector are (1) insertional mutagenesis, <i>i.e.,</i> the insertion of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the RNAi molecule into an undesirable position in the target cell genome which, for example, leads to unregulated cell growth and (2) the need for target cell proliferation in order for the nucleic acid<!-- EPO <DP n="55"> --> sequence encoding the RNAi molecule carried by the vector to be integrated into the target genome.</p><p id="p0182" num="0182">Another viral candidate useful as an expression vector for transformation of cells is the adenovirus, a double-stranded DNA virus. The adenovirus is infective in a wide range of cell types, including, for example, muscle and endothelial cells. The adenovirus also has been used as an expression vector in muscle cells <i>in vivo.</i></p><p id="p0183" num="0183">Adenoviruses (Ad) are double-stranded linear DNA viruses with a 36 kb genome. Several features of adenovirus have made them useful as transgene delivery vehicles for therapeutic applications, such as facilitating <i>in vivo</i> gene delivery. Recombinant adenovirus vectors have been shown to be capable of efficient <i>in situ</i> gene transfer to parenchymal cells of various organs, including the lung, brain, pancreas, gallbladder, and liver. This has allowed the use of these vectors in methods for treating inherited genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, where vectors may be delivered to a target organ. In addition, the ability of the adenovirus vector to accomplish <i>in situ</i> tumor transduction has allowed the development of a variety of anticancer gene therapy methods for non-disseminated disease. In these methods, vector containment favors tumor cell-specific transduction:</p><p id="p0184" num="0184">Like the retrovirus, the adenovirus genome is adaptable for use as an expression vector for gene therapy, <i>i.e</i>., by removing the genetic information that controls production of the virus itself. Because the adenovirus functions in an extrachromosomal fashion, the recombinant adenovirus does not have the theoretical problem of insertional mutagenesis.</p><p id="p0185" num="0185">Several approaches traditionally have been used to generate the recombinant adenoviruses. One approach involves direct ligation of restriction endonuclease fragments containing a nucleic acid sequence of interest to portions of the adenoviral genome. Alternatively, the nucleic acid sequence of interest may be inserted into a defective adenovirus by homologous recombination results. The desired recombinants are identified by screening individual plaques generated in a lawn of complementation cells.<!-- EPO <DP n="56"> --></p><p id="p0186" num="0186">Most adenovirus vectors are based on the adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) backbone in which an expression cassette containing the nucleic acid sequence of interest has been introduced in place of the early region 1 (E1) or early region 3 (E3). Viruses in which E1 has been deleted are defective for replication and are propagated in human complementation cells (<i>e.g.,</i> 293 or 911 cells), which supply the missing gene E1 and pIX in <i>trans.</i></p><p id="p0187" num="0187">In one embodiment one will desire to generate siRNA in a brain cell or brain tissue. A suitable vector for this application is an FIV vector or an AAV vector. For example, one may use AAV5. Also, one may apply poliovirus or HSV vectors.</p><p id="p0188" num="0188">Adeno associated virus (AAV) is a small nonpathogenic virus of the parvoviridae family. AAV is distinct from the other members of this family by its dependence upon a helper virus for replication. In the absence of a helper virus, AAV may integrate in a locus specific manner into the q arm of chromosome 19. The approximately 5 kb genome of AAV consists of one segment of single stranded DNA of either plus or minus polarity. The ends of the genome are short inverted terminal repeats which can fold into hairpin structures and serve as the origin of viral DNA replication. Physically, the parvovirus virion is non-enveloped and its icosohedral capsid is approximately 20 nm in diameter.</p><p id="p0189" num="0189">To-date seven serologically distinct AAVs have been identified and five have been isolated from humans or primates and are referred to as AAV types 1-5. The most extensively studied of these isolates is AAV type 2 (AAV2). The genome of AAV2 is 4680 nucleotides in length and contains two open reading frames (ORFs). The left ORF encodes the non-structural Rep proteins, Rep40, Rep 52, Rep68 and Rep 78, which are involved in regulation of replication and transcription in addition to the production of single-stranded progeny genomes. Furthermore, two of the Rep proteins have been associated with the possible integration of AAV genomes into a region of the q arm of human chromosome 19. Rep68/78 have also been shown to possess NTP binding activity as well as DNA and RNA helicase activities. The Rep proteins possess a nuclear<!-- EPO <DP n="57"> --> localization signal as well as several potential phosphorylation sites. Mutation of one of these kinase sites resulted in a loss of replication activity.</p><p id="p0190" num="0190">The ends of the genome are short inverted terminal repeats which have the potential to fold into T-shaped hairpin structures that serve as the origin of viral DNA replication. Within the ITR region two elements have been described which are central to the function of the ITR, a GAGC repeat motif and the terminal resolution site (trs). The repeat motif has been shown to bind Rep when the ITR is in either a linear or hairpin conformation. This binding serves to position Rep68/78 for cleavage at the trs which occurs in a site- and strandspecific manner. In addition to their role in replication, these two elements appear to be central to viral integration. Contained within the chromosome 19 integration locus is a Rep binding site with an adjacent trs. These elements have been shown to be functional and necessary for locus specific integration.</p><p id="p0191" num="0191">The AAV2 virion is a non-enveloped, icosohedral particle approximately 25 nm in diameter, consisting of three related proteins referred to as VPI,2 and 3. The right ORF encodes the capsid proteins, VP1, VP2, and VP3. These proteins are found in a ratio of 1:1:10 respectively and are all derived from the right-hand ORF. The capsid proteins differ from each other by the use of alternative splicing and an unusual start codon. Deletion analysis has shown that removal or alteration of VP1 which is translated from an alternatively spliced message results in a reduced yield of infections particles. Mutations within the VP3 coding region result in the failure to produce any single-stranded progeny DNA or infectious particles.</p><p id="p0192" num="0192">The following features of AAV have made it an attractive vector for gene transfer. AAV vectors have been shown <i>in vitro</i> to stably integrate into the cellular genome; possess a broad host range; transduce both dividing and non dividing cells <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and maintain high levels of expression of the transduced genes. Viral particles are heat stable, resistant to solvents, detergents, changes in pH, temperature, and can be concentrated on CsCl gradients. Integration of AAV provirus is not associated with any long term negative effects on cell growth or differentiation. The ITRs have been shown to be the<!-- EPO <DP n="58"> --> only cis elements required for replication, packaging and integration and may contain some promoter activities.</p><p id="p0193" num="0193">Further described herein are chimeric viruses where AAV can be combined with herpes virus, herpes virus amplicons, baculovirus or other viruses to achieve a desired tropism associated with another virus. For example, the AAV4 ITRs could be inserted in the herpes virus and cells could be infected. Post-infection, the ITRs of AAV4 could be acted on by AAV4 rep provided in the system or in a separate vehicle to rescue AAV4 from the genome. Therefore, the cellular tropism of the herpes simplex virus can be combined with AAV4 rep mediated targeted integration. Other viruses that could be utilized to construct chimeric viruses include lentivirus, retrovirus, pseudotyped retroviral vectors, and adenoviral vectors.</p><p id="p0194" num="0194">Also described herein are variant AAV vectors. For example, the sequence of a native AAV, such as AAV5, can be modified at individual nucleotides. Also described are native and mutant AAV vectors The present invention further includes all AAV serotypes.</p><p id="p0195" num="0195">Thus, as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, a variety of suitable viral expression vectors are available for transferring exogenous nucleic acid material into cells.

Several commercial products are available for cationic liposome complexation including Lipofectin™ (Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.) and Transfectam™ (Promega, Madison, Wis.). However, the efficiency of transfection by these methods is highly dependent on the nature of the target cell and accordingly, the<!-- EPO <DP n="59"> --> conditions for optimal transfection of nucleic acids into cells using the above-mentioned procedures must be optimized. Such optimization is within the scope of one of ordinary skill in the art without the need for undue experimentation.</p><heading id="h0010"><b>VII. <u>Diseases and Conditions Amendable to the Methods Described Herein</u></b></heading><p id="p0197" num="0197">In the certain embodiments described herein a mammalian recipient to an expression cassette of the invention has a condition that is amenable to gene silencing therapy. As used herein, "gene silencing therapy" refers to administration to the recipient exogenous nucleic acid material encoding a therapeutic siRNA and subsequent expression of the administered nucleic acid material <i>in situ.</i> Thus, the phrase "condition amenable to RNAi molecule therapy" embraces conditions such as genetic diseases (<i>i.e.,</i> a disease condition that is attributable to one or more gene defects), acquired pathologies <i>(i.e.,</i> a pathological condition that is not attributable to an inborn defect), cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, e.g., trinucleotide repeat disorders, and prophylactic processes <i>(i.e.,</i> prevention of a disease or of an undesired medical condition). A gene "associated with a condition" is a gene that is either the cause, or is part of the cause, of the condition to be treated. Examples of such genes include genes associated with a neurodegenerative disease (<i>e.g.,</i> a trinucleotide-repeat disease such as a disease associated with polyglutamine repeats, Huntington's disease, and several spinocerebellar ataxias), and genes encoding ligands for chemokines involved in the migration of a cancer cells, or chemokine receptor.

An example of a targetable polymorphism that is not itself a mutation is the C/G single nucleotide polymorphism (G987C) in the MJD1 gene immediately downstream of the mutation that causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and the polymorphism in exon 58 associated with Huntington's disease.</p><p id="p0200" num="0200">Single nucleotide polymorphisms comprise most of the genetic diversity between humans, and that many disease genes, including the HD gene in Huntington's disease, contain numerous single nucleotide or multiple nucleotide polymorphisms that could be separately targeted in one allele vs. the other.
