mxw-id="PDES63961378" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><u>BACKGROUND</u></heading><heading id="h0002">1. <i>Technical Field</i></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present application relates to surgical clip appliers, and in particular relates to instruments having a plurality of clips for applying the clips to body tissues and vessels during surgical procedures.</p><heading id="h0003">2. <i>Discussion of Related Art</i></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Surgical clip appliers are known in the art and have increased in popularity among surgeons by offering an alternative to conventional suturing of body tissues and vessels. Typical instruments are disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5030226A"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 5,030,226 to Green et al.</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5431668A"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 5,431,668 to Burbank, III </text></patcit>et al. These instruments generally provide a plurality of clips which are stored in the instrument and which are fed sequentially to the jaw mechanism at the distal end of the instrument upon opening and closing of the handles at the proximal end of the instrument. As the handles are closed, the jaws close to deform a clip positioned between the jaw members, and as the jaws are opened to release the deformed clip, a new clip is fed from the series to a position<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> between the jaws. This process is repeated until all the clips in the series of clips have been used.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Surgical clip appliers in the prior art are known to include some type of lockout mechanism which prevents closing of the handles, and consequentially closing of the jaws if there are no clips present in the instrument. These lockout mechanisms prevent closure of the jaws about tissue, which can traumatize the tissue and perhaps cause serious damage to the tissue or vessel when a clip is not present in the jaws. However, many of the prior art instruments provide a lockout mechanism which interferes with the closure of the jaws, and upon the application of enough force to the handles, the lockout mechanism many times may be defeated. In order to prevent this, complex mechanisms are often provided, resulting in increased cost of manufacture of the instrument.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In addition, many of the prior art instruments provide complex mechanical arrangements for closing the jaws while simultaneously preparing for feeding the next clip into the jaws after the clip positioned between the jaws is deformed and then released. These complex mechanisms, such as that shown in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5431668A"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 5,431,668 to Burbank, III et al.</text></patcit>, require numerous parts which increases the cost of manufacture, as well as increasing the time it takes to assemble each instrument. In addition, these instruments generally drive a first component, such as the channel assembly, in one direction to close the jaws while simultaneously drawing the clip pusher bar in an opposite direction to prepare for feeding the next clip in the series of clips to the jaw mechanism. This arrangement typically requires additional moving parts, also tending to increase the cost of manufacture and increase the time of assembly.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP1712190A"><text>EP1712190</text></patcit> discloses a surgical clip applier with an elongate shaft with jaws formed at a distal end thereof. A trigger is used to advance a clip between the jaws where it is then formed.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US5049152A"><text>US 5049152</text></patcit> discloses a surgical clip applier with jaws for the formation of clips which are prevented from being closed once the last clip has been formed by a lockout mechanism.

A wedge plate arrangement is used to advance clips<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The need therefore exists for an instrument for applying surgical clips which reduces the number of parts, and consequently reduces the cost of the instrument, while at the same time reducing the amount of time needed to assemble the instrument during manufacture. A specific need exists for an instrument which minimizes the number of moving parts and synchronizes the moving parts so that they move in the same direction upon closing and opening of the handles. By minimizing the number of moving parts, and synchronizing the direction of movement of the moving parts, the instrument becomes sturdier and easier to manipulate during the surgical procedure.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The need also exists for an instrument having a lockout mechanism which both prevents closing of the jaws by providing a reliable blocking mechanism, while at the same time providing a mechanism for rendering the instrument inoperable upon the application of a predetermined force to the handles after all the clips in the instrument have been utilized during the surgical procedure.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY</u></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present disclosure relates generally to surgical clip appliers. According to the invention a surgical clip applier is provided including a housing; a pair of handles pivotably connected to opposite sides of the housing; a channel assembly fixed to and extending from the housing; a clip carrier disposed within said channel assembly and defining a channel and a plurality of windows; a wedge plate slidably disposed within said channel assembly, said wedge plate being operatively connected to said handles and including a plurality of apertures formed along a length thereof; a plurality of clips slidably disposed within said channel of said clip carrier; and a clip follower slidably disposed within said channel of said clip<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> carrier at a location proximal of said plurality of clips. The clip follower is configured and adapted for selective engagement with said windows of said clip carrier and said apertures of said wedge plate. The clip follower is configured and adapted to distally urge said plurality of clips relative to said clip carrier upon a distal advancement of said wedge plate.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The clip applier includes a jaw assembly including a pair of jaws extending from an end of said channel assembly, opposite said housing. The jaw assembly may be adapted to accommodate a clip therein and may be operable to effect closure of a clip in response to movement of said handles.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The clip applier includes a clip pusher bar slidably positioned within at least one of said housing and said channel assembly, said pusher bar having a first end operatively connected to at least one of said handles and a second end defining a pusher terminating proximate said pair of jaws. The pusher bar may be moved towards said jaws as said handles are approximated in a first direction an initial amount to move said distal-most clip between said jaws. The pusher bar may be configured and adapted to move towards said housing as said handles are approximated an additional amount in said first direction to move said pusher behind a distal-most clip in said plurality of clips.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The clip applier further includes a drive channel slidably disposed within at least one of said housing and said channel assembly. The drive channel may have a first end operatively connected to at least one of said handles and a second end configured and dimensioned to selectively engage said pair of jaws to effectuate closure of said pair of jaws. The drive channel may be moved towards said jaw assembly as said handles are moved in said first direction to move said distal end thereof against said jaws to close said jaws. The drive<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> channel may be moved away from said jaws as said handles are moved in a second direction to move said distal end thereof away from said jaws to allow said jaws to open.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The clip applier may further include a pivot arm operatively connected to said wedge plate and selectively engageable by said drive channel. In use, rotation of said pivot arm, during distal movement of said drive channel, results in proximal movement of said wedge plate.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The clip applier includes a pusher bar cam pivotably supported on the drive channel and movable therewith. The pusher bar cam may extend through a slot formed in said wedge plate and into a window formed in said pusher bar. In use, as said drive channel is moved distally said pusher bar cam moves said pusher bar distally. Additionally, during distal movement of said drive channel, said pusher bar cam may be rotated relative thereto such that said pusher bar cam disengages from said window of said pusher bar allowing said pusher bar to move proximally.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The wedge plate may be biased to a distal position. The pusher bar and/or the drive channel may be biased to a proximal position.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The clip applier may further include a ratchet mechanism. The ratchet mechanism may include a rack, having a plurality of ratchet teeth, associated with said drive channel; and a pawl, having at least one tooth, disposed at a location to selectively engage said rack. The pawl may be biased into engagement with said rack. In use, as said drive channel is longitudinally reciprocated, said plurality of teeth may pass over said pawl. The pawl may prevent inadvertent return of said drive channel before full actuation of said handles.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The clip applier may further include a lockout disposed in a distal end of said channel assembly. In use, the lockout may be actuated by said clip follower when a last clip is expelled from said clip applier. The lockout may be urged by said clip follower to extend across a path of said drive channel, thereby preventing said drive channel from moving distally.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The clip applier may further include a drive pin operatively received in a pivot point formed in said drive channel to transmit axial forces to said drive channel during movement of said handles. The pivot point may be separated from an elongate slot by at least one lip.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The clip applier may further include a shipping wedge selectively attachable to said housing and being configured and adapted to engage each of said handles.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The clip applier may further include a counter mechanism supported in at least one of said housing and said channel assembly. The counter mechanism may be configured and adapted to display a change in said clip applier upon each actuation of said handles.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The drive channel may be configured and dimensioned to at least partially surround said jaws and said wedge plate. The drive channel may include a strap extending across a distal end thereof for maintaining said jaws and said wedge plate within said drive channel.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><heading id="h0005"><b><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></b></heading><p id="p0025" num="0025">The present clip applier will be more fully appreciated as the same becomes better understood from the following detailed description when considered in connection with the following drawings, in which:
