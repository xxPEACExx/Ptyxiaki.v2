Window coverings are typically mounted adjacent a window and are used to cover the window and provide a desired aesthetic effect to the interior and exterior of a home, office or other building The window covering material is often moveable from a retracted position adjacent the headrail to various extended positions that lower the bottom rail and permit the window covering material to cover a window.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Various different lift systems are used to permit a user to adjust the position of the window covering material For example, <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US6991020B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,991,020 to Cheng et al</text></patcit>. discloses a window covering according to the preamble of claim 11 that utilizes a cord lock and an operator cord that extends through the cord lock and is attached to lift cords The operator cord extends out of the cord lock and may be manipulated by a user to adjust the position of the window covering.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="US6991020B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6, 991, 020</text></patcit> also discloses a window covering according to the preamble of claim 1.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="US6837294B"><text>U S.

Patent No 6,991,020</text></patcit> and also discloses a cordless shade that utilizes a spring motor that includes two spring motor cord spools. A spring motor cord is entrained about these spools and is attached to lift cords A user adjusts the position of the window covering material by providing a downward<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> force to the bottom rail of the window covering to extend the window covering material or an upward force to the bottom rail to permit the spring motor to retract the lift cords and the window covering material</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Cheng et al teach that the attachment of the spring motor cord or operator cord to the lift cords should not pass over any pulley to avoid entanglement of the cords that may cause "hang up" problems that may make moving the window covering material problematic for a user. (<i>See e</i>.<i>g</i> <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="US6991020B"><text>U S Patent No 6,991,020</text></patcit>, Col 3, lines 46-55). Such binding may result in a user having to exert a substantial force to extend the window covering material. Sometimes, such forces can cause the attachment between the cords to break or cause other damage to the window covering. These "hang up" problems can also result in a non-level window covering due to the entanglement of the cords, which often produces an undesirable aesthetic effect</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Further, the need for the attachment of the cords in the lift systems disclosed by Cheng et al to not pass over a pulley limits the extent to which the window covering material may be extended below the headrail to, at most, the length of the headrail If the full length of the handrail is filled with cords, spools and spring motor to provide a maximum length of the window covering, the window covering cannot be used in stock window covering programs or cut down programs In these programs, window coverings are made in a limited number of stock sizes, which may then be cut down by a retailer to fit a specific window opening dimension provided by a customer. Cut down programs typically offer blinds or shades for lower prices relative to custom made window coverings because a retailer is able to take advantage of economies of scale involved in the production of the limited number of available stock sized window coverings. Window coverings that can only provide a length of extended window covering material that is relatively equivalent to the length of a headrail typically cannot provide<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the window covering material length necessary for use in one or more stock blinds of window covering cut down programs</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0014" dnum="US20040129390A"><text>U.S. Patent Application No 2004/0129390 to Toti </text></patcit>discloses a window covering that includes lift cords connected to a spring motor by various interlocking gears or other transmission systems Such interlocking gears or transmission systems can be expensive to manufacture Moreover, such lift systems often require precise fabrication due to the need for the various interlocking components to reliably interact with each other. Often, only very large window coverings, which are typically much heavier and costlier than other window coverings, may economically include such systems and still be produced efficiently enough to meet the price expectations of a customer.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A window covering is needed that Includes a connection between one or more lift cords and one or more operator cords or spring motor cords that reduces, if not completely eliminates, cord entanglement problems or "hang up" problems so that the connection of the cords may reliably pass over one or more pulleys in a window covering lift system. Preferably, such a connection does not require interlocking gears or other expensive or complicated mechanisms to provide a cost effective solution to such cord entanglement or "hang up" problems.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">1 provide a window covering that includes a first rail, window coveting material adjacent the first rail, one or more lift cords, multiple pulleys positioned adjacent the first rail, at least one spring motor adjacent the first rail, one or more spring motor cords extending from the one or more spring motors and a rigid connector attached to the one or more spring motor cords and the one or more lift cords. The window covering material is moveable from a retracted position to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> an extended position The one or more spring motor cords are configured to extend away from the one or more spring motors and travel along a path defined by at least one of the pulleys when the window covering material is raised or lowered The rigid connector is attached to the one or more spring motor cords and the one or more lift cords The connector is sized and configured to permit the one or more spring motor cords, connector and a portion of the one or more lift cords to pass along at least one of the pulleys during movement along the path The connector has a length that is not greater than 1/6, and preferably is not greater than 1/12, of the circumference of at least one of the pulleys the connector passes over when the window covering material is extended from the retracted position to the extended position.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Other embodiments of my window covering may replace the spring motor and spring motor cord with a cord lock and one or more operator cords. The one or more operator cords include a first portion that extends through the cord lock and is attached to the connector. A user may raise or lower the blind by manipulating the operator cord The first portion of the one or more operator cords move along the same path as the one or more spring motor cords would travel when the window covering is raised or lowered.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Embodiments of my window covering may include connectors of various shapes For example, the connector may have a generally C-shaped body, a generally S-shaped body, a ring that has a generally oval shaped body or a ring that has a generally circular body. Prefarably, the connector is composed of metal, such as steel, copper or aluminum, or a rigid plastic such as high density polyethylene (HDPE) or polypropylene.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Some embodiments of my window covering may include typical shades or blinds such that the first rail is a headrail Other embodiments of my window covering may include top down bottom up shades where the first rail is an intermediate rail that is moveable relative to a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> headrail. Yet other embodiments may include a second rail connected to at least one of the first rail and the window covering material such that the first rail is located below the second rail and is moveable relative to the second rail.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Preferably, the one or more lift cords are looped about the connector to attach the one or more lift cords to the connector. The one or more spring motor cords or operator cords may also be looped about the connector to attach the one or more spring motor cords or operator cords to the connector</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Various different pulley arrangements may be used in embodiments of my window covering. One embodiment may include pulleys that include first, second, and third pulleys aligned with each other adjacent the first end of the first rail and fourth, fifth and sixth pulleys aligned with each other adjacent the second end of the first rail, which is opposite the first end of the first rail Preferably, the first, second and third pulleys are connected to a first pulley mount and the fourth, fifth and sixth pulleys are connected to a second pulley mount.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The path of the connector and one or more spring motor cords or operator cords can be defined by movement of the connector and one or more spring motors or operator cords from adjacent the one or more spring motors to the first pulley, from the first pulley to the fourth pulley, form the fourth pulley, to the second pulley and from the second pulley to the fifth or sixth pulley when the window covering material is extended from the retracted position to the extended position. Preferably, movement of the connector and one or more spring motor cords or operator cords is reversed at least once when traveling along the path when the window covering material is moved from the retracted position to the extended position For example, the connector and one or more spring motor cords may move along the path such that movement of the one or more spring motor cords and connector is reversed from movement toward the first<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> end of the first rail to movement toward the second opposite end of the first rail at least once while moving along the path when the window covering material is retracted from the extended position to the retracted position or extended from the retracted potion to the extended position</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">It should be appreciated that the path may include more than one reversal of movement For instance, the movement of the one or more spring motor cords or operator cords and connector may also be reversed from movement toward the second and of the first rail to movement toward the first end of the first rail at least once while moving along the path when the window covering material is retracted from the extended position to the retracted position or extended from the retracted potion to the extended position. It should be understood that such reversals of movement can permit the window covering material to be extended a distance that is much longer than the length of the headrail so that short headrails may be used for window coverings that must cover tall and narrow windows.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Other details, objects, and advantages of the invention will become apparent as the following description of certain present preferred embodiments thereof and certain present preferred methods of practicing the same proceeds.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></b></heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">Present preferred embodiments of the invention are shown in the accompanying drawings and certain present preferred methods of practicing the same are also illustrated therein, in which:

As may be appreciated from <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>, an intermediate extended position of the window covering material can correspond with an extension of the spring motor cord 11 away from the spring motor 15 such that the spring motor cord 11 and connector 13 pass over and along the second pulley 25 and then move back toward the first pulley 23 to a position between the first pulley 23 and the second pulley 25 At this position, the window covering material may be only partially extended so that the window covering may only block or cover a portion of a window it is positioned adjacent to.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">When a user extends the window coveting material 7 from the partially extended position shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref> to a fully extended position, the window covering material may be extended to fully cover a window it is positioned adjacent to. In this position, which is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref>, the spring motor cord 11, connector 13 and lift cord 9 move along the path defined by the pulleys so that the spring motor cord 11 and connector 13 pass along the first pulley 23, move toward the fourth pulley 29, pass along the fourth pulley 29 and move toward the third pulley 27 to a position located between the third and fourth pulleys 27 and 29</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">I have found that the length of the connector 13 is important to ensure that the extending and retracting of the window covering material does not cause various undesirable problems. A connector that is too long will often bind up when passing along a pulley so that a user trying to extend the window covering material must exert substantial force to the bottom rail 5 or window covering material 7 to extend the window covering material Such force can cause damage to the window covering material, one or more of the pulleys, or the connector Further, such binding<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> can cause the window covering material 7 to be extended or retracted in an unbalanced manner such that there is a noticeable tilt of the bottom rail or window covering material during the extension or retraction of the window covering 1</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">As may be appreciated from <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref>,<figref idrefs="f0001">1</figref> have found that such binding problems can be avoided with the use of a connector 53 that is attached to a spring motor cord 51 and lift cord 59 and has a length 1 that is not greater than 1/6, and preferably is not greater than 1/12 of the circumference of the one or more pulleys 41 the connector 53 is configured to pass over when the window covering material is moved from the retracted position to an extended position It should be understood that the surface 43 of the pulley 41 that is configured to engage the connector when the connector passes along the pulley 41, defines the circumference of the pulley 41.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In contrast, connectors 65 that are longer than 1/6 of the circumference range generally causes the binding problems discussed above. As may be appreciated from <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 7</figref>, such a connector 65, which is attached to a spring motor cord 61 and a lift cord 68, may engage the headrail 69 when it passes over the surface 63 of a pulley 62 Such contact may cause binding or otherwise increase the friction of the lift system so that a user must greatly increase the force applied to the bottom rail or window covering material to extend the window covering material In some cases, the connector may be damaged when additional force is applied to the window covering material to overcome the binding problem</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">A connector that has an undesirable length can also alter the balance of the window covering material or bottom rail as it is extended due to the forces being applied to the connector and the length of the connector and, consequently, create an undesirable aesthetic effect for the window covering For instance, the window covering material or bottom rail may be lowered in<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> an undesired non-level configuration. It is also possible that such a non-level configuration may correspond with a desired position of the window covering so that the window covering has an undesirable unbalanced appearance when lowered to that position by a user.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 8</figref>, a second present preferred embodiment of my window coveting 71 includes a headrail 73, bottom rail 75 and window covering material 77 between the headrail 73 and bottom rail 75.
