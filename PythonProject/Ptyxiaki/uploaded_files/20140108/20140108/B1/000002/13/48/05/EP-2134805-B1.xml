Tremendous costs may be incurred from separating and disposing of large amounts of produced water and/or gas, inhibiting the corrosion of tubulars, replacing tubular equipment downhole, and surface equipment maintenance. Shutting off unwanted water and/or gas production are necessary conditions to maintaining a productive field. While there is a wide array of treatments available to solve these problems, they all suffer from a number of difficulties, including, but not necessarily limited to, surface m≽ixing and handling problems, etc.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For instance, traditional water and gas shut-off technology with chemicals uses sodium silicate solutions and crosslinked polymers. The silicate solution is typically not compatible with formation waters, since sodium silicate reacts with calcium chloride instantly to generate gel. In this approach, the two solutions may be injected in any order and must be separated by a slug of an inert aqueous spacer liquid. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4004639A"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 4,004,639</text></patcit> provides chemicals to achieve water shut-off in producing wells. It uses base fluid sodium silicate solution and gelling agent ammonium sulfate. Those two solutions are injected and separated by a slug of an inert aqueous spacer liquid. However, these technologies cannot generate uniform gels to plug the porous medium and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> cannot place the gel deep into the formation. Several staged treatments are also required in pumping the fluids using these techniques.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Crosslinked polymer technology may need separate crosslinkers from the linear polymer fluid separated by a slug of an inert spacer in a form of multi-stage pumping. Crosslinked polymer technology may also use a delayed crosslinking method which may depend on the formation temperature and fluid traveling time in the formation as factors to delay the crosslinking.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">There remains a need to find a chemical system that will simplify the pumping schedule and permit deep penetration into the formation to shut off the water and/or gas channels in an effective manner and keep oil flow channels open.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">There is provided, in one form, a method for inhibiting the flow of water and/or gas in a subterranean formation that involves injecting into the subterranean formation an aqueous viscoelastic treating fluid.

The fluid system comprises brine, a VES, a viscosity enhancer, and optionally for high temperatures a viscosity stabilizer, which fluid system is added just prior to pumping to form a single stage treatment. The stabilizer may be crystal particles which are alkali earth metal oxides, alkali earth metal hydroxides, alkali metal oxides, alkali metal hydroxides, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZnO, and mixtures thereof, such as MgO, TiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and the like, having a size ranging from about 1 nanometer to about 5 microns. The viscosity enhancer may be pyroelectric particles, piezoelectric particles, and mixtures thereof, in one non-limiting embodiment having a size ranging from about 1 nanometer to about 5 microns. In some cases there are viscosity enhancers that may perform both as high temperature stabilizers: that is, act toward enhancing VES viscosity at lower temperature (such as at 150°F (66°C)), but may act toward viscosity<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> stability (<i>i.e</i>. thermal stability of the VES micelles) at higher temperatures (such as at 250°F (121°C). An example is ZnO which may function both as a viscosity enhancer at low temperature (please see <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG.1</figref>) and as stabilizer at relatively high temperature (please see <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG.4</figref>).</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In one non-limiting embodiment, for environments under about 180°F (82°C) a high temperature viscosity stabilizer is not required. The term "stabilizer" herein is a component that helps or enables the VES fluid viscosity remain stable at fluid temperatures at or greater than about 180°F (82°C).</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The inventive fluid system may be pumped into the target zone at a pressure less than formation fracture pressure, and after pumping is stopped, the aqueous viscoelastic treating fluid will generate very high viscosities at static and low shear rate conditions in the porous media of underground formation. Since the viscous plug occurs <i>in situ,</i> better control on the placement of the treatment is achieved and deeper penetration of the shut-off fluid is accomplished with all of the effective permeability of the target zone receiving an effective flow control or plugging agent. The flow of the VES fluid back will stop, prevent, retard or inhibit unwanted or undesirable water and/or gas production. For high permeability or naturally fractured active zones, the aqueous viscoelastic treating fluid herein will selectively plug unwanted water and/or gas flow channels, and will let oil flow channels form and let the oil be produced, since oil contacting the VES fluid will break or reduce the viscosity thereof. For regular and low permeability zones, it takes longer time to form oil flow channels because the contact area between oil and VES fluid in the porous media is smaller than in high permeability zones.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A series of laboratory tests have shown that the system can successfully shut off the water and gas production zones in various reservoir conditions from about 70°F to about 300°F (about 21°C to about 150°C). It is expected that the method and compositions herein may be effectively used in a broader temperature range between about 50°F to about 350°F (about 10°C to about 177°C). The system has very low viscosity at high shear rates, which means it is easy to pump, and has very high viscosity at low shear rates, which means that after pumping is stopped, the fluid plug at the zone prevents, inhibits,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> retards or stops unwanted water and gas flow to the wellbore. Without wishing to be limited to any particular parameter range, it is expected that in one embodiment of the invention, the gel strength of the gels formed will range from about 500 to about 35,000 cP, preferably from about 1000 to about 20,000 cP. The single stage treatment may be pumped into targeted formations to provide lost circulation control on water based fluids.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">It will be appreciated that although the methods and compositions herein have been spoken of as being able to completely shut off water and/or gas flow in subterranean formations, that the inventive methods and compositions are considered successful even if less than complete shut-off is accomplished. Inhibition, reduction, diminishing, decreasing, and lessening of the water and/or gas flow through the use of viscous plugs herein are all considered successful, as are the complete shut-off, prevention, cessation, stoppage, end and termination of water flow, that is, complete control of the water and/or gas flow.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Magnesium oxide particles and powders have been used as stabilizers for VES-gelled aqueous fluids at temperatures from about 180 to about 300°F (about 82 to about 149°C) as disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US125465A"><text>U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/125,465</text></patcit>. It will be appreciated that although MgO particles are noted throughout the application herein as one representative or preferred type of stabilizer, other alkaline earth metal oxides and/or alkaline earth metal hydroxides may be used in the methods and compositions herein. Additionally, the alkali metal hydroxides and alkali metal oxides may be used alone or in combination with the alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The alkali metal hydroxide NaOH has been found to improve the thermal stability of VES fluids. The alkali metal hydroxide additives LiOH, NaOH, and KOH readily dissolve in water and will travel wherever the VES fluid flows during a treatment, and therefore will be easily removed from the reservoir with the VES fluid and may not induce particulate pore plugging type formation<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Core flow tests with VES-STA1 MgO particles high temperature VES stabilizer product developed by Baker Oil Tools showed plating out of most of the MgO particles on the test core face during VES-gelled fluid injection into the cores. This MgO product has a mean particle size of about 5 microns. These particles were too large to penetrate the 50 to 500 millidarcy (md) Berea test cores. It was discovered that by using very small MgO particles, such as nanometer-sized particles, the particles would stay within the VES that flows into the subterranean formation during a treatment. These MgO nano-particles, may be used to stabilize VES-gelled aqueous fluids in place of (or in addition to) the larger sized MgO particles for water and/or gas control treatments.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">This use of nanometer-sized particles is an improvement over the previous VES-gelled fluid stabilizing chemistry. Some nano-sized particles have a mean particle size of 30 nanometers (nm). One nano-MgO product was shown in laboratory tests to pass through the Berea test cores with no plating or accumulation of MgO particles on the core faces, which means nano particles are easy to flow into the porous media to stabilize the viscosity of the VES fluid. Viscosity stability tests show both particle types may achieve thermal stability of the VES-micelles at 250°F (121°C) over time.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The nano-sized MgO particles are also suspected of having additional chemistry useful for VES thermal stability. Without being limited to any one particular theory, it is suspected that some nano-sized MgO particles have unique particle surface charges that use charge attraction, surface adsorption and/or other chemistries to associate, relate or join the VES micelles. This technical improvement is helpful in the field when applying the MgO stabilizer technology, to assure VES-gelled fluid stability.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The stabilizing solid particulates and powders useful herein include, but are not necessarily limited to, slowly water-soluble alkaline earth metal oxides or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, or mixtures thereof. In one non-limiting embodiment, the alkaline earth metal in these additives may include, but are not necessarily limited to, magnesium, calcium, barium, strontium, combinations thereof and the like. In one non-limiting embodiment, MgO may be obtained in high purity of at least 95 wt%, where the balance may be impurities such as<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> MgOH, CaO, CaOH, SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and the like. In the case of the alkali metal oxides and alkali metal hydroxides, the alkali metal includes, but is not necessarily limited to, lithium, potassium, sodium and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The amount of stabilizer particles in the VES-gelled aqueous fluid, whether or not nano-sized, may range from about 0.5 to about 20.0 pptg (about 0.06 to about 2.4 kg/1000 liters) or even up to about 40.0 pptg (about 4.8 kg/1000 liters). Alternatively, the lower threshold of the proportion range may be about 1.0 pptg (about 0.12 kg/1000 liters), while the upper threshold of proportion of the particles may independently be about 10.0 pptg (about 1.2 kg/1000 liters) pptg.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">It has been discovered that the addition of pyroelectric crystal and/or piezoelectric crystal particles to an aqueous VES fluid demonstrate improved, enhanced or increased the viscosity of the VES fluid. The viscosity enhancers herein are believed to be particularly useful in VES-gelled fluids used for well completion or stimulation and other uses and applications where the viscosity of VES-gelled aqueous fluids may be increased, such as the water and/or gas shut off methods herein. It is especially useful that the viscosity enhancer particles may be very small to flow with VES fluid into the formation.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In one non-limiting explanation or theory, high temperatures and/or pressures heat and/or squeeze or press the crystal particles thereby causing more electrical charges on their surfaces. The particles with surface charges associate, connect or link the VES micelles, thus further increasing their network and enhancing the viscosity of the fluid system. In particular, the VES-gelled aqueous fluids have improved (increased, enhanced or raised) viscosity over a broad range of temperatures, such as from about 70 (about 21°C) to about 400°F (about 204°C); alternatively up to about 350°F (about 177°C), and in another non-limiting embodiment up to about 300°F (about 149°C). With respect to pressure, in another non-limiting embodiment, effective pressures may range from about 1000 psi (about 6.7 MPa) to about 40,000 psi (about 300 MPa). Alternatively, the lower end of the suitable pressure range may be about 100 psi (about 0.7 MPa), while the upper end may independently be about 50,000 psi (about 340 Pa). In another alternate embodiment, the lower end may be about<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 300 psi and the upper end may independently be about 40,000 psi (about 2.0 MPa to about 276 MPa).</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The discovery of the benefit of piezoelectric and/or pyroelectric crystals allows the VES system to have improved fluid viscosity to enhance the ability of the VES fluid to inhibit, prevent or shut off the flow of water and/or gas when the fluid is used as a plug or block or inhibitor to flow. Further, the introduction of these viscosity enhancers to the VES-gelled aqueous system will limit and reduce the amount of VES fluid which flows into the pores of a reservoir during a shut-off treatment. Enhancing the fluid viscosity of the VES-gelled fluids also helps reduce the amount of VES necessary to achieve a particular viscosity level.

Because of the exceptionally high viscosity at static and very low shear rates almost 1000 psi pressure differential (6.9 MPa) is required to make the VES fluid inside of the core to start flowing out.
