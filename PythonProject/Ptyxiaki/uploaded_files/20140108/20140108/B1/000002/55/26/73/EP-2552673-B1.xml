mxw-id="PDES63960539" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>Technical Field</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to a splice or joint for connecting steel cord reinforced belts or strips comprising thermoplastic polymers.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The use of steel cords to reinforce belts was probably first introduced to reinforce conveyor belts. Such belts basically consist of a set of steel cords encased in a rubber matrix. A steel cord conveyor belt runs on idlers and is tensioned between a receiving and discharge station for transporting materials. Evidently, the size of the steel cord for reinforcement of conveyor belts is relatively large - with diameters from 2 to 14 mm - as the acting forces are large. At the other end of the spectrum precision timing belts emerged reinforced with very fine steel cords, assembled out of steel filaments with a diameter of 40 µm to 150 µm but now encased in thermoplastic polymers in stead of rubber.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Recently, steel cords enjoy renewed attention for reinforcement of strips that are used in relatively static applications such as to reinforce pipes or hoses. See for example <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="FR2914040"><text>FR 2 914 040</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP1760380A"><text>EP 1 760 380</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO20020909812A"><text>WO 2002/0909812</text></patcit>. But the use of flexible strips can be even more diverse in that it can also be used as a retrofit material to repair damaged concrete structures or to protect mooring lines from cutting.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">While the word 'belt' in a technical context is mainly used in dynamic situations where movement or power is transferred, the word 'strip' seems to be more used in a static context to transfer force without movement. In what follows only the word 'strip' will be used, although it should be clear that for the purpose of this application, this may equally well refer to a 'belt'.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">There has always been a need to connect the ends of a strip to one another in order to make it endless, or there was the need to joint several single pieces of strip together to make a very long strip. Such a connection is referred to as a 'joint' or a 'splice' which are considered synonyms for<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the purpose of this application. An ideal splice should not be noticeable in the strip. The splice must therefore have:
<ol><li>(A). Equal breaking strength as the strip;</li><li>(B). Equal stiffness in stretching as well as in bending as the strip itself;</li><li>(C). Equal dimensions as the strip (no thicker sections)</li><li>(D). Show equal dynamic fatigue as the strip;</li><li>(E). Should be relatively easy to implement on site.</li></ol></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In principle an ideal splice could be made when the length of the splice is unlimited. However, this is not practical.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Hence, making practical splices is always compromising between the different requirements (A) to (E) mentioned above. One type of splice may therefore be perfectly fit in one application, but not for connecting another kind of strips in another application. The following splice methods are known:</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Splice by means of mechanical fasteners: a row of clamps are attached to the edge of the belt that is cut perpendicular to its length. A connecting rod is introduced into the inter-digitised eyelets formed. This kind of splice is used for fabric reinforced types of strips. It can not be used for strips with mainly axial reinforcement (the clamps tear out). As the splice is like a hinge, it is more flexible than the strip itself.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Overlap splice: the ends of the strips are overlapped and are vulcanized or glued to one another. This kind of splice is sometimes used to make rubber tracks endless. It has an increased bending stiffness in the splicing area because the two cord planes of both ends do not coincide and form a stiff double layer.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Interlocking splice: the ends of the strips are cut in the plane of the strip according a pattern with protrusions and recesses that fit into one another (like a dovetail connection). Afterwards the splice is vulcanized or glued or molten together. See for example <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO2009040628A"><text>WO 2009/040628</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The following splices are described in the ISO 15236-4 standard.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Finger splices are splices in which the ends of the strips are cut into a matching saw tooth pattern. The 'fingers' are afterwards vulcanized to one another. It is mainly used for fabric reinforced belts or strips, hence is less appropriate if only longitudinal oriented steel cords are present.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In an 'Interlaced stepped splice' cord ends from one strip are arranged - 'interlaced' - between cords of the other strip end and subsequently covered with rubber or polymer or glued together. 'Cord end' is to be regarded as that part of the cord that is in the splice. The place where the cord stops is called the 'butt end'. The butt ends of the cords usually finish at regular positions in the splice hence its name of 'stepped splice'. An 'interlaced stepped splice' can thus be defined as a splice wherein the number of cords in the splice area is always larger than the number of cords in the strip. Such a splice has a very good static strength (the splice can be stronger than the belt) but shows an increased stiffness in the splice area. Stepped interlaced splices can be used if the strip has less than about 50% linear packing density. With 'linear packing density' is meant the ratio of the sum of all cord diameters to the total width of the strip. In case of a larger linear packing density, either some cords will have to be cut at the splice entry from both belts in order to accommodate space for the inserted cords leading to a loss of strength or the splice area can be made broader than the strip in order to accommodate the increased number of cords.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A 'plain stepped splice' can be defined as a splice wherein the number of cords within the splice remains equal to or smaller than the number of cords in the strip. In other words: the cord butt ends of both strips abut to one another. Different lay-out patterns are possible such as an 'organ pipe splice' (having a repeating 01230123...pattern, the numbers indicating the step length of the cord ends of one strip in the splice) or a 'fir tree splice (having a repeating 01232100123210...) pattern. Such splices are difficult to discern from the strip itself in terms of bending stiffness, axial stiffness and section. However, they show a lower strength compared to 'Interlaced stepped splices'.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The inventors were primarily concerned with finding good splices of the 'interlaced or plain stepped splices' for strips reinforced with steel cords and encased in a thermoplastic polymer material. Although there is an extensive literature on how such splices are to be constructed for rubber steel cord reinforced belts, little exists for thermoplastic steel cord reinforced strips. For the former, a good overview can be found in <i>"</i><nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>Design<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> of Steel Cord Conveyor Belt Splices" by M. Hager and H. von der Wroge in "Belt Conveyor Technology, I/94" out of "The Best of Bulk Solids Handling 1986-1991" published by Trans Tech Publications</text></nplcit>.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Basically, there are two aspects to a stepped splice:</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">There is the mechanical aspect wherein the lay-out scheme of the splice plays a mayor role. Indeed, by seeking different interlacing patterns (for 'interlaced stepped splices') or abutment arrangements (in 'plain stepped splices) an improvement in splice performance can be obtained.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">On the other hand it will be clear that in the kind of splices envisaged, no direct connection is made between steel cords from the one strip to the steel cords of the other strip. Hence all force has to be transferred from the cords in the one strip to the cords of the other strip by mediation of the polymer that is in contact with the steel cords. Ergo two factors will be crucial in this transfer: the strength of the anchorage of the steel cord to the polymer and the strength of the polymer.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Although both aspects have a high interaction with one another and can not be fully separated from one another, the focus of this application is on the second, chemical aspect and more in particular how an optimal chemical bonding can be implemented in a splice.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">An inventive lay out scheme is the main subject of a co-pending application, published as <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO2011120892A"><text>WO2011120892</text></patcit>, of the same applicant filed on the same day as this application and covers the splice from the more mechanical viewpoint.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Disclosure of Invention</b></heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a splice between two strips that shows optimal splice behaviour in terms of- in decreasing order of importance - flexibility, shape, strength, dynamic behaviour and ease of implementation. It is a second objective of the invention to define the proper polymers that must be used in the splice area. It is a further object of the invention to define the optimal concentration of those polymers.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Basically the invention concerns a splice for connecting a first strip to a second strip. The strips comprise steel cords that are embedded in a matrix of strip polymer.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">With a 'steel cord' is meant any kind of wire wherein steel in the form of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> filaments is present including also the steel cord that consists of one single steel filament. By preference the steel is a plain carbon steel although stainless steels are not excluded per se. Such plain carbon steel has an exemplary composition with a minimum carbon content of 0.65%, a manganese content ranging from 0.40% to 0.70%, a silicon content ranging from 0.15% to 0.30%, a maximum sulphur content of 0.03%, a maximum phosphorus content of 0.30%, all percentages being percentages by weight. There are only traces of copper, nickel and / or chromium. The carbon content influences the strength attainable by the filaments so in order to reach the highest possible strength steel filaments with carbon contents of around and above 0.80% carbon are preferred.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The filaments are by preference formed by wire drawing, which is a cold forming process in which the tensile strength of the steel is further increased. In this way tensile strengths of above 2500 N/mm<sup>2</sup> are commonly obtained. Nowadays, very fine filaments with strengths in excess of 3700 N/mm<sup>2</sup> and even above 4000 N/mm<sup>2</sup> are being produced routinely. However, in relation to the splice of the invention, there is no need to go above this limit: as the strength needed for the strip can be obtained with ever finer filaments, the contact area for transfer of force from one strip to the other also diminishes. Hence, higher strength filaments will make it necessary to make the splice longer to compensate the diameter reduction. The described splices still worked well with tensile strengths in excess of 2500 N/mm<sup>2</sup>, which is quite above what is common in the field.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In many cases the steel filaments will be coated with another kind of metal or metal alloy. However, this is not a prerequisite of the invention: it works equally well with uncoated, bare steel wires. Wires are coated for a number of reasons such as to improve drawability, to prevent corrosion of the steel or to increase adhesion with a polymer.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">For example the wires can be coated electrolytically with brass having a composition of between 62.5 and 75 wt% copper, the remainder being zinc. The total coating mass is between 0 to 10 g/kg. Such a coating brings a very good adhesion with rubber with it. It is noted by the inventors<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> that such coating will also work in their invention although its presence is not mandatory to the invention.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Or the wires can be coated with zinc. Zinc is applied for corrosion protection or for adhesion with rubber or for both. The coating mass ranges from 0 to 100 g of zinc per kg of wire. The zinc can be applied onto the wire by means of an electrolytic process or by means of a hot dip process, followed or not followed by a wiping operation in order to reduce the total weight of the zinc. Because of the corrosion protection of zinc and the presence of an iron zinc alloy layer that forms during the hot dip operation, the latter coating type is preferred.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Other coating types such as ternary alloy coatings are equally well possible the only requirement being that the coating must be metallic in nature.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Steel filaments can be assembled into steel cords in many different ways. The most simple is of course if filaments are bundled together in a bundle of mutually parallel wires. When such a bundle is twisted around its own axis with a certain lay length it becomes a single lay strand. Strands can also be assembled by adding layers of filaments to a core filament or core strand, each layer having a specific lay length or direction that differs from the layer below. Strands themselves can also be assembled together with a certain lay length and direction which results in a rope.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Only in case there is absolutely no chemical interaction between the cord's surface and the polymer an influence of the surface structure of the cord - that depends on the construction type of the steel cord - on the anchorage force can be observed. Rougher surfaces will lead to a better mechanical anchoring of the polymer in the steel cord. See for example <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO2005103545A"><text>WO 2005/103545</text></patcit>. As in the invention the anchorage is predominantly of a chemical nature, the construction type of the steel cord has a minor influence on the invention.

The base polymer can be identical to the strip polymer. Alternatively the base polymer can be a thermoplastic polymer different from that of the strip polymer but then still one out of the family of possible strip polymer materials mentioned above. Still another alternative is that the strip polymer is a mixture of the same polymers as the splice polymer but possibly in other ratios of mixture. It is of course also possible that the strip polymer is the same as the splice polymer. However, as the splice polymer will in general be of a more complex nature hence more expensive the latter embodiment may not be the most cost effective.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Co-polymers that are suitable for mixing into the base polymer are grafted co-polymers, block co-polymers or random co-polymers that are functionalised in order to obtain adhesion to steel cords.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Grafted co-polymers are polymers wherein substituent, functionalised groups are attached to the backbone of a polymer which is by preference the base polymer. Not all of the base polymer must be grafted: it suffices if only part of the base polymer chains are grafted. The substituent groups can be attached through reaction with unsaturated aliphatic acids, unsaturated aromatic acids, acid anhydrides, esters, alcohols or combinations thereof. The substituent groups introduce polarity into an otherwise non-polar backbone and thereby increase adhesion to the metallic steel cord substrate.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">More preferred, the grafted co-polymer is an acrylic acid or methacrylic acid functionalised polymer of polyolefins such as polypropylene, polyethylene, or polyesters such as polyethylene terephtalate, polybutylene terephtalate.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Equally preferred are maleic anhydride functionalised polymers of polypropylene, polyethylene, ethylene-propylene rubber, or polyamides or polyurethanes.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Alternatively the co-polymer can be introduced into part of the base polymer chains as block co-polymers. In this case in part of the base polymer, blocks (series of two or more monomers) of functionalised copolymers are introduced into the chain of the base polymer. Alternatively the functionalised monomers of the co-polymer can be introduced in a random manner into the base polymer backbone, which is referred to as random or statistical co-polymers. Again it is not needed that all of the base polymer chains comprise block or random co-polymers. It suffices that a sufficient number of the base polymer chains have co-polymer monomers introduced in their backbone either in blocks or at random.

Indeed when considering a single steel cord that is pulled out of a strip the force needed to pull such single wire out of the strip increases linearly with the concentration of the functionalised co-polymer until the adhesion is so high that the steel cord breaks.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">It was therefore much to the surprise of the inventors that the strength of the splice does <u>not</u> linearly increase with the amount of the functionalised co-polymer in the splice polymer. This goes totally against what the skilled person would expect. Indeed, the splice strength showed an optimum as a function of amount of functionalised co-polymer that was not reached at the highest tested concentration of the co-polymer but at a lower concentration!</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The inventors teach that the optimal concentration of functionalised polymer can be found by observing the yield behaviour of the splice. The splice with the optimum concentration is that splice wherein a 'mixed mode' of yielding can be observed: part of the steel cords break while the remaining part of the cords slide out of the splice polymer without fracturing. If all of the cords glide out of the splice area without fracturing, the amount of functionalised co-polymer is insufficient. On the other hand if an amount of functionalised co-polymer is added wherein all cords in the splice break, part of this amount is superfluous and unexpectedly this amount does not contribute further to the splice strength. The inventors found that this method offers one way to find the optimum fraction of copolymer in the splice polymer.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Specifying the amount of functionalised polymer as a weight fraction is another way of indicating the optimal splice polymer. However, this amount strongly depends on the degree of grafting of substituent polar groups in the co-polymer or on the ratio of substitution of functionalised monomers in the co-polymer. This is strongly dependent on the fabrication method of the functionalised co-polymer and is difficult to determine precisely.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Nevertheless the inventors estimate that - in the case of a grafted copolymer - the optimum weight fraction of said grafted co-polymer is<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> between 20 and 100%, while the degree of grafted substituent polar groups on the co-polymer itself is between 0.0001 % and 1%. This means that between 1 in 1 000 000 to about 1 in 100 of the co-polymer side groups are substituted by polar groups. The higher the grafting degree, the lower the weight percentage of the grafted co-polymer in the splice material can be. If the grafting degree is 0.1 %, normally 2 to 10 wt% of grafted co-polymer will suffice to obtain the desired level of adhesion. If the grafting degree is 0.01 %, 20 to 100wt% of grafted co-polymer will be needed. In practise a degree of grafting higher than 1 % is rarely obtained. The inventors found that an amount in weight of between 40 and 70 wt% of grafted co-polymer is most preferred for commercially available grafted co-polymers. The optimal region could be narrowed to about 60 to 70%. One technique for grafting polymers is to co-extrude the base polymer with unsatured aliphatic acids, unsaturated aromatic acids, acids, anhydrides, esters, alcohols or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Alternatively, when block or random co-polymers are used, the ratio of substitution of monomers in the base polymer will be higher as such copolymers are prepared by in-situ polymerisation. The substitution ratio is there 2 to 10%. Hence, a lower weight fraction of between 2 to 20 wt% of block or random co-polymer in the base polymer suffices to obtain the desired level of adhesion.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Use of a mixture of co-polymer and base polymer as a splice polymer is preferred for plain or interlaced stepped splices. Particularly in the case of plain stepped splices, the use of such a mixture is very advantageous as there the common length between the steel cords in the splices is lower than in the case of interlaced splices. The common length 'CL' in a splice is the sum of the length of the cord sections of the first strip that lay directly adjacent to cord ends of the second strip. Clearly the common length is identical when first and second strip are exchanged. If one cord of the first strip is situated in between two cords of the second strip, the section of the one cord that are adjacent to both two cords is counted double. Two adjacent cord sections in a splice originating from cords of one strip do not contribute to the common length.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The length 'L' of the splice is of course also important in determining the strength of the splice. The length 'L' of the splice is that distance measured parallel to the spliced strips between the two most extreme cord ends of any one of the two strips. For a given splice lay-out the common length 'CL' will scale with the length 'L' of the splice: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mi>CL</mi><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">ϕ</mi><mo>×</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">L</mi><mo>×</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">N</mi></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="30" he="6" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
wherein 'N' is the number of cords in the strip (the maximum should be taken if the number of cords in first and second strip is not equal). 'ϕ' is determined by the lay-out of the splice: for a plain stepped splice 0 &lt; ϕ ≤ 1, while for an interlaced splice ϕ is larger than 1.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The longer this splice length 'L' is the longer the common length 'CL' between steel cords ends and hence the higher the splice strength will be. The splice strength is of course also determined by the anchoring force by which the cords are held in the strip.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The anchoring force is determined by pulling out one single steel cord out of a strip of (splice or strip) matrix material over a test length 'l'. This is done by taking a piece of strip (with the N-cords encased parallel to one another in it), covering the middle part of the strip over a length 'l' perpendicular to the strip, selecting a cord that is not situated on the edges (i.e. a central cord, cords on the edges only are held from one side) and liberating this cord from the strip except for the middle part of length 'I'. Then the selected cord is singled out at one side of the coverage while at the other side all remaining cords are cut except the selected cord. After removing the coverage the selected cord is pulled in axial direction out of the strip while the maximum force F<sub>max</sub> needed therefore is measured. Dividing F<sub>max</sub> by 'l' gives an anchoring force 'f<sub>a</sub>' expressed in newton per millimeter (N/mm).</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The inventors found that the criterion for preferred breakage pattern of the splice can also be expressed in a more quantitative but totally equivalent way. Preferred breakage patterns occur when the total anchoring force in the splice is larger than the breaking load 'BL<sub>strip</sub>' of the strip. In formula:<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> <maths id="math0002" num=""><math display="block"><msub><mi>BL</mi><mi>strip</mi></msub><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>CL</mi><mo>×</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi></msub><mo>/</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="33" he="7" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Then at least one of the cords will show breakage. Note that the divider '2' in the formula originates from the fact the common length of the singled out cord in the anchoring force test described above is '2 x l'.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Alternatively, the inventors found that the total anchoring force in the splice should not be larger than twice the breaking load of the strip, as then all cords break and no favourable distribution of forces by slipping occurs i.e.: <maths id="math0003" num=""><math display="block"><mi>CL</mi><mo>×</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi></msub><mo>/</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn><mo>≤</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn><mo>×</mo><msub><mi>BL</mi><mi>strip</mi></msub></math><img id="ib0003" file="imgb0003.tif" wi="41" he="7" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Increasing the strength of the splice above 2 x BL<sub>strip</sub> is superfluous and does not help to improve the overall splice strength.

In what follows the ratio (CL×f<sub>a</sub>)/(2×BL<sub>strip</sub>) will be called the 'Splice Quality factor' SQf. It is thus preferred that the SQf is larger than 1. It even more preferred that the SQf is between 1 and 2.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">As the common length 'CL' is proportional to the length of the splice 'L' it follow that too long a splice length will lead to all wires being fractured which is - strangely enough - not the most preferred situation.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The length of the splice can also be related to the critical length of the steel cord. The critical length 'L<sub>c</sub>' of a steel cord in a certain strip or splice polymer 'matrix' is that length for which the anchoring force equals the breaking load 'F<sub>b</sub>' of the cord in the matrix material: L<sub>c</sub><sup>matrix</sup>=F<sub>b</sub>/f<sub>a</sub>. I.e. it is that embedment length of steel cord when the steel cord will fracture rather than being pulled out of the strip or splice.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The splice length 'L' can be expressed relative to the critical length of the <u>splice</u> material 'L<sub>c</sub><sup>splice</sup>'. By preference 'L' is larger than two to three times the critical length of the cord in the splice material 'L<sub>c</sub><sup>splice</sup>'. Most preferred is if the splice length 'L' is larger than four times the critical length 'L<sub>c</sub><sup>splice</sup>'. By preference the splice length 'L' is shorter than seven or, even more<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> preferred, six times the critical length 'L<sub>c</sub><sup>splice</sup>'. Longer splice lengths lead to all fractured cords and no gliding cords.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The above explained principles equally apply for a plain stepped or an interlaced stepped splice.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">In case of a plain stepped splice a breaking load of the splice that is larger than half of the lower breaking load of any one of said first and second strip can be obtained by applying the principles explained above. Splice strengths larger than 55 % or even larger than 60% of the strip breaking load can be obtained on plain stepped splices. As the plain stepped splice is very similar in strength and bending stiffness to the strip itself, the splice can be processed without any interruption in the process using the strip e.g. when winding around a tube, flexible pipe or mooring rope.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In case of a interlaced stepped splice the breaking load of the splice can even be higher depending on the lay-out of the splice. Splice strengths in excess of 60% of the lower breaking load of any one of said first and second strip can be obtained. Values above 70, or 80 or even 90% of the breaking load of the strips are possible.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Finally a strip that comprises any one of the above described splices is also claimed. The splices can advantageously be used to overcome problems associated with increased length requirements such as production length limitations (e.g. because the take-up unit can not take the full length of strip) or transport limitations (e.g. when the total length needed can not be transported on a single carrier as in the case of a conveyor belt).</p><heading id="h0004"><b>Brief Description of Figures in the Drawings</b></heading><p id="p0061" num="0061"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref> shows a splice arrangement of the plain stepped splice type according which tests were performed.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2</figref> shows the increase in anchoring force with increased weight percentage of co-polymer in the splice polymer.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURE 3</figref> shows the splice strength which was obtained for various weight percentages of co-polymer in the splice polymer.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIGURE 4a</figref> shows the plain stepped splice with the longest possible common length.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIGURE 4b</figref> shows the interlaced stepped splice with the longest possible common length.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>Mode(s) for Carrying Out the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0062" num="0062">In a first preferred embodiment the inventors spliced two strips containing 54 cords extruded in parallel in High Density Poly Ethylene (HDPE, Eltex Tub 172 obtained from Solvay Polyolefins). The cords were steel cords of the type 12LE with three filaments of 0.28 and 9 filaments of 0.31 mm assembled together in a single lay as described in <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="WO2008080715A"><text>WO 2008 080715</text></patcit>. The cord has a breaking load of at least 2400 N and a diameter of 1.23 mm. The average tensile strength of the wires is 2680 N/mm<sup>2</sup>. The filaments were galvanised with a coating amount of 44 g/kg. The estimated overall strength of the strip was 54x2400N or 129.6 kN. The measured strength of the strip was 132 kN.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The width of the strip was 97 mm which results in a linear packing density of 68.5 %, hence the space between the cords is less than the diameter of the cords. With such high packing density it is not possible to make an interlaced stepped splice without cutting cords before or after the strip. In addition an interlaced splice results in cords that are not straight through just before or after or in the splice area. Therefore the inventors opted for a plain stepped splice.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In order to eliminate the variance due to the lay-out pattern of a stepped splice on the breaking load, one single arrangement of a plain stepped splice was selected for all experiments. This arrangement is represented in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref>. There the position 'X' of different abutments is represented for each cord numbered from left to right in the first strip (the dark bars in the figure). The splice length 'L' is limited to 500 mm in total. The common length of this arrangement is 17600 mm or 35.2 times the splice length 'L'. The lay-out factor 'ϕ' is 65% (i.e. smaller than 1) for this plain stepped splice. The cutting of the cords in the second strip (the white bars in the figure) is complementary to that of the first strip. The abutments were chosen in a 'random' way such that the no two abutments come too near to one another.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">The making of the splice starts with cutting the strips under 90° angle. Then on both strip ends, the entire HDPE casing is removed over 500 mm<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> by stripping. This goes very easily as the HDPE only mechanically anchors to the cords. The steel cord ends are then cut to the length of the scheme where the base line is taken at the HDPE coated strip edge. Both strips are straight aligned to each other in a mold. A grooved sheet of splice polymer material with 54 round grooves of about 1.1 mm width and with a length of 500 mm is prepared and put in the mold. The splice is built up by alternatively pushing cords from the first and second strip end into the grooves. The steel cords tend to snap into the grooves and are held in this way. Once all cord ends in place, the splice is covered with a second sheet of splice polymer and the mold is closed. The mold is heated and pressurised by putting it into a hydraulic press. Heating is up to the melting temperature of the HDPE i.e. about 130°C.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">As a grafted co-polymer for mixing the splice polymer 'Yparex®' obtained from DSM was used.

The splices Nrs. 4 and 5 showed such favoured failure mode while in splices Nrs. 1 to 3 the steel cords did not break but were pulled out of the splice polymer. In splice Nr. 6 all cords were broken, no sliding occurred. The mixed fracture behaviour is characterised in that certain cords are torn out of the splice polymer (as the adhesion strength by which they are held is less than their breaking load) while others reach their maximum breaking load. By analysing the fracture, it is clearly visible what cords are broken and what cords have been torn out of the polymer without fracture. At the moment one cord snaps, the whole construction collapses. It is conjectured by the inventors that by having cords that glide out of the polymer, the force distribution in the splice is better and leads to higher overall strength. The gliding acts as a buffer to distribute the forces more evenly.

Polyamide - due to the presence of polarity in its chains - has a higher chemical affinity to steel than the a-polar polyolefins. However, this is still insufficient to obtain a splice of sufficient strength. Therefore the inventors mixed Yparex® to it as an adhesive co-polymer in different amounts. A strip was extruded with identical cords in an identical number as in the first series of embodiments, but now made of Pipelon®. Splices were made with the same lay-out as in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>. Results are summarised in table II:

A strip was made comprising 15 steel cords of type 12LE, pulling 2700 N at break. The steel cords were incased in Eltex TUB172 HDPE. The strip had a breaking load of BL<sub>strip</sub> of 39 970 N and a width of 30 mm. Four different splices were made.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Splices 11 and 12 were of the type exemplified in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGURE 4a</figref>, i.e. it are splices 400 of the simplest possible plain stepped type wherein odd cords are cut at the one end of the splice in the first strip, while the even cords run through in the splice while in the second strip even cords are cut at the<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> other end of the splice while the odd cords 404, 406 run through to form the splice. The total length of the splice 'L' was 500 mm resulting in a common length of 14x500 or 7000 mm. The lay-out factor 'ϕ' is therefore 93 %. This is the plain stepped splice with the largest possible common length.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">The splice polymer used for splice 11 was identical to the strip polymer material i.e. Eltex TUB172 HDPE.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">The splice polymer used for splice 12 was a mixture of polyamide Pipelon® with 60% by weight of Yparex®.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">Splices 13 and 14 are of the interlaced stepped splice type as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4b</figref>, 450. In the splice the cords of both strip ends are freed over the same length L'+2A. The cord ends are put side by side in the splice thus yielding the interlaced splice with the longest possible common length of 29x450 or 13 050 mm. The length L' is only 450 mm as some of the cords had to be diverted in order to be able to accommodate the cords in the splice (as the packing density in the strip was 68.5%). As no cords were cut at the entry of the splice, the total width increased from 'b' 30 mm to 'B' 61 mm. The lay-out factor 'ϕ' for this splice is 1.93.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">The splice polymer of splice 13 was Eltex TUB172 HDPE, while the splice polymer for splice 14 was again a mixture of polyamide Pipelon® with 60% by weight of Yparex®.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">The results of the test are summarised in Table V. Qualitatively, in the tensile test the cords were torn out of the splices 11 and 13 without any cord breaking: all cords were slid out of the splice.

The reason why the strength of the splice is only 47% of the strength of the strip is due to the poor lay-out scheme: half of the cords of one strip end at the same place in the splice. When thinking away the odd cords in the left strip and the even cords in the right strip of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGURE 4a</figref>, one obtains an imaginary interlaced splice with 7 cords in the strip on the left and 8 cords in the strip on the right. The common length however remains unchanged, hence also the SQf. But then the splice strength BL<sub>splice</sub>/BL<sub>strip</sub> would at least be 94%.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p><p id="p0086" num="0086">In splice 14 all cords snapped during the splice testing.
