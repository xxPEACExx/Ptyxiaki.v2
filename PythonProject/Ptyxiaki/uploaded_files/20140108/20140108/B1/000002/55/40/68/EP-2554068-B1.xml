More particularly, the specification relates to an improved face shield assembly that universally fits to most hard hats and that further includes a dual-pivot system which allows the face shield to be efficiently located in a "down" as-used position, a "up" as-used position and a "stowed" position above the hard hat.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Current head gear product offerings are generally hard hat specific, i.e. they do not universally fit a variety of hard hats. Further, when the face shields of existing safety systems are rotated upwards into the unused position, they leave the shields in a position that is cantilevered in front of the hard hat, where it is cumbersome, off-balance and in the way. For example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6041435A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,041,435</text></patcit>, discloses a face shield bracket that can be used to adjustably couple the face shield to a hard hat or cap. The '435 patent comprises a two piece arcuately shaped frame where one piece of the frame hooks over the front brim portion of a full-brimmed hard hat and the other piece is coupled to a face shield. A flexible securing strap is coupled to the frame and extends over the crown of the hard hat, and the strap is used for securely holding the frame piece over the front of the brim portion. A pivot assembly is used in conjunction with the frame pieces to pivot one frame piece with respect to the other using a variable resistance pivot, thereby allowing the face shield to be easily locked at any position. In another embodiment, the flexible securing strap, amongst other elements, is eliminated and mounting brackets are substituted to allow the bracket to be adapted to a hard cap.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0002"><u>Summary:</u></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">An improved, dual-pivot face shield assembly is universally configured for fitting to a plurality of different hard hats. The improved dual-pivot face shield assembly is comprised of three separate brackets, namely a main mounting bracket secured to the rim of the hard hat, a rotating bracket pivotably mounted to the main mounting bracket and a lens mounting bracket pivotably mounted to the rotating bracket.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The main mounting bracket includes an arcuate brow bar, a brim portion depending forwardly from the brow bar, opposing pivot bosses extending from<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> opposing ends of the brow bar, and a plurality of mounting tabs extending downwardly and inwardly from a bottom surface of the brim portion. An elastic stretch cord having opposing ends is secured to the opposing ends of the brow bar to secure the main mounting bracket onto the hard hat. In use, the main mounting bracket is received onto a brim of the hard hat wherein the mounting tabs hook under and engage the forward edges of the brim of the hard hat and the elastic stretch cord is extended over and around the rear of the hard hat.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The rotating bracket has an arcuate body portion, opposing ends and opposing primary pivot studs extending inwardly from the opposing ends. The primary pivot studs are rotatably snap-received into pivot openings in the opposing pivot bosses on the main mounting bracket to rotatably couple the rotating bracket to the main mounting bracket. The rotating bracket is thus pivotably movable relative to the main mounting bracket between a "down" position, where the lens is in an "as-used" position, and an "up" position where the lens is tilted up, but not stowed.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The lens mounting bracket has an arcuate body portion with a lens receiving channel on the lower edge thereof, and further has opposing ends. The arcuate body portion of the lens mounting bracket is pivotably coupled to the arcuate body portion of the rotating bracket wherein the lens mounting bracket is pivotably movable relative to the rotating bracket between an "as-used" position and a "stowed" position.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">To stabilize the lens mounting bracket in the "as-used" and "stowed" positions relative to the rotating bracket, a pair of stabilizer struts are captured between the respective opposing ends of the lens mounting bracket and the main mounting bracket. The stabilizer struts include an internal spring captured in compression. A first end of the strut is rotatably connected to a post extending outwardly from the outside surface of the end of the rotating bracket while the second end of the strut is rotatably connected to a post on the outside surface of the end of the lens mounting bracket. The<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> spring is normally under compression and biases the ends of the strut outwardly to maintain the lens mounting bracket in the noted positions. As the lens mounting bracket is pivoted from one position to the other, the spring in the strut compresses, and then, once it passes a central axis, extends again and biases the ends of the strut outwardly to maintain the lens mounting bracket in the other position.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A lens is removably secured within the lens channel in the lens mounting bracket whereby the lens is movable through three different positions, namely a "down" as-used position, an "up" as-used position, and "stowed" position.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Accordingly, an objective is to provide an improved face shield assembly which universally fits most hard hats.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is another objective to provide a face shield assembly that includes a dual pivot system which allows the face shield to move between a down "as-used" position and an up "as-used" position and further to be more efficiently located in a "stowed" position above the hard hat.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Other objects, features and advantages shall become apparent as the description thereof proceeds when considered in connection with the accompanying illustrative drawings.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Brief Description of the Drawing Figures:</u></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The preferred embodiment will now be described further by way of example with reference to the following examples and figures, which are intended to be illustrative only and in no way limiting upon the scope of the disclosure.

In accordance with the teachings herein, the dual-pivot face shield assembly 10 is universally configured to fit to a plurality of different hard hats such as the representative example generally indicated at 12. The dual-pivot face shield assembly is comprised of three separate brackets, namely a main mounting bracket generally indicated at 14, a rotating bracket generally indicated at 16, and a lens mounting bracket generally indicated at 18. Further, a transparent, toric safety lens 20 is removably secured to the lens mounting bracket 18.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Hard hats 12 of the type contemplated herein are well-known in the art, and<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> generally comprise a protective dome 22 and a brim 24 extending from the front portion of the dome (See <figref idrefs="f0009">Figs. 9</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0010">10</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0012">12</figref>). The hard hat 12 is maintained on the wearer's head by a conventional head gear suspension (not shown) that encircles the wearer's head. Most hard hats 12 have the same general configuration however the specific dimensions and sizes of the dome 22 and brim 24 are different. The proposed face shield assembly 10, as described herein, is configured to be universally mounted onto hard hats 12 having this basic configuration but varying dimensions.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The main mounting bracket 14 includes an arcuate brow bar 26, a brim portion 28 depending forwardly from the brow bar 26, opposing pivot bosses 30, 32 extending from opposing ends of the brow bar 26, and a plurality of mounting tabs 34, 36, 38 extending downwardly and inwardly from a bottom surface of the brim portion 28. An elastic stretch cord 40 having opposing ends is secured within slots 42, 44 in the opposing ends of the brow bar 26 to secure the main mounting bracket 14 onto the hard hat 12.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The main mounting bracket 14 is received onto the brim 24 of the hard hat 12 where the mounting tabs 34, 36, 38 hook under and engage the forward edges of the brim 24 of the hard hat 12 (<figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 12</figref>), and the elastic stretch cord 40 is extended over and around the dome 22 at the rear of the hard hat 12. The mounting tabs 34, 36, 38 are configured so that they can accommodate a wide range of brim sizes and shapes, while the elastic stretch cord 40 pulls the mounting bracket 14 rearwardly and establishes a firm, stable fit of the main mounting bracket 14 on the brim 24 regardless of the shape of the hard hat dome 22 and shape of the brim 24.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As best seen in <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">Figs. 2-7</figref>, the brim portion 28 of the main mounting bracket 14 is designed in such a way to minimize or eliminate any gap between the inside of the lens 20 and the open area above the hard hat 12 on a wide range of hard hat sizes thus minimizing the ability of debris from falling in front of the wearer's eyes. Further in this<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> regard, the peripheral edges of the brim portion 28 include an upwardly extending debris dam 46 which will retain debris captured on top of the brim portion 28 and prevent the debris from falling into the wearer's eyes when the lens 20 is raised.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The rotating bracket 16 includes an arcuate body portion 48, opposing ends and opposing primary pivot studs 50, 52 extending inwardly from the opposing ends. The primary pivot studs 50, 52 are rotatably snap-received into pivot openings 54, 56 in the opposing pivot bosses 30, 32 on the main mounting bracket 14 to rotatably couple the rotating bracket 16 to the main mounting bracket 14.
