load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><u>Technical Field</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to thermal energy stores, and in particular to a ground or earth energy store which acts as a thermal mass to accumulate and store heat energy. The present invention also relates to heat exchange assemblies which can be used to supply heat energy into the thermal energy store and extract heat energy from it. The heat energy that is extracted from the thermal energy store can be used to provide space heating or cooling for buildings, optionally by means of a hydronic heating or cooling system.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Background Art</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In December 2006 the UK Government launched the Code for Sustainable Homes (CSH) which required progressive reductions in the environmental impact of new houses. In particular, a timetable of progressively greater targets for the reduction of energy use has been adopted, with an aim of having a 'zero carbon' output by 2016 for private housing and 2013 for public housing. A 'zero carbon' house is one that has 'zero net emissions of carbon dioxide from all energy use within the home'. This means in effect that it must generate more energy over a year than it uses.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The UK Government is currently considering incorporating parts of the Code into the building regulations with an emphasis on progressive increase in energy efficiency and the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The inventors believe that a number of technical problems need to be solved before zero carbon houses can become a practical and economic reality. One of these is that the most demand for heat and electrical energy occurs when the sun is not shining, either at night on a diurnal basis, or in winter on a seasonal basis. There is no readily available means of storing either electricity or heat for when it is most needed.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) can reduce the carbon footprint of a building by lowering its carbon emissions. By extracting useful heat energy from the surrounding ground a conventional GSHP can be used to provide hot water and/or space heating.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">GSHPs circulate a fluid (e.g. water or water/glycol mix) around a ground loop of heat collecting coils, typically made of polyethylene (PE) pipe, that is buried in the land surrounding the building. Heat energy from the ground is absorbed by the circulating fluid and is pumped through a heat exchanger in the heat pump to extract low grade heat. A compressor in the heat pump is then used to concentrate the low grade heat into useful heat that can be used to heat domestic hot water and/or provide space heating.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">If the area of the land surrounding the building is sufficient then the heat collecting coils can be laid flat or coiled in shallow trenches below the surface. In an alternative arrangement, the heat collecting coils can be lowered into vertical boreholes that are typically about 120 to 150 mm in diameter (depending on the diameter of the PE pipe that will be used) and between 80 and 150 m deep. Once the heat collecting coils have been lowered into the boreholes, the boreholes are filled with suitable filler such as a thermally-enhanced grout. The filler ensures that no voids are left in the boreholes so that good thermal contact is maintained between the heat collecting coils and the surrounding earth or sub-soil. Typically each borehole will include a single ground loop with one side being the supply and the other the return. It will be readily appreciated that GSHPs are not suitable in all circumstances. Drilling the boreholes is expensive and the boreholes must also be spaced apart by a sufficient distance (e.g. about 7.0 m) to prevent the useful heat energy from being exhausted and allow temperature recovery.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Systems using just GSHPs are essentially 'passive' because they rely on the solar energy that is absorbed by the ground during the warmer months. There are also potential problems and costs associated with positioning the heat collecting coils, e.g. there may be insufficient space or the ground might not be suitable for digging a trench or a borehole.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE8008592U"><text>DE 80 08 592U</text></patcit> discloses a device for extracting ground heat.

For example, the borehole units may be spaced at a distance of between about 1.0 and about 2.0 m, more preferably about 1.5 m. The borehole units preferably have a length of between about 1.0 and about 2.5 m, more preferably about 1.5 m, and are adapted to be received in boreholes having a similar depth. In an arrangement where the heat exchange assembly is installed in a thermal ground mass that is substantially<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> bounded or contained by building foundations then the borehole units will typically extend into the ground by a distance that is substantially the same as, or at least does not substantially exceed, the depth of the building foundations. It will be readily appreciated that the borehole units can be received in boreholes that are much shallower, and which are spaced much closer together, than the boreholes used for conventional ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) because there is no need to allow for temperature recovery for the reasons discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Boreholes of the required depth can be drilled using standard post hole drilling equipment, for example, rather than specialist deep hole boring rigs.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The open-loop heat transfer pipes of each borehole unit can be substantially U-shaped. More particularly, each open-loop heat transfer pipe can include a first length (supply) of polyethylene (PE) piping and a second length (return) of PE piping connected together by a short length of PE piping or a u-joint so that their centre lines are substantially parallel and spaced about 100 mm apart. The lengths of PE piping can be connected to the connecting pipes by elbow joints. All connections can be electro-welded or the like and the finished heat exchange assembly is preferably checked and pressure-tested in the factory before it is transported to the installation site.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The heat exchange assembly can also be supported by a substantially rigid support structure (e.g. a jig) during transportation and installation.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The present invention further provides a thermal energy store comprising: an array of boreholes in a thermal ground mass; and a heat exchange assembly as described above arranged with each borehole unit received in a respective one of the boreholes. The substantially rigid support structure is removed once the heat exchange assembly is properly positioned with each borehole unit received in a respective one of the boreholes. The thermal ground mass will typically be soil or earth that defines a thermal mass which is capable of storing and retaining heat energy. The soil or earth can be optionally compacted before the boreholes are drilled and the heat exchange<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> assembly is installed. This allows for the array of boreholes to be drilled with little disturbance to the ground between the building foundations.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The thermal energy store can include more than one heat exchange assembly. In this case, the inlets and outlets of the heat exchange assemblies can be connected to common inlet and outlet manifolds or connecting blocks by suitable connection pipes. The heat exchange assemblies can be connected together in series to form a single open-loop circuit, in parallel to form a plurality of open-loop circuits, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The boreholes can be substantially filled by a filler material, e.g. sand or a thermally-enhanced grout.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A layer of filler material (e.g. sand) can cover the connecting pipes of the heat exchange assembly. A layer of thermal insulating material (e.g. polystyrene or polyurethane foam blocks) can be on top of the layer of filler material.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">It is believed that heat transfer between the thermal ground mass and fluid circulating through the heat exchange assembly will be improved if the thermal ground mass is kept slightly moist. A damp proof membrane can therefore be positioned on top of the layer of thermal insulating material. Additional means may be provided to control moisture levels of the thermal ground mass, particularly during the summer months.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The thermal ground mass can be substantially bounded or contained by building foundations. In other words, the thermal energy store can be conveniently installed directly underneath the building during construction. However, in the case where the thermal energy store is to be installed to an existing building (i.e. retro-fitted), then the thermal energy store will normally be located outside the building foundations. A layer of thermal insulating material (e.g. polystyrene or polyurethane foam blocks) can be positioned between the building foundations and the thermal ground mass to provide additional insulation along the sides of the thermal ground mass.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A hydronic radiant heating or cooling system arranged to heat or cool a building space can include a thermal energy store as described above. The hydronic radiant heating or cooling system can be an under floor heating system, for example, where heated or cooled fluid is circulated around a tubing loop that is typically laid in a serpentine pattern and clipped to an underlying layer of insulation. A concrete screed is then laid on top of the insulation and the tubing. The tubing can also be installed in timber suspended floors, or in walls or ceilings. The hydronic radiant heating or cooling system can be installed in a building, and in particular a building that aims to meet the 'zero carbon' standard.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The present invention further provides a method of operating the hydronic radiant heating or cooling system comprising the steps of: circulating fluid through the open-loop fluid circuit of the heat exchange assembly to store thermal energy in the thermal ground mass; circulating fluid through the open-loop fluid circuit of the heat exchange assembly to extract thermal energy from the thermal ground mass; and using the extracted thermal energy to provide space heating or cooling. For example, heated or cooled fluid can be circulated through the heat exchange assembly to raise or lower the temperature of the thermal ground mass and store heat energy. Fluid can then be circulated through the heat exchange assembly where it can be heated or cooled by the thermal ground mass (i.e. the thermal ground mass is operating as a heating or cooling device in heat exchange with the heat transfer pipes of the borehole units) and the heated or cooled fluid can be used to provide radiant space heating or cooling.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Any suitable heating or cooling device can be used to heat or cool the fluid before it is circulated through the heat exchange assembly to raise or lower the temperature of the thermal ground mass. One suitable example would be a photovoltaic thermal (PV/T) hybrid array in which heat energy is removed from the conventional photovoltaic (PV) cells by fluid cooling to enable them to operate at more efficient temperatures while also capturing heat energy in a similar manner to conventional solar thermal panels. Conventional solar thermal panels can also be used. If a GSHP is available then fluid can be circulated between the heat exchange assembly and the heat pump so<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> that low grade heat which is not sufficient for radiant space heating can be extracted from the thermal energy store.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A pump can be used to circulate fluid through the heat exchange assembly.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In general terms, the present invention further provides a method of operating a thermal energy store as described above comprising the steps of: connecting the inlet and outlet of the heat exchange assembly to (a) a source of heated or cooled fluid, or (b) one of a hydronic radiant heating or cooling system and a heat pump to form a closed-loop circuit; and circulating fluid around the closed-loop circuit.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The present invention further provides a method of assembling a heat exchange assembly comprising the steps of: forming a plurality of borehole units, each borehole unit including an open-loop heat transfer pipe having an inlet and an outlet; arranging an array of the borehole units on a substantially rigid support structure (e.g. a jig) in a pre-determined pattern prior to installation of the heat exchange assembly with each borehole unit extending substantially perpendicular to a plane of the heat exchange assembly; and prior to installation of the heat exchange assembly connecting the inlet of each borehole unit apart from a first borehole unit in the array to the outlet of a preceding borehole unit in the array by a connecting pipe that lies substantially in the plane of the heat exchange assembly to define an open-loop fluid circuit including each open-loop heat transfer pipe and extending between an inlet and an outlet of the assembled heat exchange assembly.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The method of assembling the heat exchange assembly can include the step of pressure-testing the assembled heat exchange assembly prior to its installation.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The present invention further provides a method of forming a thermal energy store comprising the steps of: drilling an array of boreholes in a thermal ground mass (e.g. soil or earth, optionally compacted) in a pre-determined pattern; and installing a heat exchange assembly as described above with an array of borehole units arranged in the same pre-determined pattern, each borehole unit being received in a respective one of<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the boreholes. The method can further include the preliminary step of using a template to mark out the position of the boreholes in the pre-determined pattern before the boreholes are drilled.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The heat exchange assembly can be transported and installed while the borehole units are arranged on a substantially rigid support (e.g. a jig) which is removed once the heat exchange assembly is properly positioned with each borehole unit received in a respective one of the boreholes.

The first and third heat exchange assemblies 1a, 1c are identical while the second heat exchange assembly 1b has a narrower width. They all have the same basic construction. It will be readily appreciated that any number of heat exchange assemblies can be used depending on the available area, and that the heat exchange assemblies can have any suitable number of individual borehole units (see below) arranged in any suitable pre-determined pattern.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs. 1 to 3</figref>, each heat exchange assembly consists of an array of borehole units 2 that extend vertically into boreholes 26.

In the case of the first heat exchange unit 1a, the outlet of a first borehole unit 2<sub>1</sub> is connected to the inlet of a second borehole unit 2<sub>2</sub>, the outlet of the second borehole unit 2<sub>2</sub> is connected to the inlet of a third borehole unit 2<sub>3</sub>, the outlet of the third borehole unit 2<sub>3</sub> is connected to the inlet of a fourth borehole unit 2<sub>4</sub>, and so on. The first borehole unit 2<sub>1</sub> defines an inlet for the first heat exchange assembly 1a and the sixteenth (or last) borehole unit 2<sub>16</sub> defines an outlet for the first heat exchange assembly. The borehole units of the second and third heat exchange assemblies 1b and 1c are connected together in a similar manner.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The open-loop fluid circuits defined by each heat exchange unit 1a, 1b and 1c can be arranged in series or parallel. In the case of a parallel arrangement (not shown) then the inlet of each heat exchange assembly can be connected to a common inlet manifold or connecting block and the outlet of each heat exchange assembly can be common outlet manifold or connecting block.

Fluid supplied to the inlet 12 of the first heat exchange assembly 1a will therefore flow through the borehole units 2 of each heat exchange assembly in turn before reaching the outlet 14 of the third heat exchange assembly 1c. The heat exchange assemblies 1a, 1b and 1c, including the individual borehole units 2 and the connecting pipes 10, are formed as integral components in the factory, where they are pressure-tested and sealed. To avoid the need to perform any machining or fixing on site, the inlets and outlets of the heat exchange assemblies 1a, 1b and 1c can be connected together using a connecting block 16, e.g. by means of a screw-fit.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The heat exchange assemblies 1a,1b and 1c are positioned underneath a building, e.g. a domestic house, and the thermal energy store is bounded by the foundations 18 for the building.

Polystyrene 'clay boards' 20 are fixed to the inner faces of the trenches by pinning. The polystyrene boards 20 are intended to insulate the foundations 18 from the enclosed soil or earth 22 which forms the thermal ground mass for the thermal energy store.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Strips of thermal damp proof membrane 24 are laid on the ground and folded over the polystyrene clay boards 20 all round the periphery of the area.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The concrete is poured to form the building foundations 18 and when set, the strips of thermal damp proof membrane 24 will be trapped between the concrete and the polystyrene boards 20 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. The strip of damp proof membrane 24 is temporarily folded back over the foundations 18 while the heat exchange assemblies are installed and connected.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">A marking template (not shown) is placed on the ground between the foundations and spray markers are applied to accurately mark the position of each borehole. The marking template is removed and the boreholes 26 are drilled, typically using a post borer with a 200 mm auger. Each borehole is drilled to a depth of about 1.5 m or to substantially the same depth as the building foundations 18. Spoil from the drilling is removed from the site as work progresses.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">When the boreholes 26 have been drilled, each of the heat exchange assemblies 1a, 1b and 1c can be delivered separately and installed. The jig to which the individual borehole units 2 are mounted is lifted from the delivery vehicle by crane and gently lowered so that the borehole units 2 are lowered into the specially prepared boreholes 26. Once the connecting pipes 10 are resting on the top surface of the earth or soil, which may optionally be compacted and levelled before drilling takes place, and the borehole units 2 are received in the boreholes 26, the heat exchange assembly can be released from the jig.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">When all of the heat exchange assemblies 1a, 1b and 1c are in position, they are connected to the connecting block 16 and the inlet 12 and outlet 14 are connected to the external fluid circuit. In the case of a parallel arrangement then the inlet and outlet of each heat exchange assembly will be connected to a common inlet manifold and a common outlet manifold, respectively.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The boreholes 26 are filled with sand or other suitable filler material and the whole area between the foundations 18 is covered with a layer of sand 28, typically to a depth of about 75 mm. The sand layer is raked level. The sand or filler material that<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> is used to fill the boreholes 26 maintains a good thermal transfer between the fluid flowing through the borehole units 2 and the surrounding soil or earth 22.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The sand layer 28 is covered by insulating polyurethane foam blocks 30, each block typically being about 90 mm deep.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The insulating layer 30 is then covered by a damp proof membrane 32 with the joints taped and sealed. The strips of damp proof membrane 24 around the periphery are folded back on top of the new membrane layer 32 and taped to it.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Any thermally insulated flooring structure 34 for the building is preferably separated from the damp proof membrane 32 by an air gap 36 of about 150 mm.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The external fluid circuit and the open-loop fluid circuit defined by the borehole units 2 and the connecting pipes 10 of the heat exchange assemblies 1a, 1b and 1c together form a closed-loop heating and cooling circuit around which fluid (e.g. water or a water/glycol mix) can be circulated.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Fluid can be heated by a heat source (not shown) such as a photovoltaic thermal (PV/T) hybrid array and circulated through the heat exchange assemblies 1a, 1b and 1c to raise the temperature of the soil or earth 22. It will be readily appreciated that the soil or earth 22 that is bounded by the building foundations 18 will therefore be operating as a thermal ground mass which is capable of storing significant amounts of heat energy over time.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">When the stored heat energy is needed, fluid can be circulated through the heat exchange assemblies 1a, 1b and 1c where it is heated by the surrounding soil or earth 22. The heated fluid can be used by a hydronic radiant heating system, such as an under floor heating system, to provide space heating, or passed through the heat exchanger of a conventional ground source heat pump (GSHP), for example.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0055" num="0055">It is expected that surplus heat energy from the PV/T array would be stored in the thermal energy store during the summer and then extracted during the winter. The amount of heat energy that could be stored will depend on various factors including the quantity of heat that is provided by the PV/T array and the rate of heat loss out of the thermal ground mass - which is hopefully minimised by the use of the insulating polystyrene boards 20 and the polyurethane foam insulating layer 30 and the thermal damp proof membrane 32 which retains both heat and moisture.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56984318" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Angeformte Wärmetauscheranordnung, aufweisend:
