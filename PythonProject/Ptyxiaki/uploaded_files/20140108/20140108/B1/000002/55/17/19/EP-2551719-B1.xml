The ultra-short focus projector has the same projector screen size as conventional projectors but requires a shorter length to a projector surface (i.e., a screen). Since the distance to the projector surface is shorter, there are the following merits.
<ol><li>1. A space can be effectively utilized.</li><li>2. Projected light does not easily impinge on a presenter, and thus glare is reduced and a ghost image is prevented.</li><li>3. A distance between the image projecting device and a viewer is made greater, and thus heat and noise from the image projecting device is not annoying.</li></ol></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In order to make these merits more effective, it is preferred that the image projecting device has a vertical configuration so that a footprint is reduced and the image projecting device can be placed closer to a wall.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, if the image projecting device has a vertical configuration, it can topple easily. If the image projecting device topples, the projected light may be shown into the eyes of the viewer and cause glare. Further, if the toppled image projecting device is left for a long time, a cooling mechanism does not work sufficiently, which increases the temperature of the image projecting<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> device and causes internal parts to fail. For this reason, there is a technique for automatically stopping the projection if toppling of the image projecting device is detected.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2008009136A"><text>2008-009136</text></patcit> discloses an image projection device for projecting an image which device projects a plurality of images in a plurality of directions around an image projection device main body nearly on the same surface as the installation surface of the image projection device, for the purpose of providing an image projection device readily installed on a table in a conference or the like and projecting an image in front of all the persons present, thereby progressing an argument while looking at each other. This image projecting device includes an inertia sensor as a detecting part for detecting the toppling, and turns off the power supply of a light source to stop the output when the toppling of the image projecting device is detected.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As described above, according to the image projecting device of the prior art which forcefully stops the projection when the toppling of the image projecting device is detected, there is a problem that it takes time to resume the projection after the image projecting device is restored to the original position. This is because it takes a certain time for an ordinary image projecting device to restart the projection once the projection is stopped.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention is made in consideration of the problem of the prior art described above, and an object of the present invention is to provide an image projecting device with increased convenience by minimizing stoppage of the image projection at the time of toppling of the image projecting device.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">In order to solve the problem, according to the present invention, an image projecting device for projecting an image on a screen is provided.

To the contrary, according to the present invention, a determination whether the projected light of the image projecting device is directed to a viewer as a result of toppling of the image projecting device is used to determine whether to stop the projection.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In other words, if the image projecting device topples and the projected light of the image projecting device is not directed to a viewer, the projected light is not shown into the eyes of the viewer and thus the viewer does not perceive glare. Therefore, in this case, it is not necessary to immediately stop the image projection. Within a short time, a temperature increase due to a problem of a cooling mechanism is not substantial, and there is low probability that the device becomes disabled. By continuing the image projection without stopping it, a normal image projection can be resumed merely by restoring the toppled image projecting device to its original position. Thus, a waiting time required to resume the projection is eliminated, thereby increasing convenience.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In contrast, if the projected light of the image projecting device is directed to a viewer, the projected light is shown into the eyes of the viewer and thus the viewer perceives glare. Therefore, in<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> this case, the image projection is immediately stopped.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Further, even if the image projecting device topples and the projected light of the image projecting device is not directed to a viewer, continuing the image projection for a long time causes a high temperature increase due to a problem of a cooling mechanism and a high probability that the device becomes disabled. Therefore, if an elapsed time after the toppling reaches a predetermined time or a temperature inside the device reaches a predetermined temperature, the image projection is stopped.</p><heading id="h0008">[First Embodiment]</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is an example of an external view of an image projecting device 1 according to a first embodiment.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The image projecting device 1 according to the embodiment emits light via a projection aperture 2 at the top of the device to project an image on a screen 6. The image projecting device 1 has the same projector screen size as ordinary projectors but it is characterized in that it requires a shorter length to a projector surface. A technique for implementing such a ultra-short focus is a projection optical system disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2007316674A"><text>2007-316674</text></patcit>, for example.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Further, the image projecting device 1 is also characterized in that it has a vertical configuration. The vertical configuration has a advantage in that it can reduce the foot print of the image projecting device 1.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">An operation part 3 provided on an upper surface of the device includes plural buttons which are used for an on/off operation of a power supply, operations for various settings, switching of input<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> signals, etc.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Connection terminals 4 and ventilating openings 5 are provided on a side of the device. To the connection terminals 4 can be connected cables from various video apparatuses such as a computer, a DVD player, and can be input image signals. Further, air is exchanged between the outside via ventilating openings 5 with an internal fan. In this way, a lamp, an optical system, etc., in a casing are cooled.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a diagram for illustrating an example of an arrangement of the image projecting device and is a side view of a conference room or the like.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">An image projecting device 10 is a projector with an ordinary focal distance which is illustrated for the sake of the comparison. In the case of the ordinary focal distance, it is necessary to provide the image projecting device 10 at a place (near a center of a table 8 in the illustrated example) which is a relatively long distance away from the screen 6. To the contrary, the image projecting device 10 according to the embodiment can be provided at a place (on a stage 9 in the illustrated example) near the screen 6 because of a shorter focal distance.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the case of the ordinary image projecting device 10, it is necessary to reserve installation space on the table 8. Further, since a presenter performs an explanation standing in front of the screen 6, there are problems that the presenter perceives glare by the projected light from the image projecting device 10 and the projected light is blocked by a part of the body of the presenter and thus a part of the projected image is not visible. Further, since an attendant of the conference or the like sits around the table 8, the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> heat and the noise from the image projecting device 10 may annoy the attendant.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the case of the image projecting device 1, the image projecting device 1 is provided near the screen 6, so that it is not necessary to reserve the installation space on the table 8. Further, since the presenter can perform the explanation standing in front of the image projecting device 1, the presenter does not perceive glare by the projected light and does not block the projected light. Since the image projecting device 1 is away from the attendant, the heat and the noise don't annoy the attendant. Further, since the image projecting device 1 has a vertical configuration, the installation space can be reduced. The image projecting device 1 can have a vertical configuration with a further increased height, thereby further reducing the installation space.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">However, such a vertical configuration increases a probability of toppling in comparison with a horizontal configuration. If a toppling direction is divided broadly, the toppling direction can be a direction A to a side of the screen 6 or an opposite direction B to a side of the table 8.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">If the image projecting device topples in the direction B, there is a probability that the projected light impinges on the attendant. For this reason, it is desired that the projection is stopped immediately. On the other hand, if the image projecting device topples in the direction A, since the projected light impinges on the wall, it is not necessary to stop the projection.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In general, it takes time for the projector to resume the projection after the projection has been stopped. For this reason, in terms of increasing convenience for users, it is better to continue the projection except for<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> necessary cases.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">However, if the projection is continued while the image projecting device 1 remains toppled, the temperature inside the device becomes high, which causes parts to become disabled. A cooling mechanism of the image projecting device is designed based on a promise that the image projecting device is in its normal operating status, and thus the cooling mechanism does not work normally in statuses other than the normal operating status. For this reason, even if the projection is continued in the toppled status, it may be better to stop the projection if the toppled status continues for more than a predetermined time.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a diagram for illustrating an example of a hardware configuration of the image projecting device 1 according to the first embodiment.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The image projecting device 1 includes a lamp 104, an illumination optical system 103, an optical modulator 102 and a projection optical system 101.
