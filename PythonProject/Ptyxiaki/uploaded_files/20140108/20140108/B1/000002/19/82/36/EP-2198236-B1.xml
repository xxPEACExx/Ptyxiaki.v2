The bullet proof vests include bullet resistance armor.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The bulletproof vests for military operations worn by soldiers are heavier than the bulletproof vests worn by others like police or security guard because the soldiers need protection from powerful bullets from rifle or machine gun. The soldiers, according to mission, may also require various accessories such as pouches, magazines, water carrier, medical kit, small portable walkie-talkie sets and the like which can be positioned or fixed on the bullet proof vest as per the convenience of the soldier. The various accessories positioned on the bullet proof vest make the bullet proof vest heavy. During various emergency military operations such as, evacuation, running fast in forest or going through water, it will be necessary to quickly separate the vest from the body of the soldier for either better efficiency or to save his life.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">An example of such a quickly releasable vest is described in document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2006017332A"><text>JP 2006/017332A</text></patcit>, which forms a starting point for the current invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Thus there is a need for a vest that is capable of being separated easily from a torso portion of a user.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the prior art, the general purpose of the present invention is to provide a quickly releasable vest configured to include all the advantages of the prior art, and to overcome the drawbacks inherent therein.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a quickly releasable vest, which is capable of being dressed in and separated easily by a user.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a quickly re!easable vest, which is capable of being used by the persons such as soldiers, police, security guards and the like involved in military and other tactical operations.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a quickly releasable vest, which is capable of protecting at least a torso portion of a user.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Accordingly, the present invention provides a quickly releasable vest capable of protecting a torso portion of a user.
