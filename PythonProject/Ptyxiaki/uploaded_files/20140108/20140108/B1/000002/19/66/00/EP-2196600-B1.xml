num="0001">The present invention relates to a reinforcing bar binding machine for binding reinforcing bars by feeding out a wire that is pulled out of a wire reel from a guide portion provided at a distal end of a binding machine main body to a periphery of the reinforcing bars so as to turn thereround in a loop-like fashion and twisting the wire.</p><heading id="h0003">&lt;BACKGROUND ART&gt;</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><p id="p0002" num="0002">In the conventional reinforcing bar binding machine, as is shown in Patent Documents 1, 2, curl guides are disposed vertically for applying a curling-tendency on a wire to curl the wire. A movable curl guide is provided so as to be opened and closed, and by the movable curl guide being designed to be opened and closed, a construction is enabled in which reinforcing bar which are bound together are easily removed from a binding machine main body. In addition, the opening and closing construction has a function as a safety device. When the movable curl guide is opened, it is judged that the finger or fingers of the operator or a tool is placed between the curl guides for maintenance or an abnormal state is occurring in which something jams, and the binding machine is designed not to operate. Since an opening or closing signal of the movable curl guide is sent to the binding machine main body, an opening becomes necessary which links an interior with an exterior of the binding machine main body. In addition, since a sensor for detecting the movable curl guide is disposed in the interior of the binding machine main body so as not<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> to be influenced by dust, impact and disturbance, a signal is transmitted from the exterior to the interior of the binding machine main body by a mechanical means. Because of this, a relatively large opening is formed in a signal transmission portion of the binding machine main body.

However, when initializing is implemented, a wire is twisted to be cut or a wire reel becomes empty, there occurs from time to time a case in which a small piece of wire falls in the movable curl guide. Since when the curl guide is opened, an opening is produced between the movable curl guide and the curl guide cover, the cut small piece of wire sometimes enters the interior of the binding machine main body. In addition, since a total closure is not always provided between the movable curl guide and the curl guide cover but a small gap is formed therebetween, when the binding machine is used while being oriented upwards or when a jamming wire is attempted to be removed, there occurs from time to time a case in which the cut small piece of wire slides down on the movable curl guide to enter the interior<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> of the binding machine main body from the gap.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the event that the wire piece enters the binding machine main body, there is a possibility that a problem is caused that the wire piece gets stuck in a movable part, the wire piece enters the interior of a motor to lock the motor, or the detection by a magnetic sensor is delayed, leading to an operation failure of the reinforcing bar binding machine.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><p id="p0005" num="0005">According to one or more embodiments of the invention, there is provided a reinforcing bar binding machine comprising a mechanism for preventing a foreign matter such as a small piece of wire which happens to fall on a movable curl guide from entering an interior of a binding machine main body in<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> an ensured fashion.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to one or more embodiments of the invention, a reinforcement binding machine is provided with a fixed curl guide 5 for applying a curling-tendency on a wire and feeding out the wire downwards, a movable curl guide 10 which is mounted in an opening 14 formed at a lower portion in a binding machine main body 2 at a base portion thereof via a pivot 15 so as to rotate about the pivot 15 relative to the binding machine main body 2 and adapted to receive the wire sent from the fixed curl guide 5 side to guide again the wire so received towards the fixed curl guide 5 lying thereabove, and a cover portion 27 provided between the movable curl guide 10 and an upper surface portion 16 of the opening 14, so as to close a gap between the base portion of the movable curl guide 10 and the upper surface portion 16 of the opening 14 at all times.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the construction described above, the base portion of the movable curl guide is provided in the opening formed at the lower portion of the binding machine main body via the pivot so as to rotate downwards and the cover portion is formed for covering the gap between the base portion of the movable curl guide and the upper surface portion of the opening at all times, whereby a foreign matter such as a small piece of wire which happens to fall on the movable curl guide from entering an interior of the binding machine main body<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> in an ensured fashion, irrespective of the rotation of the movable curl guide.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A sectional shape of the cover portion 27 which is normal to the pivot 15 may be formed into an arc-like shape which is centered at the pivot 15.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the construction described above, since the cover portion is formed into the arc-like shape in section which is centered at the pivot, when the movable curl guide rotates, the cover can close the gap between the base portion of the movable curl guide and the upper surface portion of the opening continuously at all times.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The cover portion 27 may be formed into a bellows-like shape.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the construction described above, since the cover portion is formed into the bellows-like shape, even though the gap between the base portion of the movable curl guide and the upper surface portion of the opening is increased or decreased as the movable curl guide rotates, the cover portion can cover the gap at all times accordingly.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The cover portion may be formed integral with or separate from the movable curl guide.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the construction described above, since the cover portion is formed integral with or separate from the movable curl guide, in the event that the cover portion cannot be formed integrally due to a problem with molding or difference in material, the cover portion may be formed as a separate element from the movable curl guide, whereas in the event that the cover portion can be formed integral with the movable curl guide, they may be formed integral with each other.

A wire reel (not shown) round which a wire 4 is wound is installed in an accommodation chamber 3 provided in a binding machine main body 2 of the reinforcing bar binding machine 1. The wire 4 is sent to a fixed curl guide 5 provided at a distal end of the binding machine main body 2 while rotating the wire reel, the wire 4 is applied a curling-tendency by the fixed curl guide 5 so as to curl round reinforcing bars 6 so as to turn round the periphery thereof, a proximal side of the wire 4 is cut, and the portion of the wire so turned round is twisted, whereby the reinforcing bars 6 are bound together.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A guide tube 7 through which the wire 4 pulled out of the wire reel is passed is provided in the binding machine main body 2. An end of the guide tube 7 is made to open to the accommodation chamber 3, and the other end is made to open<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> to a base portion of the fixed curl guide 5. A pair of feeding gears (not shown) is installed in the guide tube 7 at an intermediate portion along the length thereof as a feeding device of the wire 4. The wire 4 is held between the gears and is designed to be fed out by the rotation of the gears.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">When a switch is ON by a trigger 8, an electric motor rotates, which rotates the wire feeding gears. Then, the wire 4 wound round the wire reel accommodated in the accommodation chamber is fed out to the front of the binding machine main body 2 through the guide tube 7.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The fixed curl guide 5 and a movable curl guide 10 are disposed at a front end of the binding machine main body so as to project therefrom, and the fixed curl guide 5 applies the curling-tendency on the wire 4 sent from the wire reel to feed it out downwards, while the movable curl guide 10 guides the wire 4 sent thereto by the fixed curl guide 5 to return again to a predetermined position on the fixed curl guide 5 lying thereabove. A distal end of the fixed curl guide 5 is curved into an arc-like shape, and the wire 4 is applied the curling-tendency thereat so as to turn circumferentially round the reinforcing bars 6 in a loop-like fashion between the movable curl guide 10 and the fixed curl guide 5.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A wire cutting device (not shown) is installed in the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> fixed curl guide 5. The wire cutting device cuts the wire when a feeding-out amount of the wire 4 reaches a predetermined amount.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A wire twisting unit 11 is installed in an interior of the binding machine main body 2, and a twisting hook 12 is provided at a distal end portion of the wire twisting unit 11.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the wire twisting unit 11, the hook 12 is pivotally attached to a sleeve 13 so as to be opened and closed freely, and the sleeve 13 is caused to advance forwards by an electric motor 9 so that the hook 12 is closed, whereby the wire 4 which is turned round the periphery of the reinforcing bars 6 in the loop-like fashion is gripped by the hook 12. The hook 12 is rotated together with the sleeve 13 so as to twist the wire 4, whereby the reinforcing bars 6 are bound together. Thereafter, the hook 12 is rotated in a reverse direction, and the sleeve 13 is withdrawn so as to be detached from the wire 4 for return to its initial position. The wire 4 is twisted as the sleeve 13 advances forwards after the wire has been cut.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The rotation of the feeding gears, cutting of the wire 4, operation of the wire twisting unit 11 and the like are sequence controlled by a control circuit, not shown. The control<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> circuit also measures a feeding mount of the wire 4 based on a rotating amount of the feeding gears.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Incidentally, as is shown in detail in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2(a), 2(b)</figref> and 10, the movable curl guide 10 is provided in an opening 14 formed at a lower portion of the binding machine main body via a pivot so as to rotate downwards so that work such as maintenance work can easily be performed.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The opening 14 is formed to open at a central portion of a front wall 17 which makes up the lower portion of the binding machine main body, and an upper surface portion 16 is made up of a concave surface portion 18 which is formed into an arc-like shape in section and a triangular groove-like recess portion 20 which is formed at the rear of the concave surface portion 18. A lower portion of the opening 14 is formed by an erect wall 21 which makes up a lower portion of the front wall 17.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>, a guide groove 22 is formed at a front portion of the movable curl guide 10 so as to be widened in width at a front end thereof, and a plate-like portion 23 is formed at a rear portion thereof. Guide members 24 are formed to be erected on the plate-like portion 23, and these guide members 24 are situated on both sides of a base portion of the guide groove 22 to guide the wire 4 so as not to wobble.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> Erected edges 25 are formed on both sides of the plate-like portion 23. Distal ends of the erected edges 25 are made integral with the guide members 24. Base portions 25a of the erected edges 25 are formed into an arc-like shape. Bearing holes 26 are formed in central portions of the base portions 25a. An abutment piece 33 is formed at the rear of one of the erected edges 25 so as to extend therefrom.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A cover portion 27 is disposed at an upper portion of a base portion of the movable curl guide 10. This cover portion 27 is made up of a cover main body 28 having an arc-like shape in section, a lower wall piece 30 which is formed to be suspended from a lower portion of a front end of the cover main body 28 and side pieces 31 which are bent to the rear from both side edges of the lower wall piece 30. A spring receiving groove 29 is formed at a rear end of the cover main body 28, and bearing holes 32 are formed in the side pieces 31. A central portion of the arc of the cover main body 28 is formed to be centers of the bearing holes 32.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The cover portion 27 is disposed on the plate-like portion 23 of the movable curl guide 10 together with a torsion coil spring 34 and is connected thereto by a pivot 15 which is inserted into both the bearing holes 26, 32. The side piece 31 and the abutment piece 33 are brought into abutment with each other on the plate-like portion 23. Consequently, as is shown in<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)</figref>, the cover portion 27 rotates together with the movable curl guide 10 at all times.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Incidentally, thepivot 15 is supported rotatably by bearing portions (not shown) which are provided on both sides of an interior of the opening 14 of the binding machine main body, and one end 34a of the torsion coil spring 34 projects from the spring receiving groove 29 in the cover portion 27 so as to be brought into engagement with the recess portion 20 on the upper surface portion 16 of the opening 14. The other end 34b is brought into engagement with an upper surface of the plate-like portion 23. Although a distal end side of the movable curl guide 10 is biased so as to rotate upwards by the configuration described above, for example, since an end face or a rear portion of the plate-like portion 23 is brought into abutment with the lower portion of the opening 14, the movable curl guide 10 is stopped to stand still in that position, and the movable curl guide 10 can be rotated downwards against the spring force of the torsion coil spring 34.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">According to the configuration described above, the cover portion 27 closes a gap between the base portion of the movable curl guide 10 and the upper surface portion 16 of the opening 14 at all times. Then, when the movable curl guide 10 is rotated downwards for some reason, the cover portion 27 is also rotated at the same time as is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2(b)</figref>. Since the cover<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> main body 28 is formed into the arc-like shape in section, the gap between the upper surface 16 and the opening 14 is kept closed. (As this occurs, the cover main body 28 and the upper surface portion 16 may be dimensioned so as to be brought into sliding contact with each other.) Consequently, since the gap is kept closed at all times from before to after the rotation of the movable curl guide 10, a foreign matter 35 such as a small piece of wire which happens to fall on the movable curl guide 10 can be prevented from entering an interior of the binding machine main body in an ensured fashion.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The cover portion 27 only has to be configured to close the gap at all times from before to after the rotation of the movable curl guide 10. Consequently, the invention is not limited to the form that has been described above. For example, as is shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)</figref>, a cover portion 27 may be configured to have a bellows-like shape.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In this case, too, when the movable curl guide 10 is rotated downwards, the cover portion 27 extends. Consequently, even in the event that as the movable curl guide 10 rotates, the gap between the plate-like portion 23 at the base portion of the movable curl guide 10 and the upper surface portion 16 of the opening 14 is increased or decreased, the gap can be closed at all times accordingly.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> As is shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figs. 7</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0008">8</figref>, a cover main body 28 of a cover portion 27 may be made of an elastic material, and the cover main body 28 may be configured so that a front half portion is formed as a curved portion 28a having an arc-like shape in section and a rear half portion is formed as a wavy portion 28b having flexibility. In this case, too, even in the event that as the movable curl guide 10 rotates, the gap between the plate-like portion 23 at the base portion of the movable curl guide 10 and the upper surface portion 16 of the opening 14 is increased or decreased, the gap can be closed at all times accordingly.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Further, the cover portion does not have to be formed as the separate element from the movable curl guide as described in the embodiments. If possible, both the members may be formed integral with each other. Alternatively, both the members are formed separate from each other and may then be made integral with each other by welding or the like.</p><heading id="h0007">&lt;Description of Reference Numerals&gt;</heading><p id="p0034" num="0034">2 binding machine main body; 5 fixed curl guide; 10 movable curl guide; 33 abutment piece; 14 opening; 15 pivot; 16 upper surface portion; 27 cover portion.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56984660" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Bewehrungsstabbindemaschine umfassend:
