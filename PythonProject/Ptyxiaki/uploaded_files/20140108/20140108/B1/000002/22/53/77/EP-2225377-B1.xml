In particular, this invention relates to oligomeric compounds (oligomers), which target the androgen receptor mRNA in a cell, leading to reduced expression of the androgen receptor. Reduction of androgen receptor expression is beneficial for a range of medical disorders, such as cancer, particularly prostate cancer or breast cancer.</p><heading id="h0002">RELATED CASES</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) of <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US99012507P"><text>U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/990,125 filed November 26, 2007</text></patcit>.</p><heading id="h0003">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">The androgen receptor (AR) is a type of nuclear receptor which is activated by binding of either of the androgenic hormones testosterone or dihydrotestosterone. The main function of the androgen receptor is as a DNA binding transcription factor which regulates gene expression. However the androgen receptor also has additional functions independent of DNA binding. The androgen receptor is most closely related to the progesterone receptor, and progestins in higher dosages can block the androgen receptor.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Whilst in humans the AR gene is single copy and found on the X chromosome at position Xq11-12, the receptor itself exists in two iso-forms (A and B). AR-A is an 87kDa protein which lacks the first 187 amino acids (N-terminal truncation). Isoform AR-B is the full length 110 kDa version.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The binding of androgen to the androgen receptor induces a conformational change to the receptor, resulting in a dissociation of heat shock proteins, dimerization and transport from the cytosol to the cell nucleus where the androgen receptor dimer binds to specific DNA sequences - referred to as hormone response elements. Depending on the interaction with other nuclear proteins, the AR controls gene expression, either increasing or decreasing transcription of specific genes, such as insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1).<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Androgen receptors can also have cytoplasmic activities though with signal transduction proteins in the cytoplasm. Androgen binding to cytoplasmic androgen receptors can cause rapid changes in cell function independent of gene transcription, for example ion transport, as well as indirect influence of gene transcription, for example via mediating other signal transduction pathways, thereby influencing the activity of other transcription factors.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The over-expression of androgen receptor, or expression of mutated androgen receptor genes has been indicated in several diseases, such as cancer, including prostate cancer and breast cancer, as well as other disorders such as polyglutamate disease (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Monks et al., PNAS November 2 2007</text></nplcit>, published on line) alopecia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, spinal and muscular atrophy and Kennedy disease.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO9711170A"><text>WO97/11170</text></patcit> reports on a method of treating a patient diagnosed as having benign prostatic hyperplasia or a prostate cancer comprising administering an antisense oligonucleotide which selectively hybridises to the androgen receptor mRNA.

The term "oligomer" in the context of the present description, refers to a molecule formed by covalent linkage of two or more nucleotides (<i>i.e.</i> an oligonudeotide). Herein, each single nucleotide, such as the nucleotides present in the oligomer of the description, may also be referred to as a "monomer" or "unit". In some embodiments, the oligomer consists or comprises of a contiguous nucleotide sequence of between 10 - 30 nucleotides in length (<i>i.e.</i> comprises or consists of from 10 - 30 covalently linked monomers).</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In various embodiments, the compound of the description does not comprise RNA (units). In various embodiments, the compounds according to the description are linear molecules or are synthesised as a linear molecule. The oligomer, in such embodiments, is a single stranded molecule, and typically does not comprise short regions of, for example, at least 3, 4 or 5 contiguous nucleotides, which are complementary to another region within the same oligomer (<i>i.e.</i> duplexes) - in this regards, In some embodiments, the oligomer is not (essentially) double stranded. In some embodiments, the oligomer is essentially not double stranded, such as is not a siRNA. In various embodiments, the oligomer of the description may consist entirely of the contiguous nucleotide region. Thus, the oligomer is not substantially self-complementary. siRNAs comprise of 2 complementary short RNA (or equivalent nucleobase units) sequences, such as between 21 and 23nts long, with, typically a 2nt 3' overhang on either end. In order to enhance in vivo uptake, the siRNAs may be conjugated, such as conjugated to a sterol, such as a cholesterol group (typically at the 3' or 5' termini of one or both of the strands).<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The description further provides target sequences in the AR mRNA or gene, or an allelic variant thereof, in particular those corresponding to SEQ ID NOS: 2 - 22, wherein antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to said target sequences are capable of down-regulating AR. For example, target sequences which correspond to the antisense oligonucleotide sequences SEQ ID NOS: 2 - 22, respectively, are shown in <figref idrefs="f0009 f0010">Figure 4</figref> (bold and underlined, with the corresponding oligo SEQ ID NOS indicated above). Variant sequences, for example but not limited to allelic variants (such as a (AR) gene present at gene locus Xq11-12) of such target sequences are also within the scope of the description. A variant sequence may have at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95% sequence homology to a target sequence in AR.

The sequence of a mature mRNA can be derived directly from<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> the corresponding cDNA sequence with thymine bases (T) being replaced by uracil bases (U).</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">It should be recognised that the Androgen Receptor gene in humans does show a degree of allelic variation, and several of the polymorphisms are associated with disease phenotypes (Mooney et al, NAR 15; 31(8) 2003). For example, a CAG repeat expansion is associated with polyglutamine expansion disorder, other characterised allelic variants include a (GGC)n trinucleotide repeat and R726L, T887A and L710H single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified, and the latter two have been shown to be correlated to enhanced promiscuity of the AR receptor for other steroid ligands. In one embodiment n may range from between 5 and 31. CAG repeats of less than 22 have been associated with an enhanced risk of prostate cancer in African American males, and this may therefore be a preferred allelic variant.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In some embodiments, the target nucleic acid is an AR allelic variant which comprises one or more single nucleotide polymorphisms, including R726L, T887A and L710H.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Therefore, in some embodiments, the target is an AR allelic variant which comprises a (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat, or (GGC)n trinucleotide repeat.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The nucleic acid which encodes the mammalian androgen receptor is, in a preferable embodiment, the human androgen receptor cDNA sequence is shown as SEQ ID NO 1 and/or the mouse androgen receptor cDNA sequence is shown as SEQ ID NO 81, or allelic variants thereof. The oligomer according to the invention is an antisense oligonucleotide.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Therefore, 'the target' of the oligomer according to the invention is the androgen receptor mRNA. The oligomer when introduced into the cell which is expressing the androgen receptor gene, results in reduction of the androgen receptor mRNA level, resulting in reduction in the level of expression of the androgen receptor in the cell.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The androgen receptor is known to regulate the expression of several genes, such as a gene selected from the group consisting of Protein kinase C delta (PRKCD), Glutathione S- transferase theta 2 (GSTT2), transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 3 (TRPV3), Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) or ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) - such genes are referred to as androgen receptor targets herein, and as such, in some embodiments, the oligomers according to the invention may be used to modulate the expression of one or more androgen receptor targets in a cell which is expressing, or is capable of expressing (<i>i.e.</i> in the case of alleviation of repression (by the AR) of the androgen receptor target in a cell) said androgen receptor target.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The oligomers which target the androgen receptor mRNA, may hybridize to any site along the target mRNA nucleic acid, such as the 5' untranslated leader, exons, introns and 3'untranslated tail.

In this regards, the oligomer of the invention can effect the inhibition of Androgen Receptor, typically in a mammalian such as a human cell. In some embodiments, the oligomers of the invention bind to the target nucleic acid and effect inhibition of expression of at least 10% or 20% compared to the normal expression level, more preferably at least a 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95% inhibition as compared to the normal expression level (such as immediately prior to dosing of the oligomer). In some embodiments, such modulation is seen when using between 0.04 and 25nM, such as between 0.8 and 20nM concentration of the compound of the invention. In the same or a different embodiment, the inhibition of expression is less than 100%, such as less than 98% inhibition, less than 95% inhibition, less than 90% inhibition, less than 80% inhibition, such as less than 70% inhibition. Modulation of expression level may be determined by measuring protein levels, <i>e.g.</i> by the methods such as SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting using suitable antibodies raised against the target protein. Alternatively, modulation of expression levels can be determined by measuring levels of mRNA, <i>e.g.</i> by northern blotting or quantitative RT-PCR. When measuring via mRNA levels, the level of down-regulation when using an appropriate dosage, such as between 0.04 and 25nM, such as between 0.8 and 20nM concentration, is, in some embodiments, typically to a level of between 10-20% the normal levels in the absence of the compound of the invention.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The description therefore provides a method of down-regulating or inhibiting the expression of the androgen receptor protein and/or mRNA in a cell which is expressing the androgen receptor protein and/or mRNA, said method comprising administering or contacting the oligomer or conjugate according to the invention (suitably in an effective amount) to said cell to down-regulating or inhibiting the expression of the androgen receptor protein and/or mRNA in said cell.
