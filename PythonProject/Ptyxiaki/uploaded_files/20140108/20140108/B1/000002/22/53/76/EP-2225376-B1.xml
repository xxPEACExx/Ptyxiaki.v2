PI3K comprises a large and complex family that includes 3 classes with multiple subunits and isoforms. The class I P13Ks are composed of a Src homology-2 domain-containing an 85 kDa regulatory subunit (p85) and a 100-kDa catalytic subunit (p110), which catalyses the phosphorylation of phosphoinositol 4-phosphate and phosphoinisitol 4,5-phosphate at their D3 positions. The PI3K regulatory subunits include p85alpha and its truncated splice variants p50alpha and p55alpha, as well as p85beta and p55gamma; the catalytic subunits include p110alpha, p110beta, and p110delta. The human catalytic subunit p110alpha is encoded by the PIK3CA gene, located on the human chromosome 3 [Chr 3: 180.35 - 180.44 M bp] specifically [chr3:180,349,005-180,435,191 bp](NCBI reference sequence annotation) (3q26.3), which is frequently mutated in a variety of human cancers; PIK3CA has been shown to be mutated in 32% of colorectal cancer, 27% of glioblastomas, 25% of gastric cancers, 36% of hepatocellular carcinomas, 18-40% of breast cancers, 4-12% of ovarian cancers and 4% of lung cancers (Samuels et al., 2006). Most of the mutations found map to three mutational hotspots within<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the PIK3CA coding sequence, known as E542K, E545K and H1047R (Kang et al., 2005). A comprehensive map of detected PIK3CA mutations and their prevalence in different human tissues can be found on<br/>

The term "oligomer" in the context of the present invention, refers to a molecule formed by covalent linkage of two or more nucleotides (<i>i.e</i>. an oligonucleotide). Herein, each single nucleotide, such as the nucleotides present in the oligomer of the invention, may also be referred to as a "monomer" or "unit". In some embodiments, the oligomer may consist or comprises of a contiguous nucleotide sequence of between 10 - 30 nucleotides in length (<i>i.e</i>. comprises or consists of from 10 - 30 covalently linked monomers).</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In various embodiments, the compounds according to the description are linear molecules or are synthesised as a linear molecule. The oligomer, in such embodiments, is a single stranded molecule, and typically does not comprise short regions of, for example, at least 3, 4 or 5 contiguous nucleotides, which are complementary to another region within the same oligomer (<i>i.e</i>. duplexes) - in this regards, In some embodiments, the oligomer is not (essentially) double stranded. In some embodiments, the oligomer is essentially not double stranded, such as is not a siRNA. In various embodiments, the oligomer of the description may consist entirely of the contiguous nucleotide region. Thus, the oligomer is not substantially self-complementary. siRNAs comprise of 2 complementary short RNA (or equivalent nucleobase units) sequences, such as between 21 and 23nts long, with, typically a 2nt 3' overhang on either end. In order to enhance <i>in vivo</i> uptake, the siRNAs may be conjugated, such as conjugated to a sterol, such as a cholesterol group (typically at the 3' or 5' termini of one or both of the strands).</p><heading id="h0008"><b><i>The Target</i></b></heading><p id="p0038" num="0038">Suitably the oligomer of the invention is capable of down-regulating expression of the PIK3CA gene. In this regards, the oligomer of the invention can effect the inhibition of PIK3CA, typically in a mammalian such as a human cell. In some embodiments, the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> oligomers of the invention bind to the target nucleic acid and effect inhibition of expression of at least 10% or 20% compared to the normal expression level, more preferably at least a 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95% inhibition as compared to the normal expression level (such as immediatley prior to dosing of the oligomer). In some embodiments, such modulation is seen when using between 0.04 and 25nM, such as between 0.8 and 20nM concentration of the compound of the invention. In the same or a different embodiment, the inhibition of expression is less than 100%, such as less than 98% inhibition, less than 95% inhibition, less than 90% inhibition, less than 80% inhibition, such as less than 70% inhibition. Modulation of expression level may be determined by measuring protein levels, e.g. by the methods such as SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting using suitable antibodies raised against the target protein. Alternatively, modulation of expression levels can be determined by measuring levels of mRNA, e.g. by northern blotting or quantitative RT-PCR. When measuring via mRNA levels, the level of down-regulation when using an appropriate dosage, such as between 0.04 and 25nM, such as between 0.8 and 20nM concentration, is, in some embodiments, typically to a level of between 10-20% the normal levels in the absence of the compound of the invention.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The PIK3CA gene is likely to be a naturally occurring gene, and therefore in relation to the human gene it will have the sequence of SEQ ID NO 1 or a natural variant thereof, whether a "silent" (e.g. not associated with a disease or other alteration in PIK3CA kinase properties) or "functional" (e.g. disease-associated) variant. The target sequence from the PIK3CA gene will be DNA or RNA, preferably mRNA. The oligomer hybridizes, such as specifically hybridises or hybridises under stringent conditions, to a single stranded nucleic acid molecule having the sequence of a portion of SEQ ID NO: 1.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">It will be noted that, in some embodiment, some oligomers are capable of targeting both PIK3CA and beta-catenin.

Suitably the cell is a mammalian cell such as a human cell. The administration may occur, in some embodiments, <i>in vitro.</i> The administration may occur in some embodiments, <i>in vivo.</i><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The term "target nucleic acid", as used herein refers to the DNA or RNA encoding mammalian PIK3CA polypeptide, such as human PIK3CA, such as SEQ ID NO: 1.

In some embodiments, for example when used in research or diagnostics the "target nucleic acid" may be a cDNA or a synthetic oligonucleotide derived from the above DNA or RNA nucleic acid targets. The oligomer according to the invention is preferably capable of hybridising to the target nucleic acid. It will be recognised that SEQ ID NO: 1 is a cDNA sequences, and as such, corresponds to the mature mRNA target sequence, although uracil is replaced with thymidine in the cDNA sequences.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The mammalian PIK3CA kinase is preferably selected from the group consisting of human or mouse PIK3CA kinase.

Typically, when referring to "naturally occurring variants" of a polynucleotide the term also may encompass any allelic variant of the PIK3CA encoding genomic DNA which are found at the Chromosome 3 [Chr 3: 180.35 - 180.44 M bp] specifically [chr3:180,349,005-180,435,191 bp](NCBI reference sequence annotation) (3q26.3) by chromosomal translocation or duplication, and the RNA, such as mRNA derived therefrom. "Naturally occurring variants" may also include variants derived from alternative splicing of the PIK3CA mRNA. When referenced to a specific polypeptide sequence, e.g., the term also includes naturally occurring forms of the protein which may therefore be processed, e.g. by co- or post-translational modifications, such as signal peptide cleavage, proteolytic cleavage, glycosylation, etc. Variant sequences, may have at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95% sequence homology to a target sequence in PIK3CA.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> Typically, an oligomer of the invention corresponding to said variant sequences is still capable of down-regulating PIK3CA.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Particularly relevant variants of PIK3CA which may be targeted by the oligomers of the invention are spontaneous point mutations which are related to hyperproliferative diseases such as cancer - in this regards, point mutations which cause amino acid substitutions at positions E542, E545 or H1047, such as point mutations which cause the substitutions E542K, E545K and H1047R are particularly relevant. By designing oligomers which target PIK3CA mRNA which comprises such a spontaneous mutation, oligomers can be created which have a preferential activity (down-regulation) on the mRNA of variant (mutated) form of PIK3CA, which, as in the case of point mutations which cause amino acid substitutions at positions E542, E545 or H1047 are associated with a cancer phenotype.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In some embodiments, the PIK3CA gene or mRNA target comprises a single base substitution at a position which corresponds to position 1781, 1790 or 3297 of SEQ ID NO 1.

As shown in Table 4, oligonucleotides of SEQ ID NOs: 57, 60, 64, 67, 70, 74, 77, 82, 87, 90 and 96 demonstrated about 90% or greater inhibition of PIK3CA mRNA expression at 20 nM in PC3 and MCF7 cells in these experiments and are therefore preferred.<br/>
Also preferred are oligonucleotides based on the illustrated antisense oligo sequences, for example varying the length (shorter or longer) and/or nucleobase content (e.g. the type and/or proportion of analogue units), which also provide good inhibition of PIK3CA expression.</p><heading id="h0032"><b><i>Example 9</i>:</b><i>In vitro analysis</i>: <i>Effecf of Antisense Inhibition of Human PIK3CA mRNA</i><u><i>on</i> cell <i>proliferafion (MTS assay)</i>.</u></heading><p id="p0250" num="0250">MCF7 breast cancer, PC3 prostate cancer and HCT116 colon cancer cells were treated with oligonucleotide using the cationic liposome formulation LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as transfection vehicle.

In HCT116 cells, oligonucleotides with SEQ ID NO:s 57, 60, 67, 77 and 82 inhibited the proliferation. The cell line MCF7 has the E545K hot-spot mutation and HCT116 has the H1047R hot-spot mutation in the PIK3CA gene, which makes them more dependent on PIK3CA signalling than the PC3 cell line which has no reported hot-spot mutation in the gene. The hot-spot mutations are activating mutations.</p><heading id="h0033"><i><b>Example 10:</b> In vitro analysis: Effect on Caspase-3</i>/<i>7 induction after antisense inhibition of PIK3CA in human cancer cell lines</i></heading><p id="p0251" num="0251">PC3 prostate cancer and HCT116 colon cancer cells were treated with oligonucleotide using the cationic liposome formulation LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as transfection vehicle.
