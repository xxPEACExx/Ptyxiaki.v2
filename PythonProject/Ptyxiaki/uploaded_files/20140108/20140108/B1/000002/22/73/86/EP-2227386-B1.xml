For example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6350709B"><text>U.S. Patent 6,350,709</text></patcit> discloses a textile substrate having a polymeric film, such as polyamide, polyolefin, or polyurethane laminated thereto. This textile substrate may be woven of nylon, polyester, or other synthetic fibers. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6350709B"><text>U.S. Patent 6,350,709</text></patcit> also discloses a method for heat sealing sheets of the laminated material to form an automotive air bag.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">When forming structures from materials having a thermoplastic layer thereon, bonds may be formed by placing materials between dies and applying energy. The polymeric films may be bonded through melting and curing.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">In one embodiment of the present invention, an article having a bond with increased strength is described. An article is described comprising two layers of dissimilar average peel strengths bonded together wherein a reinforcing component is bonded to the layer having a lower average peel strength. Bonds of the present invention are strong and durable.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In one embodiment, an article is described in which a first material having a thermoplastic polymer, and a second material having an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) laminate, are joined by a welded bond. The ePTFE laminate of the second material comprises an ePTFE membrane and a textile layer. A reinforcing component, such as a polyurethane, is disposed on a portion of a surface of the second material to form a reinforcing region. The reinforcing component<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> disposed on the second material is welded to the thermoplastic polymer of the first material to form a bond joining the first and second materials.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The reinforcing component is bonded to the second material for a distance beyond the area of the welded bond that joins the first and second materials. The reinforcing component is bonded to the second material beyond the welded bond to form a reinforcing region that extends in the direction of the welded bond that will be subject to a tensile load. The reinforcing region extending beyond the welded bond is sufficiently wide to increase the peel strength of the article to a desired strength that is greater than the average peel strength of the weakest material. Alternatively, the reinforcing region is sufficiently wide to increase the strength of the article to a strength greater than the peel strength achieved when the reinforcing region does not extend beyond the welded bond joining the first and second materials.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">While one embodiment described herein is directed to a welded bond for bonding two layers around the peripheries to form an inflatable article, other applications can be envisioned for joining two layers of unequal peel strengths. For example, further embodiments include welded bonds for garment attachments such as pockets, patches, draw cord tunnels, and the like.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The operation of the present invention should become apparent from the following description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:

The inflatable article (1) comprises a first material (10) and a second material (20) joined at the welded seam (2). The first material (10) and second material (20) are joined around peripheries to form a cavity (50) therebetween. The inflatable article may be adapted for connection to a gas supply such that the gas flows into the cavity to inflate the article. In one embodiment (<figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>), the first material (10) comprises a thermoplastic polymer (11) and the second material (20) comprises laminate comprising expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) (23) and a knit textile layer (22).</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is a cross-sectional representation of one possible inflatable article according to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. The first material (10) comprises a thermoplastic polymer (11) such as a thermoplastic polyurethane. The second material (20) comprises a laminate of an ePTFE membrane (23) between two textile layers, an inner knit layer (22) and an outer woven layer (24). As further exemplified in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, a reinforcing component (21) such as a thermoplastic polyurethane is bonded to a portion of a textile layer (22) of the second material (20) to form a reinforcing region(3). The first thermoplastic polymer (11) is bonded to at least a portion of the reinforcing region (3) to form the welded seam (2). In one embodiment, the reinforcing component (21) is bonded to the textile layer (22) of the second material (20) substantially through the thickness of the textile layer (22) when forming a reinforcing region.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In one embodiment, the reinforcing component (21) bonded to the second material (20) forming a reinforcing region (3), extends beyond the area of the welded seam (2) in a direction subject to tensile load. In an example where the article is an inflatable article, the direction of the tensile load is the side of the article subject to inflation pressure. Thus, in this<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> embodiment, the reinforcing region (3) extends for a distance on the textile of the second material (20) beyond the width of the welded seam (2) inside of the inflatable cavity. The reinforcing region (3) extends beyond the welded seam (2), in the direction of the welded seam subject to tensile load, forming an area sufficiently greater than the welded seam to increase the strength of the welded seam joining first and second materials (10, 20).</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> illustrates an exemplary inflatable mattress (30) having parallel inflatable chambers (31) defined by welded seams capable of supporting a tensile load. <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> is a cross-sectional representation of a portion of the inflatable mattress of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>. An upper mattress surface (40) and a lower mattress surface (41) are joined by ribs (43) comprising a first material (10) to form the inflatable chambers (31). The upper mattress surface (40) comprises a second material (20), and the first and second materials (10, 20) are joined at welded seams (2). Reinforcing components (21) are bonded to a knit textile layer (22) of the second material (20) to form reinforcing regions (3) which may extend on both sides of a rib since the weld may be subject to a tensile load on both sides upon inflation of the chambers (31). The thermoplastic polymer of the ribs (43) is welded to a portion of the reinforcing regions (3). The reinforcing region (3) bonded to the textile of the second material (20) extends beyond the area of the welded seam (2) for a sufficient distance in the direction of tensile load to increase the bond strength so that the resulting peel strength is greater than the peel strength of the first and second materials welded together in the absence of a reinforcing region extending for a distance beyond the welded seam in the direction of the tensile load, or until a desired strength is achieved.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref> illustrates a cross-section of a portion of an article having a welded seam, an example of which is further depicted in the micrograph of <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref>. A first material (10) comprises a first thermoplastic polymer (11) on a woven textile (12). The second material (20) comprises a woven layer (24), an ePTFE layer (23), and a knit layer (22). A reinforcing component (21) is bonded to the knit textile (22) of the second material (20) to form a reinforcing region (3) having a width defined approximately by line A-B of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>. To join the first (10) and second (20) materials, at least a portion of the reinforcing region (3) and the thermoplastic polymer<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> (11) of the first material are bonded together to form the welded seam (2) having a width which is defined approximately by lines C-D of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">7</figref>, where the welded seam (2) and reinforcing region (3) are formed by heat and pressure, compressed areas are seen as the layers are pressed together in the bonding process.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In one embodiment, such as an inflatable article, where both sides of a welded seam may be subject to tensile load, the ratio of the reinforcing region (3) to the welded seam (2) is measured as approximately the width of the reinforcing region (line A-B) to approximately the width of the welded seam (line C-D), calculated as approximately line A-B/line C-D (<figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">7</figref>). In embodiments where only one side of a welded seam (2) is subject to tensile load, the reinforcing region may be measured as line C-B, and the ratio of the reinforcing region to the welded seam may be measured as the approximate width of the reinforcing region (line C-B) to the approximate width of the welded seam (approximately line C-D), calculated as line C-B/line C-D (<figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">7</figref>). In either calculation, the ratio of the width of the reinforcing region to width of the welded seam should be greater than 1. In either embodiment, the ratio of the width of the reinforcing region (3) to the width of the welded seam is greater than or equal to about 1.2. In other embodiments, the ratio of the width of the reinforcing region to the width of the welded seam is greater than or equal to about 1.5, or greater than or equal to about 1.7, or greater than or equal to about 1. 9, or greater than or equal to about 2, or greater than or equal to about 2.5, or greater than or equal to about 3, or greater than or equal to about 3.5, or greater than or equal to about 4, or greater than or equal to about 4.5.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref> illustrates an example of a welded seam wherein a reinforcing component (21) is bonded to the textile layer (22) of a second material (20) to form a reinforcing region (3) that does not extend substantially beyond the welded seam (2) (defined by line a'-b' in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref>). Thus, the ratio of reinforcing region (also line a'-b') to welded seam is approximately 1.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The first material (10) comprises a first thermoplastic polymer (11) which can be a thermoplastic polyurethane. The thermoplastic polymer may be a film with or without an additional layer. The first material (10) may be a laminate comprising at least one additional layer, for example,<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the thermoplastic polymer (11) can be in the form of a film or a coating laminated to, for example, a woven, non-woven or knit textile layer (12).

The second material (20) has an average peel strength less than the average peel strength of the first material (10) when tested according to the method disclosed herein for peel strength. Briefly described, the average peel strength of the first material and the average peel strength of the second material are calculated by bonding two pieces of a first material together, bonding two pieces of a second material together, and testing and measuring the peel strength for several samples of each material according to the described method.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The reinforcing component may comprise a thermoplastic polymer, such as polyurethane, polyester, elastomer, nylon, or the like, or may be a thermosetting polymer such as a thermosetting polyurethane.

In certain applications thicker reinforcing components may be desired having a thickness greater than about .025 mm (10 mil), or greater than about 0.32 mm (12 mil). In one embodiment the reinforcing component bonds directly to ePTFE. In another embodiment, where the second material is a laminate of ePTFE and a textile layer, the reinforcing component bonds directly to the ePTFE of the second material to form a reinforcing region. In another embodiment the reinforcing component bonds to the textile layer of the second material, and in another embodiment, the reinforcing component penetrates substantially entirely through the thickness of the textile (22) of the second material (20) to form the reinforcing region (3).</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In one embodiment, a first material (10) is joined to a second material (20)<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> at a welded seam (2), and the second material has a weight of less than about 10 oz/yd<sup>2</sup> (339 g/m<sup>2</sup>).

This procedure provides a puling force that is perpendicular (tension) to the welded seam. The strain (amount of elongation) and the load at break is the output that is measured and recorded from this test protocol. The load at break is referred to herein as the peel strength.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The test samples are prepared by die cuffing a 1 inch (2.54 cm) by 6 inch (15 cm) test specimen with the welded seam parallel to the 1" wide direction. The sample is clamped at each end and then pulled at a rate of about 12 inches (31 cm) per minute until the test is completed. The test is completed when the yield point of the stress/strain curve has been exceeded or a visual defect is observed. Visual defects for completing the test include a knit fracture, separation of any layers in the composite being welded, or any fracture of the polyurethane weld itself. The seam strength is then reported as the maximum load (in pounds force) that the tested weld seams reached prior to the test being completed. The results are reported in units of pounds force per linear inch.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><heading id="h0007"><u>Average Peel Strength of Material</u></heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">To determine the average peel strength of the first and second materials, samples of each material were prepared as follows.
