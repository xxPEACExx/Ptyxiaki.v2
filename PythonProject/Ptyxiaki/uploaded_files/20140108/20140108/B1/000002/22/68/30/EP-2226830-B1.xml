A scanning electron microscope can also alter a sample by inducing a chemical reaction on the surface as the beam scans across the surface. For example, electrons in the beam can initiate a reaction of a gaseous precursor adsorbate, which can decompose to deposit material onto the surface or can etch the sample surface by combining with the surface material to form a volatile compound, which is eventually removed by the vacuum pump. The beam can also initiate a reaction directly in the sample, such as when an electron beam is used to expose a photoresist.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The resolution of electron beam processing, whether in imaging or inducing a reaction, depends in part upon the diameter of the beam as it impacts the surface. The smaller the electron beam diameter, the smaller the region from which secondary electrons will be emitted for imaging or the smaller the region that will be chemically altered.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As electrons in the primary beam impact the sample surface, they can cause the emission of other electrons, referred to as secondary electrons. The primary electrons also penetrate below the sample surface, and are backscattered from the sample. The depth of penetration and the number of backscattered electrons depend on the energy of the electrons in the primary beam and on the sample material. Backscattered electrons that return to the surface can cause the emission of additional secondary electrons, referred to as "type II" secondary electrons. Because of the scattering of the primary beam electrons in the sample, the secondary electrons and backscattered electrons are emitted from a surface area that is larger than the area of the primary beam impact, thereby reducing the resolution of electron beam processing. Secondary electron transport inside the sample prior to emission also broadens the area from which the secondary electrons are emitted from the surface.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The beam spot size is also limited by several types of aberration, the largest of which in many applications is chromatic aberration. Electrons coming from the source do<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> not all have the same energy, and the chromatic aberration occurs because the lenses in the focusing column focus electrons having different energies at different places. One way to reduce the chromatic aberration is to use a small aperture in the beam path that stops electrons that are not tightly focused, thereby eliminating electrons having energies that deviate by a certain amount from the mean beam energy. Unfortunately, as the aperture gets smaller, diffraction effects caused by the aperture increase and cause the beam to spread out. Thus, as one reduces the chromatic aberration, one increases the beam spread due to diffraction.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It has been considered that scanning electron microscopes were reaching their limits of usefulness as microstructures were produced in the sub-10 nanometer range. In "<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Does SEM Have a Future?", Semiconductor International, December 27, 2007</text></nplcit>, Senior Editor Alexander E. Braun questions whether SEMs will be useful as structures are formed having dimensions of tens of nanometer and smaller. The article suggests that the trade offs between a large convergence angle to reduce diffraction effects and a small convergence angle to reduce chromatic aberration appeared to limit the usefulness of an SEM for structures in the nanometer range. Dr. Braun suggests two alternatives to extend the usefulness of SEMs: Use of aberration correction or use of higher energies. According to Dr. Braun, aberration correctors are complex devices with forty eight or sixty four active elements, and an exceeding small depth of field. It is known that many of the settings on the numerous active elements of the correctors are specific to a particular beam condition; minor changes in the beam parameters require time-consuming adjustments of many elements. While an aberration correction can be used to obtain high resolution images in a research environment, the requirement to readjust the many elements for any change in the imaging conditions makes aberration correctors impractical for routine SEM operation.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">One proposed solution is to use helium ions, instead of electrons, because the helium ions have a shorter wavelength and therefore have smaller diffraction effects. Helium ions, however, are much heavier than electrons and cause more damage to the sample. Furthermore, helium ion microscopy is an immature technology with reliability problems that inhibit applications beyond research in light ion microscopy.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">One application for electron beams is to initiate a chemical reaction of gaseous precursor molecules adsorbed on a sample surface to etch a sample or to deposit a material on a sample. The use of a charged particle beam to initiate a chemical reaction with a precursor is referred to as "beam chemistry." For many applications, it is desirable to be able to use beam chemistry to fabricate high aspect ratio structures, that is, structures that are relatively deep or tall compared to their width. There are multiple<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> competing mechanisms inherent in the charged particle beam deposition process that tend to broaden the structures produced, thereby reducing the aspect ratio.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2005072756A1"><text>U.S. Pub.

These electrons decompose the precursor adsorbates and cause etching or deposition on the sides of structures, making holes and deposited structures wider. The literature shows numerous results pointing to improvements in aspect ratio with increasing beam energy.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The aspect ratio of structures fabricated by beam chemistry is also affected by precursor adsorbate depletion. Depletion occurs because precursor adsorbates are consumed in the chemical reactions that cause etching or deposition, and the adsorbates are replenished at a finite rate given by the local precursor arrival rate at the sample surface. Depletion affects nanostructure aspect ratios because the electron flux that causes depletion is not constant across the sample surface. The electron flux has a maximum at the electron beam axis, and decreases with increasing distance from the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> beam axis. In particular, the electron flux is typically relatively low at the sidewalls and relatively high at the top surface of a structure being grown by beam chemistry. Hence, adsorbate depletion is greatest at the top surface, as is the consequential suppression of the vertical growth rate. Preferential suppression of the vertical growth rate causes a reduction in the aspect ratio of a structure grown by beam chemistry.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Thus, the industry requires a practical system for producing fine structures using a charged particle beam.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Summary of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">An object of the invention is to provide an electron beam system for producing fine structures using a charged particle beam.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The present invention improves charged particle beam deposition and gas assisted etching by controlling adsorbate depletion, and the electron beam energy and diameter.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood.

In electron beam initiated deposition, lateral process resolution is limited by electron emission from sidewalls, which is affected by the size of the interaction volume. Applicants believe that a combination of low beam energy and adsorbate depletion control ultimately yield superior resolution for beam-induced processing.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Charged particle beam-induced growth can be thought of in terms of two components - a vertical component driven by electrons in the vicinity of the electron beam, and an undesirable horizontal component driven by electrons emitted from deposit sidewalls. Similarly, etching has an analogous vertical component, and a horizontal component driven by electrons that are emitted/reflected from the base of the pit and strike the etch pit sidewalls. The horizontal components cause broadening of the structures fabricated, limiting the resolution and aspect ratios.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The undesirable horizontal component is caused primarily by a delocalized process often referred to as "overspray". The bulk of overspray is caused by a combination of primary electrons scattered by gas molecules; backscattered and secondary electrons emitted from the sample, and recollected electrons originating at deposit or etch pit sidewalls. The use of low energy beams reduces the problem of backscattered electrons, secondary electrons, and type II secondary electrons, but enhances the contribution due to beam scatter in the gas.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Deposition and etch process rates are modulated by the extent of precursor adsorbate depletion at the sample surface. Depletion occurs because precursor adsorbates are consumed in the chemical reactions that cause etching or deposition, and the adsorbates are replenished at a finite rate given by the precursor pressure at the sample surface, and the precursor molecule sticking coefficient, adsorption time and<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> diffusion coefficient at the sample surface. Depletion can be defined by D = C/C<sub>0</sub>, where C = local adsorbate concentration and C<sub>0</sub> = C in the absence of electron irradiation. D scales directly with local electron flux, and inversely with the rate of adsorbate arrival (occurring through gas adsorption and adsorbate diffusion). The local process (etch or deposition) rate at a given point on the sample surface scales inversely with D at that point on the sample surface.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The vertical and horizontal growth rate components discussed above are driven by the local electron flux under the beam and at nanostructure sidewalls, respectively. The electron flux at the sidewalls is typically lower than under the beam, and so D is typically greater under the beam than at the sidewalls. That is, an increase in beam current has the effect of preferentially increasing D under the beam, thereby preferentially increasing the horizontal growth rate, resulting in broader structures. The preferential increase in D under the beam can be alleviated by decreasing the beam current or by increasing the precursor gas pressure near the sample surface. Both of these approaches improve the ratio of vertical to horizontal growth. However, both of these approaches have disadvantages. An increase in pressure increases the extent of electron beam scattering by the gas. The use of a low beam current has the disadvantage of a poor signal-to-noise ratio for imaging. Imaging is needed to focus the beam prior to processing. Imaging is also needed for navigation prior to processing and inspection of the structures grown by beam chemistry.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In a preferred embodiment, applicants modulate D by altering the beam current during etching or deposition. Beam current is typically controlled by changing the size of an aperture in the beam path. An aperture having a smaller hole lets less current pass by blocking electrons that are further from the beam axis. Apertures are typically formed as holes in an aperture strip that can be mechanically moved to place apertures of different sizes in the beam path. Because changing apertures typically requires mechanically moving and centering an aperture, it requires electron imaging and takes time. The beam current can also be controlled by changing the excitation of a condenser lens that controls the beam diameter in the plane of the aperture. However, a change in condenser lens excitation also alters the electron beam diameter at the sample surface, which must subsequently be re-focused by adjusting an objective lens. The latter requires electron imaging and takes time. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the beam current is controlled by using rapid blanking and unblanking of the beam, that is, interrupting the beam above the sample so as to modulate the fraction of electrons that reach the sample. By rapidly blanking and unblanking the beam, a user can control the beam current. It is<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> preferred to blank the beam in a manner that prevents the beam from sweeping across the sample as it is blanked. There are several blanking techniques that accomplish this, and those techniques are loosely referred to as "conjugate blanking" techniques. Conjugate blanking techniques include positioning electrostatic blanking plates at a crossover point of the electron beam or using double deflection to cancel out electron beam motion in the plane of the sample. Skilled persons will understand that such techniques are not perfect and some slight deflection does take place in the plane of the sample because of non-ideal, real-world phenomena such as the transit time of electrons through blanking plates and fringe electric fields around the plates.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Controlling the beam current using blanking provides several advantages:

The "effective" cross-section for a given process is a function of the secondary and backscattered electron yields, and the energy distributions of the primary, backscattered and secondary electrons. A highly focused, low energy beam is desirable for some high efficiency, high resolution processes. In general, scattering of the primary electron beam by the (precursor) gas molecules increases roughly exponentially with decreasing beam energy.

A voltage source 56 provides a potential difference between objective lens 52 and sample 54. Voltage source reduces the landing energy of electrons in the primary beam. This known technique allows the beam to travel through the column at a higher, energy with reduced dispersion, and then the beam energy is reduced as it approaches the sample. This reduces the electron interaction in the beam and therefore improves the resolution. As the electrons approach the sample, the electrons are slowed to a relatively low landing energy. Thus, the electron beam has low chromatic aberration and low landing energy, while avoiding beam spreading caused by diffraction and beam interaction. The low energy is useful for many processes, such as electron-beam induced deposition.

In step 802 a substrate is provided in a vacuum chamber including an electron beam column. In step 804, a gaseous precursor is introduced into the vacuum chamber. In step 806, the electron beam is directed toward the substrate in the presence of the precursor to initiate a reaction. In step 810, the current of the beam or the precursor pressure is modulated to control the ratio between horizontal and vertical growth. In preferred embodiments, the beam current is controlled by rapid blanking. For example, the current can be decreased to narrow the structure or increased to widen the structure as it is being formed. In step 812, the beam is removed and the gas exhausted from the vacuum chamber. While the examples above use WF<sub>6</sub> as a deposition precursor, any known deposition or etch precursor can be used. Many such precursors are known in the art.

The beam current is controlled by changing the duty cycle (d) defined as d = t/T, where T is the duration of one blank/unblank cycle, and t is the time during which the beam is active (i.e., unblanked) per cycle. Hence, d is the fraction of the current arriving at the sample surface. In general, it is desirable to enable a maximum beam current reduction of at least one order of magnitude (i.e., a duty cycle of 10<sup>-1</sup>). The corresponding values of t and T are determined by the beam current and the number of electrons on average delivered to the sample per cycle. For example, if the beam current in the absence of blanking equals 1 nA, then the values [d = 10<sup>-1</sup>, t = 1.6 ns and T = 16 ns] corresponds on average to 1 electron per pulse and a beam current of 100 pA at the sample surface. The value of t determines beam current continuity and granularity of the beam current control. Continuity and granularity degrade when each pulse delivers (on average) more than one electron to the sample. The above values of d and t are appropriate, for example, when using WF<sub>6</sub> as a deposition precursor at a pressure of about 13 mbar (about 10 mTorr), and a beam current (in the absence of blanking) of 1 nA. However, the extent of precursor adsorbate depletion at the sample surface is a strong function of the precursor species and pressure and the beam current used for beam chemistry. The duty cycle is preferably very small, that is, a very small, high frequency "beam ON" pulse per blank/unblank cycle. A very small duty cycle (whereby d approaches zero) corresponds to a very large beam current reduction. It is relatively easy to increase a very small d to increase then beam current, but more difficult to decrease it further. For the same reason, a small value of t is desirable. Hence, in a generic beam chemistry system, the minimum value of d should preferably be about 10<sup>-2</sup>, more preferably about 10<sup>-3</sup> and more preferably still about 10<sup>-4</sup>. Similarly, in a generic beam chemistry system, the minimum value of t should preferably be about 10<sup>-1</sup> ns, more preferably about 10<sup>-2</sup> ns and more preferably still about 10<sup>-3</sup> ns. The periods in which the beam is on and then off are typically very short compared to the processing time, which is typically on the order of seconds. In other words, the minimum duty cycle is preferably smaller than about 10<sup>-2</sup>, more preferably smaller than about 10<sup>-3</sup> and most preferably<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> smaller than about 10<sup>-4</sup> and t is preferably smaller than about 10<sup>-1</sup> ns, more preferably smaller than about 10<sup>-2</sup> ns and most preferably smaller than about 10<sup>-3</sup> ns.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">While <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> shows that the relative growth rate in the horizontal and vertical directions can also be controlled by controlling the adsorbate pressure, the pressure cannot be altered as quickly as the beam current. Furthermore, electron beam scatter in the gas increases with pressure. It is therefore desirable to minimize the gas pressure in order to minimize electron-gas scattering above the sample surface.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The system of Henstra provides for quick switching between high and low beam current. Under some circumstances, a high beam current will etch the underlying material while a lower beam current will result in deposition (see, for example, <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Toth et al., J. Appl. Phys. 101, 054309, 2007</text></nplcit>; and <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Lobo et al., Nanotechnology 19, 025303, 2008</text></nplcit>). Thus, a user can switch readily between etching and deposition.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In another embodiment of the invention, the electron beam induced deposition is performed with the sample cooled below room temperature, which increases the precursor residence time at the sample surface, thereby reducing the gas pressure needed for processing. The reduced gas pressure reduces scattering of the primary beam, allowing lower beam energies to be used. The lower energy electrons have a smaller interaction volume within the sample. Hence, overspray is reduced both because of reduced electron-gas scattering, and because reflected and secondary electrons come only from a volume that is closer to the beam impact point at the sample surface. In the extreme case of a very low sample temperature, such as that achieved by liquid nitrogen cooling of the sample, many precursors condense onto the sample surface, and the gas inside the SEM chamber can be evacuated prior to electron beam processing. This is advantageous in that it essentially eliminates scattering of the primary beam by gas molecules during electron beam processing.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 9</figref> shows the steps of a preferred method. In step 902, a substrate is provided in a vacuum chamber including an electron beam column. In step 904, the substrate is cooled, for example, to between about -10 °C and about - 150 °C. In step 906, a valve is opened to allow a small amount of precursor gas to flow to the work piece. At cool work piece temperatures, multiple layer of molecules can adhere to the work piece. An electron beam is then directed to the substrate to react the molecules on the substrate. The electron beam can be directed to the substrate either while the gas is flowing, or after the gas has condensed onto the substrate. The left branch of the flowchart shows that in step 908L, the electron beam is directed toward the substrate as the gas is flowing, and then the gas valve is closed in step 910L. Alternatively, as shown<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> in the right branch of the flow chart, the valve is closed in step 910R and then the electron beam is directed toward the substrate in step 908R. Closing the valve reduces the gas pressure and therefore reduces scattering of the electron beam. In optional step 912, the substrate is briefly heated, for example by resistance heating, to evaporate the unreacted precursor from regions that were not addressed by the beam. In decision block 914, a decision is made as to whether processing is complete. The process is not yet complete, the process continues with step 904. The temperature used depends on the vapor pressure of the precursor. Most known precursors have low vapor pressures between temperatures of between about -10 °C and about -150 °C.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Another aspect of the invention is the provision of an electron beam having a low chromatic aberration and low energy electron beam that provides improved resolution in various electron beam applications. The low chromatic aberration is provided as described in Henstra, while the low energy is achieved by applying a voltage to the sample to decelerate the objective lens and the sample allows the maintenance of a high beam energy in the majority of the electron column reduces spreading of the beam caused by the mutual repulsion of the electrons in the beam.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Reducing the energy of the primary beam reduces the penetration depth of the electrons, thereby shrinking the interaction area from which the secondary electrons emerge from the surface and improves resolution. Low beam energy, however, typically causes the beam to spread out more in the electron column, thereby increasing the beam spot size on impact and decreasing resolution. This is caused in part because the charged particles in the beam repel each other, and at low beam energies, the particles take more time to traverse the column and the repulsive force operates for a longer period of time on the beam, spreading the particles further apart. By having the electrons traverse the column at relatively high energy and then lose energy as they approach the sample, high resolution is maintained at low beam energies.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">While the examples above use an electron beam, other types of beams, such as a focused ion beam, could also be used. Instruments using a focused ion beam, or even a focused ion beam and a focused electron beam, are known to the skilled person per se.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">When using, for example, a focused ion beam, the impinging ions cause the formation of secondary electrons. These secondary electrons are thought to be responsible for the beam induced deposition (also known as ion beam induced deposition or IBID, as opposed to the earlier described electron-beam induced deposition or EBID) or beam induced etching. Again, lateral process resolution is limited by electron emission<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> from sidewalls, which is affected by the size of the interaction volume.<br/>
Applicants believe that adsorbate depletion control ultimately yield superior resolution for ion beam-induced processing.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">It is noted that in EBID a low energy of the impinging electron beam is preferred to minimize the interaction volume. For ions this is not, or to a much lesser degree, the case, as the range of ions in matter is much less than the range of electrons. Also, the before mentioned back-scattered electron are not formed. Therefore the energy of ions used for IBID and -etching is typically higher than the energy of electrons used for high resolution EBID.For an apparatus using electrons again "conjugate blanking" techniques are preferred, especially as the transit time of the ions through the blanking plates of a blanker is much longer than the transit time of electrons in such a blanker.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">It is mentioned that modern instruments equipped with a scanning electron microscope column, a focused ion beam column, or both, are typically equipped with a controller controlling the deflection unit(s) for position the beam(s) upon the sample.

In an aspect of the invention this controller also controls the duty cycle of the beam by controlling the one or more beam blanker used to control the duty cycle.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Although the present invention and its advantages have been described in detail, the scope of the present application is not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments of the process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, means, methods and steps described in the specification, but defined by the appended claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56984084" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Verfahren zum Erzeugen einer mikroskopischen Struktur, wobei das Verfahren aufweist:
