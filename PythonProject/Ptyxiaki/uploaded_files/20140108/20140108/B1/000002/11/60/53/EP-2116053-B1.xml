mxw-id="PDES63961407" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to the field of personalizing a service in a multimedia network and specifically to personalization on the basis of information read from a code.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Personalization, interactivity, combined services and fixed-mobile convergence can be achieved in several ways, but to succeed in the development of new services and in achieving interoperability between technologies, the industry must agree on an approach that is based on open standards and interfaces. One of the most promising approaches is to use the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) framework. IMS was originally designed to enable multimedia services for third-generation mobile terminals, but it has already been extended to handle access also from public Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) and Private Networks, and is continuing to be extended into an access-independent platform for service delivery, including broadband fixed-line access. IMS provides seamless roaming between mobile, public WLAN and private networks for a wide range of services, such as gaming and interactive IP television (IPTV) and devices, such as set-top boxes, multimedia players and digital cameras.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The ability of IMS to deliver combined services enables a seamless integration of TV, communication, and internet services to create a more convenient and attractive experience to the consumers. IMS-based IPTV also inherits all the capabilities of IMS for service roaming, thus linking the IPTV experience to a user profile, not limited to a particular device, as with traditional set-top-boxes. An IPTV service can<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> therefore be delivered to any device adapted with an IMS interface and located within the range of the IMS domain.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Consumers want greater control over TV services and delivered content anytime, anywhere, and on any device. Personalization will enable them to customize TV and Video-on-Demand (VoD) packages according to individual preferences, and to exert greater control over the channel content. The increasing popularity of SMS-based voting and chat services in TV programs also points to strong business opportunities in the area of interactive services.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">IMS-enabled IPTV uses the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), which provides a unified control scheme that can be used to control all types of media sessions as well as application services. It thus supports combined services and interactivity by joining different communications paradigms into a complete multimedia user experience.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The QR-code (Quick Response Code) is a matrix code, or two-dimensional bar code, which was created with the purpose of deriving a code which allowed its contents to be decoded at high speed. QR-codes are now used for inventory management in a wide variety of industries and has become the most popular type of two dimensional codes in Japan. Although initially used for tracking parts in vehicle manufacturing, the inclusion of the QR-Code as a reading software on camera phones in Japan, has led to a wide variety of new, consumer-oriented applications, aimed at relieving the user of the tedious task of entering data into their mobile phone. QR-codes storing addresses and URLs are becoming increasingly common in magazines and advertisements in Japan. The addition of QR-codes on business cards is also becoming common, greatly simplifying the task of entering the personal details of a new acquaintance into the address book of a users mobile phone. Consumers with capture programs and a PC with an RS-232C-interface may use a scanner to acquire data from a QR-code.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A user may build a personal profile by registering (bookmarking) products which are of interest. To bookmark a product, the user registers a code attached to the product by way of scanning a QR-code or, alternatively, by reading an RFID tag, colorcode or matrix code etc, and stores an associated product identity. Information related to the product may be stored in a database and/or on a media player, such as, e.g., a Network Personal Video Recorder (NPVR). If such information comprises personalized advertisements, these may be viewed on, e.g., a TV, PC or a mobile device on a later occasion according to personal preferences.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">One way of delivering personalized advertisements, which is applied in many of the commercial systems available today, is based on analysis of data entered by a user. Personalized advertising brings more value both for the user and for the content provider. In existing technology the personalization of the delivered content is based on previous searches that the user has performed, or on messages written earlier. The fact that this information is stored may also be transparent to the user.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A three-dimensional code system that integrates both online and offline, and analog, as well as digital components is based on the use of colorcodes. In this system a camera recognizes indexed codes, comprising specific data. A matrix of blocks and analog data pertaining to the number of colors are digitized and processed by a dedicated server, using unique addresses registered for each of the codes. A typical colorcode interaction flow starts with the authentication of a colorcode by a media player. A number associated with the colorcode is then transferred to a server. Finally, content or a set of actions represented by the colorcode, and associated with the number are transferred to the media player for further processing.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A system for managing interaction between vendors and content providers and users is known from <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2006011728A"><text>US 2006/011728</text></patcit> where such an interaction is initiated by a user scanning a common bar code from a mobile device and providing the scanned bar code to a server, capable of keeping content of vendors and content providers accessible to the users, from certain dedicated databases.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO0065509A"><text>WO 00/65509</text></patcit> refer to a method and a system for specifying information, such as multimedia, at a server and to provide the specified information to a user upon receiving a specific and identifiable bar code from the user.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In addition, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2006029681A"><text>WO2006/029681</text></patcit> discloses data collection and message presentation systems, capable of presenting personalized, rich media content to a user on the basis of permissions and settings provided by the user. According to one embodiment, a user may initiate a requested service by scanning a bar code and thereby authorizing oneself for acquiring required real-time data.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> illustrates an IMS-based IPTV architecture which provides combined services and fixed-mobile convergence. Although specified for IPTV services, a similar architecture could be used for other interactive services as well, which are accessed via a common IMS system. The architecture of <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> includes an IMS Client environment 100, IMS application servers 101, a common IMS system 102, a transport layer 103 and a Service Delivery Platform (SDP) 104. The Service Delivery Platform offers a standardized set of support functions that can be shared among various service components.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The main functional blocks in the IMS client environment are the IPTV applications 105, other applications 106, such as combinational IMS services, the media client 107, the SIP client 108.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the client environment, the IPTV applications are responsible for all interactions between IPTV services and users on their media players 110, for instance a set-top box/ TV, PC or cellular telephone. Each media player also hosts a media client, which receives and decodes the video and audio streams that make up the digital TV signals, and a SIP client which provides the control interface to the IMS core.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Depending on the application, media players will be required to support specific hardware 111, such as a camera, a scanner or a microphone, which may be attached to, or integrated with the media player.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The IPTV Application servers 112, being the central point of the IPTV service, manage all IPTV-specific functions not provided through IMS interfaces, and are connected to content providers 113. Each IPTV application server interfaces with the IMS core and functions provided by the service delivery platform.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The common IMS system includes the IMS core 114, comprising Call Session control Functions (CSCF's) 115, the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) 116 and IMS enablers 117. The IMS<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> core provides a control layer that controls services provided over fixed and mobile access networks. The Call Session control Function (CSCF), which is the central control point in IMS, provides SIP routing services and enforces Authentication and Authorization (AA). The HSS generally stores and provides user data in IMS. Additional complexity may be contained in additional databases. The most relevant IMS enablers for personalized TV service are the Presence and Group Management (PGM), and the IMS messaging (IMSM).</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The Service Delivery Platform (SDP) provides a variety of support functions that can be shared along different types of services. The support functions comprises service provider support functions, such as different charging models (Charging) 118, Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) 119 support functions and content related support functions, such as Electronic Service Guides (ESG) 120. ESGs provide information about available services and contain an electronic program guide that enables viewers to navigate, discover, and select programs and content by time, title, channel and genre.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A problem with existing solutions is that information collection associated with a user using a service is often done automatically, without actively involving the user. The user might even be unaware of the information collection taking place during the execution of a service. This kind of information collection does not encourage the user to update and to reuse the stored information for e.g. personalization purposes.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Another problem is that information collection is also often limited to Internet searches and ordering, while other activities which are associated with the human behaviour are not captured.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In addition, it is not always appropriate that immediate actions are triggered upon having collected information from a scanned code or a read RFID tag. This<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> problem raises the question of how to enable updating of information related to a certain activity, and a triggering of said activity, so that the activities can be scheduled in various different ways on the basis of personalized information stored and processed over time.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Yet another problem with presently used systems is how to execute personalized interaction of individual users, e.g. when different family members are watching content displayed on a shared device, such as a TV. Today this type of problem entails the use of an active login procedure for each family member, wherein each family member may authorize oneself by entering a secret PIN code to a shared TV remote control. This approach does neither provide for a flexible method for updating of user preferences, nor does it encourage user personalization associated with individual user interactivity.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0024" num="0024">The object of the present invention is to address at least some of the problems outlined above. In particular, it is an object to provide personalized services for users having registered a media player in a multimedia network, such as IMS. This object and other are obtained by providing a method according to claim 1 and an application server according to claim 17 for providing personalized service instructions on the basis of information retrieved from a code, e.g. a colorcode, a QR-code or an RFID-tag.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In a first embodiment, a media player, e.g. a mobile telephone, is used for creating or updating personal data stored in a preference database. A user may request for a service from a second media player, wherein the personal data, stored in the preference database is used for the personalization.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A first user which has registered a first media player (UE A) to a multimedia network with a first identity<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> (ID_1), reads a code using a visual interface, integrated with or connected to the first media player. The code is decoded in the media player and a user preference message, comprising the content of the code and at least one identity, is created by an application of the media player, and forwarded to an application server, adapted to provide personalized services according to the claimed invention. In the application server, one user preference data record for each identity of the user preference message is created, or, if already existing, updated, on the basis of the content of the user preference message. A user wanting to activate a personalized service, sends a service request, comprising a request for a personalized service and the first identity, is received from a second, registered media player (UE B). In the application server, the user preference data record is retrieved from the preference database. On the basis of the content of the service request and the content of the user preference data record, the application server is requesting for a personalization message, comprising personalized instructions on the service, from a content database.

Different types of media players, each comprising a SIP client (not shown), provide the media players access to the common IMS system. A media player adapted for interaction with the common IMS system may be any kind of electronic equipment suitable for hosting SIP client functionality, such as e.g. a mobile device, a set-top-box/TV (STB/TV), a PC or a PDA. Each media player may have one or more applications stored on a memory space, which are invoked by a personalization message, sent from an application server in response to a service request. The respective application may be invoked as a result from a communication between the media player and the application server, dedicated to provide a service requested, either from a media player, or from a content provider. A user of a media player who has the intention of personalizing a service, may initially read a code, carrying service specific information and/or one or more identities, via a code reading entity, e.g. a scanner or a camera. Each media player in the figure has means for reading and decoding a code 203, e.g. a QR-code, a colorcode or an RFID-tag.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">When a code has been read, the media player establishes a connection with an IMS application server 204, via the CSCF of the IMS core. The IMS system illustrated in the figure comprises a number of IMS application servers, each adapted to service different types of media players. IMS application server 1, provides services to mobile telephones, IMS application server 2, provides television services, while IMS application server 3, provides services adapted for PC's, and a default server, IMS AS X, may provide services to other<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> types of specially adapted media players. Via the IMS core, one of the IMS application servers (204, IMS AS 1-X), responsible for a requested service is addressed, wherein the content of the code, together with a personal identity to which the respective media player has been registered, is decoded and forwarded to the respective IMS application server. The IMS application server creates a user preference data record, which is stored in a preference database (207). The preference database may be located in the IMS core or at the content provider premises, depending on e.g. the business model and the O&amp;D structure chosen by the respective service provider. The preference database, will be further described below with reference to <figref idrefs="f0006">figure 6</figref>.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The IMS application server also have access to one or more content providers 206, comprising service specific content, to be used when setting up personalized instructions to a media player from which a personalized service, e.g. specified advertisements. The content provider may also be accessed from the IMS application server, upon receiving a request for a personalized service from a media player.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">A personalized service may be actively requested by a user of media player, or triggered by a predetermined, condition such as time of day. According to one embodiment of the invention, a request for a service is sent from a media player as a SIP message, comprising a feature tag, specifying instructions associated with the requested service. In case no feature tag is attached to the SIP message, a default instruction may be attached to the body of the SIP message. Upon receiving the SIP message, including a feature tag or a default instruction by an IMS application server adapted to distribute the requested service, the IMS application server requests for information from the respective user preference data record, stored in the preference database. Depending on the content of the service request and the content of the user<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> preference data record, relevant content, sent from a content provider is assembled, forming a personalization message by an application in the IMS application server. The content retrieved from the content provider may have the form of an Extensible Markup Language XML. The IMS application server attaches a feature tag (FT1-FTX), corresponding to the service request, to the XML. The message, now comprising an XML and a feature tag, is then forwarded to the respective media player for which the requested service is intended, and a personalized service is delivered to the media player.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">A strolling user may come across a product he or she finds interesting. By reading a QR-code, comprising a product identity, which is attached to the product, with a QR-code reader, attached to or integrated with the IMS registered media player, the content retrieved with the QR-code reader triggers a procedure for creating or updating a user preference data record linked to, and associated with the personal IMS identity to which the media player is registered. The information retrieved from the QR-code described above may also be used for updating the user preference data record in such a way that the user preference data record is modified according to the behaviour of the user of the media player. By linking each user to a specific user preference data record by the identity of the user, a media player may be shared by a plurality of users. Each user, wanting to personalize a service may register the media player using a personal identity. This identity will then be linking the user to a dedicated user preference data record, in which personalized data, associated with that user is stored and updated.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">How the user preferences, read from a code, is effecting the content retrieved from the content provider, is not the scope of the claimed invention and, thus, this process will not be described any further in this document.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0050" num="0050">A signalling procedure illustrating one embodiment of the claimed invention where a user, having registered a media player in an IMS network, subscribes to an interactive, personalized service, will now be described with reference to the signalling diagram in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>. In the figure, a first media player, UE A 300, e.g. a mobile terminal, is registered to a personal IMS identity (ID_1), e.g. SIP:user@net.com. In a first <b>step 3:1,</b> the user reads a QR-code 301 with an integrated or attached code reader 302, wherein an application is decoding the content of the QR-code and creates a message, comprising the content of the QR-code and ID_1 in <b>step 3:2.</b> In UE A, A SIP client 303 initiates a communication with the IMS network (IMS core), via CSCF 304, by creating a user preference message, using a SIP MESSAGE method with a feature tag, QR_AD, for transmission of the content of the QR-code and ID_1 to CSCF in <b>step 3:3,</b> and further to an IMS application server 305 in <b>step 3:4.</b> Upon receiving the scanned information at the IMS application server, a user preference data record linked to by ID_1, is created in a preference database 306 in <b>step 3:5,</b> or if already existing, relevant parts of the user preference data record is updated according to the content of the received user preference message. The creating/updating process is verified with a 200 OK message sent to CSCF in <b>step 3:6,</b> and terminated in UE A in <b>step 3:7.</b></p><p id="p0051" num="0051">A user wanting to receive personalized services via another media player, UE B 307, i.e. an STB/TV, which depends on the information earlier retrieved from the QR-code, may request for a personalized service upon having registered UE B to IMS. By registering UE B to the same personal IMS identity as UE A, i.e. SIP:user@net.com, both media·players will be linked to the same user preference data record. By forwarding the service request, comprising specific instructions within a feature tag, from UE B, to the IMS application server, the user instructs the IMS application server to deliver<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> personalized services to the TV-screen of UE B. This instruction could for example indicate the desire to receive a certain category of advertisements on the families TV screen at certain, predefined occasions. The message is assembled as an SIP REGISTER message and the requested service is specified by the attached feature tag, TV_QR_AD. In <b>step 3:8</b> the message is sent to the IMS application server. The IMS application server receiving the service request from UE B, requests for the user preference data record linked to by personal ID_1 in <b>step 3:9,</b> from a preference database. Next, in <b>step 3:10,</b> the IMS application server requests for servive specific instructions, e.g. XML instructions, from a content database 308. In the requesting IMS application server, a SIP MESSAGE, forming a personalization message, comprising the feature tag, TV_QR_AD and an XML description, adapted according to the content of the respective preference data record and the service request, is assembled. In <b>step 3:11,</b> the personalization message is sent to CSCF, and in <b>step 3:12</b> it is forwarded to UE B. In UE B, an application interprets the received personalization message and the requested service is executed in a personalized manner.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In a home with a media player, i.e. an STB/TV, which is registered to IMS via a family IMS identity (a group IMS identity), several individuals, e.g. family members, may share the same STB/TV. A plurality of the family members may also have individual media players, e.g. mobile telephones, each being registered to IMS via different individual personal IMS identities. In order to be able to simultaneously provide personalized services to a plurality of users wherein content is displayed on a shared device, e.g. a TV screen, and in order to provide automatic creation/updating of individual, as well as group user preferences, stored in the respective user preference data record, an alternative embodiment will be<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> required.
