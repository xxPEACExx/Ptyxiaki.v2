The ACM controlling ECU is communicatively connected to an engine controlling ECU (Electric Control Unit). The engine controlling ECU controls the operation of fuel injectors of the engine based on a crank pulse signal and a TDC (Top Dead Center) pulse signal. The engine controlling ECU also switches to select an all cylinder operation state or selective-cylinder operation states by controlling the operation of the hydraulic actuators of the valve resting mechanism of the engine. Since an engine vibration is different among the all cylinder operation state and the selective-cylinder operation states, the ACM controlling ECU receives the crank pulse signal, the TDC pulse signal and a cylinder stop signal which indicates to stop a cylinder from the engine controlling ECU. The ACM controlling ECU determines an engine vibration cycle such as a vibration mode of primary vibration, 1.5<sup>th</sup> order vibration or secondary vibration, and calculates the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> amplitude or the phase of the engine vibration to optimally control the active control mount in accordance with the engine vibration state.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2007269049A"><text>2007 - 269049</text></patcit> discloses an active vibration isolating support device which optimally controls an active control mount in a motor-assisted hybrid vehicle based on the operation state of the motor vibration control. The active vibration isolating support device disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2007269049A"><text>2007 - 269049</text></patcit> includes a control map changer for changing a phase correction control map for generating a target current waveform for vibration control of an engine mount depending on the presence/absence of a motor vibration control signal which is supplied to a generator motor. Accordingly, optimum active mount control based on the state of vibration control by the generator motor can be performed.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">There has been known a hybrid vehicle including a motor generator for assisting an engine output and an engine which can perform a selective cylinder operation. Since an acceleration function realized by the motor assist is added to the hybrid vehicle, the hybrid vehicle can perform the selective-cylinder operation in a vehicle speed range higher than a vehicle speed range in which a selective-cylinder operation state can be performed by a conventional vehicle (not a hybrid vehicle) which includes an engine capable of performing a selective cylinder operation.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">If a selective-cylinder operation is performed in a vehicle speed range higher than the vehicle speed range allowed in the conventional vehicle, the amplitude of the engine vibration becomes greater. Therefore, in order to enhance the vibration absorbing property of the active control mount, the ACM controlling ECU is provided with a booster circuit for boosting the driving voltage supplied to an actuator of the active<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> control mount to, for example, 24V from the battery voltage to realize a displacement of an active control mount which cancels out the increased amplitude of the engine vibration (see Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2005249013A"><text>2005-249013</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">An actuator of the active control mount according to Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP2008057559A"><text>2008 - 057559</text></patcit> is driven by a solenoid magnet (corresponding to a coil assembly 43). In accordance with the variation of the drive frequency for cancelling out the engine vibration, a voltage required for supplying the same strength of the driving current becomes higher as the drive frequency is increased because the driving current for driving the solenoid magnet needs to be supplied against the counter-electromotive voltage of the solenoid magnet.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Therefore, in a conventional active vibration isolating support device with an active control mount, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6A</figref>, the maximum voltage V<sub>max</sub> is set in advance at which the maximum value I<sub>Rq</sub> of the target current waveform of a driving current required in a high range of the drive frequency f<sub>DV</sub> [Hz] can be supplied to the solenoid magnet. A booster circuit then boosts the battery voltage V<sub>B</sub> to the maximum voltage V<sub>max</sub> and supplies a driving circuit which performs the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) control with the electricity to be supplied to the solenoid magnet.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the above configuration, however, the booster circuit disadvantageously boosts the battery voltage to V<sub>max</sub> even in a range where the drive frequency f<sub>DV</sub> [Hz] is low, for example, at the drive frequency f1 [Hz] where V1 is satisfactory as the required voltage value V<sub>Rq</sub> for supplying the maximum value I<sub>Rq</sub> of the target current waveform of a required driving current (i.e. the maximum target current value I1) as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6B</figref>. Thus, the electric power of W1' which is greater than W1 is supplied as the required electric power W <sub>Rq</sub> for driving the solenoid magnet. This causes a problem that the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> excessive electric power (W1' - W1) is consumed by the booster circuit or the driving circuit wastefully generating heat, which deteriorates an electric power efficiency.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Since the ACM controlling ECU is provided with the booster circuit, the electric power consumption becomes larger, and the amount of the heat generated by the booster circuit or the driving circuit which supplies electricity to the actuator of the active control mount by PWM control is increased. This causes a need for heat radiation and cooling. Especially, when the ACM controlling ECU is arranged in a vehicle compartment of a vehicle and the vehicle is left for a while without any passengers on the vehicle in the idling driving state of the engine, heat radiated from the ACM controlling ECU may not be fully removed.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="EP2098749A1"><text>EP 2 098749 A1</text></patcit>, as state of art pursuant to Art. 53(3) EPC, discloses: an active vibration isolating support apparatus having a solenoid driving device comprising: power supply parts (72A, 72B) which drive and control an actuator (M<sub>R</sub>, M<sub>F</sub>) including a solenoid by supplying the actuator with electric power; a drive frequency determining unit (71 b) which determines a drive frequency at which the actuator is driven based on drive request information for driving the actuator; a target voltage determining unit which determines on the basis of the determined drive frequency a target voltage value to which the source voltage is boosted and at which the electric power is supplied to the solenoid; wherein the determined target voltage value is input to the power supply parts (72A, 72B), which supply the driving circuit with the electric power required to drive the solenoid at the target voltage value.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention has been made in view of the above problem, and an object of the present invention is to provide an active vibration isolating support device which solves the heat radiation problem of an ACM controlling ECU at the time of an idling driving state of an engine, where the ACM controlling ECU boosts the battery voltage and supplies electric power to an actuator.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The invention provides an active vibration isolating support device in accordance with claim 1.

When the low frequency engine shake vibration occurs while the vehicle is traveling, the first elastic body 19 is deformed by a load input from the engine via the diaphragm support boss 20 and the first elastic body support boss 18, thus changing the capacity of the first liquid chamber 30, so that a liquid moves to and fro between the first liquid chamber 30 and the third liquid chamber 35 via the through passage 32. In this state, when the capacity of the first liquid<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> chamber 30 increases/decreases, the capacity of the third liquid chamber 35 decreases/increases correspondingly, and this change in the capacity of the third liquid chamber 35 is absorbed by elastic deformation of the diaphragm 22. The shape and the dimensions of the through passage 32 and the spring constant of the first elastic body 19 are set such that a low spring constant and high attenuation force are exhibited in the frequency region of the engine shake vibration. Therefore, it is possible to effectively reduce the vibration transmitted from the engine 102 to the vehicle body frame.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Further, in the frequency region of the engine shake vibration, when the engine 102 is in a steady rotating state, the driving unit 41 is maintained in a non-operating state.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">When vibration occurs which has a higher frequency than that of the above-mentioned engine shake vibration, that is, vibration during idling or vibration during selective-cylinder operation due to rotation of crankshaft (not shown) of the engine, the liquid within the through passage 32 providing communication between the first liquid chamber 30 and the third liquid chamber 35 becomes stationary and a vibration isolating function cannot be exhibited.

At this time, the movable core 54 moves the movable member 28 downward via the nut member 56 fixed to the rod 55 connected to the lower side of the movable member 28 so as to deform the second elastic body 27 downward.
