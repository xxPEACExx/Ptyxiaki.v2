load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>Technical Field</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a power generating apparatus of a renewable energy type which transmits rotation energy of a rotor from a renewable energy source to a generator, particularly a power generating apparatus of a renewable energy type having a function of cooling a hydraulic transmission.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">From the perspective of preserving the global environment, power generating apparatuses of a renewable energy type such as a wind turbine generator using wind power and a tidal generator using tidal current, river current or ocean current energy are becoming popular. To improve power generation efficiency, it is desired to increase the size of the power generating apparatus of the renewable energy type. Particularly, wind turbine generators installed offshore are expensive to construct in comparison to those installed onshore and thus, it is desired to improve power generation efficiency by increasing the size of the wind turbine generator so as to improve profitability.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">With increased output of the generator produced by the larger power generating apparatus of the renewable energy type, heat loss from the generator increases. In the power generating apparatus of the renewable energy type in which the rotation of the rotor is transmitted to the generator by a hydraulic transmission formed by a hydraulic pump and a hydraulic motor, in addition to the heat loss from the generator, there is heat loss from the hydraulic transmission as well. Thus, it is desired to develop a power generating apparatus of a renewable energy type having a function of cooling a heat-producing component such as the generator and the hydraulic transmission.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In view of this, Patent Literature 1 proposes a wind turbine generator having a cooling system for cooling a converter, a transformer and a control unit. The cooling<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> system includes a plurality of heat exchangers installed around a tower. In the heat exchangers, a cooling medium having cooled the converter, the converter, the transformer and the control unit is cooled by heat exchange with atmospheric air.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent Literature 2 discloses a cooling device for a wind turbine generator. The cooling device has a heat exchanger to cool a plurality of devices such as a converter, a transformer, a bearing box and a generator. Cooling water cools the devices and then is cooled by the heat exchanger installed on an outer wall of a tower and a nacelle.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Patent Literature 3 discloses a power generating apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1.</p><heading id="h0003">[Citation List]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Patent Literature]</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007"><ul><li>[PTL 1]<br/>

This causes a temperature of a temperature of an operating oil of the hydraulic transmission to change. As described above, in the case of the power generating apparatus installed with the above-described cooling device, cold energy such as ambient air and seawater that are around the device is often used and thus, the cooling performance largely depends on the temperature change of the surrounding environment.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The viscosity of the operating oil changes in accordance with the temperature change. At a low temperature, the viscosity of the operating oil becomes high, resulting in significant energy loss in the hydraulic transmission. At a high<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> temperature, the viscosity of the operating oil declines, resulting in accelerating degradation of the operating oil. This leads to a decline of the lubricating property, wear of the sliding part and leaking of the operating oil. Therefore, in the power generating apparatus installed with the hydraulic transmission, it is desired to keep the temperature of the operating oil at an appropriate temperature. However, such technique is not disclosed in Patent Literatures 1 and 2.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In view of the above issues, it is an object of the present invention is to provide a power generating apparatus of renewable energy type which is capable of maintaining an oil temperature of the hydraulic transmission at an appropriate temperature.</p><heading id="h0007"><b>Solution to Problem</b></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">One aspect of the present invention is a power generating apparatus of renewable energy type which generates power from a renewable energy source. The power generating apparatus may include, but is not limited to:
<ul><li>a rotating shaft which is driven by the renewable energy source;</li><li>a hydraulic pump which is driven by the rotating shaft;</li><li>a hydraulic motor which is driven by operating oil supplied from the hydraulic pump;</li><li>a generator which is coupled to the hydraulic motor;</li><li>an oil line which is connected to the hydraulic pump and the hydraulic motor and which circulates the operating oil between the hydraulic pump and the hydraulic motor;</li><li>an oil cooler which is connected to the oil line and which cools the operating oil by heat exchange with a cooling medium;</li><li>a cooling-medium line which supplies the cooling medium to the oil cooler;</li><li>a bypass line which diverges from at least one of the oil line and the cooling-medium line and merges into said at least one of the oil line and the cooling-medium line to bypass the oil cooler; and</li><li>a flow regulating valve which is provided in said at least one of the oil line and the cooling-medium line that is arranged between a diverging point and a merging point of the bypass line and which regulates a flow rate of at least one of the operating oil and the cooling medium flowing into the oil cooler.</li></ul></p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> In the above power generating apparatus of the renewable energy type, the bypass line is provided to diverge from at least one of the oil line and the cooling-medium line and the flow rate of one of the operating oil and the cooling medium flowing into the bypass line. Thus, the heat exchange amount between the operating oil and the cooling medium in the oil cooler can be adjusted and thus, the temperature of the operating oil to be cooled in the oil cooler can be adjusted as needed. Even when the temperature of the surrounding environment, the amount of heat released from the generator or the like changes, it is possible to keep the operating oil at the appropriate temperature, and to prevent overcooling of the fluid by putting a limit on the amount of the fluid bypassing the oil cooler. The flow-regulating valve can be fully closed. In such case, the flow rate of the cooling medium entering the oil cooler becomes 0, resulting in cooling failure in the oil cooler.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The above power generating apparatus of the renewable energy type may further include a heat exchanger which is provided in the cooling-medium line and which cools the cooling medium by an ambient fluid which exists around the power generating apparatus of the renewable energy type. A heat exchange amount between the cooling medium and the ambient fluid in the heat exchanger may be adjusted by regulating the flow rate of at least one of the operating oil and the cooling medium.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In this manner, the heat exchanger is provided in the cooling-medium line to cool the cooling medium by an ambient fluid which exists around the power generating apparatus of the renewable energy type. By adjusting the flow rate of one of the cooling medium and the ambient air in the heat exchanger, it is possible to adjust an amount of potential heat of the cooling medium as desired. By this, in addition to adjusting of the flow rate of the operating oil in the oil cooler by means of the bypass line and the flow-regulating valve, the potential heat amount of the cooling medium, i.e. the cooling capacity of the cooling medium is now adjustable and thus, the function of cooling the operation oil can be significantly improved. In the wind turbine generator, heat loss of the oil cooler changes depending on the load of the generator. Therefore, with the above structure, the operation oil can be cooled in accordance with the load of the generator.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The above power generating apparatus of the renewable energy type may<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> further include a generator cooler which is provided in the cooling-medium line and which cools the generator. The cooling medium may be used to cool the oil cooler and the generator cooler.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In this manner, the generator cooler is provided in the cooling-medium line to cool the generator and the cooling medium is used to cool the oil cooler and the generator cooler. Other heat-producing components are cooled by the cooling medium used in the oil cooler. Thus, it is possible to cool other heat-producing components of the power generating apparatus of the renewable energy type integrally, thereby improving the cooling efficiency.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The above power generating apparatus of the renewable energy type may further include:
<ul><li>an operating-oil extraction line which is provided to extract a portion of the operation oil from the oil line and supply the extracted portion of the operating oil to a sliding part of at least one of the hydraulic pump and the hydraulic motor as lubricating oil; and</li><li>a lubricating-oil cooling device which is provided in the operating-oil extraction line and which cools the extracted portion of the operating oil. The lubricating-oil cooling device may cool the lubricating oil to be supplied to the sliding part to keep a temperature of the lubricating oil lower than a temperature of the operating oil at an inlet of the hydraulic pump.</li></ul></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As described above, the extracted portion of the operation extracted from the oil line is cooled and the cooled portion of the operating oil is used as lubricating oil. Thus, it is no longer necessary to provide a separate lubricating oil supply mechanism such as a lubricant storage tank, resulting in simplified device. The extracted portion of the operation oil to be supplied to the sliding part must have higher viscosity than the operating oil in the hydraulic transmission. The extracted portion of the operating oil is cooled in the lubricating-oil cooling device to increase the viscosity and thus, the extracted portion of the operating oil is fully capable of functioning as lubricating oil.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The above power generating apparatus of the renewable energy type may further include a controller which controls a flow rate of at least one of the operating oil and the cooling-medium flowing into the oil cooler by adjusting an opening degree of the flow regulating valve to adjust a temperature of the operating oil at a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> prescribed position of the oil line to a set temperature.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">By this, it is possible to maintain the temperature of the operating oil flowing in the oil line at the set temperature with precision. The set temperature may be set based on the viscosity of the operating oil. For instance, an upper limit of the set temperature may be set in correspondence to a lower limit of the viscosity that is set such as to suppress a deterioration and leaking of the operating oil, whereas a lower limit of the set temperature may be set in correspondence to an upper limit of the viscosity that is set such as to suppress energy loss caused by viscosity resistance of the operating oil in the hydraulic transmission. In the hydraulic transmission, appropriate temperatures of the operating oil vary depending on a position in the oil line. Thus, a set temperature is set in correspondence to a position in the oil line. It is preferable to set more than one set temperature. In the case where more than one set temperature is set, the set temperatures correspond to the positions on the oil line respectively.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The above power generating apparatus of the renewable energy type may further include tower/nacelle cooler which is provided in at least one of the nacelle which houses the hydraulic pump and the hydraulic motor and the tower which supports the nacelle so as to cool air in said at least one of the nacelle and the tower. The cooling medium may be supplied to the tower/nacelle cooler.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In this manner, the tower/nacelle cooler is provided to cool air in the at least one of the nacelle and the tower and the cooling medium used in the oil cooler is used to the tower/nacelle cooler. Thus, it is possible to cool other heat-producing components of the power generating apparatus of the renewable energy type integrally, thereby improving the cooling efficiency.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The above power generating apparatus of the renewable energy type may further include at least one of a generator cooler and a tower/nacelle cooler which is connected in series or in parallel to the cooling-medium line, said generator cooler cooling the generator, said tower/nacelle cooler cooling one of the tower and the nacelle that house at least the hydraulic pump and the hydraulic motor. The cooling medium may be water to which antifreeze fluid is added and the oil cooler and said at least one of the generator cooler and the tower/nacelle cooler may be cooled by the cooling medium.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In this manner, at least one of a generator cooler and a tower/nacelle cooler is<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> connected to the cooling-medium line and at least one of the generator cooler and tower/nacelle cooler is cooled by the cooling medium used in the oil. Thus, it is possible to cool other heat-producing components of the power generating apparatus of the renewable energy type integrally, thereby improving the cooling efficiency. In such case, water to which antifreeze is added is used as the cooling medium. By this, the cooling medium does not freeze even when an ambient temperature is below freezing, thereby preventing a failure of the cooling system caused by freezing of the system.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The above power generating apparatus of the renewable energy type may further include an air blowing device which is provided in the cooling-medium line and the cooling medium may be air and be introduced to the oil cooler by the air blowing device.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In this manner, the air is used as the cooling medium and the air is introduced to the oil cooler by the air blowing device.

In particular, air is preferable as the cooling medium. In such case, the air is introduced to the oil cooler 36 by a fan 39 provided in the cooling-medium line 30. By this, it is possible to simplify the structure of the cooling-medium line 30 and also to perform maintenance easily.

In the heat exchanger 35, the cooling medium having passed through the oil cooler 18 and the generator cooler 22 is cooled by heat exchange with the ambient air flowing in the duct part 40 of the nacelle 4. The wind turbine generator 1 is often installed where a certain wind<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> speed and higher can be obtained. Therefore, in the wind turbine generator 1, with use of the air as the ambient fluid for cooling the cooling medium, it is possible to draw the ambient fluid to the heat exchanger 35 easily.

In the wind turbine generator 1, heat loss of the oil cooler 36 changes depending on the load of the generator 20. Therefore, with the above structure, the operation oil can be cooled in accordance with the load of the generator. Only one heat exchanger 35 is shown in the drawing. However, it is possible to provide more than one heat exchanger 35 depending on an expected amount of heat generated from the heat-producing component of the wind turbine generator 1.

Except for the cooling mechanism within the transformer room 72, the wind turbine generator of the second preferred embodiment has essentially the same structure as the wind turbine generator 1 of the first preferred embodiment described above. The same components that are described in the first preferred embodiment are indicated with the same reference numerals and are not explained further. In the second preferred embodiment, components that are different from the first preferred embodiment are mainly explained.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG.7</figref>, the wind turbine generator 1 is provided with a transformer-room cooler 91 which cools the transformer room 72. The transformer-room cooler 91 is connected to the cooling-medium line 30 which supplies the cooling medium to the oil cooler 36. In the drawing, the cooling-medium line 30 of the oil cooler side and another cooling-medium line 30' of the transformer room side are connected in the heat exchanger 35 which performs heat exchange between the ambient fluid and the cooling medium. In the preferred embodiment, the cooling medium line 30 and another cooling-medium line 30' are connected in series. However, this is not limitative and, for instance, the cooling medium line 30 and<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> another cooling-medium line 30' may be connected in parallel via a cooling-medium storage tank.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">The transformer-room cooler 91 is provided with a group of heat exchanger tubes in which the cooling medium flows and a fan which forms a flow of the air to direct the air in the transformer room 72 toward a surrounding area of the group of heat exchanger tubes. With the structure, the flow of the air having been cooled by the group of heat exchanger tubes circulates in the transformer room 72 to cool the inside of the transformer room 72 heated by the heat released from the transformer 73. In the drawing, the transformer room 72 is arranged in the tower 2.

The tower-side heat exchanger 95 is arranged at a bottom part of the tower 2 and cools the cooling medium by heat exchange with seawater. To the tower-side heat exchanger 95, a seawater supply line 97 is connected to supply the sweater pumped by a pump 96.

Thus, it is possible to cool other heat-producing components of the wind turbine generator 1 integrally, thereby improving the cooling efficiency. In such case, water to which antifreeze is added is preferable used as the cooling medium. By this, the cooling medium does not freeze even when an ambient temperature is below freezing, thereby preventing a failure of the cooling system caused by freezing of the system. In the drawing, there is one heat exchanger 35 or 95 and the cooling medium line 30 or 30' is arranged in series with respect to each of the heat-producing components.

However, the present invention is also applicable to a tidal generator. The "tidal generator" herein refers to a generator which is installed at places such as the sea, a river or a lake and which generates power from energy of tidal current. The tidal generator is essentially the same as the wind turbine generator 1 except for the rotor 2 being rotated by the tidal current instead of the wind. The components that are in common with the wind turbine generator 1 are indicated with the same reference numerals. The tidal generator is provided with the rotor 6 rotated by the tidal current acting thereon, the hydraulic transmission 10 increasing the rotation speed of the rotor 6, the generator 20 generating electric power, the nacelle 4 housing at least one of the hydraulic pump 12 of the hydraulic transmission 10 and the tower 2 supporting the nacelle 4.
