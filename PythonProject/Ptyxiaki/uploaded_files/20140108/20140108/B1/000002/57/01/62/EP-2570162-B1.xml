Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to a combination structure for a labyrinth, particularly to one that is convenient to be assembled, disassembled and transported and can be changed and recombined to form different routes as one pleases, diversified in labyrinth play, safe in use and able to attain an effect of implying instruction in amusement.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Generally, a conventional labyrinth structure sets up outdoors for amusement or for teaching includes several separating plates and firm joint members combined together. The firm joint members of the conventional labyrinth structure are generally screws or iron nails, and the routes designed for the conventional labyrinth are fixed, impossible to be changed at will, and after played for several times, the fixed routes of the conventional labyrinth have been already memorized by the players and become familiar to them, thus losing pleasure and challenge of play in the labyrinth and failing to arouse public interest and in consequence, leaving the labyrinth structure deserted. Therefore, the labyrinth routes have to be changed frequently for continuously maintaining novelty of the labyrinth play; nevertheless, detaching the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> components of the labyrinth and then reassembling them together to set up a new labyrinth will take much time and require lots of troubles and in the course of detachment, the separating plates are apt to be damaged and impossible to be reused, not only wasting materials but also contaminating the environment as well. Further, the fixed type labyrinth components are extremely huge in volume, which are not easy to be moved about and will take too much space in transportation. Furthermore, after being assembled to make a labyrinth, the separating plates are in a closed condition and hence, the moving directions of the players in the labyrinth cannot be seen from the outside. Thus, when children are playing in the labyrinth, parents are unable to know where the children are, and the children inside the labyrinth may begin to cry because of panic and even worse, danger may occur to the children.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A combination structure according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE3309735A1"><text>DE 33 09 735 A1</text></patcit>.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">This invention is directed to a combination structure for a play labyrinth, as set out in claim 1.

The connecting end 100 is axially cut with a one-half recess 102 and bored with an insert hole 104, while another connecting end 101 is axially cut with a two-thirds recess 103 and disposed with an insert hole 105, and each frame rod 10 has its wall provided with a plurality of insert holes 106.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The reinforcing support bar 11 is to be obliquely set inside the four frame rods 10 and has two ends respectively formed into a connecting end 110, which is bored with an insert hole 112 and has two sides respectively and lengthwise cut with a one-third recess 111.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The fixing members 12 are to be respectively inserted through the insert holes 104, 105 of the connecting ends 100, 101 of the four mutually butt jointed frame rods 10 and through the insert holes 112 of the connecting ends 110 of the reinforcing support bar 11 for securing the four frame rods 10 and the reinforcing support bar 11 together. The fixing members 12 are tightening cords respectively having one end provided<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> with female threads 120 and another end formed with male threads 121.<br/>
In assembling, referring to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">Figs. 1-5</figref>, firstly, the connecting ends 100 of two frame rods 10 are mutually butt jointed at a right angle, letting the connecting ends 100 of the two frame rods 10 received in the corresponding one-half recesses 102 and having the insert holes 104 of the connecting ends 100 of the frame rods 10 aligned to each other. Next, the fixing member 12 is inserted through two aligned insert holes 104 of the connecting ends 100 and has the male threads 121 at one end threadably combined with the female threads 120 at another end for stably fixing the two butt jointed ends 100 of the two frame rods 10. Afterward, the two connecting ends 110 of one reinforcing support bar 11 are respectively positioned in the two-thirds recesses 103 of the connecting ends 101 of the frame rods 10 that are vertically butt jointed to have the insert hole 112 of the connecting end 110 of the reinforcing support bar 11 aligned to the insert holes 105 at the connecting ends 101 of the frame rods 10. Subsequently, another two frame rods 10 are butt jointed at a right angle in the same way as described above, respectively having another connecting end 101 lean on the connecting end 110 of the reinforcing support bar 11 and letting the insert hole 105 at the connecting ends 101 of the two frame rods 10 aligned to the insert hole 112 at the connecting end 110 of the reinforcing support bar 11. Then, a fixing member 12 is<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> inserted through the insert holes 105 and 112 and has the male threads 121 at one end screwed with the female threads 120 at another end and thus, four frame rods 10 and one reinforcing support bar 11 can be firmly combined together to form a labyrinth unit 1 , as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>. To assemble two labyrinth units 1 together, simply have the two labyrinth units 1 contacting closely to let the insert holes 106 in the walls of two frame rods 10 respectively aligned to each other and then, have the fixing members 12 respectively inserted through the two mutually aligned insert holes 106 and tied up for securing two labyrinth units 1 together, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>. Hence, here completes an assembly of labyrinth unit 1.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In using, referring to <figref idrefs="f0006 f0007 f0008">Figs. 6-8</figref>, after several labyrinth units 1 are assembled in foresaid modes, these labyrinth units 1 can be butt jointed one by one to make up a labyrinth 2 according to the labyrinth routes designed in advance.
