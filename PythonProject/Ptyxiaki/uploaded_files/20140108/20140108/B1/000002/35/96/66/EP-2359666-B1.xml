As a result, the application of LED systems has come to include not only low-power applications, but also high-power applications. LED systems are also gaining popularity in outdoor applications, in addition to indoor applications. Moreover, LED systems are being used in general applications, and not just in special lighting applications.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">For some applications, a Class II isolation for output is required. A typical Class II high-power LED driver design uses a common front-end power factor correction section with either multiple isolated LED converters in parallel, or with multiple single stage isolated LED drivers connected to the same power sources. In such arrangements, component redundancy is undesirably high. Consequently, the cost and size of such arrangements are high and system efficiency is low.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2002145041A"><text>US 2002/145041</text></patcit> describes a device for controlling and adjusting a display light for a retail display system comprising a computer associated with plural light sources for adjusting the light sources to optimally display particular products.

Therefore, all the channels are isolated from the main power converter to meet Class II requirements.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">On each channel, the optocoupler feeds back the output current signal to the peak current regulator 156. The channel with the highest output current is regulated at any<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> given time. In the event that a light load or no load condition is present in an output channel, voltage on the winding T4, which is tightly coupled to secondary of the output transformer, is indicative of the voltage on the output channels. This voltage is processed by error amplifier 146 to take over the control loop to regulate the maximum output voltage.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Accordingly, the circuit 10 facilitates sensing output currents for a plurality of isolated output channels and regulating the current of the channel with the highest output current at a given time. In this manner, the circuit eliminates a need to use multiple Class II converters for LED applications, Thereby saving costs, reducing circuit size, and increasing efficiency.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">It will be appreciated that the specific examples of component values and/or model numbers presented herein are illustrative in nature and are not to be interpreted in a limiting sense.
