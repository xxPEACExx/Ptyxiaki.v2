More specifically, implementations of the present disclosure can provide a user-centric design approach to model and create simple service-based applications in a graphical manner. A user is able to model web service applications by defining data flows between form-based representations of web service operations without having to write programmatic code. For example, a user can create a new web service utilizing two or more separate web services using a graphical tool, rather than a programmatic tool to create the new service. As another example, a user can model an application by graphically connecting one or more user interface elements of one or more front ends of web service applications. In addition, the user may model<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> an application having multi-page functionality, such as tabbed web service applications within one application. As an advantage, the user is not required to understand specific programming models, languages, or structure.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a block diagram of an exemplar system architecture 100 that can be used to execute implementations of the present disclosure is illustrated. The architecture 100 may represent any client/server system that spans one or more networks. In one example, the architecture 100 represents a web service composition architecture 100 that can generate WYSIWYG ("What You See Is What You Get") type web service applications and provide the applications to one or more users. For example, the architecture 100 may employ techniques to combine web services into one web service application and to provide the application for execution on one or more systems.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In some implementations, the architecture 100 may represent a client/server system supporting multiple computer systems including a client 102, a client 104, and/or one or more servers 106 and 108 that are connectively coupled for communication with one another over a network 110. In some implementations, the clients 102, 104 may be directly connected to the servers 106 or 108 (without connecting via network 110).</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The clients 102, 104 are intended to represent various forms of processing devices including, but not limited to, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a handheld computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a cellular telephone, a network appliance, a camera, a smart phone, an enhanced general packet radio service (EGPRS) mobile phone, a media player, a navigation device, an email device, a game console, or a combination of any two or more of these data processing devices or other data processing devices. Each client 102, 104 may access application software and/or web services provided by server system 106 and/or server system 108.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The server systems 106, 108 are intended to represent various forms of servers including, but not limited to a web server, an application server, a proxy server, a network server, a server farm, etc. The server system 106 can, for example, be provided as an application server that executes software accessed by client computers 102, 104. The software can include predefined and/or user designed web service applications with web service operations being represented by form-based front ends that are used during the design of the application. In some implementations, the applications may be<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> composed at design time to model the web service application, to define data flow between web service operations, and to provide a concrete view of the web service application as the service may appear at runtime.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In operation, multiple clients (e.g., clients 102, 104) can communicate with server system 106 or server system 108 via network 110. In some implementations, a user can invoke applications and/or web services available from the server system 106 in a web browser running on client 102, 104. Each application can individually access data from a number of repository resources. For example, the server system 106 can access one or more repositories 112 and similarly, the server system 108 can access one or more repositories 114. Data repositories 112 and 114 can store preconfigured web service applications and/or user designed web service applications.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">By way of a non-limiting example, a user can create an application using client device 102, which communicates with system 106. The system 106 can be a repository that stores a number of preconfigured web services. Once the user generates a new application, the new application can be stored and executed on either system 106, or another system (e.g., system 108). In some implementations, another user can interact with the new application through device 104, for example, where the new application is stored and executed on system 106 and/or system 108.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In some implementations, the client devices 102, 104 may communicate wirelessly through a communication interface (not shown), which may include digital signal processing circuitry where necessary. The communication interface may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as GSM voice calls, SMS, EMS, or MMS messaging, CDMA, TDMA, PDC, WCDMA, CDMA2000, or GPRS, among others. Such communication may occur, for example, through a radio-frequency transceiver (not shown). In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth, WiFi, or other such transceiver.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In some implementations, the architecture 100 can be a distributed client/server system that spans one or more networks such as network 110. The network 110 can be provided as a large computer network, such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, a cellular network, or a combination thereof connecting any number of mobile clients, fixed clients, and servers. In some<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> implementations, each client (e.g., clients 102, 104) can communicate with the server systems 106, 108 via a virtual private network (VPN), Secure Shell (SSH) tunnel, or other secure network connection. In some implementations, the network 110 can include the Internet, a wireless service network and may include the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). In other implementations, the network 110 may include a corporate network (e.g., an intranet) and one or more wireless access points.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref>, a flowchart illustrates exemplar steps that can be executed in accordance with implementations of the present disclosure. In particular, the steps can be executed to model a web-based application that includes a plurality of web services during the design time of the application development process. The exemplar steps of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref> may be implemented using software instructions stored in a computer-readable storage medium and executed by a processing system including one or more processors. The exemplar steps can, for example, be performed in the environment 100, the clients 102 or 104, and/or servers 106 or 108.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In some implementations, services and operations associated with services may be represented by service front ends (e.g., user interfaces). A user interface can include a service operation with a nested container structure. The nested container structure typically includes a root operation container and an interaction container for receiving input parameters and providing output parameters of a web service. The interaction containers can determine a visualization of particular operation parameters that are used to invoke the service.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The user can retrieve information from a service description and/or other service related annotations. Information gained from a service description and description annotations can be used to create a user interface. The user interface is typically a user interface for a specific service operation. The user (e.g., functioning as a service composer and application designer), interacts with these user interfaces to create a desired application in a WYSIWYG principle. In general, no technical knowledge about service composition is required to build an application using the techniques described herein. Consequently, the user can model and layout an application in a graphical way without having to write programmatic code.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">An exemplar application may provide several displayable pages that can be connected with each other to define a navigation flow from conception to the final application. Each page acts as a container for the user interfaces and represents a dialog visible on a user's screen.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In step 200, the service elements and corresponding structure are retrieved from a repository (e.g., a computer-readable storage device). In some implementations, web service data can be retrieved from a local service repository. The services and operations can be presented to a user in a service browser. A service browser is typically displayed as a window, from which a user can select web service elements (e.g., email service, flight booking service, hotel booking service, weather service, etc.) and service operations (e.g., search flight, flight booking, etc.).<br/>
Elements and structure provided by one or more services can be analyzed in step 202. By way of one non-limiting example, an inference engine (not shown) can be implemented to parse a particular model that represents the web service. In general, an inference engine is provided as a computer program that derives answers from a knowledge base. In implementations of the present disclosure, an inference engine can analyze particular service elements and operations provided by a service description (e.g., WSDL). The inference engine can generate user interface elements for each service element requested for display within a particular user interface. The inference engine can use a number of data points to infer which user interface element should be used for a specific service element. For example, the inference engine may use a parameter type (e.g., input or output), a base data type, data type enhancements and restrictions, and/or occurrence definitions.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The inference engine may be equipped to handle complex data types. Complex data types may require special consideration, because the complexity may include data types that are arbitrarily nested or recursive in nature. By way of one non-limiting example, the inference engine may not follow recursions arbitrarily to avoid infinite loops, but rather can abort further inspection after a certain number of loops. By way of another non-limiting example, input parameters having complex data types may be represented by a nested structure with the complex type divided into its child elements. It is contemplated that the web service models can be parsed in any other<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> manner including, but not limited to, parsing during manual creation of the user interfaces.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In some implementations, output parameters that have complex data types may be presented by tables as standard output format or lists. Depending on the depth of a nested complex type, the table may contain an expanded mode to depict complex child elements. Minimum and maximum occurrences are taken into consideration by redundantly displaying the data type element or allowing multi selection in the range of the occurrence.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In step 204, it is determined whether annotation effects exist. Annotation effects represent annotated services that act as the foundation for designed applications. The annotations are reusable information fragments attached to each service description (e.g., WSDL, WADL), which are typically not available for an application developer or service composer. The annotations can be created by the service developer and stored in an annotation model based on a predefined meta-model. Annotations provide extensive additional information covering the visual appearance of a service, the behavior of user interface elements, and relations between services to further improve the visual appearance of the resulting composite application.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">If annotation effects exist, which annotation effects exist are determined in step 206. Whenever the inference engine detects annotations attached upon a service element, the engine may request a description for each annotation, which specifies the effects of this particular annotation. Possible effects can include, but are not limited to, the creation of additional user interface elements, the addition and/or change of user interface element properties, the change of the appearance of user interface elements, and the restriction to a set of valid values. An annotation effect determination component of the inference engine can generate a description object for the annotation. The inference engine can analyze the description and include the effects of the annotation in its analysis process.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">If it is determined that annotation effects do not exist, model commands are provided in step 208. Each command may represent a predefined change requests to an underlying application model. This application model represents the current state of the application during the design time. In general, the inference engine may select the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> appropriate model commands depending on predefined rules. The execution may affect the current state of the application model by integrating new elements or changing existing ones, for example. Consequently, the application model can be updated in step 210.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 2B</figref>, a screen-shot of an exemplar a web-based authoring tool 220 is depicted. The tool provides a way for a user to model an application using user interface front ends without having to create programmatic code. A front end is a user interface for defining an abstraction of underlying components which provide a user-friendly interface. In some implementations, front ends may represent services and operations of those services. The front end may include user interface elements for each input parameter, such as a button to call a service and resulting user interface elements for providing expected outcome of receiving the service.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">By way of a non-limiting example, a flight search operation is modeled in the authoring tool 220. Here, the user interfaces include a search flights user interface 221 and a flight booking interface 224. The flight search operation includes input areas to search available flights (e.g., "Departure Location," "Destination," "Departure Date"). One input area 222 includes a destination with the data type of "string," while another input area 223 includes a departure date with the data type of "date." The return value may be a complex type containing the data type elements "Flight Number", "Airline", and "Price" all of which are defined as "string" data types.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Continuing with the above example, an inference engine can be implemented to generate a container structure that includes an operation root group, an input group, and an output group. In addition, both input and output parameters may be inferred. Because the destination parameter is defined as a "string" data type, a textbox is chosen as the user interface element, whereas the departure date is defined as a "date" data type and therefore it can be visualized by a calendar widget. For the output parameter as a complex type, a structured output (e.g., a table) can be chosen to display the results.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In some examples, the authoring tool 220 determines annotation effects between two different applications. Namely, the authoring tool 220 determines annotation effects between the search flights user interface 221 and the flight booking user interface 224, as shown by area 226. In this example, the parameter of the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> destination input field 222 is predefined as a "string" data type. This data type can be used as a metric for matching other input areas having the "string" data type related to a location or destination. If two input areas share the same data type or other similar feature (e.g., location), the authoring tool 220 may provide a suggestion that the two input fields share data at some point. For example, if a particular flight is found in the search flights application, a user may wish to book that flight within the search application rather than jump to a flight booking application.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Without the influence of annotations, the destination input field 222 may be displayed as a standard textbox handling arbitrary phrases. The addition of an enumeration annotation defines a collection of valid values. In one example, valid values may include a selection of all available destination airports. To avoid false inputs, the inference engine may not select a textbox as representing the user interface element, but rather may select a combobox to restrain the input possibilities. In addition, a label annotation can be added to all parameters defining a name readable for humans. This can allow the inference engine to use the name provided by the label annotation, rather than using the parameter name from the service description that does not necessarily provide an understandable name for its elements.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The inference engine as well as the annotation effect determinations consider the formerly mentioned user interface design recommendations. These recommendations influence the choice of which user interface element is used to represent a service parameter, or change the configuration of those user interface elements. In the depicted example, the annotation effects are used to provide commands that change the underlying application model, as shown in area 230.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Particular rules may be applied for specific annotation effects. For example, one rule may include the user of a radio button group whenever there is a choice between two or three values. Another rule may include the use of a dropdown list whenever there are more than three but under twenty valid values. Other rules may include the use of textboxes, scrollbars, sorting, alphabetizing, search capabilities, and so on.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The complete design process including the integration and composition of the front ends may be supported by a web-based authoring tool. The tool may support the user in the design of multi-page applications and the composition of the service front<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> ends. The tool may implement an internal object model which represents the current modeling state and supports the generation of executable applications for different target platforms. This model can be updated according to user changes and the model's serialization can serve as input to a "model-to-code" generation process.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048"><figref idrefs="f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008 f0009 f0010 f0011">FIGs. 3A-3H</figref> provide exemplar screen-shots illustrating composition of an exemplar architecture in accordance with implementations of the present disclosure. The screen-shots depicted in <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008 f0009 f0010 f0011">FIGs. 3A-3H</figref> detail a data flow between web service operations depending on the order of invocation of the web services from one or more computer-readable repositories, such as repository 114. In general, a user can define the data flow and connect particular elements to generate new combined web service applications. The following example provides the combination of a search customer web service (e.g., database search), a send message web service (e.g., email), and a track message web service (e.g., shipping tracking). In general, the screen-shots depicted in <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008 f0009 f0010 f0011">FIGs. 3A-3H</figref> may be provided in a browser-based application. However, in some implementations, another application tool can be used to generate interfaces. Users can use the application tool to generate user interfaces for each service operation.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 3A</figref>, an exemplar screen-shot 300 of an application tool for generating user interfaces is illustrated. One exemplar application tool is the ServFace Builder described above. The screen-shot 300 provides a service browser 304, a page outline window 306, and a working window 308. The service browser 304 functions to provide a graphical listing of available services including service operations. In this example, the service browser 304 may be created by a user who integrates services from a connected service repository. In another example, the service browser 304 may be created by a developer that can integrate multiple front ends of varying services.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The page outline window 306 can provide a thumbnail view of one or more pages of a webpage application. The working window 308 provides a view of the in progress combinations of web service applications for a particular page. In screen-shot 300, a search customer front end 310 is currently selected from the service browser 304 and appears in the working window 308. The search customer front end 310 corresponds to the search customer service, as shown by arrow 312. The search customer front end 310 includes a search box 314, a search button 316, and a table 318. The table 318 may<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> be generated from a previously performed search within the search customer application 310.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGs. 3B</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">3C</figref>, a screen-shot 320 of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 3B</figref> is provided as an update of the screen-shot 300. More specifically, the user has selected another service from the service browser 304, as depicted by arrow 324, to provide a send message front end 322. A screen-shot 330 of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 3C</figref> is provided as an update of the screen-shot 320. More specifically, the user has selected a track message service from the service browser 304, as depicted by arrow 334, to provide a track message front end 332. The working window 308 adjusts to accommodate a view of front ends 310, 322, 332. In some implementations, the working window 308 may tile, stack, or otherwise manipulate application windows for easy viewing.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG 3D</figref>, a screen-shot 340 depicts a user selected parameter of the search customer front end 310. In the illustrated example, the user has selected the "phone" column 342 (e.g., the telephone number associated with a particular name). The application tool automatically presents a context menu 344 in response to receiving the user input selecting the phone column 342. The context menu 344 can include one or more user-selectable contexts. The user-selectable contexts are generated when, for example, a user selects a field or parameter in front end 310. The contexts may be generated based on which field or parameter is selected. For example, if the user selects the phone column 342, the context menu 344 includes options that are similarly connectable to the phone column. Specifically, the context menu 344 includes connect, move, and rename options because a phone number can be connected, moved, or renamed in any or all screens or dialog boxes.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0008 f0009 f0010 f0011">FIGs. 3E-3H</figref>, data flows between the displayed front ends can be defined by selecting a particular context from the context menu 344. In the exemplar screen-shot 350 of <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 3E</figref>, the user has selected the connect context from the context menu 344, as indicated at 352. In response to the user-selected context, the application tool automatically determines and indicates fields of the other, open front ends 322, 332 that can be linked with the selected field of the front end 310 (i.e., the phone column 342 of the exemplar illustration). The available fields of the open front ends 322, 332 can be presented to the user in a field menu. The available fields can be<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> determined based on various approaches. By way of one non-limiting example, the available fields can be determined based on comparing data types. In this example, the application tool may search for other fields that accept integer values as inputs. In particular, the application tool can determine a data type of interaction elements of the open front ends 322, 332. For example, the selected phone column of the front end 310 can correspond to an integer data type. As a result, a drop-down list of fields of the open front ends 322, 332 that also correspond to the integer data type can be presented to the user. In the instant example, such fields can include a "phone number" field and an "ID number" field of the front end 322, and a "tracking number" field of the front end 332. In another example, the drop-down list of fields can be populated may use a complex automatic mapping algorithm. One example of a mapping algorithm may include a schema matching algorithm. The schema matching algorithm employs two schemas (e.g., service descriptions and/or WSDLs) and maps the schemas against each other for purposes of finding similarities.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In the exemplar screen-shot 360 of <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 3F</figref>, a user input has been received selecting the phone number field, as indicated by 354. In response to the user selection, the application tool automatically indicates, or highlights the phone number field 356 in the send message front end 322. In the exemplar screen-shot 370 of <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 3G</figref> a user input has been received selecting the track number field, as indicated by 372. In response to the user selection, the application tool automatically indicates, or highlights the track number field 374 of the track message front end 332. Although not illustrated, if a user selection is received indicating a selection of the ID number field 362 from the drop-down menu, the application tool would automatically indicate, or highlight the ID number field 364 of the send message front end 322.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">A user input can be received confirming a desired connection between fields of the various front ends. In this manner, a dataflow can be defined between fields of the front ends, with one field of one front end providing an input to one or more fields of one or more other front ends. In the exemplar screen-shot 380 of <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 3H</figref>, a connection 382 illustrates a user-defined dataflow between the phone column of the search customer front end 310, and the phone number field of the send message front end 322. More specifically, by clicking on the suggested interaction element in context menu 344, the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> target of a data flow is defined and the connection 382 established (e.g., confirming the phone number field selection of <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 3F</figref>).</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In some implementations, the user can directly select a user interface element, or data field that is graphically presented on a display rather than selecting the user interface element from a menu. More specifically, and with reference to <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG 3G</figref> the user can select the connect context item to invoke a connection mode. In the connection mode, the user can graphically select a data field. For example, the user can move a mouse cursor to a position over a data field of interest and select the data field. Accordingly, the user may directly select a data field in a graphically displayed front end (e.g., phone number field 356) instead of selecting the data field from a menu. It is appreciated that implementations of the present disclosure can use a menu-based approach, a graphical selection based approach and combinations thereof to define a dataflow between user interface elements of disparate web service front ends.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The definition of the dataflows can be used in various ways. For example, the definition of the dataflow may use a value of an output parameter of an operation as the input parameter for another operation in the process. In particular, if two different services include operations for searching (e.g., searching flights and searching hotels), a process can be created to provide a combined search. That is, a user can search for a flight using a constructed application, and the arrival date of a selected flight can automatically be provided as the start date for a hotel booking. In this example, the dataflow would be defined as the arrival date field of a flight search result front end providing input to a check-in field of a hotel booking front end.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">In another example, the definition of the dataflow can be used to reuse a value of an input parameter of one operation as input parameter for another operation. Using the above flight and hotel search example, the user can create a process for a combined search. In such a case, a user may wish to express that the destination of the flight is also the search location of the hotel. In this example, the dataflow would be defined as the destination field of the flight search as automatically providing input for the hotel search.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">While the above examples describe connecting data fields located within one user interface page, any number of pages can be accessed and connected regardless of the location of the user interface. In one example, this can be accomplished by extending a<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> context menu in a hierarchy such that a user can select items located in fields of other user interface pages.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG 4</figref>, a flowchart illustrates exemplar steps that can be executed in accordance with implementations of the present disclosure. In particular, the steps can be executed to model an application including a plurality of web services. The process shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG 4</figref> may be implemented using software instructions stored in a computer-readable storage medium and executed by a processing system including one or more processors. The process can, for example, be performed in the environment 100, the clients 102 or 104, and/or servers 106 or 108.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In step 400, web services are retrieved from a repository. For example, the user can access the repository 114 to retrieve a plurality of web services. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 3F</figref>, the plurality of web services may include the search customer service 310, the send message service 322, and the track message service 332, and/or the services listed in the service browser 304. In effect, the user selects services 310, 322, and 332, because the user intends to integrate the three user interfaces into one application environment.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In step 402, a plurality of user interfaces, or front ends, is displayed on a display device that is in communication with the computer-readable repository. Each user interface corresponds to one of the plurality of selected web services. In step 404, a first user input is received that indicates an interaction element of one of the plurality of displayed user interfaces. For example, the user can provide input indicating an interaction element of a first user interface. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 3E</figref> as an example, the user can provide an input indicating a selection of the phone column 342. As discussed above, a context menu can be displayed in response to receiving the first user input. The context menu may include one or more user-selectable contexts. For example, referring to <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 3F</figref>, the context menu 342 includes a connect option, a move option, and a rename option.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">In step 406, one or more interaction elements of a second user interface are indicated based on the first user input. For example, the application tool can indicate a correlation between a first selected interaction element (e.g., column 342) and a similar input field in another interface (e.g., input field 356 in interface 322). In step 408, a second user input is received that indicates a selection of one of the one or more<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> interaction elements of the other user interface. In step 410, a user defines a dataflow between user-selected interaction elements. For example, and with reference to <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 3G</figref>, the application tool defines a dataflow 382 between the phone column 342 and the phone number field 356 in response to receiving the second user input. In particular, the application tool uses the selected user interface elements to create a connection in the back end of the user interface. The connections result in a definition of the dataflow from service operation A to service operation B. The dataflow of the selected parameters is triggered by the execution of operation A during the runtime of the modeled application. In step 412, an application is generated and/or interpreted based on the dataflow. More specifically, a new application can be generated based on the plurality of selected frontends and the dataflow defined between user interface elements thereof. This new application can be deployed as a web-based application, for example, through which user inputs and outputs are processed in accordance with the defmed dataflows. In other implementations, dataflows can be created and/or modified in an existing application.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 5</figref>, a schematic illustration of exemplar hardware components 500 that can be used to execute implementations of the present disclosure is provided.
