mxw-id="PDES63960989" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>Field Of The Invention</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to reinforcement of structures, and more particularly to reinforcement of vehicle structures using multiple reinforcing materials.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In recent years, considerable attention has been directed toward improving vehicle performance in the event of collisions or other impacts. One particular aspect that has been addressed has been roof crush resistance. An object of such efforts has been to increase the loads that a vehicle roof is able to withstand (e.g., during a rollover accident) and to help thereby prevent intrusion of the roof into the passenger compartment. Efforts so far largely have been in the area of metal reinforcement, such as the increased use of steel structures for reinforcement. Unfortunately to perform an effective job of structural reinforcement relatively heavy structures are needed. This has an undesired effect of increasing vehicle weight, with an attendant decrease in fuel efficiency. Thus, there is a need for structural reinforcements that provide enough support to meet the need for roof crush resistance, and other structural reinforcement applications, while avoiding the detrimental effects of increasing the weight of the vehicle roof.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE202004009473U1"><text>DE202004009473 (U1</text></patcit>), which discloses the preamble of claim 1, is concerned with a reinforcing component for vehicle bodywork has foaming plastic compound on surface of temperature-stable pressure-resistant bearer part.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In various other vehicle locations, recent years have seen the increased use of structural reinforcements in which vehicle cavities are commonly fitted with structural reinforcements that aid in controlling deformation from an impact. For some applications, it has become popular in recent years to employ a carrier structure in<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> combination with an expandable material as part of the reinforcement. See e.g., <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6932421B"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 6,932,421</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6921130B"><text>6,921,130</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6920693B"><text>6,920,693</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US6890021B"><text>6,890,021</text></patcit>; and <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US6467834B"><text>6,467,834</text></patcit>. Typically, these carrier structures are made solely of molded polymeric materials. Some are made solely of metallic materials. As has been the case for a wide number of applications of these structures, the size and geometry of the structure may be related to the extent of load bearing that is required for the application. Often, this has been addressed by simply increasing the amount of material used for the carrier (and thus the part weight) in response to the increased need for impact resistance. Attention to controlling multiple modes of deformation within a single carrier is often only incidental, if at all.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The reinforcement and support of vehicle roof structures provides a further particular challenge, especially in view of the cavity volumes in which reinforcement of the above type is possible. By increasing the amount of material used for the carrier, it may be difficult to employ a reinforcement that Is large enough to provide the requisite support but small enough to fit within the confines of certain vehicle cavities, including pillars and door sills. In addition, many new vehicle designs, particularly those related to compact vehicles, require stronger reinforcements in even smaller cavities. Traditional reinforcement structures may not be suitable, as cavity size requirements often limit the ability to add more material to the reinforcements for strength increase.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Thus, there remains a need for alternative techniques that allow for the ability to improve the support capability of a carrier while avoiding the addition of substantial weight and further avoiding the expense and time associated with additional raw materials and additional processing time. There also remains a need for a structural reinforcement that can be made in a relatively low profile shape so that it can be employed with success in smaller cavities.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention meets one or more of the above needs by the improved devices and methods described herein.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In one aspect, the present invention pertains to a structural reinforcement comprising a base portion, an expandable material and a localized reinforcement. The base portion may be an elongated base reinforcing portion having a longitudinal axis. The expandable material may be an expandable polymeric material at least partially associated with the base reinforcing portion. The localized reinforcement may be a localized reinforcement aligned generally parallel with the longitudinal axis and located within a contemplated impact deformation region of the structural reinforcement. The localized reinforcement may further be made of a material that is dissimilar from and has a higher tensile strength than the material of the base reinforcing portion so that upon impact in the impact deformation region the severity of deformation is substantially reduced as compared to a part without the localized reinforcement.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">This aspect may be further characterized by one or any combination of the following features. The base reinforcing portion and the expandable polymeric material may be integrally formed of the same material. The localized reinforcement may include a fastening means that fastens the localized reinforcement to a vehicle structure or to the base reinforcing portion. The fastening means may attach to any mounting bracket, a seat belt mechanism or retractor, a pull handle bracket, a roof rack, a mirror bracket, a sunroof bracket, a bumper bracket, a hinge component, a chassis mount bracket, an engine bracket, a suspension component or a radiator bracket. The localized reinforcement may be made of a metallic material selected from steel, aluminum, titanium, nickel, magnesium, an alloy, a transition metal or any combination thereof. The localized reinforcement may be substantially completely covered by the base reinforcing portion, the expandable material, or both. The base reinforcing portion may include a curved first surface that is in contact with a curved localized reinforcement. The localized reinforcement may be a composite material. The localized reinforcement may have an outer surface and at least a portion of the outer surface may be in contact with the expandable material after expansion.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In a further aspect, the present invention contemplates a structural reinforcement comprising a base reinforcing portion having one or more extensions, an expandable polymeric material adjacent to the one or more extensions and a localized reinforcement. The base reinforcing portion may be elongated and may include a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> curved first surface and a longitudinal axis. The expandable material may be at least partially associated with the base reinforcing portion and the one or more extensions may cause the expandable material to expand vertically first and horizontally only after the expandable material extends beyond the height of the one or more extensions. The localized reinforcement may be aligned generally parallel with the longitudinal axis of the base portion and may be located within a contemplated impact deformation region of the structural reinforcement. The localized reinforcement may further be in contact with the curved first surface of the base reinforcing portion and may be made of a material that is dissimilar from the material of the base reinforcing portion.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">This aspect may be further characterized by one or any combination of the following features. The expandable material may have a ductility ratio of about 2.5. The localized reinforcement may have a generally curved or U-shaped profile. The base reinforcing portion is a polymeric part. The ductility of the base reinforcing portion material may be less than the ductility of the localized reinforcement material. The localized reinforcement may have one or more visible exposed surfaces after expansion of the expandable material. The structural reinforcement may include a top portion, a middle portion, and a bottom portion so that the localized reinforcement is only in contact with the middle portion. The base reinforcing portion, the localized reinforcement, or both, may contain a mechanical interlocking means.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In yet another aspect, the present invention contemplates a structural reinforcement comprising: a base reinforcing portion including a curved first surface and one or more extensions; an expandable polymeric material at least partially associated with the base reinforcing portion, wherein the expandable polymeric material is located adjacent to the one or more extensions such that the one or more extensions cause the expandable material to expand vertically first and horizontally only after the expandable material extends beyond the height of the one or more extensions; a localized reinforcement having a generally curved or u-shaped profile and located within a contemplated impact deformation region of the structural reinforcement, wherein: at least a portion of the outer surface is visibly exposed and in contact with the expandable material after expansion; the localized reinforcement is made of a material that is<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> dissimilar from the material of the base reinforcing portion; the localized reinforcement is in contact with the curved first surface of the base reinforcing portion; and the ductility of the base reinforcing portion material is less than the ductility of the localized reinforcement material; a fastening means that fastens the localized reinforcement to a vehicle structure or to the base reinforcing portion.</p><heading id="h0004">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a perspective view of an illustrative reinforcement in accordance with the present teachings.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a bottom view of the reinforcement of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a skeleton view of the reinforcement of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a perspective view of a portion of an illustrative reinforcement in accordance with the present teachings.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is a perspective view of an Illustrative reinforcement in accordance with the present teachings.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> is a cross-section view of the reinforcement of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref> is a view of an illustrative bracket attached to the cross-section shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> in accordance with the present teachings.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 8</figref> is a perspective view of an illustrative reinforcement in accordance with the present teachings.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 9</figref> is a perspective view of an illustrative reinforcement in accordance with the present teachings.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 10</figref> is a diagram displaying location and movement of expanded material and adjacent extensions in accordance with the present teachings.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 11</figref> is a perspective view of an illustrative reinforcement in accordance with the present teachings.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The invention herein contemplates a unique approach for providing supplementary support and reinforcement to portions of a vehicle structure that<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> experience increased deformation during vehicle impact. The additional support is provided by including a localized reinforcement structure that, in combination with a base reinforcing portion as part of a single carrier, is capable of providing necessary support for structural reinforcement of the vehicle without adding substantial weight or cost to a vehicle. The base reinforcing portion is made of a polymeric material and the localized reinforcement is made of a metallic material. The resulting structure may weigh less than a reinforcing structure made entirely of metallic material. The resulting structure may also weigh less and/or costs less than a reinforcing structure made entirely of polymeric material (e.g., a polymeric reinforcing structure that provides support equal to that of the reinforcement of the present invention). The structural reinforcement of the present invention is capable of providing additional support to the roof structure or other cavities of a vehicle without adding substantial unwanted weight.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">By placing structural reinforcements within vehicle cavities, the force of an impact is absorbed and dissipated by the structural reinforcement. In the event that the force of the impact is too great, the material of the structural reinforcement may crack, bend or break. By providing the localized reinforcement disclosed herein within a structural reinforcement, any impact that involves more force than the base reinforcing portion is capable of withstanding will cause a multiple stage deformation. The force of an impact may come into first contact with the base reinforcing portion. Once the force exceeds the strength capability of the base reinforcing portion, the force will be transferred to the localized reinforcement as opposed to causing breaking or cracking of the base reinforcing portion. This multiple stage deformation sequence may include further means to control the effects of impact force on the structural reinforcement. For example, the addition of an expandable material as disclosed herein may add an additional level of support for preventing any cracking or breaking of the base reinforcement portion.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As discussed herein, a localized reinforcement may be placed in contact with a base reinforcing portion. The localized reinforcement may be placed at a location on the base reinforcing portion that experiences increased deformation during impact to reduce the deleterious effects of the impact on the vehicle. The localized reinforcement may also span the entire length of the base reinforcing portion in the event that the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> entire base reinforcing portion experiences increased deformation during impact. The localized reinforcement may be an elongated structure that is made of a material that is dissimilar to that of the base reinforcing portion. The base reinforcing portion may also be an elongated structure having a longitudinal axis and the localized reinforcement may be aligned in a generally parallel relationship to the longitudinal axis of the base reinforcing portion. The localized reinforcement may act to bisect the base reinforcing portion, such that the localized reinforcement is aligned in a parallel manner with one or more rib structures running transverse to the longitudinal axis and/or one or more rib structures running substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis on either side of the localized reinforcement. The localized reinforcement may be attached to the base reinforcing portion via a fastener and/or an adhesive. It may be held in place by attachment, compressive forces, friction, adhesion, or any combination thereof. The localized reinforcement may include multiple layers of the same material, or multiple layers of dissimilar materials. The layers may further include adhesives and/or expandable materials disposed between the layers. The layers may also be fastened to one another, to the base reinforcing portion, to any adhesive or expandable material, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The localized reinforcement may be insert-molded such that the localized reinforcement is inserted into a location and molten material is applied over and around the localized reinforcement. The localized reinforcement may be co-extruded with the base reinforcing portion material, the expandable material, or both. The localized reinforcement may also be attached to the base reinforcing portion via a fastening means or adhesive. After attachment, the localized reinforcement may extend along the entire length of the base reinforcing portion or alternatively it may extend along up to about 25% of the length of the base reinforcing portion, up to about 50% of the length of the base reinforcing portion, or even up to about 75% of the length of the base reinforcing portion. It may extend greater than about 25% or greater than about 50% of the length of the base reinforcing portion. The localized reinforcement may extend along a width of the base reinforcing portion. The localized reinforcement may extend along the entire width of the base reinforcing portion or alternatively it may extend along up to about 25% of the width of the base reinforcing portion, up to about 50% of the width of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the base reinforcing portion, or even up to about 75% of the width of the base reinforcing portion.
