According to any one of the above embodiments of the invention, said compounds (I) are those which are in the form of mixture of para or meta isomers and the para isomer accounts for at least 90% w/w of said mixture, or even at least 95%.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to a particular embodiment of the invention, said novel compounds are those wherein R is an ortho, meta or para, in particular a para, substituent of the phenyl ring and represents a methyl or methoxy group, R<sup>1</sup> represents a methyl or ethyl group, R<sup>2</sup> represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl or ethyl group, and X represents a CHO group.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">It is also understood that, according any of the above embodiments, said compound (I) can be in the form of any one of its stereoisomers or of a mixture thereof.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As specific examples of the invention's compounds, one may cite, as non-limiting example, 2,4-dimethyl-3-(4-methylphenyl)-4-pentenal, which possesses an aldehydic, floral (marguerite), powdery-anis odor character, with a fruity-hexenal-apple aspect. This compound imparts also interesting bottom notes of the anis, aromatic (basil), verbena, green and very aldehydic notes type.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Although having a quite different chemical structure, said compound imparts an odor which can be considered as being in between the one imparted by the known perfuming ingredients 3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-methylpropanal and 3-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-methylpropanal. However, the invention's compound is more powerful and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> substantive than the two cited known ingredients, and allows new olfactive effects as shown in the Examples.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">This compound represents an embodiment of the invention particularly appreciated by the perfumers.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As other example, one may cite 4-methyl-3-(4-methylphenyl)-4-pentenal, which possesses a green, floral and anis odor. Its odor is in between the one of Trifernal<sup>®</sup> (trademark to Firmenich SA: 3-phenylbutanal) and the one of 2,4,6-trimethyl-3-cyclohexene-1-carbaldehyde (Arctander N° 761) with in addition an carvone, anis note. This invention's compound possesses a very substantive odor.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to a particular embodiment of the invention the compounds of formula (I) are: 2,4-dimethyl-3-(4-methylphenyl)-4-pentenal or 4-methyl-3-(4-methylphenyl)-4-pentenal.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As can be seen from the above table, although the precise tonalities of the invention's compounds may vary according to the exact structure of the compounds, notes of the green and/or floral types are characteristic. When R is a methyl group and X is a CHO group, the compound (I) possesses also an anisic note quite appreciated.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As mentioned above, the invention concerns the use of a compound of formula (I) as perfuming ingredient. In other words it concerns a method to confer, enhance, improve or modify the odor properties of a perfuming composition or of a perfumed article, which method comprises adding to said composition or article an effective amount of at least a compound of formula (I). By "use of a compound of formula (I)" it has to be understood here also the use of any composition containing compound (I) and which can be advantageously employed in perfumery industry as active ingredients.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Said compositions, which in fact can be advantageously employed as perfuming ingredient, are also an object of the present invention.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Therefore, another object of the present invention is a perfuming composition comprising:
<ol><li>i) as perfuming ingredient, at least one invention's compound as defined above;</li><li>ii) at least one ingredient selected from the group consisting of a perfumery carrier and a perfumery base; and</li><li>iii) optionally at least one perfumery adjuvant.</li></ol><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">By "perfumery carrier" we mean here a material which is practically neutral from a perfumery point of view, i.e. that does not significantly alter the organoleptic properties of perfuming ingredients. Said carrier may be a liquid or a solid.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As liquid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, an emulsifying system, i.e. a solvent and a surfactant system, or a solvent commonly used in perfumery. A detailed description of the nature and type of solvents commonly used in perfumery cannot be exhaustive. However, one can cite as non-limiting example solvents such as dipropyleneglycol, diethyl phthalate, isopropyl myristate, benzyl benzoate, 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)-1-ethanol or ethyl citrate, which are the most commonly used.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As solid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, absorbing gums or polymers, or yet encapsulating materials. Examples of such materials may comprise wall-forming and plasticizing materials, such as mono, di- or trisaccharides, natural or modified starches, hydrocolloids, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl acetates, polyvinylalcohols, proteins or pectins, or yet the materials cited in reference texts such as <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>H. Scherz, Hydrokolloids : Stabilisatoren, Dickungs- und Gehemittel in Lebensmittel, Band 2 der Schriftenreihe Lebensmittelchemie, Lebensmittelqualität, Behr's VerlagGmbH &amp; Co., Hamburg, 1996</text></nplcit>. The encapsulation is a well known process to a person skilled in the art, and may be performed, for instance, using techniques such as spray-drying, agglomeration or yet extrusion; or consists of a coating encapsulation, including coacervation and complex coacervation techniques.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">By "perfumery base" we mean here a composition comprising at least one perfuming co-ingredient.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Said perfuming co-ingredient is not of the formula (I). Moreover, by "perfuming co-ingredient" it is meant here a compound, which is used in perfuming preparation or composition to impart a hedonic effect. In other words such a co-ingredient, to be considered as being a perfuming one, must be recognized by a person skilled in the art as being able to impart or modify in a positive or pleasant way the odor of a composition, and not just as having an odor.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The nature and type of the perfuming co-ingredients present in the base do not warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to intended use or application and the desired organoleptic effect. In general terms, these perfuming co-ingredients belong to chemical classes as varied as alcohols,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> lactones, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, acetates, nitriles, terpenoids, nitrogenous or sulphurous heterocyclic compounds and essential oils, and said perfuming co-ingredients can be of natural or synthetic origin. Many of these co-ingredients are in any case listed in reference texts such as the book by <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969, Montclair, New Jersey, USA</text></nplcit>, or its more recent versions, or in other works of a similar nature, as well as in the abundant patent literature in the field of perfumery. It is also understood that said co-ingredients may also be compounds known to release in a controlled manner various types of perfuming compounds.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">For the compositions which comprise both a perfumery carrier and a perfumery base, other suitable perfumery carrier, than those previously specified, can be also ethanol, water/ethanol mixtures, limonene or other terpenes, isoparaffins such as those known under the trademark Isopar<sup>®</sup> (origin: Exxon Chemical) or glycol ethers and glycol ether esters such as those known under the trademark Dowanol<sup>®</sup> (origin: Dow Chemical Company).</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">By "perfumery adjuvant" we mean here an ingredient capable of imparting additional added benefit such as a color, a particular light resistance, chemical stability, etc. A detailed description of the nature and type of adjuvant commonly used in perfuming bases cannot be exhaustive, but it has to be mentioned that said ingredients are well known to a person skilled in the art.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">An invention's composition consisting of at least one compound of formula (I) and at least one perfumery carrier represents a particular embodiment of the invention as well as a perfuming composition comprising at least one compound of formula (I), at least one perfumery carrier, at least one perfumery base, and optionally at least one perfumery adjuvant.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">It is useful to mention here that the possibility to have, in the compositions mentioned above, more than one compound of formula (I) is important as it enables the perfumer to prepare accords, perfumes, possessing the odor tonality of various compounds of the invention, creating thus new tools for their work.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Preferably, any mixture resulting directly from a chemical synthesis, e.g. without an adequate purification, in which the compound of the invention would be involved as a starting, intermediate or end-product could not be considered as a perfuming composition according to the invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Furthermore, the invention's compound can also be advantageously used in all the fields of modern perfumery to positively impart or modify the odor of a consumer product into which said compound (I) is added. Consequently, a perfumed article comprising:

is also an object of the present invention.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">For the sake of clarity, it has to be mentioned that, by "consumer product base" we mean here a consumer product, which is compatible with perfuming ingredients. In other words, a perfumed article according to the invention comprises the functional formulation, as well as optionally additional benefit agents, corresponding to a consumer product, e.g. a detergent or an air freshener, and an olfactive effective amount of at least one invention's compound.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The nature and type of the constituents of the consumer product do not warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to the nature and the desired effect of said product.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Examples of suitable consumer product bases include solid or liquid detergents and fabric softeners as well as all the other articles common in perfumery, namely perfumes, colognes or after-shave lotions, perfumed soaps, shower or bath salts, mousses, oils or gels, hygiene products or hair care products such as shampoos, body-care products, deodorants or antiperspirants, air fresheners and also cosmetic preparations. As detergents there are intended applications such as detergent compositions or cleaning products for washing up or for cleaning various surfaces, e.g. intended for textile, dish or hard-surface treatment, whether they are intended for domestic or industrial use. Other perfumed articles are fabric softeners, fabric refreshers, ironing waters, papers, wipes or bleaches.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Some of the above-mentioned consumer product bases may represent an aggressive medium for the invention's compound, so that it may be necessary to protect the latter from premature decomposition, for example by encapsulation.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The proportions in which the compounds according to the invention can be incorporated into the various aforementioned articles or compositions vary within a wide range of values. These values are dependent on the nature of the article to be perfumed and on the desired organoleptic effect as well as the nature of the co-ingredients in a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> given base when the compounds according to the invention are mixed with perfuming co-ingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in the art.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">For example, in the case of perfuming compositions, typical concentrations are in the order of 0.001 % to 10 % by weight, or even more, of the compounds of the invention based on the weight of the composition into which they are incorporated. Concentrations lower than these, such as in the order of 0.01% to 1% by weight, can be used when these compounds are incorporated into perfumed articles, percentage being relative to the weight of the article.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The invention's compounds can be prepared according to a method comprising the preparation of an ester of the invention, which can be converted into an alcohol by reduction, and finally the oxidation of said alcohol into an invention's aldehyde. The aldehyde can be subsequently be transformed into an acetal or cyanide according to the invention using standard methods known from the art. The ester itself can be prepared by reacting an appropriate orthoester with an appropriate allyl-benzyl alcohol, under Claisen rearrangement conditions, as show in the scheme herein below:

Using such methodology, the alcohols and esters according to the invention are also valuable intermediates for the production of the aldehydes and cyanides of formula (I).</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Alternatively, the invention's compounds can be obtained by a process comprising the following key steps:
