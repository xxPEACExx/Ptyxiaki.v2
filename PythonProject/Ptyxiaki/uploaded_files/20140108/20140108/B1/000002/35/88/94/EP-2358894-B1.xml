mxw-id="PDES63960972" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to a test for diagnosing a patient's capacity for responding to treatment with the therapeutic enzyme asparaginase. It notably relates to a test for predicting the efficacy of a treatment using asparaginase in a given patient as defined in the appended claims.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">L-asparaginase is an essential component of the chemotherapy protocols that have been used for more than 30 years for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemias. Its mechanism of action is based on the hydrolysis of the plasma amino acid asparagine, an essential element for tumoral growth of lymphoblasts. In contrast to normal cells, cancerous lymphoblastic cells are unable to produce their asparagine themselves, and are dependent on extracellular sources. Treatment with asparaginase deprives them of this essential constituent and thus brings about their death.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The enzyme produced from microorganisms is currently marketed in three forms: the first two are derived from bacterial sources <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Erwinia chrysanthemi,</i> the third is obtained by covalent-bond coupling of polyethylene glycol to the native asparaginase of <i>Escherichia coli</i> (PEG-asparaginase).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Despite its considerable antileukaemic efficacy, treatment with asparaginase is associated with a certain number of complications connected with the immunogenicity of the enzyme. These complications may be reflected in clinical manifestations or in silent inactivation.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Hypersensitivity reactions, with severity varying from moderate allergic reaction to anaphylactic shock, have been reported by many authors (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Wang et al., Journal of Immunological Methods 239 (200) 75-83</text></nplcit>). Development of reactions of this type, observed with the three forms of asparaginase, generally leads to discontinuation of the treatment for fear of a more severe reaction.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In addition, asparaginase causes the appearance of circulating antibodies that possess neutralizing properties, reflected in an increase in clearance of the enzyme by the reticuloendothelial system and a decrease in its<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> therapeutic efficacy (<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Müller H.J., Boos J. Crit Rev Oncol/hematol 1998; (28):97-113</text></nplcit>). These antibodies have been observed with the three forms of the enzyme (<i>E. coli</i>, <i>Erwinia</i> and PEG-asparaginase), and in this instance the therapeutic objective of asparaginase, which is to achieve rapid and complete depletion of plasma asparagine for an extended period, is not attained.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">This inactivation of the enzyme by neutralizing factors, mainly antibodies, present in the patients' serum is not accompanied by clinical signs, it is silent for the clinician.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The inventors have identified that there is therefore a considerable need for clinicians to have at their disposal a test that is quick and is easy to use, for predicting the presence of asparaginase neutralizing factors, mainly antibodies, present in patients' serum. This test would make it possible to adjust the dose of enzyme administered or to replace the asparaginase used with another form of asparaginase that is not sensitive, or is less sensitive, to these neutralizing factors.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Several possibilities were considered for monitoring asparaginase activity in a patient:
<ul><li>Assay of plasma L-asparagine</li><li>Assay of plasma L-asparaginase activity</li><li>Assay of anti-asparaginase antibodies</li></ul></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The level of plasma asparagine is the main biochemical parameter reflecting the therapeutic effect that is desired with asparaginase: a rapid, complete and long-lasting depletion of asparagine. Several methods have consequently been described for its assay. Mostly they are based on combining a stage of separation of the constituents of the sample to be assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography and fluorometric detection or quantification by mass spectrometry. These methods are tedious, they require trained personnel, and their cost and the time taken are incompatible with routine clinical use.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">More recently, Verma et al. described a method for rapid assay of asparagine based on the co-immobilization of L-asparaginase and a coloured indicator on various substrates (nitrocellulose membrane, silicone gel or beads of calcium alginate). When one of these supports is brought<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> into contact with a sample of a patient's serum, the immobilized L-asparaginase will degrade the asparagine present. The production of ammonium following this hydrolysis reaction will lead to a colour change of the phenol red indicator. Although this method appears to meet the requirements of simplicity and speed of use, the authors do not supply data by which it can be validated, and there are still doubts about its accuracy.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Apart from the absence of validated methods that can be used easily and quickly, assay of plasma L-asparagine is limited by the following considerations. <i>In vivo,</i> the degradation of asparagine by the action of asparaginase is counterbalanced by the physiological production of asparagine, whereas <i>in vitro,</i> the catalytic effect of the enzyme on asparagine will persist. As a direct consequence, when a serum sample is taken from a patient treated with asparaginase, the presence of a residual amount of enzyme will lead to a bias in measurement of the asparagine level, which will be "falsely" lower than the physiological level (<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Boos et al., European journal of cancer (1996) 32, 1544-1550</text></nplcit>). This interference in the analytical procedure results in absence of correlation with the physiological asparaginase activity in the patient tested.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Several methods for assay of plasma L-asparaginase have been described, and that used most often is based on incubation of the serum containing L-asparaginase in a buffer containing L-asparagine, then after stopping the reaction, determination of the ammonium produced using Nessler reagent. Orsonneau et al. proposed a quicker and more accurate automated variant, with which patients treated with L-asparaginase can be monitored (<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>J.L. Orsonneau et al. Ann Biol Clin 2004, 62: 568-72</text></nplcit>). This method is based on the action of glutamate dehydrogenase, which uses the ammonium produced during the hydrolysis of L-asparagine by L-asparaginase to convert α-ketoglutarate to glutamic acid.<br/>
<br/>
        Glutamate dehydrogenase α-ketoglutarate + NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + NADPH → L-glutamate + NADP + H<sub>2</sub>O<br/>
<br/>
</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In this reaction, the amount of NADPH oxidized in the course of the reaction is equivalent to the amount of ammonia contained in the sample and can be determined by measuring the decrease in optical density. The kinetics of appearance of ammonium can thus be monitored and the activity of the L-asparaginase can be calculated. Although this method<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> makes it possible to monitor the L-asparaginase activity in a patient, it does not give any predictive information regarding the neutralization of this enzyme by factors present in the serum.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Wang et al. developed a standardized ELISA test for quantifying anti-asparaginase IgGs in plasma samples from patients (<nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>B. Wang et al., Journal of Immunological Methods 239 (2000) 75-83</text></nplcit>). This test was used within the scope of a clinical study for measuring the concentration of anti-asparaginase antibodies present in the serum of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, treated with L-asparaginase and who did or did not develop an allergic reaction (<nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>M.H. Woo et al., Leukemia (1998) 12, 1527-1533</text></nplcit>). The authors were able to show that the median concentration of anti-asparaginase antibodies was higher in the patients who developed an allergic reaction regardless of whether the measurement is carried out before or after said reaction has occurred. They conclude that there is a benefit in clinical practice of using such a test for predicting the future development of an allergic reaction.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Nevertheless, the predictive value of such a test can be questionned; the ranges of variation of the concentration of anti-asparaginase antibodies measured before the development of an allergic reaction overlap, they are respectively:
<ul><li>from 0.001 to 0.375 unit of OD for the patients who developed an allergic reaction subsequently;</li><li>from 0.004 to 0.064 unit of OD for the patients who did not develop a subsequent allergic reaction</li></ul></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Moreover, measurement of the concentration of antibodies does not give any information regarding the pharmacological activity of asparaginase in the patient and its possible neutralization by factors present in the serum.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><nplcit id="ncit0007" npl-type="s"><text>Ogawa C. et al. (British Journal of Haematology, 141, Suppl.1, 1-121</text></nplcit>) discloses a method for predicting whether an L-asparaginase can be active in children patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The presence of neutralizing factors in blood samples is identified by measuring plasma ammonia.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><nplcit id="ncit0008" npl-type="s"><text>E.H. Panosyan et al., J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol. 2004, 26, 4 : 217-226</text></nplcit> investigated the anti-asparaginase antibody and Asparaginase enzymatic<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> activity in the sera of patients. The authors describe an <i>ex vivo</i> neutralization assay conducted using patient's serum specimens as a source of anti-asparaginase antibodies. The serum specimens were incubated with native or PEG-asparaginase antigen solutions and the remaining asparaginase enzymatic activity was measured. The authors finally recommended the standard monitoring of serum anti-asparaginase antibodies in clinical settings.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The aim of the present invention is therefore to propose a novel approach that makes it possible to overcome the drawbacks of the prior art and to know at a given moment whether a patient has factors that can neutralize asparaginase activity. The method must have the advantage of being completely predictive, i.e. it must not require a stage of administration of the enzyme to the patient to be diagnosed. It must reflect the patient's capacity for responding to any form of asparaginase. Thus, the patient may be a patient who has to be treated for the first time using the enzyme, or a patient who has been treated or is currently being treated with asparaginase. It is possible to test for the presence of factors that can neutralize the activity of the enzyme used for previous or current treatment, which makes it possible to know whether the treatment with this enzyme can be resumed or continued, and optionally adjusted. It is also possible to detect the presence of factors that can neutralize the activity of the enzyme considered for the treatment of said patient, which makes it possible to validate or rule out the use of a particular enzyme.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">This knowledge will provide the practitioner with far more pertinent guidance, than with the methods of the prior art, on the form of treatment (posology, dosage regimen) or on the choice of enzyme or its form of administration. Either the neutralizing factors are absent or are present at a low enough level for treatment by means of the test enzyme to be possible, optionally with strengthening of the dosage or of the dosage regimen. Or the neutralizing factors are present at a level that is too high for such a treatment to be continued or initiated, and then the invention makes it possible to test and/or recommend an alternative solution using another form of the enzyme or a form that is less sensitive or is not sensitive to the neutralizing factors, such as the enzyme included in a biovector.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The invention thus aims to propose an <i>in vitro</i> method of determination of the presence of factors that neutralize asparaginase activity in a blood sample from a patient.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">It also aims to propose a method for <i>in vitro</i> determination of a patient's capacity for responding (i) positively to treatment with an asparaginase or (ii) of not responding to it or (iii) only responding incompletely.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">It also aims to propose a method for predicting the efficacy of a treatment using asparaginase or the fact that this enzyme will not immediately be the object of substantial inactivation of its activity by neutralizing factors.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The invention therefore relates to a method as claimed in claim 1.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Disclosed herein is a method of <i>in vitro</i> measurement of the presence of factors that neutralize asparaginase activity in a sample of blood, plasma, serum or derived medium that may contain said neutralizing factors, obtained from a patient, comprising mixing of said sample with an asparaginase, incubation of said mixture, then measurement of the residual activity of this asparaginase in the mixture, which reflects and makes it possible to determine and quantify the presence of neutralizing factors in the sample and therefore <i>in vivo</i> in the patient. The method makes it possible to diagnose, qualitatively and quantitatively, the presence of asparaginase neutralizing factors in a patient. By neutralizing factors, it is intended not only anti-asparaginase antibodies, but also any other factor that may inhibit asparaginase or its enzymatic activity, for example proteases such as human asparaginyl endopeptidase.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The invention thus relates to a method for predicting whether a given asparaginase can be active in a given patient. This method comprises the determination <i>in vitro</i> of a patient's capacity for responding to treatment with an asparaginase, in which a sample of blood, plasma, serum or derived medium that may contain factors that neutralize asparaginase activity, obtained from said patient, is submitted to the method comprising mixing of said sample with said asparaginase, incubation of said mixture, then measurement of the residual enzymatic activity of said asparaginase in the mixture, which reflects and makes it possible to determine and quantify the presence of neutralizing factors in the sample and therefore <i>in vivo</i> in the patient, that are able to neutralize asparaginase activity, and<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> therefore the patient's capacity to respond to treatment with this enzyme. The invention therefore offers a method for testing the efficacy of an asparaginase for a particular patient.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Depending on the presence or absence of neutralizing factors, and optionally on their level, the process and the method make it possible to determine whether the patient is likely to (i) respond positively to treatment with asparaginase or (ii) not respond to it or (iii) only respond incompletely.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The sample can come from a patient currently being treated with an asparaginase or from a patient who has been treated with an asparaginase.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The sample can also come from a patient who has never been treated with an asparaginase or with this asparaginase.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The asparaginase used in the test can be the one that is being or was used in the treatment carried out on the patient.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">It can also be an enzyme from a different source that we wish to test in the patient to predict its efficacy. It is also possible to test various enzymes simultaneously or successively to determine the most suitable treatment for the patient.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The invention therefore provides a method for predicting the efficacy of a treatment with asparaginase or for predicting the fact that this enzyme will not immediately undergo substantial inactivation by neutralizing factors.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The invention applies to all forms of asparaginase, for example L-asparaginase. Without being limited to them, we may mention the native enzymes obtained from any bacterial source, for example L-asparaginase produced by <i>E. coli,</i> the enzyme produced by <i>Erwinia,</i> mutated enzymes or modified enzymes, for example the pegylated enzymes (PEG-asparaginase). The enzyme can also be of natural, synthetic or recombinant origin. It can be free or included in a biovector, for example in erythrocytes.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The residual activity of the asparaginase in the mixture can be measured by adding, to said mixture, asparagine, preferably L-asparagine and a<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> reagent system that is able to detect the enzymatic degradation of asparagine by active asparaginase.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">According to an advantageous configuration, the method comprises the following stages:

The asparaginase activity measured for the control is higher than expected (655, 636 and 661 IU/L respectively for the 3 control compared to the 500 IU/L that were expected). The percentage of inhibition of asparaginase activity was calculated based on enzymatic activity measured for the control. The fact that numerous values of inhibition percentage are negative indicate a bias in the measurement procedure.<br/>
The percentage of inhibition of asparaginase activity is higher after centrifugation suggesting that the centrifugation step has eliminated some immune complexes that were formed between asparaginase and anti-asparaginase antibodies.<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --></p><p id="p0092" num="0092">On the 17 patients assayed 14 experience an inhibition of the asparaginase activity by factors present in their serum (<figref idrefs="f0003">figure 6</figref>).
