Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">Figs. 1-11</figref>, the electronic mobile device 100 includes a base 102 that detachably supports a first compartment cover 104 and a second compartment cover 106. The covers 104 and 106 may be interchanged with other covers formed of different materials having different sizes, colors, decorative patterns, or the like for personalization of the device 100. Furthermore, the covers 104 and 106 provide a protective case when connected to the base 102, and to this end, some of the surfaces of the base 102 are recessed or otherwise configured to accommodate the covers 104 and 106. These aspects of the device 100 are described in further detail below.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Referring first to the base 102, a front surface 108 supports an input panel 110, such as a touch-sensitive panel, a keypad, a trackball or optical track pad, combinations thereof, or the like. In some embodiments, a first end surface 212 and a second end surface 114 of the base 102 also include additional keys (not shown), such as convenience keys, volume keys, mute keys, or the like. The input panel 110 and the keys may be manipulated to perform various functions such as placing phone calls, browsing the internet, taking photographs, playing electronic games, inputting information to a navigation system, and the like.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The base 102 also includes a first side surface 316 and a second side surface 318 (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>) that both extend between the first and second end surfaces 212 and 114. The first and second side surfaces 316 and 318 are normally covered by and disposed adjacent the first and second compartment covers 104 and 106 when the covers 104 and 106 are attached to the base. As such, in some embodiments, the side surfaces 316 and 318 include linear tracks 919 (<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 9</figref>) that guide the covers 104 and 106 during removal and attachment, which will be described in further detail below.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As shown most clearly in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 6</figref>, the base 102 further includes a rear surface 620 opposite the front surface 108 (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>). Like the first and second side surfaces 316 and 318, at least a portion of the rear surface 620 is normally covered by the first and second compartment covers 104 and 106 when the covers 104 and 106<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> are attached to the base. The covers 104 and 106 also normally prevent access to storage compartments defined by the rear surface 620. That is, the first cover 104 normally prevents access to a first compartment 522 that houses a first removable component 524, such as removable memory card. Similarly, the second cover 106 normally prevents access to a second compartment 526 that houses a second removable component 528, such as a battery. Either or both of the compartments 522 and 526 may house additional removable components (not shown), such as a SIM card and/or an additional memory card.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">As used herein, the phrase "prevents access" and variations thereof means that a cover prevents components from being removed from a compartment when the cover is connected to the base 102 (i.e., the cover is in its normal position), but components may be removed from a compartment when the cover is detached from the base 102. That is, no other panels or doors are disposed between the cover and the compartment, and components within the compartment may be manipulated by detaching only the cover. However, the compartment may include connectors or holders, such as the holders 629 and 631 (<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 6</figref>), that directly support the components therein.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">Figs. 1-11</figref>, the rear surface 620 and the side surfaces 316 and 318 support a connection interface 130 that includes one or more electrical contacts or one or more connectors that house electrical contacts, such as battery charging contacts 432 and a data port 434, to facilitate functions such as charging the mobile device 100, exchanging information with the device 100, and the like. In some embodiments, the connection interface 130 further includes a camera lens 436 and a flash 438 to facilitate taking photographs using the device 100.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The connection interface 130 has a narrow saddle-like shape that extends across the width of the rear surface 620, from the first side surface 316 to the second side surface 318, and separates the first and second covers 104 and 106. Such a connection interface 130 facilitates connecting the device 100 to other electronic accessories (not shown), such as charging stations, compact audio devices, or the like, having support docks such as support dock 870 shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 8 and 9</figref>. In some embodiments, the support dock 870 includes electrical contacts (not shown) that<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> engage the electrical contacts 432 and 434 of the mobile device 100, for example, to charge the battery 528, to permit data transmission between the devices, or the like.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In addition to electrical contacts, the illustrated support dock 870 advantageously has a narrow saddle-like shape corresponding to the connection interface 130 and configured for receiving the device 100. The narrow saddle-like shape permits the support dock 870 to only contact the connection interface 130 to support the device 100. That is, the support dock 870 does not contact the first and second covers 104 and 106 and therefore the device 100 may be connected to the support dock 870 without removing the first and second covers 104 and 106. In addition, other interchangeable covers having different sizes and thicknesses may be connected to the device 100 and used with the support dock 870 provided that the covers do not overlap the connection interface 130 (i.e., the covers define an opening through which the connection interface 130 extends and is accessible).</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Furthermore, the saddle-like shapes of the connection interface 130 (i.e., the connection interface 130 extending across the width of the rear surface 620 from the first side surface 316 to the second side surface 318) and the support dock 870 provide lateral support (i.e., support in a direction between the sides of the connection interface 130) for the mobile device 100. As such, the shapes of the support dock 870 and the mobile device 100 prevent the mobile device 100 from falling sideways out of the support dock 870.
