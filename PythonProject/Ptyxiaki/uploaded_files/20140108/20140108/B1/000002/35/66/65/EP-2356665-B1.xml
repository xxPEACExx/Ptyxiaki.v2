Moreover the present invention relates to one or more activation buttons each of which is adapted to be attached to the activation element. Furthermore, the present invention relates to the combination of an electrical switch and an activation button. Finally, the present invention relates to a kit of an electrical switch and an activation button.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In today's electronic devices electrical switches are a common used element, thus, it is desired from a manufacturers and a costumer's point of view that the switches are as inexpensive and as versatile as possible.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4166935A"><text>US 4,166,935</text></patcit> discloses an electrical switch having two push buttons for rocking a pivotal actuator alternately in opposite directions for alternately closing double-throw contacts. However, the disclosed electrical push button does not allow for different buttons to be attached thereto.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is an object of an embodiment of the present invention to provide a system by means of which a few elements may be combined into a plurality of different switching elements.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Furthermore, it is an object of an embodiment of the present invention to provide an electrical switch which is adapted to be engaged by at least two different switch buttons.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Moreover, it is an object of an embodiment of the present invention to provide an electrical switch in which a light emitting element remains in the same position independent on the position of an activation button of the switch.</p><heading id="h0003">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">In a FIRST aspect the present invention relates to an electrical switch adapted to be engaged by a first and a second activation button by means of which a user may operate the electrical switch, the electrical switch comprising:<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> -->
<ul><li>a housing ;</li><li>at least one set of conductors, each set of conductors comprising a first conductor and a second conductor ; and</li><li>an activation element which is movable between:
<ul><li>a switched position in which the conductors are electrically connected, and</li><li>a non-switched position in which the conductors are not electrically connected,</li></ul></li></ul>
wherein an outer surface of the activation element defines:
<ul><li>a set of first retaining surfaces adapted to retain the first activation button in relation to the activation element by engagement between the set of first retaining surfaces and a corresponding set of first mating surfaces defined by the first activation button, and</li><li>a set of second retaining surfaces adapted to retain the second activation button in relation to the activation element by engagement between the set of second retaining surfaces and a corresponding set of second mating surfaces defined by the second activation button.</li></ul></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further, the first and second retaining surfaces are arranged such with respect to each other that the first activation button cannot be retained in relation to the activation element by engagement between the first mating surfaces and the second retaining surfaces. Moreover, the first and second retaining surfaces are arranged such with respect to each other that the second activation button cannot be retained in relation to the activation element by engagement between the second mating surfaces and the first retaining surfaces.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Hereby the first activation button can only be retained to the activation element by engagement between the first mating surfaces and the first retaining surfaces. Likewise, the second activation button can only be retained to the activation element by engagement between the second mating surfaces and the second retaining surfaces.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">One advantage of the present invention is that a plurality of different activation buttons may be attached to the activation element. Due the provision of a first and a second retaining surface, two different surfaces may be provided for engagement with the mating surfaces<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> (which are provided on the activation buttons). One result is that a plurality of different buttons may be provided.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The electrical switch may be adapted to be mounted on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) by means of any known method such as by soldering. The electrical conductors of the device may be accessible from an outer surface of the electrical switch such that they may be fastened and electrically connected to a PCB. The conductors may comprise a metal material which may comprise tin such as Sn100 or tinbronze (CuNi).</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The first and the second activation button may be of different shape. The cross-sectional shape of at least one of the activation buttons may be circular, oval, elliptical or polygonal such as triangular, quadrangular, etc. The activation button may comprise a transparent material. Said cross-section may define a plane which is parallel to the upper surface of the electrical switch e.g. the upper surface of the activation element.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The buttons may comprise a plastic material such as PPS (Polyphenylenesulfide). Alternatively, or as a supplement, the buttons may be reinforced with fibre glass or Kevlar.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The housing may comprise one or more parts. In one embodiment, the housing comprises an upper part and a lower part which are fastened to each other. In one embodiment, the upper part and the lower part are permanently fastened to each other by means of welding or gluing. By permanently fastened is meant that the two elements cannot be separated from each other without damaging one of the two parts or the material (e.g. glue) used to fasten the two elements to each other. In one embodiment, the upper part and the lower part are detachably fastened to each other e.g. by means of a snap lock. The housing may comprise the same materials as are described above in relation to the buttons.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The activation element may comprise any of the materials described in relation to the housing. The activation element is moveable between: a switched position in which the conductors are electrically connected, and a non-switched position in which the conductors are not electrically connected. In one embodiment, this movement is a linear movement e.g. into and out of the housing. In one embodiment, the movement causes the activation element to move along a normal of the surface onto which the electrical switch is fastened. In another embodiment, the movement is transverse to said normal e.g. parallel to the surface on to which the electrical switch is fastened. In one embodiment, the movement is a rotational movement e.g. such that the activation element and the activation button are rotated about a normal of the surface onto which the electrical device is fastened. In the alternative, the activation element is rotated about a line extending parallel to the surface onto which the electrical switch is fastened.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In order to allow two different kinds of activation buttons to be fastened to the activation element, an outer surface of the activation element defines a set of first retaining surfaces and a set of second retaining surfaces. In one embodiment, the activation element comprises more than two sets of retaining surfaces. Accordingly, the activation element may comprise a set of third retaining surfaces or a set of fourth retaining surfaces etc. It will be appreciated that the higher the number of retaining surfaces is, the larger is also the number of different kinds of buttons which may be fastened/attached to the activation element. Although this document is described in relation to two sets of retaining surfaces, it will be appreciated that any number of retaining surfaces may be provided and that the scope of protection covers any number of sets.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one embodiment, the term "a set" shall be understood as at least one retaining surface. In another embodiment, the term "a set" shall be understood as at least two retaining surfaces. Accordingly, a set of retaining surfaces may comprise one, two, three, four, five etc. retaining surfaces.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Unless otherwise stated, terms such as vertical, horizontal, lateral, upwards, downwards, lower, upper, side etc., refer to the electrical switch in a position wherein it orientated such that the activation element defines the uppermost part of the device. However, it will be appreciated that the electrical switch, in use, may be orientated in any other way.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The first retaining surfaces and the second retaining surfaces may be provided at different radial, translational or circumferential positions. In one embodiment, the first retaining surface and the second retaining are provided at different vertical positions. In the latter embodiment, the length of the radially extending members which define the mating surfaces may be different. As an example, the set for first retaining surfaces may be positioned above the set of second retaining surfaces. Accordingly, in the latter example, the distance from the first set of retaining surfaces to the upper surface of the activation element is shorter than the distance from the second set of retaining surfaces to the same upper surface. Moreover, the first translationally extending members defined by the first activation button may be shorter than the second translationally extending members as the latter must be designed to extend from the upper surface of the activation element to the set of second retaining surfaces.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Alternatively, or as a supplement, the distance from the centre of the activation element to outer surface of the first activation element may be different than the corresponding distance from the centre of the activation element to the outer surface of the second activation element.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Alternatively, or as a supplement, the circumferential extent of the each of the first retaining surfaces may be different than the circumferential extent of each of the second retaining surfaces. In one embodiment, the first retaining surfaces have a larger circumferential extend than the second retaining surfaces. In another embodiment, it is the other way around.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In one embodiment, the first retaining surfaces are spaced apart circumferentially. In the latter embodiment, a second retaining surface may be provided in the spaces defined between the first retaining surfaces.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The first and the second retaining surfaces may define any shape. In one embodiment, the first and/or the second retaining surfaces defines planar surfaces. In the latter embodiment, the retaining surfaces may be arranged so as to define a polygonal cross-section such as a hexagonal or an octagonal shape.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In another embodiment, the first retaining surfaces of the outer surface define arcs of a circle having a first radius and the second retaining surfaces of the outer surface define arcs of a circle having a second radius. The radiuses may be identical or different. Thus, the first radius may be larger than the second radius, or vice versa.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In one embodiment, the radiuses of the first retaining surfaces are not identical. Accordingly, one of the first retaining surfaces may have a larger radius than another of the first retaining surface. The same may be the case with the second retaining surfaces.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Either or both of the first and the second activation button(s) may comprise translationally extending members. Each of said members may define the associated mating surface. Accordingly, the first activation button may comprise translationally extending engagement members each of which may define one of the first mating surfaces. Additionally, the second activation button may comprise translationally extending engagement members each of which may define one of the second mating surfaces.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The activation element may define radially extending protrusions which defines the first retaining surfaces. In the latter case, the second retaining surfaces may be defined in the spaces defined between the radially extending protrusions, whereby, the translationally extending engagement members are positioned in spaces defined between the radially extending protrusions when the second activation button is attached to the activation element.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">One or more of the activation buttons may be solid such that it does not define any cavities. Alternatively, or as a supplement, at least one of the first and second activation buttons may<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> define a cavity with an opening. The opening may face the activation element when the activation button is attached to the activation element. In one embodiment, the opening defines a plane which coincides with a plane defined by the upper surface of the activation element.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In one embodiment, the activation element and one or more of the activation buttons are designed such that the activation element extends into the cavity of said one or more activation buttons, when the button is fastened to the activation element.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The electrical switch may comprise a light emitting element. In one embodiment, the light emitting element is arranged to emit light into that one of the activation buttons which is attached to the activation element. In the latter embodiment, the activation element may be transparent. The activation button may form a waveguide i.e. be capable of conducting visible light. Accordingly, the light emitted into the activation button may be visible from an outer surface of the activation button. The waveguide may be made from any of the materials known in optical fibre technology such as glass.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In one embodiment, the light emitting element may form part of the activation element e.g. by defining an outer (upper) surface of the activation element. In the latter embodiment, the light emitting element may be supplied with electrical energy when the activation element is depressed as the electrical conductors of the light emitting element is thus brought into contact with the one of the sets of conductors.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">When the light emitting element forms part of the activation element, the light emitting element moves when the activation element moves. In the alternative, the light emitting element may remain in the same horizontal and/or vertical and/or rotational position relative to the housing irrespective of the position of the activation element. Accordingly, if the activation element is depressed, moved, rotated etc., the light emitting element remains in the same position.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As an example, the activation element may be adapted to be moved vertically in order to be changed between its switched and non-switched position.
