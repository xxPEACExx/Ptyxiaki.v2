popular form factor for hearing assistance devices, including hearing aids. BTE's allow placement of multiple microphones within the relatively large housing when compared to in-the-ear (ITE) and completely-in-the-canal (CIC) form factor housings. One drawback to BTE hearing assistance devices is that the microphone or microphones are positioned above the pinna of the user's ear. The pinna of the user's ear, as well as other portions of the user's body, including the head and torso, provide filtering of sound received by the user. Sound arriving at the user from one direction is filtered differently than sound arriving from another direction. BTE microphones lack the directional filtering effect of the user's pinna, especially with respect to high frequency sounds. Custom hearing aids, such as CIC devices, have microphones placed at or inside the entrance to the ear canal and therefore do capture the directional filtering effects of the pinna, but many people prefer to wear BTE's rather than these custom hearing aids because of comfort and other issues. CICs typically only have omni-directional microphones because the port spacing necessary to accommodate directional microphones is too small. Also, were a CIC to have a directional microphone, the reflections of sound from the pinna could interfere with the relationship of sound arriving at the two ports of the directional microphone. There is a need to be able to provide the directional benefit obtained from a BTE while also providing the natural pinna cues that affect sound quality and spatialization of sound.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20050196001A1"><text>U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0196001 A1</text></patcit> discloses a hearing device including a silicon microphone and a low-pass filter to acquire a low frequency signal and an electret microphone and a high-pass filter to acquire a high frequencies signal, in order to generate a wide-band input signal.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20060078141A1"><text>U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0078141 A1</text></patcit> discloses a hearing aid including at least a first microphone for receiving ambient sound and at least one further microphone disposed in the housing of the hearing aid at a location sheltered against wind influences during normal use of the hearing aid.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">European Patent Application No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP1773098A1"><text>EP 1 773 098 A1</text></patcit> discloses matching microphones, in particular microphones of a hearing aid, and a means for amplitude and phase compensation relative to the microphones.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The invention is in the device of Claim 1 and the method of Claim 12.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">This document provides method and apparatus for providing users of hearing assistance devices, including hearing aids, with enhanced spatial sound perception.

These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the present subject matter. The scope is defined only by the appended claims.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Behind-the-ear (BTE) designs are a popular form factor for hearing assistance devices, particularly with the development of thin-tube/open-canal designs. Some advantages of the BTE design include a relatively large amount of space for batteries and electronics and the ability to include a large directional or multiple omni-directional microphones within the BTE housing.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">One disadvantage to the BTE design is that the microphone, or microphones, are positioned above the user's pinna and, therefore, the spatial effects of the pinna are not received by the BTE microphone(s). In general, sounds arriving at a person's ear experiences a head related transfer function (HRTF) that filters the sound differently depending on the direction, or angle, from which the sound arrived. A sound wave arriving from in front of a person is filtered differently than sound arriving from behind the person. This filtering is due in part to the person's head and torso and includes effects resulting from the shape and position of the pinna with respect to the direction of the sound wave. The pinna effects are most pronounced with sound waves of higher frequency, such as frequencies characterized by wavelengths of the same as or smaller than the physical dimensions of the head and pinna. Spectral notches that occur at high frequencies and vary with elevation or arrival angle no longer exist when using a BTE microphone positioned above the pinna. Such notches provide cues used to inform the listener at which elevation and/or angle a sound source is located. Without the filtering effects of the pinna, high frequency sounds received by the BTE microphone contain only subtle cues, if any, as to the direction of the sound source and result in confusion for the listener as to whether the sound source is in front, behind or to the side of the listener.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Loss of pinna and ear canal effects can also impair the externalization of sound where sound sources no longer sound as if spatially located a distance away from the listener. Externalization impairment can also result in the listener perceiving that sound sources are within the listeners head or are located mere inches from the listeners ear.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Therefore, sounds received by a CIC device microphone include more pronounced directional cues as to the direction and elevation of sound sources compared to a BTE device. However, current CIC housings limit the ability to use directional microphones. Directional microphones, as opposed to omni-directional microphones,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> assist users hearing certain sound sources by directionally attenuating unwanted sound sources outside the direction reception field of the microphone. Although omni-directional microphones used in CIC devices provide directional cues to the listener.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The following detailed description refers to reference characters M<sub>o</sub> and M<sub>i</sub>. The reference characters are used in the drawings to assist the reader in understanding the origin of the signals as the reader proceeds through the detailed description. In general, M<sub>o</sub> relates to a signal generated by a first microphone positioned outside of the ear and typically situated in a behind-the-ear portion of a hearing assistance device, such as a BTE hearing assistance device or Receiver-in-canal (RIC) hearing assistance device. M<sub>i</sub> relates to a signal generated by a second microphone for receiving sound from a position proximal to the wearer's ear canal, such sound having pinna cues. It is understood that BTE's, RIC's and other types of hearing assistance devices may include multiple microphones outside of the ear, any of which may provide the M<sub>o</sub> microphone signal alone or in combination.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a block diagram of a hearing assistance device according to one embodiment of the present subject matter. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a hearing assistance device housing 115, including a first microphone 101 and hearing assistance electronics 117, a receiver (or speaker) 116 and a second microphone 102. In various embodiments, the housing 115 is adapted to be worn behind or over the ear and the first microphone 101 is therefore worn above the pinna of a wearer's ear. In various embodiments, the receiver 116 is either mounted in the housing (e.g., as in a BTE design) or adapted to be worn in an ear canal of the user's ear (e.g., as in a receiver-in-canal design).

The first microphone signal 205 is produced by a microphone external to a wearer's ear canal and the second microphone signal 208 is produced by a microphone receiving sound proximal with the ear canal of the user. The microphone mixing electronics 203 combine low frequency information received from the first microphone signal 205 and high frequency information received from the second microphone signal 208 to form a composite output signal 204. In various embodiments, the high-pass filter 209 is a band-pass filter that passes the high frequency information used for spatial cues.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In various embodiments, the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter f<sub>cL</sub> is approximately the same as the cutoff frequency of the high-pass filter f<sub>cH</sub>.

The values of the cutoff frequencies are adjustable for specific purposes. In some embodiments, a cutoff frequency of about 3 KHz is used. In some embodiments a cutoff frequency of approximately 5 KHz is used. In various embodiments, the cutoff frequencies are programmable. The present system is not limited to these frequencies, and other cutoff frequencies are possible without departing from the scope of the present subject matter.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates high and low pass filter frequency responses of the microphone mixing electronics according to one embodiment of the present subject matter where the low-pass filter cutoff frequency is higher than the high-pass filter cutoff<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> frequency. In various embodiments, the cutoff frequencies are programmable. In various embodiments, the values for the cutoff frequencies are between approximately 1 KHz and approximately 6 KHz. Other ranges possible without departing from the scope of the present subject matter. In various embodiments, the cutoff frequencies are programmable. In various embodiments, the value of the high-pass filter cutoff frequency is limited to be less than the value of the low-pass filter cutoff frequency.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In various embodiments, a hearing assistance device according to the present subject matter can be programmed to select between one or more cutoff frequencies for the low and high-pass filters. For example, the cutoff frequencies may be selected to enhance speech. The cutoff frequencies may be selected to enhance spatial perception.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A user in a crowded room trying to talk one on one with another person may select a higher cut-off frequency. Selecting a higher cut-off frequency emphasizes the external microphone over the ear canal microphone. In general, information contributing to intelligibility resides in the low-frequency part of the spectrum of speech. Emphasizing the low frequencies helps the user better understand target speech. In some embodiments, low frequencies are emphasized with the use of directional filtering of the external microphone. In contrast, lowering the cutoff frequency emphasizes the ear-canal microphone and thereby spatial cues conveyed by high frequencies. As a result, the user gets a better sense of where multiple sound sources are located around them and thereby facilitates, for example, the ability to switch between listening to different people in a crowded room.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a signal flow diagram of microphone mixing electronics according to one embodiment of the present subject matter. <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 4</figref> shows a composite output signal 404 produced by a feature generator module 411 using a low-pass filtered first microphone (M<sub>o</sub>) signal 405 and an output from a notch feature detector 412 based on the second microphone signal 408.
