With regard to surgical sutures, various types of barbed sutures have been developed and/or discussed in literature in an effort to help prevent slippage of the suture and/or eliminate at least some knot-tying. With such known barbed sutures, the configuration of the barbs, such as barb geometry (barb cut angle, barb cut depth, barb cut length, barb cut distance, etc.) and/or the spatial arrangement of the barbs, will likely affect the tensile strength and/or holding strength of the suture. There is much prior art focusing on these features, mostly in the context of barbs that are cut into the suture shaft or suture core. In most known monofilament cut, barbed sutures, the tensile strength of a barbed suture is significantly less than a non-barbed suture of equivalent size. This is due to the fact that escarpment of barbs into a monofilament, depending on the barb cut depth, reduces the straight pull tensile strength since the effective suture diameter is decreased. Further, unlike conventional sutures that disproportionately place tension directly at the knots, barbed sutures tend to spread out the tension more evenly along the suture length, including at the location of the barbs. It is therefore critical for the monofilament, at the location of the barbs, to have sufficient tensile strength, and also critical for the barbs themselves to be sufficiently strong to resist breakage or peeling.<br/>
Most monofilament barbed sutures are made of relatively soft polymeric materials, thus providing a limit on the stiffness of the barbs. For any given suture size, it is difficult<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> to form barbs large enough and strong enough to catch tissues without bending, slippage or breakage, and without adversely affecting the strength of the suture. The holding strength and tensile strength can be increased by use of a stiffer material for the suture, but any increase in stiffness leads to a decrease in the flexibility of the suture, which is undesirable.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">International Application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO03083191A1"><text>WO03/083191 A1</text></patcit> discloses a monofilament suture with a round cross-section.

For purposes of the present application, the term "co-extrusion" refers to a process where two or more different materials, such as polymers, are melted in separate extruders with both melt streams fed through a co-extrusion die wherein they are joined to form a single molten strand. Further, the term "stiffness" as used herein refers the load required to deform a material, which is measured by the slope of the stress-strain curve. The initial slope of the stress-strain curve (typically from 0.5% - 1.5% strain range) is also termed as Young's Modulus or the initial modulus, which is the measure of stiffness used herein.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Tissue grasping monofilament medical devices according to the present invention comprise at least two different components that are co-extruded. The term "different" as used herein is intended to cover both distinctly different materials having fundamentally different chemical formulas and structures, or materials having similar chemical formulas and structures, but different molecular weights and thus potentially different physical properties. The first component forms a core or shaft and the second component forms the tissue grasping elements, or one or more " ridges"<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> extending substantially lengthwise along a predetermined length of the filament, and out of which the tissue grasping elements are formed by cutting or otherwise removing portions of the ridge. The cross-section of the core may be any shape including, but not limited to, round, oval, triangle, square or rectangular. The cross-section of the ridge and ultimately the tissue grasping elements can also be of substantially any shape suitable to increase the holding strength of the monofilament. Particularly suitable configurations of the ridge are triangular or various other shapes that have a wider base than distal end. The core and the ridges may be coupled simply by adherence of the two dissimilar materials together during the co-extrusion process, or may be physically reinforced by complementary interlocking shapes as will be described further below. By co-extruding two different materials and optimally selecting the materials as described herein, a tissue grasping monofilament can be achieved having both improved strength of the tissue grasping elements, and an improved combination of tensile strength and flexibility.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The two materials may be made from various suitable biocompatible materials, such as absorbable or non-absorbable polymers. The two materials may have different properties, such as modulus, strength, in vivo degradation rates, so that the desired properties for overall performance of the tissue grasping monofilament device and the capability of the tissue grasping elements to engage and maintain wound edges together can be tailored. Preferably, the first component is a relatively soft material having an initial modulus of no greater than about 2.76GPa (400kpsi), and the second component is a stiffer material having an initial modulus of at least about 3.45GPa (500kpsi). Preferable materials for the second component include, but are not limited to, polyethylene terephthalate, polymers or copolymers of lactide and glycolide, and more preferably 95/5 copolymer of poly (lactide-co-glycolide), 90/10 copolymer of poly (glycolide-co-lactide), and materials for the first component include, but are not limited to, polypropylene, polydioxanone, copolymers of poly (glycolide-co-caprolactone).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">Figures 1b-d</figref> illustrate one exemplary embodiment of a co-extruded tissue grasping monofilament 100 according to the present invention. In this embodiment, the first component 102 is made of polydioxanone (PDS), and the second component 104 is made of polylactide (PLA) and polyglycolide (PGA) or 95/5 PLA/PGA copolymers (a stiffer material with a higher initial modulus). The second component has a substantially triangular overall outer perimeter forming first, second and third 104a,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 104b, 104c ridges extending outwardly from the core 102. Tissue grasping elements 106 subsequently cut into the ridges are shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 1d</figref>. With a co-extruded monofilament wherein the second material has a greater stiffness, the holding strength of the tissue grasping elements is greater due to the greater stiffness. In the illustrated embodiment, the core is substantially circular in cross-section and has an outer diameter d of approximately 0.05-0.76 mm (2-30 mil), preferably 0.127-0.635 mm (5-25 mil). Further, each ridge and resulting tissue grasping elements projects outwardly from the core to a distal tip 105a, 105b, 105c a distance h of approximately 0.0762-1.27 mm (3.50 mil), preferably 0.2032-0.889 mm (8-35 mil).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1a</figref>, one exemplary process for making a co-extruded monofilament of the type shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">Figs. 1b-d</figref> will now be described in detail. The first component, which as indicated can be PDS, is melted in a first extruder 110, metered and pressurized through a gear pump 112. The pressurized polymer melt stream 114 (which is inside a heated metal block or a transfer tube, not shown) passes through an upper die 116 of a shape suitable to form the desired cross-section of the core, in this case circular. The second component (i.e., PLA) 104 is melted in a second extruder 122, metered, and pressurized through the gear pump 124. The second pressurized polymer melt stream 126 (inside a heated transfer tube, not shown) enters a merging chamber 130 in the co-extrusion die block 138 between the upper die 116 and a lower die 132. More specifically, as used herein the term "merging chamber" refers to the portion of the co-extrusion die block 138 where the melt streams of the first and second components merge before being extruded together through the bottom or lower die 132. At a given temperature, the lower modulus material has a lower viscosity, which aids in its ability to flow around the core component before entering the lower die. The merged stream 134 of the two components passes through the lower die 132 of a predetermined shape (in this case triangular) to form the desired overall cross-section of the co-extruded monofilament 140.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The co-extruded molten monofilament strand 140 exiting the co-extrusion die block 138 is quenched and solidified in a liquid bath 142 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 2</figref>, to quickly preserve the shape of the extrudate. The solidified dual-component monofilament strand is then passed through a first set of godet rolls 144 at a constant speed and then drawn or stretched preferably to 2-10 times its original length with the second set of feeding or godet rolls 146 running at a faster speed. As is well known, drawing or stretching (as opposed to injection molding techniques) improves strength<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> by orienting molecules along the axis of the fiber. The drawn strand may be drawn for the second time with the third set of rolls 150 to reach the maximum stable draw ratio to optimize the tensile properties. During the drawing process, the monofilament can be heated with one or several of the feeding rolls and/or through a hot oven 148. The fully drawn monofilament 151 may then be relaxed by passing through a heated relaxation oven 152 and onto another set of rolls 154 running at a slightly slower speed before taking up with winding device 156.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The co-extrusion process described above, in combination with natural adherence between the two materials, mechanically couples the two components to result in a suitable co-extruded monofilament. The core of the first, less stiff material allows for good overall flexibility of the monofilament, while the second, stiffer material into which the tissue grasping elements are formed allows for stronger tissue grasping elements leading to better holding strength for the monofilament. Finally, because the suture core 102 remains intact, tensile strength is not adversely affected.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Although a substantially triangular overall cross-section is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1b</figref>, it is to be understood that any suitable cross-section can be used and achieved with coextrusion, such as, but not limited to, circular or oval as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs 1e and 1f</figref>, or any suitable polygonal cross-section. The cross-section of the core may be varied as well.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As previously indicated, the tissue grasping elements can be formed in the ridges in any suitable configuration and by any suitable manner known to those skilled in the art, such as cutting by knife, laser or other device, stamping, punching, press forming or the like. For example, in one embodiment the tissue grasping elements are formed by cutting with a suitable cutting blade or knife. The desired number of acute, angular cuts are made directly into the ridges of the co-extruded monofilament. <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 5</figref> illustrates an exemplary cut, where the cutting blade 500 first cuts into the ridge at an angle β of approximately 30 degrees relative to the longitudinal axis x-x of the monofilament, to a depth approximately equal to or preferably less than the height of the ridges, and subsequently further cuts into the monofilament for a distance of approximately 50% ∼100% of the height of the ridges at an angle of approximately 0 degrees. To facilitate this cutting, the monofilament is typically placed and held on a cutting vice or the like. A template may also be used to help guide the cutting blade. As the ridges protrude from the core, an alternate means for cutting the tissue grasping<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> elements is to slice across the ridges from one side to the other, thus making it a one motion movement cutting and increasing efficiency. The blade will take the shape of the tissue grasping element configuration with the cutting blade on the side instead of in the front. Also, since the tissue grasping element configuration is pre-determined by the shape of the blades, the changes can easily be made to the machine if changes are desired. As indicated, material can be removed from the ridges by other suitable means such as laser cutting or stamping.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Figs. 3a-d</figref>, in alternate embodiments according to the present invention, the second component from which the tissue grasping elements are formed does not surround the core, but rather is mechanically coupled with the core and projects outwardly therefrom. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 3a</figref>, first and second ridges 300a, 300b (within which the tissue grasping elements are subsequently formed) extend outwardly from the core 302, but a base portion 303 at a proximal end thereof is embedded within the core. Preferably, each is configured to provide additional mechanical resistance against pulling the tissue grasping elements out of the core. In <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Figs. 3a-c,</figref> the ridges include the base portion 303 that is larger in width w<sub>1</sub> and cross-section than the width w<sub>2</sub> and cross-section of the distal tip portion 304. The base portion may include additional extensions or projections 306 that extend laterally outward and assist in mechanically locking the projection to the core. As stated, embedding the ridges into the core provides additional security through "mechanical locking" between the ridge material and core material. The two ridges preferably are placed along the short axis of the oval core if the core is oblong, so as to minimally affect overall stiffness of the monofilament.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> -->Further, in the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the overall dimension of the core is approximately 0.1016-1.016 mm (4-40 mil), preferably 0.381 mm (15 mil) (dimension a) by approximately 0.0508-0.508 mm (2-20 mil), preferably 0.203 mm (8 mil) (dimension b), and dimensions w, w<sub>1</sub> and w<sub>2</sub> are approximately 0.0254-0.254 mm (1-10 mil), preferably 0.1016 mm (4 mil), 0.0508-0.508 mm (2-20 mil), and preferably 0.2032 mm (8 mil), and 0.01016-0.1016 mm (0.4-4 mil), preferably 0.0381 mm (1.5 mil).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As further shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figures 3b-3d</figref>, the number of ridges 300 and/or their configurations can vary to best suit the desired product features in a given surgical application. In addition, the core can take circular and non-circular cross-sections to accommodate the number of ridges, mechanical properties of the filaments, and the extrusion process. Further, similar type ridges 400 extending from the outer periphery<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> of the core can be connected by a relatively thin membrane or covering 401 of the same material that surrounds or substantially surrounds the core as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The following are detailed representative examples of co-extruded, tissue grasping monofilaments of the present invention which are exemplary only, as the present invention is not intended to be limited other than by the appended claims.</p><heading id="h0006"><u>Example 1</u></heading><p id="p0035" num="0035">A nonabsorbable tissue grasping monofilament substantially of the configuration shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1b</figref> was formed using the coextrusion process shown and described above in connections with <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1a</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">2</figref>.
