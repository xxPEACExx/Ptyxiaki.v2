mxw-id="PDES63960715" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to aircraft loaders according to the preamble of claim 1 for transferring cargo and freight to and from an aircraft cargo bay for example such an aircraft loader is disclosed, e.g., in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20060104760A"><text>US 2006/0104760</text></patcit>. The invention more particularly concerns an aircraft loader with a barrier system particularly adapted for improving safety of the operators working on the loader.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Loaders are used for aircraft servicing and are designed to transfer containers, pallets, luggage and other types of goods to aircrafts. Many of the existing loaders have an elevator platform, a bridge platform for interfacing the elevator platform to the aircraft cargo bay, and a control station for controlling operation of the loader.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Different safety mechanisms have been proposed in the art to improve the safety of the operators working on the loader. For example, longitudinal guardrails extending along the bridge platform have been proposed for preventing falling of the operator. Known in the art, there is <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US3524563A"><text>US patent No. 3,524,563</text></patcit> granted to Mc Cartney et al. which describes hand rails mounted on each longitudinal side of the bridge platform and acting as a safety feature for the operators. Each hand rail may be pivoted to a horizontal out-of-the-way position when vertical clearance is needed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Other retractable guardrails extending under the raised platforms for preventing an operator accessing below the platforms when they are raised have also been proposed. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US20060104760A"><text>US patent application published under No. 2006/0104760</text></patcit> describes such a system.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In fact, when an operator loads goods inside or outside the aircraft, he generally stands on the bridge platform and is not still aware of the movement of the elevator<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> platform behind him. This movement could be dangerous for the operator since he can fall from the bridge platform when the elevator platform extends at a lower level.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In an attempt to remedy to this issue, in international patent application published under No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO2006063453A"><text>WO2006/063453</text></patcit>, the applicant of the present invention proposed a retractable handrail mechanism mounted along an end of the bridge platform, between the elevator platform and the bridge platform. The retractable handrail mechanism has an extended position wherein the handrails are raised across the goods path for blocking passage of the goods between the bridge platform and the elevator platform. The retractable handrails also has a retracted position wherein the handrails are moved away from the goods path when both platforms extend at the same level for allowing passage of the goods between both platforms. The retractable handrail mechanism is advantageously responsive to the movement of the elevator platform and is provided with a handrail retracting mechanism for operating the handrails between each of the extended and retracted positions. As described, the handrails may vertically fold on itself. It is also mentioned that a weight-and-pulley device or a pivoting device for vertically lowering the handrails below the bridge platform when both platforms extend at the same level could be used.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">This system improves over the prior art in providing a controllable guardrail preventing falling of the operator from the bridge platform to the elevator platform when both platforms do not extend at the same level. The proposed system however remains quite complicate to implement.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It would therefore be desirable to provide an improved barrier system for a loader that will provide a guardrail between the bridge platform and the elevator platform for preventing falling of an operator when the two platforms do not extend at the same level. It would also be desirable that such a barrier system be easy to implement while its design fulfils safety regulations in the field of aircraft loaders. It would be even more desirable to provide a barrier system that would be responsive to the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> movement of the elevator platform, thereby providing a secure system that will not be time consuming for the operator.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide an aircraft loader that satisfies the above-mentioned needs.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Accordingly, the present invention provides an aircraft loader according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, each of the supporting elements has a first plate attached to the elevator platform and a second plate attached to the first plate with a bolt and nut arrangement which advantageously acts as a shear safety pin.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the barrier system is further provided with a kick plate mechanism mounted on the bridge platform and responsive to a movement of the elevator platform with respect to the bridge platform. The kick plate mechanism is provided with a kick plate having a raised position where the plate extends across the passage when both platforms extend at different heights and a lowered position where the kick plate extends below the bridge platform when both platforms extend at the same level.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">These and other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon reading the detailed description and upon referring to the drawings in which:

As it will be more detailed thereafter, the loader of the present invention is particularly advantageous since the movement of the barrier system is responsive to the movement of the elevator platform with respect to the bridge platform, thereby providing a secure system that will not be time consuming for the operator. Thus, the aircraft loader with a barrier system proposed by the present invention advantageously allows the loader to still meet full loading cycle requirements imposed by airlines. In a further embodiment, the barrier system is further provided with a kick plate mechanism extending at the bottom of the bridge platform for preventing small objects extending on the bridge platform from falling on the elevator platform or in the vicinity thereof, thereby also improving the safety of the operators working on the ground proximate the aircraft loader.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1 A to 1C,</figref> there is shown an aircraft loader <b>10</b> for loading goods (not shown) in and out of an aircraft (not shown), the loader <b>10</b> being provided with a barrier system <b>12</b> according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> illustrated, the barrier system <b>12</b> of the aircraft loader of the invention is to be used with a loader <b>10</b> having two platforms and is mounted therebetween. In fact, the first platform is a bridge platform <b>14</b> intended to interface with the loading level of the aircraft while the second platform is an elevator platform <b>16</b> acting as a shuttle for bringing containers from ground height to aircraft door height or vice versa. As it is well known in the art, each of the two platforms <b>14, 16</b> is generally moveable between a respective uppermost position and a respective lowermost position. Of course, as it will be better understood upon reading of the present description, the barrier system <b>12</b> of the present invention could also be used on a loader <b>10</b> having more than two platforms.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2A</figref> which shows another barrier system <b>12</b> according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention. It should be mentioned that the loader <b>10</b> is only partially illustrated in order to better show the barrier system <b>12</b> of the invention. As illustrated, the barrier system <b>12</b> of the present invention is mounted on an aircraft loader <b>10</b> having a bridge platform <b>14</b> and an elevator platform <b>16</b> for transferring loads therebetween. The barrier system <b>12</b> has first and second upright guiding elements <b>18, 20,</b> each being respectively attached to the bridge platform <b>14</b> on each side thereof. Preferably, each of the guiding elements <b>18, 20</b> comprises a tubular member. As better illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2B</figref>, the barrier system <b>12</b> also has first and second supporting elements <b>22</b> (only one is shown), each being mounted on a corresponding side of the elevator platform <b>16</b> in alignment with the corresponding guiding element <b>18, 20.</b></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Still referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2A</figref> and also to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2B</figref>, the barrier system <b>12</b> is provided with an inverted-U-shaped element <b>24</b> having first and second legs <b>26, 28</b> and a transverse element <b>30</b> extending therebetween. Each of the legs <b>26, 28</b> is slidably mounted inside a respective one of the guiding elements <b>18, 20</b> and cooperates with a corresponding one of the supporting elements <b>22</b> that are adapted for supporting the legs <b>26, 28</b> and driving the inverted-U-shaped element <b>24</b> with the elevator platform <b>16.</b> Preferably, and as it will be more detailed thereinafter, the legs <b>26, 28</b> are not attached to the supporting elements <b>22</b> that act as supports only. Thus, one<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> can understand that the inverted-U-shaped element <b>24</b> is adapted to slide up and down, following the relative movement of the elevator platform <b>16</b> compared to the bridge platform <b>14.</b></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The inverted-U-shaped element <b>24</b> is slidable between a raised position providing a passage for the loads thereunder when the bridge platform <b>14</b> and the elevator platform <b>16</b> extend at a same level and a lower position wherein the transverse element <b>30</b> extends across the passage for the loads for providing a guardrail between the platforms <b>14, 16</b> when the elevator platform <b>16</b> extends below the bridge platform <b>14.</b> In <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2A</figref>, the inverted-U-shaped element <b>24</b> is in the lower position for defining a guardrail between the two platforms <b>14, 16</b> in order to prevent the operator to inadvertently fall from the bridge platform <b>14</b> on which he is working. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> illustrates the loader <b>10</b> of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1A</figref> in which both platforms <b>14, 16</b> extends at the same level. As it can be seen, the barrier system <b>12</b> is in the raised position for allowing the loads to freely move under the barrier system <b>12</b> between the bridge platform <b>14</b> and the elevator platform <b>16.</b> In other words, when the elevator platform <b>16</b> approaches the bridge platform <b>14,</b> the supporting elements <b>22</b> push the inverted-U-shaped element <b>24</b> up. This inverted-U-shaped element <b>24</b> then slides upwardly inside the guiding elements <b>18, 20,</b> until the two platforms <b>14,16</b> are at the same height. Then the containers are free to travel under the inverted-U-shaped element <b>24.</b> In the opposite direction, as soon as the elevator platform <b>16</b> leaves the bridge platform <b>14,</b> the inverted-U-shaped element <b>24</b> slides downwardly inside the guiding elements <b>18, 20,</b> since it is only supported by the contact with the supporting elements <b>22.</b></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, as illustrated, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the barrier system <b>12</b> is advantageously further provided with a sensor <b>23</b> for sensing the presence and/or absence of a container that would extend between the two platforms <b>14, 16</b> to prevent a movement of the platforms as long as the container is still on both platforms. Indeed, in certain cases, containers having a truncated base are used. In order to ensure that such containers are well detected, the sensor <b>23</b> is advantageously mounted proximate the junction of the two platforms<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> <b>14,16,</b> for example on one of the guiding elements <b>18, 20</b> at a convenient height.

This preferred embodiment will advantageously ensure that no container extends in an overhang position between the two platforms <b>14,16</b> before moving one of the platforms <b>14, 16.</b> The sensor <b>23</b> can be an infra-red sensor but it should be understood that any other convenient means for monitoring the presence and absence of a container between the two platforms could be used.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1A</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0002">2A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, the guiding elements <b>18, 20</b> and the supporting elements <b>22</b> advantageously project outwards the corresponding platform <b>14, 16</b> in order to not encroach on the space available for the loading and unloading of the loads.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1C</figref>, in a preferred embodiment, each of the supporting elements <b>22</b> is provided with a first plate <b>31</b> attached to the elevator platform <b>16</b> and a second plate <b>32</b> attached to the first plate <b>31</b> with attaching means, preferably a bolt and nut arrangement <b>34</b> and more preferably two such arrangements. Thus, in case of any pinching or extraordinary resistance, the bolts will break to prevent any further damage to the whole mechanism. In other words, these bolts can be considered as shear safety pins.

However, in another preferred embodiment, the legs <b>26, 28</b> do not rest on the supporting elements when the elevator platform <b>16</b> extends at the lowermost level. Instead, the guiding elements <b>18, 20</b> and the inverted-U-shaped element <b>24</b> are particularly shaped so that the transverse element <b>30</b> of the inverted-U-shaped element <b>24</b> abuts against the guiding elements <b>18, 20</b> when the elevator platform <b>16</b><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> extends at a lowermost level. This could be easily understood with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2A</figref>. Indeed, let imagine that the bridge platform <b>14</b> shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2A</figref> has to be raised again for reaching the level of an aircraft door.

For example, each leg <b>26, 28</b> may be provided with a bolt and nut arrangement <b>27</b> extending therethrough at a convenient height. Thus, the legs <b>26, 28</b> of the inverted-U-shaped element <b>24</b> will be allowed to slide downwardly inside the guiding elements <b>18, 20</b> until the bolt and nut arrangement <b>27</b> abuts against the guiding elements <b>18, 20</b> to prevent the inverted-U-shaped element <b>24</b> to further slide downwardly.

In fact, in this embodiment, the barrier system <b>12</b> is advantageously further provided with a kick plate mechanism <b>50</b> devised to prevent some goods extending on the bridge platform <b>14</b> to accidentally fall down on the elevator platform <b>16</b> when the two platforms do not extend at the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> same height. The kick plate mechanism <b>50</b> is mounted on the bridge platform <b>14</b> and is responsive to a movement of the elevator platform <b>16</b> with respect to the bridge platform <b>14.</b> The kick plate mechanism <b>50</b> is provided with a kick plate <b>52</b> having a raised position where the plate <b>52</b> extends across the passage when both platforms <b>14, 16</b> extend at different heights and a lowered position where the kick plate <b>52</b> extends below the bridge platform <b>14</b> when both platforms <b>14,16</b> extend at the same level. In <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1A, 1 B</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>, the kick plate <b>52</b> is in the raised position since the two platforms <b>14, 16</b> do not extend at the same level. In <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">6</figref>, the kick plate <b>52</b> is in the lowered position since both platforms <b>14, 16</b> extend at the same level.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">As better shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 5 and 6</figref>, in a preferred embodiment, the kick plate mechanism <b>50</b> is provided with a pivoting element <b>54</b> mounted with the kick plate <b>52</b> and the bridge platform <b>14</b> for driving the kick plate <b>52</b> between the raised and lowered positions. The pivoting element <b>54</b> is provided with an abutting member <b>56</b> cooperating with one of the supporting elements <b>22</b> for lowering the kick plate <b>52</b> when the elevator platform <b>16</b> is driven proximate the bridge platform <b>14.</b> The kick plate mechanism <b>50</b> further has resilient means <b>58</b> mounted with the bridge platform <b>14</b> and cooperating with the abutting member <b>56</b> for urging the pivoting element <b>54,</b> thereby driving the kick plate <b>52</b> in the raised position when the elevator platform <b>16</b> is lowered with respect to the bridge platform <b>14.</b> As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the pivoting element <b>54</b> is fixed to a pivot point <b>60,</b> giving to the pivoting element <b>54</b> the latitude to rotate around this point <b>60.</b> Any movement applied on the left end of the pivoting element <b>54</b> will be inverted at the right end. Thus, the right end of the pivoting element <b>54</b> which is slidably attached to the kick plate <b>52</b> acts as a lever for the kick plate <b>52</b> which will translate vertically in response to a movement of the left end of the pivoting element <b>54.</b> As it can be seen, when the two platforms <b>14, 16</b> are not at the same height, the resilient means <b>58,</b> a spring for example, urge the left end of the pivoting element <b>54</b> in a downward position. The right end of the pivoting element <b>54</b> thus holds the kick plate <b>52</b> upwards in the raised position. When the elevator platform <b>16</b> is raised, the supporting element <b>22</b> pushes the abutting member <b>56</b> of the pivoting element <b>54</b> upwards, thus compressing the resilient means <b>58.</b> The right end of the pivoting element <b>54</b> is then lowered so the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> kick plate <b>52</b> is now lowered under the top of the two platforms <b>14, 16</b> to allow containers to be transferred from one platform to the other one.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">This preferred embodiment is particularly advantageous since it provide an enhanced safety for operators working both on the bridge platform and on ground proximate the aircraft loader.
