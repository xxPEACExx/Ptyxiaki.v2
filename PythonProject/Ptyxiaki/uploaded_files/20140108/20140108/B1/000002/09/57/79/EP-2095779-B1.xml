Therefore, an accommodation space 50 is formed in the outer housing 47 on the radially outer side of the small-diameter portion 59.

The ultrasonic cable 33, the high-frequency cable 38, and the switch cable 53 extended from the proximal-end portion of the inner housing 39 are led into the proximal-end housing 57, and then led into the electrical cable 23.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">It is to be noted that, in the handpiece 21, a sealing member, e.g., an O-ring is appropriately arranged between respective members to keep the inside fluid-tight and protect electrical elements and others, and therefore the handpiece 21 can be treated by<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> autoclave sterilization using high-temperature highpressure water vapor.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the sheath unit 22 detachably disposed to the handpiece 21 includes a cylindrical sheath 54. A columnar probe 55 is fitted into the sheath 54, and the probe 55 is held by the sheath 54. A distal-end portion of the probe 55 is protruded from a distal-end portion of the sheath to form a treatment portion 56 to treat a living tissue.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, a coupling mechanism to couple the sheath unit 22 with the handpiece 21 detachably and coaxially is formed at the coupling cylinder 46 of the handpiece 21 and the proximal-end portion of the sheath 54 in the sheath unit 22. When the sheath unit 22 is coupled with the handpiece 21, the proximal-end portion of the probe 55 of the sheath unit 22 is pressed against the distal-end portion of the horn 31 of the handpiece 21. The vibrator 24 of the handpiece 21 and the probe 55 of the sheath unit 22 are ultrasonic-vibrated integrally, the proximal end and the distal end of the probe 55 serve as antinode positions of the vibration, and an axial length L2 of the probe 55 is a length corresponding to a half wavelength of the ultrasonic vibration. Further, a high-frequency current flows through the vibrator 24 of the handpiece 21 and so the high-frequency current flows through the probe 55.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As explained above, in the surgical instrument, a high-frequency current is output to the piezoelectric element portion 26, the high-frequency current flows through the vibrator 24 and the probe 55, and the treatment portion 56 of the probe 55 is press against a living tissue, thereby giving the living tissue a high-frequency treatment. Furthermore, a driving current is output to the piezoelectric element portion 26, the vibrator 24 and the probe 55 are ultrasonic vibrated integrally, and the treatment portion 56 of the probe<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> 55 is pressed against a living tissue, thereby giving the living tissue an ultrasonic treatment. Moreover, the surgical instrument can operate in various modes in accordance with a high-frequency current and a driving current output to the piezoelectric element portion 26. For example, a high-frequency incision mode where strong incision and very weak coagulation are performed by means of the high-frequency current; a high-frequency coagulation mode where strong coagulation and very weak incision are performed by means of the high-frequency current; a simultaneously incision mode where strong incision and weak coagulation are performed by means of both the high-frequency current and the ultrasonic vibration; a simultaneous coagulation mode where strong coagulation and strong incision are performed by means of both the high-frequency current and the ultrasonic vibration; and an ultrasonic incision and dissection mode where weak coagulation and weak incision are performed by means of the ultrasonic vibration. In the surgical instrument according to this embodiment, three modes are adopted, and when any one of the three hand switches 52a, 52b, and 52c is pressed, the surgical instrument is activated in any one of the three modes. A mode to be adopted and assignment of the modes to the hand switches 52a, 52b, and 52c may be arbitrarily set. For example, (i) the high-frequency incision mode/the high-frequency coagulation mode/the simultaneous coagulation mode, (ii) the high-frequency incision mode/the simultaneous coagulation mode/the high-frequency coagulation mode, (iii) the high-frequency incision mode/the simultaneous coagulation mode/the ultrasonic incision and dissection mode, (iv) the high-frequency incision mode/the ultrasonic incision and dissection mode/the simultaneous coagulation mode, (v) the high-frequency incision mode/the high-frequency coagulation mode/the ultrasonic incision and dissection mode, or (vi) the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> simultaneous incision mode/the simultaneous coagulation mode/the ultrasonic incision and dissection mode may be assigned to the hand switches 52a, 52b, and 52c at the distal end/middle/proximal end position. It is to be noted that the hand switch for incision is provided closer to the distal-end side than the hand switch for coagulation on medical standards.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In the surgical instrument according to this embodiment, the axial length L1 of the vibrator 24 is the length corresponding to one wavelength or above of the ultrasonic vibration. Therefore, an axial length of the handpiece 21 is a length corresponding to approximately one wavelength or above of the ultrasonic vibration, thereby securing the axial length that facilitates holding and operating. In this embodiment, in particular, since the axial length L1 of the vibrator 24 is the length corresponding to one wavelength of the ultrasonic vibration and an axial length of the handpiece 21 is a length corresponding to approximately one wavelength, this is the length suitable for holding and operating the handpiece in one hand. Specifically, the axial length 11 of the piezoelectric element portion 26 of the vibrator 24 is the length corresponding to the quarter wavelength of the ultrasonic vibration, and an axial length of the support portion 48 to be supported by an operator is a length corresponding to approximately quarter wavelength of the ultrasonic vibration. Additionally, the axial length 12 of the horn 31 of the vibrator 24 is the length corresponding to the three-quarter wavelength or above of the ultrasonic vibration, and the hand switch portion 49 is arranged along the extending portion 37 of the horn 31. With such a structure, an arrangement and a shape are secured, the arrangement and the shape suitable for operating the hand switch portion 49 by a finger of a hand holding the handpiece 21 while fitting the support portion 48<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> at a base portion of a thumb and an index finger when an operator holds the handpiece 21. Although the two or more hand switches 52a, 52b, and 52c are aligned in the axial direction in the hand switch portion 49, an axial length of the hand switch portion 49 is a length corresponding to approximately a three-quarter wavelength or above of the ultrasonic vibration, and hence the two or more hand switches 52a, 52b, and 52c can be arranged with an appropriate margin. In particular, when the three hand switches 52a, 52b, and 52c are aligned and arranged in the axial direction like this embodiment, securing a length corresponding to a three-quarter wavelength of the ultrasonic vibration as the axial length 12 of the horn 31 of the vibrator 24 realizes a preferable arrangement. In addition, the outside diameter d of the extending portion 37 of the horn 31 is smaller than the outside diameter D of the piezoelectric element portion 26, and so the outside diameter of the small-diameter portion 59 of the distal-end-side inner cylinder 42 accommodating the extending portion 37 of the horn 31 is smaller than the outside diameter of the proximal-end-side inner cylinder 41 accommodating the piezoelectric element portion 26, and the switch main body 51 of the hand switch portion 49 is accommodated in the accommodation space 50 on the radially outer side of the small-diameter portion 59. Therefore, in the hand piece 21, the outside diameter of the hand switch portion 49 is equal to or smaller than the outside diameter of the support portion 48, a diameter of the periphery of the hand switch portion 49 is reduced, and so the handpiece 21 can be readily held and operated with respect to an entire balance.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">When using the surgical treatment apparatus, the sheath unit 22 is attached to the handpiece 21. After opening an abdomen, the handpiece 21 is held by one hand, the hand switches 52a, 52b, and 52c are pressed<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> to activate the handpiece 21 in various modes, and the handpiece 21 is moved to press the treatment portion 56 of the probe 56 against a living tissue, thereby treating the living tissue. Here, since a high-frequency treatment is often performed for a long time during an operation, an inconvenience occurs when the handpiece 21 is hard to be held and operated. However, since the handpiece 21 can be easily held and operated in this embodiment, an operation can be smoothly carried out.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The present invention can be applied to various surgical treatment apparatuses other than the above-explained ultrasonic output combined high-frequency surgical instrument for abdominal operations. For example, the present invention can be also applied to such an ultrasonic output combined high-frequency surgical instrument for endoscopic operations as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>. In the surgical instrument depicted in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, a handpiece 21 and a sheath unit 22 having the same structures as those in the foregoing embodiment are used. However, a sheath 54 and a probe 55 in the sheath unit 22 are long, the probe 55 has a length which is an integral multiple of a half wavelength of ultrasonic vibration, and a treatment portion 56 has a hook-like shape. Besides, the present invention can be also applied to a surgical instrument in which a sheath unit is undetachably coupled with a handpiece and an ultrasonic surgical instrument having no high-frequency treatment function.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56984870" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Handgriffteil (21) für ein chirurgisches Behandlungsinstrument, das dazu eingerichtet ist, von einem Anwender gehalten und bedient zu werden und das sich in eine axiale Richtung erstreckt, wobei das Handgriffteil (21) weiterhin dazu eingerichtet ist, zum Antreiben des Handgriffteils (21), elektrisch mit einem Hauptkörper verbunden zu werden, wobei das Handgriffteil (21) umfasst:
