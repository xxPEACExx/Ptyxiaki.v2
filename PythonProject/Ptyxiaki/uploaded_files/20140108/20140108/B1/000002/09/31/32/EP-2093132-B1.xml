Thereby, it is possible to change and adjust the resonance frequency of resonance of the wavelength depending on the distance in the magnetic field generated by the current that flows into the steering member body 24.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">According to this embodiment, effects as follows can be obtained
<ol><li>(1) The steering member 22 structure includes: the metal steering member body 24 extending substantially in the vehicle width direction 23; the metal side brackets 26 that are fixed respectively to both ends of the steering member body 24 and are attachable respectively to the vehicle body side parts 25; and the metal stay 28 that is fixed to the intermediate part of the steering member body 24 and is supportably attachable to the body floor 27. Here, the multiple ground current connecting members 41 to 46 connectable with the vehicle body metal part are provided in the intermediate part of the steering member body 24 at the intervals 51 to 57 in the longitudinal direction (vehicle width direction 23). With this structure, the resonance frequency of resonance of the wavelength depending on the distance in the magnetic field generated by the current 47 flowing into the steering member body 24 can be changed, eliminated, or adjusted.
<br/>
In other words, the magnetic field 62 is generated by the current 47 (ground current) flowing into the steering member body 24 through the side bracket 26, the stay 28, or the like, so that resonance of the wavelength depending on the distance length) of the flowing current 47 occurs in the steering member body 24. However, through the multiple ground current connecting members 41 to 46 provided at the intervals 51 to 57 in the vehicle width direction 23, the above-mentioned current 47 can be flowed into the vehicle body metal part (dash panel 21, vehicle body floor 27, or the like) from each part of the steering member body 24. Therefore, the distance of the current 47 flowing is reduced. Thereby the resonnance frequency can be controlled, and reduction and prevention of the influence due to resonance can be attained. The intervals 51 to 57 between adjacent ground current connecting members 41 to 46 can be set as needed at an optimal value according to a purpose.
</li><li>(2) Particularly, in the above-mentioned structure, each interval 51 to 57 between adjacent ground current connecting members 41 to 46 is set to be<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> not more than such a length that the resonance frequency of resonance of the wavelength to be generated can be separated from the radio reception frequency band. Thereby, poor reception of a radio can be eliminated without providing the noise filter, therefore allowing cost reduction.</li></ol></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to this embodiment, and various alternations and modifications can be made to this embodiment.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56984900" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Lenkgliedeinheit, die umfasst:
