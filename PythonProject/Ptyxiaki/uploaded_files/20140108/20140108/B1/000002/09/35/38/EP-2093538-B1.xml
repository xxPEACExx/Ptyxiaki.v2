More specifically, it relates to the rotation angle detector and the process for detecting the rotation angle, by which it becomes possible to design a space for installing such the equipment to be smaller, to widen a measuring range of the absolute rotation angle for the detectable rotation body, and to reduce a cost for production, without decreasing a detection accuracy and a resolution therefore.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">So far, a rotation angle detector (referred to as a rotation sensor hereinafter) is used in a variety of field, such as an engine for vehicle, a steering wheel, a DC motor, or the like. For example, the rotation sensor is used in a case of attaching the same to a shaft to be rotated, such as a steering shaft or the like in a vehicle, and then of detecting a rotation<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> angle of a steering wheel to be integrated with such the shaft.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, in a case of rotating a rotation body, such as the steering wheel or the like, regarding an absolute rotation angle as a θ, a state of the rotation body is similar from a visual point of view for between zero degree &lt; e &lt;= 360 degrees and 360 degrees &lt; θ &lt;= 720 degrees, and then it is difficult to distinguish there between. Therefore, there is proposed a rotation sensor for detecting the absolute rotation angle as the θ in the case of rotating the rotation body.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">According to <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2002098522A"><text>JP 2002-098522</text></patcit>, there is proposed a rotation sensor, which comprises: a first detectable body to be rotated due to a rotation body to be measured; a first rotation detecting unit for detecting a signal of the first detectable body; a second detectable body to be rotated due to a rotation body or to the first detectable body; a second rotation detecting unit for detecting a signal of the second detectable body; and an absolute angle detecting unit for detecting an absolute rotation angle of the rotation body, with reference to a gradient of a signal regarding a signal to be output from the second rotation detecting unit and to the values of a voltage (three values of zero, a positive value and a negative value).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, according to Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2002098522A"><text>2002-098522</text></patcit>, there is a problem that the gradient of the signal regarding the signal to be output from the second<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> rotation detecting unit becomes to be uncertain immediately after turning on an electric source therefore. Moreover, regarding the first rotation detecting unit, for improving a resolution therefore with using a signal by using an optical encoder method, there is a problem that it becomes necessary to enlarge a sensing part of the first detectable body in a radial direction thereof.

That is to say, at the number of rotations judging unit 33, an existing section is judged whether at the first section Sc 1 or at the second section Sc 2, and then the number of rotations thereof is judged with making use of such the judged existing section. For example, in a case where the existing section is judged as at the first section Sc 1, a difference of the phases ΔT between the first continuous signal for the angle and the second continuous signal for the angle for each of the Sc 1 is zero degree, 40 degrees, 80 degrees, 120 degrees and 160 degrees respectively. That is to say, it is able to judge accurately without any problems if an allowable error of the angle for the first angle sensor 13 and for the second angle sensor 23 is approximately ±15 degrees as in total (&lt; ±20 degrees). For example, in a case where the difference of the phases ΔT between the first continuous signal for the angle and the second continuous signal for the angle is assumed to be as 35 degrees, it is able to judge the number of rotations therefore as two. That is to say, the allowable error becomes to be widened as double in a case where the existing section is judged and then the number of rotations therefore is judged thereby (as conventional, the individual allowable errors regarding the angles for both of the sensors has to satisfy that &lt; ±10 degrees as in total respectively).</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Still further, regarding the large angle calculating unit 34, the absolute rotation angle of the shaft S is calculated thereat, with reference to the number of rotations for the first rotor 11 and to (the rotation angle according to) the first continuous signal for the angle, that are judged by using the number of rotations judging unit 33.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Thus, at the rotation sensor 10, it becomes able to detect the absolute rotation angle of the shaft S.

Here, according<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> to the present invention, the value of relations as the K is satisfied with which is not an integer. Moreover, the cycle of the rotation angle as the Tc, the cycle of the angle section for judgment as the Sc and the cyclic difference as the ΔS satisfy the expression of relations as the Sc = Tc / i = ΔS · j (the i and the j are positive integers respectively, and the symbol "·" means a multiplication operator).</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Thus, a degree of magnitude regarding the value of the K becomes to influence onto the accuracy and the resolution of the rotation sensor 10. Moreover, the same becomes to influence onto a size of the rotor 21, that is to say, a size of the rotation sensor 10. Hence, the value of the K becomes to be as between 1.8 5 ≤ K ≤ 2.25 in a case where the i (= Tc / Sc) = 2, for designing therewith the detection accuracy and the resolution to be as higher regarding the absolute rotation angle of the rotation sensor 10, for designing therewith the measuring range of the absolute rotation angle thereof to be as wider, and for designing therewith the space for the installation thereof to be as smaller.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a table for explaining a range for measuring an angle with using the rotation sensor 10 regarding the range thereof as between 1.8 ≤ K ≤ 2.25.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Here, the range for measuring the angle according to the rotation sensor 10 is a least common multiple between the cycle of the rotation angle as the Tc for the first rotor 11 and the cycle of the rotation angle as the Tm for the first rotor 21. Moreover, an α and a β are values that correspond to a number of teeth for the first gear 14 and to a number of teeth for the second gear 24 respectively. That is to say, in a case where the number of teeth for the first gear 14 is defined as the number of teeth of the first gear, and the number of teeth for the second gear 24 is defined as the number of teeth of the second gear respectively, the α and the β are the values that the number of teeth of the first gear and the number of teeth of the second gear are divided by a greatest common measure between the number of teeth of the first gear and the number of teeth of the second gear respectively. Further, the α is the value by which 360 degrees is divisible, because the cycle of the rotation angle as the Tc and the cycle of the rotation angle as the Tm are the integers respectively.

However, it becomes possible to design the resolution and the accuracy therefore to be as the K times as higher than the former case, by defining the second angle sensor 23 to be as the main sensor and the first angle sensor 13 to be as the substitutive sensor. Further, the allowable error becomes to be as the i times as larger than conventional regarding the judgment of the number of rotations therefore, according to the designing the existing section to be divided into the i pieces (here, there are two pieces).
