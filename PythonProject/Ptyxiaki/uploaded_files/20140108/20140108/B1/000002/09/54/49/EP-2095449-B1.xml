mxw-id="PDES63960712" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><heading id="h0002"><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to carbon foam for use in batteries. More particularly, the present invention relates to non-conductive carbon foams having improved cell size uniformity and high pore volume, providing for a better acid battery. The invention also includes the cell components of a battery which incorporate nonconductive carbon foam.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>BACKGROUND ART</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Typical lead acid batteries are the most commonly utilized rechargeable batteries, comprising generally at least one positive element, at least one negative element, and an electrolytic solution. One of the drawbacks of lead acid batteries is that both the positive elements and the negative elements are formed from lead, thereby giving the battery a substantial weight. However, these batteries have maintained popularity as they are relatively low cost and can provide ample power for items such as<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> starter motors for automobiles despite having one of the lowest energy-to-weight ratios of any currently produced battery type.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As noted, the substantial weight of a lead acid battery is due mostly to the lead elements which comprise the positive and negative elements within the battery. These elements function in transferring a current to and from terminals of a battery during both the charging and discharging of the battery. This action is facilitated by a paste within the battery, typically a lead paste, which provides for a chemical reaction which either stores or expends energy as an electric current from the battery.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The standard lead acid battery for an automobile is designed for a 12-volt system, most often including six cells of up to 2.1 volts. The cells contains positive and negative lead elements which function as electrodes, including both lead metal and also lead dioxide. The positive lead electrode in a charged state has paste containing lead dioxide whereas the negative lead electrode can be material such as lead in a sponge formation. The electrolytic solution is most often 6-12 molar sulfuric acid which encompasses both the positive and negative electrodes.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An inherent problem with traditional lead acid batteries is that during the battery's functional life, the lead dioxide is slowly converted into<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> lead sulfate. Lead sulfate is considered a corrosion product and can impede the transfer of electrical energy to the positive electrode. An additional problem of this corrosion is the mechanical effects of the accumulation of the corrosion within the battery. Specifically, lead sulfate will cover the layer of the lead dioxide present on the positive electrode and can continuously compound resulting in a significant volume expansion within the battery, as the lead sulfate corrosion is less dense than other elements of the battery.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">This volume expansion within the battery can result in a much less than desired electrical performance as well as poor recharge characteristics. Even more problematic, the volume expansion can impart significant mechanical stress upon the positive electrode resulting in electrode deformation as well as potential cell failure within the battery. As such, the performance of the battery will substantially decrease causing a decrease in the desired service life of the battery.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As a result of the corrosion problem associated with lead acid batteries, various attempts have been made to improve the performance of batteries. One method of improving the durability of a lead acid battery is to provide the positive electrode with improved corrosion resistance. One proposed method of accomplishing this is by using a carbon material for the composition of the positive electrode, as carbon is much less susceptible to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> oxidation and the resulting corrosion than is lead under the same operating conditions. One such method is described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5512390A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,512,390 to Obushenko</text></patcit>. The Obushenko patent claims this battery is advantageous over traditional lead acid batteries as graphite plates may serve as both positive and negative electrodes resulting in considerable weight savings when compared to a conventional lead acid battery. Furthermore, the battery of the Obushenko patent assertedly does not experience the corrosion associated with the lead electrodes of conventional lead acid batteries.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">While the use of carbon instead of lead in a lead acid battery can alleviate many of the problems associated with conventional lead acid batteries, there are problems with specific modes of carbon used within the batteries. The Obushenko patent suffers from the inherent problems associated with graphite, graphite being a relatively flat and dense material with little service area available for the necessary amount of paste to create the desired electrical performance. Essentially, an increase in the surface area of a carbon element would provide for more energy transfer thus providing for greater electrical discharge and recharge characteristics.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">An alternative carbon structure for replacing the lead plates in a lead acid battery is carbon foam.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Carbon foams have attracted considerable interest recently because of their properties of low density, coupled with either very high or low thermal conductivity. Conventionally, carbon foams are prepared by two general routes. Highly graphitizable foams have been produced by thermal treatment of mesophase pitches under high pressure. These foams tend to have high thermal and electrical conductivities. For example, in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6033506A"><text>Klett, U.S. Patent No. 6,033,506</text></patcit>, mesophase pitch is heated while subjected to a pressure of 1000 psi to produce an open-cell foam containing interconnected pores with a size range of 90-200 microns. According to Klett, after heat treatment to 2800°C, the solid portion of the foam develops into a highly crystalline graphitic structure with an interlayer spacing of 0.366 nm. The foam is asserted to have compressive strengths greater than previous foams (3.4 MPa or 500 psi for a density of 0.53gm/cc).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6776936B"><text>Hardcastle et al. (U.S. Patent No. 6,776,936</text></patcit>) carbon foams with densities ranging from 0.678-1.5 gm/cc are produced by heating pitch in a mold at pressures up to 800 psi.

These foams have an open-celled structure of interconnected pores with pore sizes ranging up to 1000 microns. Unlike the mesophase pitch foams described above, they are not highly graphitizable. In a recent publication, the properties of this type of foam were described (High Performance Composites September 2004, pg.25). The foam has a compressive strength of 800 psi at a density of 0.27 g/cc or a strength to density ratio of 3000 psi/g/cc.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5888469A"><text>Stiller et al.

It is suggested that these foams are stronger than those having a glassy carbon or vitreous nature which are not graphitizable.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Carbon foams can also be produced by direct carbonization of polymers or polymer precursor blends. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US3302999A"><text>Mitchell, in U.S. Patent No. 3,302,999</text></patcit>, discusses preparing carbon foams by heating a polyurethane polymer foam at 200-255°C in air followed by carbonization in an inert atmosphere at 900°C.

An open-celled carbon foam is produced by impregnation of a polyurethane foam with a carbonizing resin followed by thermal curing and carbonization. The pore aspect ratio of the original polyurethane foam is thus changed from 1.3-1.4 to 0.6-1.2.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US6979513B"><text>Kelley et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,979,513</text></patcit>, carbon foam is used as an electrode plate within an electrode chemical battery.

There is desired, therefore, a carbon foam material which has the controllable cell structure where the cell structure strength, density, and strength-to-density ratio make the foam suitable for use in electrochemical batteries as well as in other applications.

The inventive foam exhibits a density, compressive strength and compressive strength to density ratio to provide a combination of strength and relatively light weight characteristics not heretofore seen. Moreover, the uniformity of the foam, in terms of the foregoing characteristics, and its low ash content also advantageously contribute to its usefulness in an electrochemical battery. In addition, the monolithic nature and bimodal cell structure of the foam, with a combination of larger and smaller pores, which are relatively spherical, provide a carbon<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> foam which can be produced in a desired size and configuration and which can be readily machined.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">More particularly, the inventive carbon foam has a density of 0.05 to 0.4 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (grams per cubic centimeter, g/cc)), with a compressive strength of at least 13-79 MNm<sup>-2</sup> (2000 pounds per square inch, psi)) (measured by, for instance, ASTM C695). An important characteristic for the foam when intended for use in battery applications is the ratio of strength to density as a lower density allows for a greater amount of paste to be applied. For such applications, a ratio of strength to density of at least 34.47 MPa/g/cm<sup>3</sup> 5000 psi/g/cc, more particularly less than 48.26 MPa/g/cm<sup>3</sup> 7000 psi/g/cc, is possible when the density is less than 0.4 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (0.4 g/cc).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The inventive carbon foam should have a relatively uniform distribution of pores in order to relatively uniformly contain the electrochemical paste. In addition, the pores should be relatively isotropic, by which is meant that the pores are relatively spherical, meaning that the pores have, on average, an aspect ratio of between 1.0 (which represents a perfect spherical geometry) and 1.5, more preferably no more than 1.25. The aspect ratio is determined by dividing the longer dimension of any pore with its shorter dimension.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The foam should have a total porosity of 65% to 95%, more preferably 70% to 95%. It has been found highly advantageous to have this high porosity as the carbon foam electrodes can contain a greater degree of paste. Preferably, in a bimodal pore distribution embodiment, at least 90% of the pore volume, more preferably at least 95% of the pore volume should be the larger size fraction, and from 2% to 10% of the pore volume, can be the smaller size fraction.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The larger pore fraction of the bimodal pore distribution in the electrode plate comprising carbon foam should be 10 to 150 µm (microns) in diameter, more preferably 15 to 95 µm (microns) in diameter, most preferably 25 to 95 µm (microns) in diameter. The smaller fraction of pores should comprise pores that have a diameter of<br/>
0.8 to 3.5 µm (microns), more preferably 1 to 2 µm (microns). The bimodal nature of the carbon foam provides an intermediate structure between open-celled foam and closed-cell foam, thus limiting the liquid permeability of the foam while maintaining a foam structure.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Advantageously, to produce the carbon foam for an electrochemical battery, a polymeric foam block, particularly a phenolic foam block, is carbonized in an inert or air-excluded atmosphere, at temperatures<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> which can range from 500°C, more preferably at least 800°C, up to 3200°C to prepare carbon foams useful in battery applications.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Additionally, the novel electrode plate comprises carbon foam which is considerably nonconductive.

Phenolic resins are a large family of polymers and oligomers, composed of a wide variety of structures based on the reaction products of phenols with formaldehyde. Phenolic resins are prepared by the reaction of phenol or<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> substituted phenol with an aldehyde, especially formaldehyde, in the presence of an acidic or basic catalyst. Phenolic resin foam is a cured system composed of open and closed cells. The resins are generally aqueous resoles catalyzed by sodium hydroxide at a formaldehyde:phenol ratio which can vary, but is preferably 2:1. Free phenol and formaldehyde content should be low, although urea may be used as a formaldehyde scavenger.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The foam for the electrode plate is prepared by adjusting the water content of the resin and adding a surfactant (e.g., an ethoxylated nonionic), a blowing agent (e.g., pentane, methylene chloride, or chlorofluorocarbon), and a catalyst (e.g., toluenesulfonic acid or phenolsulfonic acid). The sulfonic acid catalyzes the reaction, while the exotherm causes the blowing agent, emulsified in the resin, to evaporate and expand the foam. The surfactant controls the cell size as well as the ratio of open-to-closed cell units. Both batch and continuous processes are employed. In the continuous process, the machinery is similar to that used for continuous polyurethane foam. The properties of the foam depend mainly on density and the cell structure.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The preferred phenol is resorcinol, however, other phenols of the kind which are able to form condensation products with aldehydes can also be used. Such phenols include monohydric and polyhydric phenols,<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> pyrocatechol, hydroquinone, alkyl substituted phenols, such as, for example, cresols or xylenols; polynuclear monohydric or polyhydric phenols, such as, for example, naphthols, p.p'-dihydrexydiphenyl dimethyl methane or hydroxyanthracenes.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The phenols used to make the foam starting material can also be used in admixture with non-phenolic compounds which are able to react with aldehydes in the same way as phenol.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The preferred aldehyde for use in the solution is formaldehyde. Other suitable aldehydes include those which will react with phenols in the same manner. These include, for example, acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In general, the phenols and aldehydes which can be used in the process of the invention are those described in <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="US3960761A"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 3,960,761</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="US5047225A"><text>5,047,225</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The polymeric foam used as the starting material in the production of the inventive carbon foam should have an initial density which mirrors the desired final density for the carbon foam which is to be used for an electrode plate. In other words, the polymeric foam should have a density of from 0.1 to 0.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (g/cc), more preferably of from 0.1 to<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> 0.4 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (g/cc). The cell structure of the polymeric foam should have a porosity of between 65% and 95% and a relatively high compressive strength, i.e., on the order of at least 0.69 MNm<sup>-2</sup> (100 psi), and as high as 2.07 MNm<sup>-2</sup> (300 psi) or higher.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In order to convert the polymeric foam to carbon foam, the foam is carbonized by heating to a temperature of from 500°C, more preferably at least 800°C, up to 3200°C, in an inert or air-excluded atmosphere, such as in the presence of nitrogen. The heating rate should be controlled such that the polymer foam is brought to the desired temperature over a period of several days, since the polymeric foam can shrink by as much as 50% or more during carbonization. Care should be taken to ensure uniform heating of the polymer foam piece for effective carbonization.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">By use of a polymeric foam heated in an inert or air-excluded environment, a non-graphitizing glassy carbon foam is obtained, which has the approximate density of the starting polymer foam, but a compressive strength of at least 13.79 MPa (2000 psi) and, significantly, a ratio of strength to density of at least 34.47 MPa/g/cm<sup>3</sup> (5000 psi/g/cc), more preferably at least 48.26 MPa/g/cm<sup>3</sup> (7000 psi/g/cc), while being nonconductive. Furthermore, the carbon foam has a relatively uniform distribution of isotropic pores having, on average, an<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> aspect ratio of between 1.0 and 1.5, more preferably between 1.0 and 1.25.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The resulting carbon foam for an electrode plate has a total porosity of 65% to 95%. In one embodiment, the carbon foam is bimodal with at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, of the pore volume of the pores at 10 to 150 µm (microns) in diameter while 2% to 10%, of the pore volume of the pores are 0.8 to 3.5 µm (microns). The bimodal nature of the carbon foam for an electrode plate provides an intermediate structure between open-celled foams and closed-cell foams, limiting the liquid permeability of the foam while maintaining a foam structure. In one embodiment at least 95% of the pore volume of the pores have a diameter of between 25 and 95 microns.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The carbon foam used in the electrode plates may function both as a positive electrode and also as a negative electrode plate. Each current collector has an electrical connection point wherein the current is transferred to or from the battery, thus charging and discharging the battery while providing electrical energy to the item for which the battery is used.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In a further embodiment, the electrical connection point can be formed of a conductive material including but not limited to metals, conductive resins, conductive plastics, ceramics, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The electrode plate may take on a variety of shapes for use in an electrochemical battery. In a preferred embodiment, the carbon foam element possesses a rectangular body and a narrow width for each respective plate. Depending on the battery type and specific application, a multiplicity of shapes can be made for a corresponding battery. Furthermore, one of the novel features of the inventive carbon foam for electrode plates is the ability to easily machine the carbon foam into a desired configuration. Moreover, in an additional embodiment, phenolic foam precursors can be designed with dimensions corresponding to the desired size and shape of the carbon foam required for the electrode plates.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">An additional element needed for the construction of an electrochemical battery is a paste which is in a chemically active state thus providing the necessary means to create electrical energy from chemical energy. The paste is applied to the surface of the carbon foam electrode foam such that the paste penetrates into the porosity of the carbon foam. Advantageously, the novel electrode plates created from carbon foam which have evolved from a phenolic foam, has an extremely low density with a very<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> high porosity as well as a high surface area. As such, a greater amount of active paste can be applied to the surfaces of the electrode plate created from the carbon foam than the prior art wood-based carbon foams. Furthermore, the phenolic based carbon foam has the necessary mechanical and structural properties providing for a durable battery while simultaneously having a low density and high surface area so that a desirable amount of reactive paste can be applied to the carbon foam.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Typical reactive paste include oxides of various materials. A standard oxide which has been traditionally used with lead acid batteries is lead oxide, a reactive paste which functions well with carbon foam electrodes. This reactive paste is responsible for the battery's capabilities including both recharging and discharging energy into an electrical system. Furthermore, a variety of additives may be added to the paste to facilitate better chemical transfer as well as mechanical elements to provide for a much longer lifespan of the battery. A further advantage of using the phenolic carbon foam with low density and a high porosity and surface area is that the reactive paste penetrates deeply into the interporsity of the carbon foam electrode plates and thus is much better fixed to the electrode plates than paste in a typical lead acid battery with lead electrodes. This provides for a much more efficient electrical transfer and also increases the battery's durability when<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> subjected to mechanical stresses in that the paste will not easily remove from the carbon foam electrode plate.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The battery also contains an electrolytic solution which corresponds to the particular battery chemistry. Typically lead acid batteries and batteries using a lead oxide active paste utilize an electrolyte of sulfuric acid. Conventional lead acid batteries with lead electrodes typically have an electrolyte of 37% sulfuric acid, which is roughly of from 6 molar to 12 molar. In a further embodiment, the electrolytic solution can be of a gel design in which the electrolyte has a substantially higher viscosity than typical sulfuric acid and water solutions. Furthermore, the present invention is not limited to only sulfuric acid solutions as other acids depending on the specific type of battery and the designated reactive paste can be utilized with the novel carbon foam electrode plates.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">One embodiment of a working battery with a phenolic-based nonconductive carbon foam comprising the electrode plates is created by inserting the carbon foam plates within the housing and surrounding the plates with the electrolytic solution. Prior to the construction of the battery, the carbon foam electrode plates are typically modified so that there is a positive electrode plate and at least one negative electrode plate. Specifically, when forming the positive electrode plate and the negative electrode plate,<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> each plate is treated differently upon impregnating the plate with a lead paste. For instance, the positive electrode plate can be subjected to conditions so that a portion of the lead oxide paste is converted to lead sulfate. Following the negative plate, which is often left untreated, comprises a phenolic-based carbon foam impregnated with lead oxide paste.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In a functioning battery comprising of phenolic-based carbon foam electrodes, as the battery discharges, it creates two chemical reactions. The first reaction includes the negative electrode plates in which an excess of electrons is built with the second reaction on the positive electrode plate experiencing a shortage of electrons. As the battery discharges, the electrons flow to the apparatus in which the battery is providing power and both electrode plates impregnated with a reactive paste build up a sulfate when sulfuric acid is the electrolytic solution. In the case of lead oxide used as a reactive paste, both plates accumulate lead sulfate. Simultaneously, water builds up within the electrolytic solution thus requiring the battery to be recharged for further operation.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">As is advantageous with typical lead acid batteries, the above reaction is also reversible for batteries comprised of the novel carbon foam. Thus, during the charging process, the reaction is reversible as the positive plate will accumulate the oxide rather than lead sulfate. Furthermore, the<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> battery formed for the novel electrodes plates constructed of nonconductive, phenolic-based carbon foam can comprise a series of cells. Specifically, each single unit of the battery is considered a cell with the voltage characteristics of the cell determined by the electrochemical reaction occurring within the cell. Yet furthermore, each cell can contain multiple electrode plates of both positive and negative designations ultimately comprising the required voltage to operate the recipient device of the electrical energy.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The advantage of the novel electrode plate comprised of phenolic-based carbon foam which is also nonconductive are multiple. First, the low density and high surface area combined with the superior strength of the phenolic-based carbon foam provide for a battery which is much less heavy than traditional lead acid batteries while supplying even greater electrical output. Furthermore, the novel electrode plates are more durable with respect to mechanical stresses as the reactive paste impregnated in the porosity of the electrode plates will not separate from their electrode plates as easily under stress when compared to both traditional lead acid batteries and prior art carbon foam batteries. Yet furthermore, the carbon foam of the electrode plates is much more resistant to chemical corrosion than traditional lead electrode plates providing for a much extended service life of the battery containing phenolic-based carbon foam electrode plates.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --></p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Accordingly, by the practice of the present invention, batteries with electrode plates comprised of nonconductive phenolic-based carbon foam having heretofore unrecognized characteristics are prepared. These novel carbon foam electrode plates exhibit exceptionally high strength-to-density ratios and have a distinctive porosity, high surface area and low density which make them uniquely effective for electrochemical batteries.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The above description is intended to enable the person skilled in the art to practice the invention.
