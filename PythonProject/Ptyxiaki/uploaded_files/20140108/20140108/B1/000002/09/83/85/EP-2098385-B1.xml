Therefore, a belt-reinforcing structure having an organic fiber cord(s) spirally wound in the circumferential direction of the tire is conventionally provided radially outwardly of the belt ply as a cover member, whereby the outer diameter growth of the tire during running at high speed is restrained to thereby suppress occurrence of edge separation of the belt ply, obtaining high-speed durability.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As one example of the above conventional belt-reinforcing structure, there is known a belt-reinforcing structure having a center reinforcement layer disposed radially outwardly of a center region of the belt ply and end reinforcement layers disposed radially outwardly of opposite end regions of the belt ply. The center reinforcement layer has a cord of organic fiber greater in elongation (less in elastic modulus) such as nylon, and the end reinforcement layers have an organic fiber cord for which a hybrid cord is used, the hybrid cord having a filament of organic fiber greater in elongation such as nylon and a filament of organic fiber less in elongation (greater in<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> elastic modulus) such as aramid fiber, the filaments being twisted together (see, Japanese Patent Application <i><u>Kokai</u></i> Publication <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPHEI5338409B"><text>HEI 5-338409</text></patcit> for example).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">By configuring the belt-reinforcing structure as described above, there are advantages that the organic fiber cords of the belt-reinforcing structure can follow lifting at the time of tire vulcanization, and that outer diameter growth in the ends of the belt ply where edge separation occurs is effectively restrained, enabling high high-speed durability to be provided. Further, vibration in the sidewall portions of the tire can also be suppressed, which contributes to a reduction in tire noise.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In recent years, there are strong requirements for further improvements in tire properties with improvements in vehicle performance.

The two carcass plies 4 and 5 comprise an inner carcass ply 4 and an outer carcass ply 5. The inner carcass ply 4 has opposite end portions 4a which are each turned up around a bead core 6 embedded in a bead portion 3 from an axially inner side of the tire towards an axially outer side of the tire with a bead filler 7 being sandwiched. The outer carcass ply 5 has opposite end portions 5a which are each wrapped around the bead core 6 from the axially outer side of the tire towards the axially inner side of the tire.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The rubber layer r of each carcass ply 4, 5 is formed of rubber having a low dynamic elasticity modulus which is equal to or less than 5 MPa, thereby enhancing ride comfort. Note that the dynamic elasticity modulus referred here is a dynamic elasticity modulus when measured<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> under conditions of a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius, an initial strain of 10 %, an amplitude of ±2 % and a vibration frequency of 20 Hz, using a viscoelastic spectrometer (made by Toyo Seiki Seisaku-sho).</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Two belt plies 8 and 9 are provided radially outwardly of the carcass plies 4 and 5 in the tread portion 1, the belt plies 8 and 9 having a rubber layer u and reinforcing cords m such as steel cords embedded therein, the reinforcing cords m being obliquely arranged in the range of an angle which is equal to or greater than 25° and is less than 35° with respect to the circumferential direction T of the tire. The reinforcing cords m of the belt ply 8 are oblique toward one side with respect to the circumferential direction T of the tire, the reinforcing cords m of the belt ply 9 are oblique toward the other side with respect to the circumferential direction T of the tire, and the reinforcing cords m of the belt plies 8 and 9 cross with each other in such a manner that the oblique directions thereof with respect to the circumferential direction T of the tire are opposite.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">A belt-reinforcing structure 10 is provided radially outwardly of the belt plies 8 and 9 as a cover member, the belt-reinforcing structure 10 having organic fiber cords n spirally wound in the circumferential direction T of the tire. The belt-reinforcing structure 10 includes a center reinforcement layer 10A and end reinforcement layers 10B, the center reinforcement layer 10A being disposed radially outwardly of a center region BC of the belt plies 8 and 9 in the axial direction of the tire, the end reinforcement layers 10B being disposed radially outwardly of end regions BE of the belt plies 8 and 9 located on the opposite sides of the center region BC in the axial direction of the tire. The center reinforcement layer 10A<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> has an organic fiber cord na formed of organic fiber having an elastic modulus of 10000 MPa or less. As the organic fiber having an elastic modulus of 10000 MPa or less, nylon (nylon 66) fiber or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fiber, for example, is preferably used. The lower limit of the elastic modulus of the organic fiber cord na is preferably 1000 MPa or more in terms of handling during processing.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Each end reinforcement layer 10B has an organic fiber cord nb, which comprises a hybrid cord having a filament of organic fiber having an elastic modulus of 10000 MPa or less and a filament of organic fiber having an elastic modulus higher than that of the organic fiber having an elastic modulus of 10000 MPa or less, the filaments being twisted together. As the organic fiber having an elastic modulus of 10000 MPa or less, the same one as in the above is preferably used. As the organic fiber having a higher elastic modulus, one having an elastic modulus of 30000 MPa or more is preferably used. Examples of the organic fiber having an elastic modulus of 30000 MPa or more can include aramid fiber, polyolefin ketone fiber, poly para-phenylene benzoxazole (POB) fiber and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) fiber. Polyolefin ketone fiber is preferably used in terms of adhesion to rubber.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The hybrid cord can be obtained, for example, by bundling one or a plurality of filaments which are formed of organic fiber having an elastic modulus of 10000 MPa or less and twisted in one direction and one or a plurality of filaments which are formed of organic fiber having a higher elastic modulus and twisted in one direction, and by twisting them together in the opposite direction (the other direction).<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 3</figref>, a strip material 11 having one or a plurality of organic fiber cords n covered with rubber is used for each of the center reinforcement layer 10A and end reinforcement layers 10B. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>, the center reinforcement layer 10A has a one-layer structure in which the strip material 11 is spirally wound in the circumferential direction T of the tire from one side toward the other side in the axial direction of the tire.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Each end reinforcement layer 10B is formed into a two-layer structure having a first end reinforcement layer part 10B1 adjacent to the belt ply 9 and a second end reinforcement layer part 10B2 disposed radially outwardly thereof by spirally winding at least one strip material 11 from an axially inner side of the tire toward an axially outer side of the tire, by turning it in the opposite direction at an edge 10e of the belt-reinforcing structure and by spirally winding it from the axially outer side of the tire toward the axially inner side of the tire. Opposite edges 11e and 11f of the strip material 11 are away inwardly in the axial direction of the tire from the edge 10e of the belt-reinforcing structure. That is, an organic fiber cord nb formed of the hybrid cord covered with rubber is spirally wound from the axially inner side of the tire toward the axially outer side of the tire, turned in the opposite direction at the edge 10e of the belt-reinforcing structure and further wound spirally from the axially outer side of the tire toward the axially inner side of the tire; opposite edges of the organic fiber cord nb are away inwardly in the axial direction of the tire from the edge 10e of the belt-reinforcing structure.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In embodiments of the present invention, the end reinforcement layer 10B has a two-layer structure as described above, whereby outer diameter growth in the ends of the belt plies where edge separation occurs can be restrained more effectively than before, enabling high-speed durability to be enhanced. On the other hand, vibration in the sidewall<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> portions 2 can also be suppressed more effectively than before, enabling tire noise to be reduced.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In addition, since the opposite edges of the organic fiber cord nb of the end reinforcement layer 10B are away inwardly in the axial direction of the tire from the edge 10e of the belt-reinforcing structure which is subject to stress concentrations, occurrence of edge separation of the end reinforcement layer 10B is restrained, allowing high-speed durability to be further improved.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In embodiments of the present invention, as the hybrid cord used for the organic fiber cord nb of the end reinforcement layer 10B, one having an inflection point of 2 % or less in a stress-strain curve (S-S curve) is preferably used. This allows loosening of the hybrid cord arising from heat contraction in a cure process and a PCI (post-cure inflation) process after curing to be restrained. Therefore, vibration in the sidewall portions 2 and outer diameter growth in the belt ply ends can be even more effectively restrained. The lower limit of the inflection point is preferably 1 % or more in terms of lifting applied to a green tire when cured. Such a hybrid cord having an inflection point of 2 % or less can be obtained, for example, by suitably adjusting its twisting number and/or tension applied thereto in a dipping process.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the above embodiment, the end reinforcement layer 10B is<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> configured such that the first end reinforcement layer part 10B1 is substantially as equal in width as the second end reinforcement layer part 10B2 and the second end reinforcement layer part 10B2 is disposed on the first end reinforcement layer part 10B1 substantially in an entirely overlapping manner.
