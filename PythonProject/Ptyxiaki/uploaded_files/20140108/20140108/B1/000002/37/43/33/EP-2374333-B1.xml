The illumination devices, which may comprise light emitting diodes, emit visible light that carries codes (series of data symbols), i.e. coded light, identifying a light source or group of light sources. The light source codes are transmitted by modulating the luminance output from the illumination device. In such an illumination system, an optical receiver for receiving the codes is e.g. implemented in a remote control device for controlling the illumination devices or embedded in another device such as a switch or a sensor device.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Coded light also has advantages for mass-market illumination devices to perform e.g. fine tuning of the light sources and it allows embedding of individual information in the luminance output, representative of e.g. temperature or other status information.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Mass-market illumination devices may have a direct connection between an AC power source and the light sources. Such illumination devices typically do not contain an electrical driver. It is considered that such illumination devices should pave the road and generate a market for more advanced illumination systems.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Illumination devices wherein light sources are directly connected to an AC source have disadvantages when compared to DC-driven light sources (although these latter are more expensive), such as a lower efficacy and the production of some visible flicker resulting from the AC modulation frequency.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2006175985A"><text>US 2006/175985</text></patcit> discloses a method and circuit for driving light emitting diodes (LEDs) in multiphase.

A phase switch is provided in each conductive path.

It is also an object to provide an optical receiver capable of receiving and processing luminance output containing embedded data.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">An illumination device connectable to an AC voltage source for applying an alternating voltage during a series of time intervals is disclosed. The illumination device comprises at least a first light source and a second light source, arranged to be connected in series to the AC voltage source, to generate a luminance output in response to the alternating voltage. Selection means are provided that are configured for selectively applying the alternating voltage over the first light source or the first and second light source. A controller is provided for controlling the selection means in response to a data signal comprising data symbols such that one or more of the data symbols are contained in the luminance output.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Moreover, a method of embedding one or more data symbols of a data signal in a luminance output of an illumination device is disclosed. The illumination device is connected to an AC voltage source for applying an alternating voltage during a series of time intervals. The illumination device comprises at least a first light source and a second light source, connected in series to the AC voltage source, for generating a luminance output in response to the alternating voltage. The alternating voltage is selectively applied over the first light source or the first and second light source in response to the data signal such that one or more of the data symbols are embedded in the luminance output during a time interval.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">By selectively controlling the selection means, e.g. a switch, during a time interval the first light source or both the first and second light source can be controlled to emit light. The point in time during the time interval at which a switch occurs is referred to as the switching point. Data symbols are embedded in the luminance output of the illumination device by making the selective control dependent on the data symbols to be embedded, i.e. to modulate the switching point(s).</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">It should be noted that binary modulation of the switching point is not necessary. Other types of modulation have been envisaged as well, including analogue modulation (with an amplitude modulated control signal) and digital modulation (comprising multiple levels). A switching point may, for example, have four positions that allow two bits to be included in the luminance output during a time interval.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">It should also be noted that the disclosed illumination device is not necessarily applied for the purpose of illumination but may also be applied for data communication as such. As an example, the illumination device may constitute an access point to a network.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Claims 2 and 14 define specific embodiments according to the invention to enable data symbols to be included in the luminance output. The controller controls the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> variation of the switching point in time between light emission from the first light source and light emission from both the first and second light sources, and thus determines the duration of the first and second parts of the time interval.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The embodiments of the invention as defined in claims 3, 4 and 15 allow for differences in the switching point between time intervals while embedding identical data symbols. This dynamic variation of the switching point may e.g. be applied in a situation wherein an optical receiver moves with respect to the illumination device and the receiver requires the data to be embedded at higher luminance outputs for appropriate detection of the data signal.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The embodiment of the invention as defined in claim 5 allows for the use of a simple optical receiver capable of detecting variations in the luminance output between two time intervals.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In an embodiment of the invention as claimed in claim 6, said controller is configured for varying the duration of said first part and second part between a first of said two time intervals and a second of said two time intervals such that said luminance output of said illumination device remains substantially constant between said first and second of said two time intervals for different data symbols. This provides the advantage of a substantially constant integrated optical power for successive time intervals and thus avoids substantial visual flickering in the luminance output between successive time intervals.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In an embodiment of the invention as claimed in claim 7, the illumination device further comprises at least a third light source connected in series to said first and second light sources to contribute to said luminance output in response to said alternating voltage, wherein said selection means for applying said alternating voltage is further configured for selectively applying said alternating voltage over said third light source and wherein said controller is configured for controlling said selection means to selectively apply said alternating voltage over said third light source in response to said data signal.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In an embodiment of the invention as claimed in claim 8, said controller is configured for controlling said selection means for selectively applying said alternating voltage to said first light source and second light source such that said alternating voltage is applied over said first light source during two or more of parts of a single time interval.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The embodiments of claims 7 and 8 allow for higher data rates within a time interval. The embodiment of claim 7 provides further light sources and thus further switching points that can be modulated to embed data symbols in the luminance output. The<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> embodiment of claim 8 provides for repeated selection of the first respectively the first and second light sources within a time interval.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The embodiment of claim 9 provides small form factor light sources for the illumination device.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In order to enable retrieving the data symbols from the luminance output of the illumination device, an optical receiver is required. The optical receiver comprises an optical detector configured for detecting the luminance output containing the data symbols.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The optical receiver may further comprise at least one of an integrator and a memory. The integrator is configured for obtaining optical power from the detected luminance output for each of the two time intervals. The memory may store information indicative of a switching point between the first part and the second part during a time interval.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The optical receiver also includes a processor. In case the optical power for different data symbols is substantially equal, such as for the embodiment of claim 6, the processor may be configured to compare only corresponding parts of two time intervals to retrieve data symbols. Whereas the optical power for the entire time intervals may be substantially equal, parts of the intervals may show different optical power. Data symbols may also be retrieved by comparison of the detected switching points with stored switching points.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In an embodiment of the invention as claimed in claim 11, said data signal is a binary signal comprising first and second symbols and wherein said memory further comprises at least one luminance output profile during said one time interval representing at least one of said first and second symbols.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The embodiment of the invention as defined in claim 12 allows for determining further data from the light sources, such as the light intensity received from an illumination device.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Finally, an illumination system comprising the illumination device and a remote control accommodating such an optical receiver are proposed.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Hereinafter, example embodiments of the invention will be described in further detail.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0034" num="0034">In the drawings:<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> -->

The illumination system 2 comprises a plurality of illumination devices 3. The illumination devices 3 may comprise high/low pressure gas discharge sources, inorganic/organic light emitting diodes, or laser diodes. The illumination system 2 may further comprise a remote control 4 allowing a user to control the illumination devices 3.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref> provides a circuit diagram of an illumination device 3 connected to an AC voltage source 10 arranged in series with a first light emitting diode (LED) D1 and a second light emitting diode D2. LEDs D1 and D2 emit a luminous output upon application of a voltage over these LEDS. LEDs D1 and D2 may represent groups of LEDs. Apart from various resistances, Rext, Rint and Rshunt, the circuit comprises a rectifier 11 and a selecting means 12, embodied as a switch. The switch 12 is arranged such that it enables shorting the second LED D2 in a closed state of the switch. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref>, this is done by providing a tap point between the LEDs D1 and D2.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates the alternating voltage Vmains (left-hand vertical axis) supplied by the AC voltage source 10 to the LEDs D1 and D2 for a single time interval. It is assumed that the LEDs D1 and D2 have a threshold voltage Vth of 100 Volts.
