load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><u>Technical field of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for measuring the ash content of a biological material in an automated or semi-automated procedure. The invention is particularly useful for measuring the ash content in biofuels, such as wood chips and coal.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Background</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Biomass fuels are commonly used in burn processes for generation of heat and energy. One of the most important biomass fuels is wood. However, different biomass fuels generate different amount of heat and different amount and type of residuals after burning. Great deviations exist also for different types and qualities of wood. This makes it difficult to control a burning or combustion process effectively.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The effective thermal value of a specific biomass fuel can be determined relatively precisely if the moisture content and ash content for the biomass fuel is known. However, heretofore, fast and accurate estimation of both moisture content and ash content have been difficult to achieve in practice.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Ash from biomass, such as wood, typically comes from the minerals present in the structure of e.g. trees and shrubs in addition to any soil contamination and other contaminations. Properties of wood ash depend on a variety of factors including the type of tree or shrub, the part of the tree or shrub (bark, wood, leaves), type of waste (wood, pulp, or paper residue), type of soil and climate and conditions of combustion.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Agricultural residues typically generate significantly more ash than woody biomass. Typically, the ash content in wood is about 0.5 percent, whereas it is 5 to 10 percent in diverse agricultural crop materials, and up to 30 to 40 percent in rice husks and milfoil.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The composition and amount of ash affects the biomass behavior under the high temperatures of combustion and gasification. For example, melted ash may cause problems in both combustion and gasification reactors. These problems can e.g. be clogged ash removal systems caused by slagging ash, fouling of burners and boilers from ash deposition, and severe operating problems in fluidized bed systems. When wood is combusted alone, ash deposition is not typically a problem because combustion temperatures are likely to be low. However, when biomass is co-fired with coal, combustion temperatures are considerably higher and may reach a level where slagging could occur.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DD265696A"><text>DD-A-265696</text></patcit> discloses a method of estimating ash contents of a material by scanning said material with gamma rays of two energies.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">There is therefore a need for a fast and accurate method and system for determining ash content of a biological material, and in particular for biomass fuels, which can e.g. be used directly by people in field work operation, be used in automated processes, and the like.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved method and apparatus for estimating the ash content in a biological material in an automated or semi-automated process, which overcome or at least alleviate the above-discussed problems of the prior art.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">This object is achieved by means of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a method for estimating ash contents in a biological material, comprising the steps of:
<ul><li>scan the biological material with electromagnetic radiation of at least two different energy levels;</li><li>determine the amount of radiation transmitted through said sample of the biological material at said energy levels;</li><li>estimate the moisture content in the biological material based on a relationship between said determined amount of radiation transmitted through the biological material at said energy levels; and estimating the ash content in said biological material, based on said estimated moisture content in the biological material, and average attenuation coefficients for the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> biological material without moisture, attenuation coefficients for a combustible part of the biological material and attenuation coefficients for the ash of the biological material at said energy levels.</li></ul></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention is particularly useable for estimating the ash content in biomass fuels, but it is also useable for other biological materials. In particular, it is useable for estimating the ash content of wood chips, but it may also be used for other forms of wood, as well as for other types of biological material, such as pulp, biomass fuel, coal, etc. It may also be used for processed biomass, such as lignite, torrefied biomass and hydrothermal carbon (HTC). The invention is particularly useful for biological materials in a liquid or separated form, and preferably in the form of chips.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Ash content is in the present application used to denominate the residual remaining after ashing, and preferably the residual remaining after burning/combustion at 575 ± 25°C.

Consequently, estimation of moisture content in a material is also, indirectly, an estimation of the non-moisture content. In e.g. wood chips, the material essentially consists of moisture on the one hand and fibers and ash content on the other.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The ash of biomass fuels typically comprises materials such as silicon, magnesium, aluminum, iron and calcium. The ash content has a great influence on the thermal value of the biomass. An increased ash content corresponds to a decreased thermal value. Thus, by estimation of the ash content it is also possible to deduce the thermal value of the biomass, and thus its usefulness. It is also possible to control the burning / combustion process in relation to the ash contents, in order to obtain a more effective<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> burning / combustion, and avoid ash related problems, such as slagging and the like.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The combustible part of the biological material, i.e. the part which does not constitute moisture or ash content, typically predominantly comprises carbohydrates and lignin. For wood, the carbohydrate concentration is typically in the range 65-75%. Lignin concentration is typically in the range 18-35%.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">It is to be acknowledged by the skilled addressee that the estimate of moisture content in the biological material, and calculation of the average attenuation coefficients for the biological material without moisture at said energy levels need not be distinguishable steps or made explicitly. It is also possible to integrate these steps in an integrated equation or calculation routine, arriving directly at the estimation of the ash content in the biological material.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The method of the present invention makes use of irradiation of two or more different energy levels, and determines the ash content of the material, directly or indirectly, from the measured transmission energy, i.e. the amount of the radiation of each wavelength that is absorbed in the material.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The step of determining the attenuation coefficient for moisture at the at least two energy levels is preferably made by means of reference measurements. Similarly, the step of determining the attenuation coefficients for the combustible part of the biological material and the ash of the biological material at the two or more energy levels is also preferably made by means of reference measurements.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Irradiation of the material is preferably made by scanning of the biological material with electromagnetic radiation of at least two different energy levels, wherein the biological material is arranged in a separated form, and preferably in the form of chips.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The method/apparatus according to the present invention is very well suited for use in online measurements along conveyor lines where material is transported, in pipe-lines, on conveyor belts etc. This is possible, since e.g. the present invention can be used for various and varying heights and forms of the biological material.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">However, the present invention is also very useable for measuring samples of material arranged in sample containers, e.g. for sample testing in process industries, in the field measurements, etc.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Thus, the present invention may be used in fully or partly automated procedures, and requires no, or very limited, operator interaction.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The determined ash content can be used as input for the control of subsequent processing of the biological material. Hereby, the subsequent use of the biological material becomes more efficient. For example, this information could be used for obtaining more efficient purification, incineration, combustion, etc. Further, the ash content may be used to generate an alarm or the like e.g. when a predetermined threshold value is exceeded. The sending of this information to the control system and the use of said information for the control of the subsequent process may also be automated. When used in an in-line system, the subsequent process can hereby be controlled in real-time based on said information. However, it is also possible to store the information for later use in association with the specific sample or batch of biological material.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Thus, in one line of embodiments, the scanning of the biological material with electromagnetic radiation of at least two different energy levels comprises arranging the biological material in a sample container.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In another line of embodiments, the scanning of the biological material with electromagnetic radiation of at least two different energy levels comprises scanning the biological material as it is continuously conveyed through a point of measure.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The amount of radiation transmitted through the sample of the biological material at the two energy levels is preferably determined in relation to a calibration reference value. The calibration reference value can e.g. be determined by measurement of the transmission of radiation through a reference material of a predetermined thickness, which is preferably made immediately before and/or after the each measurement through the biological material, the reference material e.g. being aluminum. Hereby, it is ensured that adequate calibration is always at hand.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Further, the moisture content of the sample of biological material is preferably based on a determination of a K-value for the biological material, said K-value being calculated as: <maths id="math0002" num=""><math display="block"><mi>K</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>ln</mi><mfenced separators=""><msub><mi>N</mi><mn>01</mn></msub><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>N</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mfenced></mrow><mrow><mi>ln</mi><mfenced separators=""><msub><mi>N</mi><mn>02</mn></msub><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>N</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mfenced></mrow></mfrac></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="38" he="17" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
wherein N<sub>01</sub>, N<sub>02</sub> are the calibrated reference values for the transmission at the two energy levels and N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub> are the transmission values through the biological material at said energy levels, and estimation of the moisture content of said biological material by comparing said calculated K-value with corresponding K-values for a similar material type, e.g. provided in the form of a reference database. It has been found by the present inventors that the K-value is relatively linear for many types of biological material, in particular for many sorts of wood, and accordingly, relatively few specific values in the reference database for each type of biological material can still be used to provide accurate estimations of a broad range of moisture content values in the sample material. The ash content for each sample may be regarded as more or less constant. When the K-values are linearly dependent on the moisture content, it may even be sufficient to store only two different K-values in the reference database.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The scanning of the sample of the biological material with electromagnetic radiation of at least two different energy levels may comprises a first scan with a first energy level, and a subsequent second scan with a second energy level.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The at least two different energy levels are both preferably of X-ray radiation wavelengths. Further, the radiation of both said energy levels are preferably emitted from a single radiation source operating in the energy range 20 - 150 kVp. Here, kVp (Peak kilovoltage) denotes the maximum voltage applied across an X-ray tube. It determines the kinetic energy of the electrons accelerated in the X-ray tube and the peak energy of the X-ray emission spectrum. The actual voltage across the tube may fluctuate.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus for estimating ash contents in a biological material in comprising:<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> -->

The biological material 102 may typically be wood chips, or other biomass fuels.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In order to scan all of the material moved past the measurement device, the measurement device comprises a radiation source 104 adapted to irradiate a target area 105 that spans across the width of the conveyor line. The radiation source 104 is adapted to provide radiation of at least two different energy levels / wavelengths. Preferably, the radiation source is an X-ray tube for provision of X-ray radiation of two or more different wavelengths. Preferably, the X-ray tube operates in the range 20-150 kVp. The output radiation from the radiation source is preferably directed towards the target area through a collimator and a lens (not shown). The radiation source 104 is controlled by means of a controller 106.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Alternatively, the radiation source 104 may comprise two or several separate juxtaposed radiation tubes, wherein the juxtaposed radiation sources radiate the different wavelengths either simultaneously or sequentially. However, preferably the different wavelength radiation traverses the material to be measured along essentially the same path. When radiation of two (or more) wavelengths is emitted simultaneously from the radiation source the intensity of the two signals should preferably be measured individually. This may be effected directly by making provisions such that certain portions of the detector by filtration only measure radiation having a certain energy level while others measure other energy levels. It may also be effected by subsequent treatment of signals, allowing superimposed signals to be separated.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">On the opposite side of the target area 105, a detector 107 is arranged to receive radiation transmitted through material located in the target area 105. The detector is preferably a semiconductor detector comprising a linear array of semiconductor detector areas 107a-c distributed across the width of the conveyor line.

This can be achieved, for example, by measuring without any biological material present. Thus, in this case, a reference measurement is obtained with air as a reference material. Alternatively, the biological material may be replaced with a reference material with known properties, such as aluminum. The reference measurements may be obtained before measuring of the biological material, during initialization, or repeatedly during the process. Alternatively, reference measurements may be obtained by relocating the radiation source 104 and the detector 107 to a location next to the conveyor line such that the radiation passes through air only on its way from the radiation source to the detector.

The material types may e.g. be different sorts of wood, such as birch, spruce, pine, oak, and alder, and also coal and other biofuels. Hereby, the same type of measurement data as obtained with the subsequent measurement of new materials can be related to exactly measured moisture content data.

The total attenuation through the material at each energy level comprises three parts: attenuation in the moisture content (water) and the attenuation in the non-moisture content, i.e. dry combustible material and ash. The attenuation in the moisture content depends on the attenuation coefficient for moisture at the specific energy level. The attenuation in the non-moisture content similarly depends on the average attenuation coefficient for the non-moisture content at the specific energy level, i.e. on the average coefficient for the dry combustible material and the average attenuation coefficient for the ash. By means of the estimation of the moisture content discussed above, the amount of moisture and non-moisture in the material are now known.

By solving this set of equations, an estimate is obtained for the amount of combustible dry biological material on the one hand, and for the amount of ash content on the other.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Thus, as a final step, the ash content of the biological material is estimated, based on the average attenuation coefficients for the biological material without moisture and attenuation coefficients for a combustible part of the biological material and ash of the biological material at the two energy levels. The determined ash content of the biological material may be used as an indirect measure of the amount of energy that can be obtained from the biological material.
