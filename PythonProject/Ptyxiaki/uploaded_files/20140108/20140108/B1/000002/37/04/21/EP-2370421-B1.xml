Aliphatic acetals as odorant were already described in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="GB1167776A"><text>GB 1167776</text></patcit>. However the structure and the organoleptic descriprition are different from the one mentioned in this application.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The compounds with the closest chemical structure and being described as having valuable organolepic properties are some acetals of citral reported in the book by S. Arctander (Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969, Montclair, New Jersey, USA), and specifically the diethyl (N° 651), the dimethyl (N°652) and the propyleneglycol (N°656) acetals. We may also cite citronellal cyclomonoglycolacetal (N° 659) as having a closest chemical structure. These compounds were used as perfuming ingredients in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2003137758B"><text>JP 2003137758</text></patcit>. However these prior art compounds are reported as having always a citrus-lemon note type, in other words a quite different note from the present invention compounds. Nothing in the prior art suggests that the invention's compounds could have their specific odor (as reported further below) or even an odor at all.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Description of the invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">We have now surprisingly discovered that 2-[(1Z)-2,5,6-trimethyl-1,5-heptadienyl]-1,3-dioxolane (compound (I)) can be used as perfuming ingredient, for instance to impart odor notes of the green type.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Said compound possesses a green, herbal odor, evoking the Clary Sage with, a nice velvety side and violet leaf undertone. This compound is totally lacking lemon-citrus notes.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The odor of the invention's compounds lacks, or does not possess significant, citrus-lemon notes, which are characteristic of the prior art compounds and in particular of the above-mentioned citral acetals. Said differences lend the invention's compounds and the prior art compounds to be each suitable for different uses, i.e. to impart different organoleptic impressions.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">As mentioned above, the invention concerns the use of compound (I) as perfuming ingredient. In other words it concerns a method to confer, enhance, improve or modify the odor properties of a perfuming composition or of a perfumed article, which method comprises adding to said composition or article an effective amount of compound (I). By "use of compound (I)", it has to be understood here also the use of any composition containing compound (I) and which can be advantageously employed in perfumery industry as active ingredients.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Said compositions, which in fact can be advantageously employed as perfuming ingredients, are also an object of the present invention.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Therefore, another object of the present invention is a perfuming composition comprising:
<ol><li>i) as perfuming ingredient, at least one invention's compound as defined above;</li><li>ii) at least one ingredient selected from the group consisting of a perfumery carrier and a perfumery base; and</li><li>iii) optionally at least one perfumery adjuvant.</li></ol></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">By "perfumery carrier" we mean here a material which is practically neutral from a perfumery point of view, i.e. that does not significantly alter the organoleptic properties of perfuming ingredients. Said carrier may be a liquid or a solid.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As liquid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, an emulsifying system, i.e. a solvent and a surfactant system, or a solvent commonly used in perfumery. A detailed description of the nature and type of solvents commonly used in perfumery cannot be exhaustive. However, one can cite as non-limiting example solvents such as dipropyleneglycol, diethyl phthalate, isopropyl myristate, benzyl benzoate, 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)-1-ethanol or ethyl citrate, which are the most commonly used.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">As solid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, absorbing gums or polymers, or yet encapsulating materials. Examples of such materials may comprise wall-forming and plasticizing materials, such as mono, di- or trisaccharides, natural or modified starches, hydrocolloids, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl acetates,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> polyvinylalcohols, proteins or pectins, or yet the materials cited in reference texts such as <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>H. Scherz, Hydrokolloids : Stabilisatoren, Dickungs- und Gehermittel in Lebensmittel, Band 2 der Schriftenreihe Lebensmittelchemie, Lebensmittelqualität, Behr's VerlagGmbH &amp; Co., Hamburg, 1996</text></nplcit>. The encapsulation is a well known process to a person skilled in the art, and may be performed, for instance, using techniques such as spray-drying, agglomeration or yet extrusion ; or consists of a coating encapsulation, including coacervation and complex coacervation techniques.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">By "perfumery base" we mean here a composition comprising at least one perfuming co-ingredient.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Said perfuming co-ingredient is not compound (I). Moreover, by "perfuming co-ingredient" it is meant here a compound, which is used in perfuming preparation or composition to impart a hedonic effect. In other words such a co-ingredient, to be considered as being a perfuming one, must be recognized by a person skilled in the art as being able to impart or modify in a positive or pleasant way the odor of a composition, and not just as having an odor.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The nature and type of the perfuming co-ingredients present in the base do not warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to intended use or application and the desired organoleptic effect. In general terms, these perfuming co-ingredients belong to chemical classes as varied as alcohols, lactones, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, acetates, nitriles, terpenoids, nitrogenous or sulphurous heterocyclic compounds and essential oils, and said perfuming co-ingredients can be of natural or synthetic origin. Many of these co-ingredients are in any case listed in reference texts such as the book by <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969, Montclair, New Jersey, USA</text></nplcit>, or its more recent versions, or in other works of a similar nature, as well as in the abundant patent literature in the field of perfumery. It is also understood that said co-ingredients may also be compounds known to release in a controlled manner various types of perfuming compounds.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">For the compositions which comprise both a perfumery carrier and a perfumery base, other suitable perfumery carrier, than those previously specified, can be also ethanol, water/ethanol mixtures, limonene or other terpenes, isoparaffins such as those known under the trademark Isopar<sup>®</sup> (origin: Exxon Chemical) or glycol ethers and glycol<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> ether esters such as those known under the trademark Dowanol<sup>®</sup> (origin: Dow Chemical Company).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">By "perfumery adjuvant" we mean here an ingredient capable of imparting additional added benefit such as a color, a particular light resistance, chemical stability, etc. A detailed description of the nature and type of adjuvant commonly used in perfuming bases cannot be exhaustive, but it has to be mentioned that said ingredients are well known to a person skilled in the art.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">An invention's composition consisting of compound (I) and at least one perfumery carrier represents a particular embodiment of the invention as well as a perfuming composition comprising compound (I), at least one perfumery carrier, at least one perfumery base, and optionally at least one perfumery adjuvant.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Preferably, any mixture resulting directly from a chemical synthesis, e.g. without an adequate purification, in which the compound of the invention would be involved as a starting, intermediate or end-product could not be considered as a perfuming composition according to the invention.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Furthermore, the invention's compound can also be advantageously used in all the fields of modern perfumery to positively impart or modify the odor of a consumer product into which said compound (I) is added. Consequently, a perfumed article comprising:
<ol><li>i) as perfuming ingredient, compound (I), as defined above, or an invention's perfuming composition; and</li><li>ii) a consumer product base ;</li></ol>
is also an object of the present invention.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">For the sake of clarity, it has to be mentioned that, by "consumer product base" we mean here a consumer product, which is compatible with perfuming ingredients. In other words, a perfumed article according to the invention comprises the functional formulation, as well as optionally additional benefit agents, corresponding to a consumer product, e.g. a detergent or an air freshener, and an olfactive effective amount of at least one invention's compound.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The nature and type of the constituents of the consumer product do not warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to the nature and the desired effect of said product.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Examples of suitable consumer product bases include solid or liquid detergents and fabric softeners as well as all the other articles common in perfumery, namely perfumes, colognes or after-shave lotions, perfumed soaps, shower or bath salts, mousses, oils or gels, hygiene products or hair care products such as shampoos, body-care products, deodorants or antiperspirants, air fresheners and also cosmetic preparations. As detergents there are intended applications such as detergent compositions or cleaning products for washing up or for cleaning various surfaces, e.g. intended for textile, dish or hard-surface treatment, whether they are intended for domestic or industrial use. Other perfumed articles are fabric softeners, fabric refreshers, ironing waters, papers, wipes or bleaches.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Some of the above-mentioned consumer product bases may represent an aggressive medium for the invention's compound, so that it may be necessary to protect the latter from premature decomposition, for example by encapsulation.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The proportions in which the compounds according to the invention can be incorporated into the various aforementioned articles or compositions vary within a wide range of values. These values are dependent on the nature of the article to be perfumed and on the desired organoleptic effect as well as the nature of the co-ingredients in a given base when the compounds according to the invention are mixed with perfuming co-ingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in the art.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">For example, in the case of perfuming compositions, typical concentrations are in the order of 0.01 % to 15 % by weight, or even more, of the compounds of the invention based on the weight of the composition into which they are incorporated. Concentrations lower than these, such as in the order of 0.001% to 5% by weight, can be used when these compounds are incorporated into perfumed articles, percentage being relative to the weight of the article.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The invention's compounds can be prepared from the known compound Methyl Citral (Arctander N° 1956) by reacting said starting material with a suitable alcohol or diol. A typical example is provided in the Examples herein below.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>Examples</u></b></heading><p id="p0029" num="0029">The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following examples, wherein the abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art, the temperatures are indicated in degrees centigrade (°C) ; the NMR spectral data were recorded in CDCl<sub>3</sub> (if not stated otherwise) with a 360 or 400 MHz machine for <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C, the chemical<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> shifts δ are indicated in ppm with respect to TMS as standard, the coupling constants J are expressed in Hz.</p><heading id="h0005"><u>Example 1</u></heading><heading id="h0006"><u>2-(Z-2,5,6-Trimethyl-hepta-1,5-dienyl)-[1,3]dioxolane</u></heading><p id="p0030" num="0030">A 3 liter 3-neck flask equipped with a thermometer, magnetic stir bar and Dean-Stark trap is charged with 675g of E- and Z-Methyl-citral (4.07 mol), 1210g of ethylene glycol (19.5 mol), 23.3g of MgCl<sub>2</sub> (0.24 mol) and 844g of toluene. The entire mixture is refluxed for 27hours during which time water and some ethylene glycol are azeotropically removed from the reaction until 92% of the starting material is consumed. After cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature, the lower phase containing unreacted ethylene glycol is discarded and the upper toluene phase is washed with saturated NaHCO<sub>3</sub> then water. After removal of toluene at reduced pressure, the crude concentrate is flash distilled under vacuum to give 789g of 95% pure E- and Z-Methyl-citralacetal (E/Z = 57/43). The latter is then carefully fractionated by distillation to give a total of 678g of distillate of which 133g is pure Z-Methyl-citralacetal and 222g is pure E-Methyl-citralacetal.
