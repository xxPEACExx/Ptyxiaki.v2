More specifically, this solution relates to the generation of energy from a fluid flow.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Different types of energy generation systems (or simply generators) are known in the art for generating energy (for example, of the electrical type) through the transformation of another type of energy; with reference in particular to the generation of energy from renewable energy sources, generators that exploit a fluid flow (for example, the wind) have attained an increasing attention in the last years.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">These (eolic) generators are commonly based on turbines (at horizontal axis), which are mounted atop vertical towers. Alternatively, generators based on parachutes have been proposed - for example, as described in<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US3887817A"><text> USUS-A-3,887,817</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US4124182A"><text>US-A-4124,182</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6555931A"><text>US-A-6,555,931</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO2004044418A"><text>WO-A-2004/044418</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO20087034421A"><text>WO-A-20087034421</text></patcit> (the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Generally, these generators are based on a parachute (or a similar element) that can be switched between a closed condition and an open condition (in which it is carried away by the wind or the water); a balloon may also be associated with the parachute, so as to maintain it lifted. The parachute and the balloon are connected to an energy converter at ground through a connection cable. The parachute is alternatively opened and closed. When the parachute is open, it is carried away from the converter by the wind (so as to generate the desired electrical energy); the parachute is then closed, and returned towards the converter (by exploiting a small fraction of the generated electrical energy).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It is also possible to provide a pair of twin sections (each one including a parachute and a balloon), which are connected to each other by a single connection cable passing through an energy converter of the reciprocating type. In this case, the two parachutes are alternatively opened and closed. When a parachute is open, it is carried away from the converter by the wind (so as to generate the electrical energy); at the same time, it returns the other parachute towards the converter (without any waste of the generated electrical energy).<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The above-described generators have a low environmental impact, and they may be installed practically everywhere; moreover, these generators are simple, reliable and easy to maintain (and then very cost effective). Notwithstanding, the generators based on the parachutes provides a very high yield. Indeed, in this case it is possible to exploit the wind at a relatively high height from the ground. As it is known, the speed of the wind generally increases moving away from the ground; for example, at 800m above the ground the wind has an average speed of 6-10 m/s for 5,000-7,000 hours a year (against an average speed of 4-5 m/s for 2,000-4,000 hours a year at 80m above the ground). Since the power of the wind (which is transformed into electrical energy by the converter) depends on the third power of its speed, it follows that any (even small) increase of the speed of the wind moving away from the ground involves a very high increase of its power.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, a problem of the above-mentioned generators is the switching of the parachutes between their opening and the closing conditions. Indeed, these operations require a relatively high energy, since at least one of them (for opening or closing the parachutes) has to be performed in opposition to the wind.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">For this purpose, it is possible to add driving cables (extending from the converter to each parachute), which are used to drive the opening and the closing of the parachute from ground. A drawback of the driving cables is their complexity (because of the need of transmitting a high force at a high distance); moreover, the driving cables are prone to malfunctioning - for example, because they may twist with the connection cable.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Alternatively, it is possible to mount a motor on board of each parachute. However, the motor must be relatively powerful, and then heavy (to provide the energy required to open and close the parachute). Therefore, the motor cannot be supplied locally neither by renewable energy generators - for example, solar panels (since they are unable to provide the required energy) nor by batteries (since their endurance is too low for practical applications). Conversely, if the motor is supplied remotely from the ground, a corresponding electrical cable extending from the converter to the parachute is required; this electrical cable is very dangerous - for example, in case of spikes or breaks thereof.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">An additional problem of the generators based on two sections is the high risk of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> twist of the corresponding portions of the connection cable that extends from the converter (with a consequent stopping of their operation). When this happens, it is necessary to lower the parachutes to ground for disentangle the portions of the connection cable. However, this operation is very complex and time consuming; moreover, the twist of the portions of the connection cable may bring about damages to the generator.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In its general terms, the solution according to embodiments of the present invention is based on the idea of exploiting the fluid flow itself for the switching.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Particularly, different aspects of the solution according to embodiments of the invention are set out in the independent claims. Advantageous features of the same solution are set out in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">More specifically, an aspect of the solution according to an embodiment of the invention proposes an energy generation system for generating energy from a fluid flow. The system includes energy conversion means. The system further includes sail means, which is switchable between an active condition (for being carried away from the energy conversion means by the fluid flow) and a passive condition (for minimizing said carrying away). Connection means is provided for connecting the sail means to the energy conversion means; the energy conversion means generates said energy when the sail means in the active condition is carried away. Return means is instead used for returning the sail means in the passive condition towards the energy conversion means. The system then includes switching means for switching the sail means to the passive condition and to the active condition in response to a maximum distance and to a minimum distance thereof, respectively, from the energy conversion means. In the solution according to an embodiment of the invention, the sail means includes a pair of sail modules that are slidable along the connection means; each sail module is individually switchable between the active condition and the passive condition. The switching means then includes stopping means for each sail module; the stopping means is adapted to stop the sliding of the corresponding sail module in the active condition when carried away, thereby causing the switching thereof to the passive condition. Passive locking means is also provided for each sail module; the passive locking means is adapted to lock the corresponding stopped sail module in the passive condition. The switching<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> means further includes coupling means for sliding each sail module locked in the passive condition in opposition to the fluid flow to a standing position along the connection means by the other sail module in the active condition when carried away. Active locking means is also provided for each sail module; the active locking means is adapted to lock the corresponding sail module in the standing position, thereby causing the switching thereof to the active condition after the unlocking from the passive condition.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Another aspect of the solution according to an embodiment of the invention proposes a corresponding method (with the same advantageous features recited in the dependent claims for the system that apply <i>mutatis mutandi</i> to the method).</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A further aspect of the solution according to an embodiment of the invention. proposes a computer program for performing this method.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A still further aspect of the solution the solution according to an embodiment of the invention proposes a corresponding computer program product.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The solution according to embodiments of the invention, as well as further features and the advantages thereof, will be best understood with reference to the following detailed description, given purely by way of a non-restrictive indication, to be read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings (wherein corresponding elements are denoted with equal or similar references and their explanation is not repeated for the sake of brevity).

The generator 100 is used to generate energy (for example, of the electrical type) from the wind; the wind (pictorially represented at the reference 105) consists of a flow of air, which is substantially parallel to ground 110 (from the left to the right in the figure).</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">For this purpose, the generator 100 includes a base 115, which is installed on the ground 110. An energy converter 120 is mounted on the base 115. A connection cable 125 connects a parachute complex 130 (including a pair of parachutes) to the power converter 120; the cable 120 has a length (for example, 1.000-1.200m) allowing the parachute complex 130 to reach a desired height above the ground 110 (for example, 700-900m), and it is dimensioned so as to sustain the applied forces (for example, being made of 12 twisted ropes in Dynema SK75, with thermic treatment and polyurethane coating). A balloon complex 135 (for example, including a pair of aerostatic balloons) is associated with the parachute complex 130, so as to maintain it lifted from the ground 110 even in the absence of the wind 105. A controller 140 is arranged in the base 115 for controlling operation of the whole generator 100; particularly, the controller 140 monitors an extension of the cable 125 from the converter 120, so as to measure a distance of the sail complex 130 from it. For example, the controller 140 is based on a microprocessor - with a control unit, a RAM being used as a working memory by the control unit, a flash E<sup>2</sup>PROM being used to store information to be preserved even when a power supply is off (particularly, a control program of the controller 140), a keypad, and a display.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In operation, starting from <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG.1A</figref>, when the parachute complex 130 is open (for example, with its upper parachute) the wind 105 carries the parachute complex 130 away from the converter 120 (towards the right in the example at issue). In this phase, the cable 125 is extracted from the converter 120 so as to accumulate energy (schematically represented with the lifting of a weight from the ground 110 in the figure); for example, the energy may be accumulated by unwinding the cable 125<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> from a rotor of an electrical generator (so as to apply a corresponding torque).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Considering now <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG.1B</figref>, when the parachute complex 130 reaches a maximum distance from the converter 120 (for example, 800-1.000m) it is closed, so as to minimize its carrying away by the wind 105. The energy that was accumulated in the previous phase is now used by the converter 120 for returning the parachute complex 130 towards the converter 120 (schematically represented with the lowering of the weight to the ground 110 in the figure). However, the energy that is wasted for returning the parachute complex 130 towards the converter 120 is only a small fraction of the accumulated energy (since the drag that is opposed by the parachute complex 130 is now very low); therefore, a net result of the above-described two phases provides a surplus of energy that is used by the converter 120 to generate electrical energy.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Moving to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG.1C</figref>, when the parachute complex 130 reaches a minimum distance from the converter 120 it is open again (with its lower parachute now); for example, the minimum distance is equal to 0.3-0.7, and preferably equal to 0.4-0.6, such as equal to 0.5 times the maximum distance (for example, 400-500m). The same operations described above are then repeated. Particularly, the parachute complex 130 is carried away by the wind 105, and the cable 125 is extracted from the converter 120 so as to accumulate energy.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Likewise, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG.1D</figref>, when the parachute complex 130 reaches the maximum distance it is closed; the energy that was accumulated in the previous phase is again used by the converter 120 for returning the parachute complex 130 towards the converter 120 (in a small fraction) and for generating electrical energy. When the parachute complex 130 reaches the minimum distance again, it is open (with its upper parachute), so as to return the generator 100 to the situation shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG.1A</figref> (with the same operations described-above that are repeated continually).</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">This structure of the generator 100 (based on a single cable) is very simple and safe.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the solution according to an embodiment of the invention, the opening and closing of the parachute complex are performed by exploiting the wind itself. Particularly, an example of operation of the solution according to an embodiment of the invention is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0007">FIG.2A-FIG.2I</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">For this purpose, the parachute complex is formed by a downstream parachute 230d and an upstream parachute 230u (with respect to the wind, flowing from the left to the right in the figure). Likewise, the balloon complex is formed by a downstream balloon 235d for the parachute 230d (fixed at a free end of the cable 125) and an upstream balloon 235u for the parachute 230u (fixed to the cable 125 between the balloon 235d and the converter, not shown to the left of the figure - for example, at 5-10m from the balloon 235d); the parachute 230u is arranged upstream the balloon 235u, and the parachute 230d is arranged upstream the balloon 235d (downstream the balloon 235u). A latch 240u for the parachute 230u is arranged upstream the balloon 230u, and a latch 240d for the parachute 230d is arranged upstream the balloon 230d (downstream the balloon 235u) - for example, 5-10m before the respective balloons 235u and 235d. The parachute 230u and the parachute 230d can slide along the cable 125 (between the latch 240u and the balloon 235u and between the latch 240d and the balloon 235d, respectively).

Therefore, the corresponding mechanisms that may be installed on board of the parachutes are very simple and light (so that they can be supplied locally - for example, by renewable energy generators or by batteries); moreover, this allows the use of very large parachutes, which can generate a high amount of energy per generator (for example, of the order of some hundreds of MW to some GW).</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">An exemplary implementation of the solution according to an embodiment of the invention is shown in <figref idrefs="f0008 f0009">FIG.3A-FIG.3E</figref>.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In detail (see <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG.3A</figref>), each parachute 230d,230u includes a sail 305d,305u (for example, of the round type with a diameter of 8-15m for a balloon 235d,235u with a diameter of 5-8m). The sail 305d,305u is provided with an apical hole 310d,310u, which allows its sliding along the cable 125. Preferably, the apical hole 310d,310u is associated with a screw, which rotates the sail 310d,305u when it slides along the cable 125 (clockwise or counter-clockwise); this increases the drag of the sail 310d,305u when it is carried away by the wind (for example, by 15-30%), with a corresponding increase of the yield of the generator.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Suspension lines 315d,315u (for example, 4-20) extend from a border of the sail 305d,305u to a collector 320d,320u (for example, a bush), which can slide along the cable 125 as well. The parachute 230d,230u is locked to the latch 240d,240u by locking the collector 320d,320u thereto; the parachute 230d,230u is instead locked in the closed condition by locking the collector 320d,320u to the apical hole 310d,310u.

A constraining cable 335 extends between the gearwheel 330 and the collector, generically denoted with the reference 320 (being provided with a spacer projecting laterally from the cable 125); the gearwheel 330 is spring biased so as to wound the cable 335 around it (counter-clockwise in the example at issue). The ratchet 325 also includes a pawl 340 (which is likewise fixed to the latch or to the apical hole); the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> pawl 340 is spring biased to engage the gearwheel 330, so as to prevent its rotation clockwise, and then the unwinding of the cable 335.

However, after the collector 320 has reached the ratchet 325, the cable 335 cannot unwind (since the pawl 340 prevents the rotation clockwise of the gearwheel 330), so that the collector 320 is maintained in this position (i.e., locked to the latch or in the closed condition).</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">With reference now to <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG.3D</figref>, when the relay 345 receives the unlocking command, the pawl 340 disengages from the gearwheel 330.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In this condition, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG.3E</figref>, the gearwheel 330 is free to rotate counter-clockwise, so that the collector 320 can move away from the ratchet 325 by unwinding the cable 325 (because the parachute is carried away from the latch or because the sail is carried away from the collector by the wind).</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The proposed implementation only requires a relay 345 to unlock the parachute from the latch (to cause its opening after reaching the balloon) or to unlock the parachute from the closed condition (to cause its opening). Therefore, the relay 345 may be supplied by a simple system that is installed on board of the parachute (for example, a battery, a photo-voltaic generator, or a small dedicated eolic generator). Moreover, the control of the ratchet only involves the sending of simple unlocking commands; therefore, these unlocking commands may be transmitted from the ground - for example, with a wireless connection (so as to avoid the addition of any auxiliary cable).</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">With reference now to <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG.4</figref>, there is shown a schematic representation of a particular of the generator according to an embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In detail, the converter 120 includes a drum 405 for wounding the cable 125.

Particularly, the generator 500 includes an energy converter 520 of the reciprocating type (mounted on the same base 115 but with a different controller 540); for example, the generator 520 includes a mechanism for converting the movement of a rotor in both directions into a unidirectional rotation that is used to generate electrical energy. In this case, the generator 500 includes two twin sections, each one being formed by a parachute complex 530a,530b and a balloon complex 535a,535b as above; in this case, however, a (single) cable 525 connects the parachute complex 530a and the parachute complex 530b to each other through the converter 520.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In operation, starting from <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG.5A</figref>, when the parachute complex 530a is open (with its upper parachute) the wind 105 carries the parachute complex 530a away from the converter 520. In this phase, the cable 525 pulls the other parachute complex 530b that is closed towards the converter 520. However, as above the energy that is wasted for pulling the parachute complex 530b towards the converter 120 is only a small fraction of the energy that is produced by the parachute complex 530a being carried away by the wind; therefore, a net result of this phase provides a surplus of energy that is used by the converter 520 to generate electrical energy.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Considering now <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG.5B</figref>, when the parachute complex 530a reaches the maximum distance it is closed; at the same time, the parachute complex 530b reaches the minimum distance, so that it is open (with its lower parachute).

Instead, when the parachute 530a is open (with its lower parachute), a terminal portion of the cable 525 associated with it is slanting from the converter 520 in the direction of the wind 105, because of its action on the parachute complex 530a.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Considering now <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG.6B</figref>, when the parachute complex 530a reaches the maximum distance it is closed.

Particularly, in an embodiment of the invention the parachute complex 530b reaches the converter 520 and it is locked in this position for a while; in this way, it is possible to perform fast operations on the corresponding section of the generator 600 (for example, to inflate the balloon complex 535b, to recharge batteries being used to supply the relays of the ratchets, and the like).</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In this condition (possibly after the unlocking of the parachute complex 530b from the converter 520), the buoyancy of the balloon complex 535b (acting vertically upwards) is completely applied to the cable 525 (arranged in the same direction); conversely, only a component of the (same) buoyancy of the balloon complex 535a (again acting vertically upwards) is applied to the cable 525 (slanting thereto), while a remaining component of the buoyancy of the balloon complex 535a acts perpendicularly to the cable 525 (towards the converter 520). As a consequence, the parachute complex 530b lifts, since the upwards force (due to the buoyancy of the balloon complex 535b) exceeds the downwards force (due to the component along the cable 525 of the buoyancy of the balloon complex 535a); at the same time, the parachute complex 530a lowers approaching the converter 520 (because of the component perpendicular to the cable 525 of the buoyancy of the balloon complex 535a).</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG.6C</figref>, the parachute complex 530b is open (with its upper parachute) with a delay from the closing of the parachute complex 530a. For example, this delay is set to a predefined time interval (such as 10-60s); alternatively, the delay is defined by a predefined offset above the minimum distance (such as 0.2-0.4 times the minimum distance, or 80-160m). Preferably, in this condition the parachute complex 530b is at a lower distance from the converter 520; for example,<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> the distance of the parachute complex 530b is equal to 0.3-0.7, and preferably equal to 0.4-0.6, such as equal to 0.5 times the distance of the parachute complex 525b (for example, 200-250m). In this way, it is strongly reduced the risk of any twist between the terminal portions of the cable 525 associated with the two parachute complexes 530a and 530b.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">As soon as the parachute complex 530b is open, the action of the wind 105 generates a torque (since it is never perfectly aligned with the rotation axis of the base 615) that rotates the base 615 by 180° around its vertical axis; consequently, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG.6D</figref>, the parachute complex 530b passes downstream and the parachute complex 530a passes upstream the wind 105. In this way, the parachute complex 530b is carried away by the wind 105 (with the corresponding terminal portion of the cable 525 that slants from the converter 520 in the direction of the wind 105); at the same time, the cable 525 pulls the parachute complex 530a towards the converter 520 (with the corresponding terminal portion of the cable 525 that moves towards the vertical from the converter 520). In this way, the parachute complex currently open is always downstream the wind 105, while the other parachute complex being closed is upstream (so as to further reduce the risk of any twist between the corresponding terminal portions of the cable 525).</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">The same operations are then repeated in a dual manner for the other parachutes of each complex 530a and 530b, until the generator 500 returns to the situation shown in <figref idrefs="f0013">FIG.6A</figref> (with the same operations described above that are repeated continually).</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Naturally, in order to satisfy local and specific requirements, a person skilled in the art may apply to the solution described above many logical and/or physical modifications and alterations.
