id="p0002" num="0002">Metal wire has application in numerous fields and industries. For example, Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding is a welding process which incorporates the automatic feeding of a continuous, consumable wire electrode that is shielded by an externally supplied gas. Copper-plated steel wire is often used as the consumable wire electrode in MIG welding. Copper-plated steel wire, for use as welding wire, has conventionally been differentiated based on certain characteristics of the wire (e.g., its composition and diameter) that may impact its performance during welding. These characteristics are predictable in that they are generally known prior to and/or controlled during the manufacturing process. Conversely, other characteristics of the welding wire that may impact its performance during welding are unpredictable because they result variably from unintended events arising during the manufacturing or subsequent processing of the wire.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">By way of example to illustrate various aspects of the general inventive concepts, methods and/or systems for manufacturing, transferring, classifying, certifying and pricing wire are disclosed herein.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A method of manufacturing wire (e.g., copper-plated steel wire) from a material (e.g., steel), according to one exemplary embodiment, is disclosed.

Accordingly, the general inventive concepts are not intended to be limited to the specific embodiments illustrated herein.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A system 100 for making wire 102, according to one exemplary embodiment, is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. The system 100 includes at least one production line 104 for forming the wire 102, such as copper-plated steel wire, from a material 106, such as steel. In one exemplary embodiment, the material 106 is flexible, round steel. Other exemplary materials can include flux cored wire, solid wire, metal cored wire, and non-coated wire. Other suitable materials may be used as needed. The production line 104 includes a series of stations. By moving the material 106 through the stations, the material 106 is transformed into the wire 102 and stored on a storage device 108, such as a reel, drum, stem, or box. Before the material 106 is introduced into the production line 104, it is selected based on characteristics of the material 106 (e.g., its composition) and its suitability for producing a particular (e.g., sized) wire.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one exemplary embodiment, the production line 104 includes a loading station 110, a cleaning station 112, a drawing station 114, a plating station 116, a coating station 118 and an unloading station 120. More or fewer stations may be used in particular or alternative production lines. For example, the plating station 116 can be omitted from a production line for producing bare wire. Furthermore, the ordering of the stations can change in particular or alternative production lines.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The loading station 110 receives a quantity (e.g., 5000 lb.) of the material 106 for delivery through the production line 104. The material 106 moves from the loading<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> station 110 to the cleaning station 112, where an outer surface of the material 106 is cleaned. In one exemplary embodiment, the cleaning station 112 uses a cleansing and/or coating agent to clean the outer surface of the material 106. After cleaning, the material 106 moves to the drawing station 114.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The drawing station 114 includes at least one die. In one exemplary embodiment, the drawing station 114 includes a series of dies D<sub>1</sub> 122, D<sub>2</sub> 124, ... D<sub>N</sub> 126 (N &gt; 1), with each die having a successively smaller opening than the previous die. In one exemplary embodiment, the drawing station 114 includes between 8 and 17 dies. A lubricant (e.g., a powder lubricant) is typically added to the material 106, prior to the material 106 entering each die, to facilitate passage of the material 106 through the dies 122, 124, 126 and to reduce wear on the dies 122, 124, 126. As the material 106 passes through the drawing station 114, a diameter of the material 106 is progressively reduced by plastic deformation to a desired dimension and consequently the length of the material 106 increases. Because of this elongation of the material 106 as it passes through the dies 122, 124, 126, the process speed is faster on the output side of the drawing station 114 than on the input side of the drawing station 114 to accommodate the increased length of the material 106.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As the material 106 leaves the drawing station 114, it optionally moves to the plating station 116 where a layer of copper is deposited on the material 106. In one exemplary embodiment, a thin copper layer is deposited. Application of the copper layer can be continuous or non-continuous.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In one exemplary embodiment, the plating station 116 includes a copper bath 128 housing a copper solution (e.g., copper sulfate, electroless additives, and sulfuric acid) in which the material 106 is submerged. In the copper bath 128, the layer of copper is deposited on the material 106 using an electroless plating process. The plating station 116 also includes a water bath 130 through which the copper-plated<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> material 106 passes to rinse off any excess copper solution. Other techniques, such as electroplating, can be used to deposit the copper layer on the material 106.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The material 106 having the copper plating then moves to a coating station 118 which imparts a surface coating to the material 106 to complete formation of the wire 102. In one exemplary embodiment, the surface coating includes a lubricant. In this case, the lubricious properties of the surface coating facilitate passage of the wire 102 through any liners (e.g., tubes for protecting the wire 102 as it is uncoiled and delivered to a weld site) and/or through a wire-delivery apparatus (e.g., a gun) during welding.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Placement of the copper layer and/or the surface coating on the material 106 provides the resulting wire 102 with properties that are well-suited for use in certain welding applications. From the coating station 118, the wire 102 moves to the unloading station 120 where the wire 102 is wound onto the storage device 108. The storage device 108 can form a final product for sale to and/or use by customers, or the storage device 108 can hold the wire 102 for subsequent processing and/or transferring to another storage device.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The production line 104 also includes process control logic 132. The process control logic 132 is software and/or hardware that controls the production line 104 in accordance with parameters input by an operator. A display 134 is connected to, or otherwise in communication with, the process control logic 132 to provide the operator with an interface for controlling and monitoring the production process.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In preparation for starting the production line 104, the operator or another person manually feeds an end of the material 106 from the loading station 110 through the cleaning station 112, the drawing station 114, the plating station 116, and the coating station 118, and around the storage device 108 at the unloading station 120. Thereafter, during the production process, rotation of the storage device 108 causes the material 106 to be pulled from the loading station 110, through the cleaning station 112,<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the drawing station 114, the plating station 116, and the coating station 118, to the unloading station 120. Other structure (e.g., rollers, circular blocks) can be used in moving the material 106 through the stations.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The entire production process is automated and ideally continues until a predetermined quantity of the wire 102 is wound on the storage device 108 (hereinafter referred to as a production run). After each production run, the production process is temporarily halted and the wire 102 is manually or automatically cut at a point near the storage device 108. The storage device 108 containing the predetermined quantity of the wire 102 is removed from the production line 104 and can be stored at a location 136 with storage devices 108 from other production runs. The removed storage device 108 is then replaced with an empty storage device 108, and the wire 102 that was previously cut is wrapped around or otherwise engages the empty storage device 108. Thereafter, the production process is restarted and automatic production of the wire 102 resumes.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Exhaustion of the material 106 at the loading station 110 is prevented by joining additional quantities of the material 106 at the loading station 110. For example, additional 4000 lb coils of steel can be welded together at the loading station 110 to maintain a continuous supply of the material 106 for the production process.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As noted above, ideally, the production process runs continuously except for the routine changing out of full storage devices 108 for empty storage devices 108 between production runs. However, unintended interruptions in the production process are an unavoidable consequence of its high-speed operation. An interruption is any significant change (e.g., reduction) in the respective speeds of the production process during a production run. In one exemplary embodiment, a production run is considered to have commenced once the storage device 108 has rotated for a predetermined period of time, which accounts for the period of time it takes for the production line 104 to transition from an initial idle state to normal process speeds during each production<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> run. In one exemplary embodiment, an interruption means the production process comes to a complete stop. The interruption can result from the operator halting the production process, for example, when a problem in the production process is observed. When an unintended interruption in the production process occurs, the resulting abrupt reduction in the process speed can cause the material 106 to deform, break and/or have significant coating variances, all of which can have a negative impact on the performance of the resulting wire 102 during welding.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">For example, an uninterrupted production run results in the wire 102 having generally uniform cast, pitch, and twist properties throughout the predetermined quantity of the wire 102. If the wire 102 is extended, the tendency of the wire 102 is to assume a circular or sinusoidal shape. Cast refers to an amplitude of the wire 102. Pitch refers to a distance the wire 102 rises or lifts from a flat surface. Twist refers to a number of turns or revolutions that the wire 102 has when held at its ends. The cast, pitch, and twist properties of the wire 102 are controlled or otherwise influenced within the production process, such that the wire 102 will exhibit a consistent and/or desired behavior.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">If any interruptions occur during a production run, however, the resulting wire 102 cannot be assured of having generally uniform cast, pitch, and twist properties. For example, interruptions during the production process can result in the material 106 being deformed, such that a deformed portion 300 results between a non-deformed first portion 302 and a non-deformed second portion 304, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>. If the deformed portion 300 is not removed during the production process, the resulting wire 102 will include the deformed portion 300, which contributes to a reduction in the uniformity of the cast, pitch, and twist properties of the wire 102. This reduction in the uniformity of the cast, pitch, and twist properties of the wire 102 can have a negative impact on the quality of the wire 102. For example, as the uniformity of the cast, pitch, and twist properties of the wire 102 are reduced, the wire 102 may become more difficult to store (e.g., on the storage device 108) in a consistent manner.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Furthermore, if substantial, the deformed portion 300 may need to be removed before the production process can resume in a normal fashion. The deformed portion 300 is typically removed (e.g., manually cut out) such that the material 106 separates into the non-deformed first portion 302 and the non-deformed second portion 304, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>. The first portion 302 and the second portion 304 of the material 106 must be reconnected so that the production process can be restarted. Typically, the first portion 302 and the second portion 304 are joined by a weld 306, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>. The weld 306 can reduce the uniformity of the cast, pitch, and twist properties of the wire 102</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Similarly, if the material 106 breaks during the production process, the material 106 separates into the first portion 302 and the second portion 304, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>. In this case, the first portion 302 and the second portion 304 of the material 106 must be reconnected before the production process can resume. As noted above, the first portion 302 and the second portion 304 are typically joined by the weld 306, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>. The weld 306 can reduce the uniformity of the cast, pitch, and twist properties of the wire 102.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Unintended interruptions during the production process can also result in the wire 102 having coating variances. When an unintended interruption occurs, the production process often slows abruptly and/or comes to a stop. As a result, application of the copper plating via the plating station 116 and application of the surface coating via the coating station 118 occur at a different rate than when the production process is operating at its normal speeds. Thus, the interruptions cause the copper plating and the surface coating to be applied in a non-uniform manner.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Each deformed portion 300, weld 306 and/or variation in copper plating or surface coating represents a potential inconsistency in the wire 102 that can have a negative impact on the performance of the wire 102 during welding. The aforementioned unintended interruptions in the production process represent the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> underlying cause of these inconsistencies. The system 100 is capable of tracking a number of interruptions that occur during each production run. Accordingly, the system 100 can identify a corresponding number of inconsistencies that likely exists in a predetermined quantity of the wire 102.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In particular, the system 100 includes stop count logic 138. In one exemplary embodiment, the stop count logic 138 is integrated with the process control logic 132. The stop count logic 138 is software and/or hardware that operates to identify the number of interruptions occurring during a particular production run (hereinafter referred to as production interruptions). The stop count logic 138 can monitor (e.g., by interfacing with the process control logic 132) any equipment and/or parameters relating to the production process to determine whether an interruption has occurred. For example, the stop count logic 138 can measure a rotational speed of a storage device 108 during a production run. In this case, the stop count logic 138 determines that an interruption has occurred each time a significant change in the rotational speed of the storage device 108 is detected during the production run. As another example, the stop count logic 138 can monitor a state of a process motor or obtain such state information from the process control logic 132. In this case, the stop count logic 138 determines that an interruption has occurred each time a significant change in the state of the process motor is detected during the production run. Other examples of equipment and/or parameters relating to the production process that can be monitored by the stop count logic 138 include loose tension in rollers, faults in winding traverse, faults due to excess torque, and/or status (e.g., open or closed) of any guard interlocks.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The stop count logic 138 also operates to associate the number of interruptions with the storage device 108 for the particular production run. Thus, each storage device 108 can be marked with the number of interruptions that occurred during production of the wire 102 stored thereon. Since the number of production interruptions is an indicator of the number of inconsistencies likely to exist in the wire 102, the number of production<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> interruptions can be used as a quality metric for differentiating different production runs of the wire 102.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In one exemplary embodiment, the storage device 108 is marked by affixing a label 140 to the storage device 108 indicating the number of production interruptions, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>. The label 140 can be affixed while the storage device 108 is at the unloading station 120, the location 136 or elsewhere. The label 140 can be affixed manually or automatically. In one exemplary embodiment, the storage device 108 has identifying information (e.g., a reel number) indicated thereon or attached thereto (e.g., an RFID tag) and the number of production interruptions is associated with the storage device 108 by mapping the identifying information and the number of production interruptions to a data store, for example, a database (not shown).</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In one exemplary embodiment, instead of or in addition to marking the storage device 108 with the number of production interruptions, the storage device 108 is grouped based on its associated number of production interruptions.

The predetermined location is designated for those storage devices 108 associated with a specific number of production interruptions or range of production interruptions (e.g., less than some predetermined threshold). In one exemplary embodiment, only those storage devices 108 having zero production interruptions associated therewith are placed at the predetermined location. In addition to the number of production interruptions, the storage device 108 can be grouped based on one or more properties (e.g., size, cast, coating, pitch, twist) of the wire 102 stored on the storage device 108.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In one exemplary embodiment, the stop count logic 138 identifies how much wire 102 (e.g., by weight, by length) was produced when an interruption occurs, thereby allowing a location of a corresponding inconsistency in the wire 102 to be identified or otherwise approximated. Based on the estimated location of the inconsistency, the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> system 100 and/or its operator can determine whether the inconsistency occurred in a portion of the wire 102 that is readily removable (e.g., near the end of a production run, near where the wire 102 is expected to be partitioned into smaller quantities). If so, the system 100 and/or its operator can remove the portion of the wire 102 with the inconsistency, thereby increasing the overall consistency of the remaining wire 102.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In producing the wire 102, it is often desirable to transfer the predetermined quantity (e.g., 4000 lbs.) of wire 102 from the storage device 108 to one or more packages 202 (e.g., 1000 lb. packaged coils of the wire 102) for sale to and/or use by customers. Accordingly, in one exemplary embodiment, a system 200 for transferring the wire 102 is provided (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>). The system 200 has at least one transfer line 204. Each transfer line 204 includes a loading station 206, a transfer station 208 and an unloading station 210. More or fewer stations may be used in particular or alternative transfer lines. Furthermore, the ordering of the stations can change in particular or alternative transfer lines.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In one exemplary embodiment, the system 200 is separate from the system 100 and includes its own process control logic 212, display 214 and stop count logic 216, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. Alternatively, the system 200 could be integral with the system 100, such that the loading station 206, transfer station 208 and unloading station 210 are included in the production line 104 and controlled by the process control logic 132, display 134 and stop count logic 138 of the system 100.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The loading station 206 receives the storage device 108 with the wire 102.

The storage device 108 may contain enough wire 102 to fill several of the packages 202. When the storage device 108 runs out of the wire 102, it can be replaced at the loading station 210 with another storage device 108 having the predetermined quantity of the wire 102.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As noted above, ideally, the transfer process runs continuously during each transfer run, with the routine changing out of full packages 202 for empty packages 202 between transfer runs and, as needed, empty storage devices 108 for full storage devices 108.

The material, such as a 4000 lb. coil of steel, is selected based on initial characteristics (e.g.,<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> diameter, composition) of the material that render it suitable for forming the wire. In one exemplary embodiment, loading the material includes moving the material from a storage location to a production location or line.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">After loading, the material is cleaned in step 806. In one exemplary embodiment, an outer surface of the material is cleaned by application of a cleansing and/or coating agent.

Because each die has a successively smaller opening than the previous die, a diameter of the material is progressively reduced by plastic deformation to a desired dimension. A lubricant (e.g., a powder lubricant) is typically applied to the material before it enters each of the dies, to facilitate passage of the material through the dies and to reduce wear on the dies.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">After the material is drawn to the desired diameter, a layer of copper is deposited on the material in step 810.

For example, the method 800 includes tracking the number of interruptions that occur during one of or any combination of two or more of the steps 804, 806, 808, 810, 812, 814, and 816. An interruption is any significant change (e.g., reduction) in the normal speeds of the production process and/or the transfer process. In one exemplary embodiment, an interruption means the production and/or transfer process comes to a complete stop.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">More or fewer steps may be present in particular or alternative methods of making the wire. For example, the plating in step 810 can be omitted if bare wire is being produced. Furthermore, the order in which the steps are performed can change in particular or alternative methods.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">In one exemplary embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref>, the method 800 tracks those interruptions that result in the production process or the transfer process coming to a stop. At that start of the method 800, a counter (e.g., a global variable "Stop") for tracking the number of stops is set to have a value of zero in step 802. After the production process commences, the method 800 continually checks, in step 820, whether or not a stop has occurred during the loading of the material. If a stop has not occurred, then loading of the material continues in step 804. If a stop has occurred, the counter is incremented by 1 in step 822. Thereafter, the loading of the material in step 804 can resume after the cause of the stop is addressed.<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --></p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The method 800 continually checks, in step 824, whether or not a stop has occurred during the cleaning of the material. If a stop has not occurred, then cleaning of the material continues in step 806. If a stop has occurred, the counter is incremented by 1 in step 826. Thereafter, the cleaning of the material in step 806 can resume after the cause of the stop is addressed.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">The method 800 continually checks, in step 828, whether or not a stop has occurred during the drawing of the material through the dies. If a stop has not occurred, then drawing of the material continues in step 808. If a stop has occurred, the counter is incremented by 1 in step 830. Thereafter, the drawing of the material in step 808 can resume after the cause of the stop is addressed.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The method 800 continually checks, in step 832, whether or not a stop has occurred during the plating of the material with the copper. If a stop has not occurred, then plating of the material continues in step 810. If a stop has occurred, the counter is incremented by 1 in step 834. Thereafter, the plating of the material in step 810 can resume after the cause of the stop is addressed.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The method 800 continually checks, in step 836, whether or not a stop has occurred during the coating of the material with the surface coating. If a stop has not occurred, then coating of the material continues in step 812. If a stop has occurred, the counter is incremented by 1 in step 838. Thereafter, the coating of the material in step 812 can resume after the cause of the stop is addressed.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">The method 800 continually checks, in step 840, whether or not a stop has occurred during the unloading of the completed wire onto the first storage device. If a stop has not occurred, then unloading of the wire continues in step 814. If a stop has occurred, the counter is incremented by 1 in step 842. Thereafter, the unloading of the wire in step 814 can resume after the cause of the stop is addressed.<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --></p><p id="p0069" num="0069">The unloading of the wire continues until the first predetermined quantity of the wire is stored on the first storage device.

If a stop has not occurred, then transfer of the wire continues in step 816. If a stop has occurred, the counter is incremented by 1 in step 846.

For example, wire 102 that encountered no interruptions during its production and/or transfer can be generally classified as higher quality wire (e.g., having more uniformity) than wire 102 that encountered a few interruptions during its production and/or transfer. Likewise, wire 102 that encountered a few interruptions can be generally classified as higher quality wire than wire 102 that encountered many interruptions. In addition to the number of production and/or transfer interruptions, the wire 102 can be differentiated based on one or more properties (e.g., size, cast, pitch, twist) of the wire 102.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --></p><p id="p0073" num="0073">The ability to classify the wire 102 based in whole or in part on characteristics (e.g., the number of interruptions encountered by the wire 102) that are indicative of the quality of the wire 102 and that are unknown until after the production and/or transfer of the wire 102 is complete, provides increased flexibility in differentiating the wire 102 across different production runs and/or transfer runs, different production lines and/or transfer lines, different manufacturers, etc. For example, a first package 202 of the wire 102 and a second package 202 of the wire 102 might have previously been considered the same or otherwise interchangeable because of similarities in the characteristics (e.g., diameter, composition) of the wire 102 in the first and second packages 202. However, if the wire 102 in the first package 202 encountered ten interruptions during its production and packaging, but the wire 102 in the second package 202 encountered only one interruption during its production and packaging, the wire 102 in the second package 202 is of a higher quality than the wire 102 in the first package 202.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">Thus, the number of interruptions can be used to differentiate each package 202 of the wire 102 into one or more distinct classes. As one example of a classification scheme, if the total number of interruptions associated with the package 202 of wire 102 is zero, the wire 102 in the package 202 is classified as zero-stop or no-stop wire; if the total number of interruptions associated with the package 202 of wire 102 is one, the wire 102 in the package 202 is classified as one-stop wire; and so on. As another example of a classification scheme, if the total number of interruptions associated with the package 202 of wire 102 is zero, the wire 102 in the package 202 is classified as premium grade wire; if the total number of interruptions associated with the package 202 of wire 102 is one to two, the wire 102 in the package 202 is classified as high grade wire; if the total number of interruptions associated with the package 202 of wire 102 is three to five, the wire 102 in the package 202 is classified as standard grade wire; and if the total number of interruptions associated with the package 202 of wire 102 is more than five, the wire 102 in the package 202 is classified as low grade wire.<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --></p><p id="p0075" num="0075">The ability to differentiate the wire 102 based on the number of interruptions encountered during the production and/or transfer of the wire 102 can be used to certify that a particular quantity of the wire 102 is interruption free, i.e., did not encounter any interruptions. The certification, for example, can take the form of indicia attached to or otherwise associated with the storage device. As a result, customers and/or users of the wire 102 can be confident that the quality of the wire 102 was not impacted by one or more interruptions during the production and/or transfer of the wire 102.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">The ability to differentiate the wire 102 based on the number of interruptions encountered during the production and/or transfer of the wire 102 can also be used as a pricing metric. Since the number of interruptions is indicative of the quality of the wire 102, the number of interruptions associated with a package 202 of the wire 102 can be taken into account when setting a price point at which the package 202 will be marketed and sold.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">The ability to differentiate the wire 102 based on the number of interruptions encountered during the production and/or transfer of the wire 102 allows the wire 102 to be better targeted to specific applications. For example, a first welding project might call for a highly consistent wire 102 having uniformity in cast, pitch, and twist properties throughout, wherein a wire 102 that encountered few, if any, interruptions during its production and/or transfer should be used. Conversely, a wire 102 that encountered several interruptions during its production and/or transfer and, thus, has less uniformity, may be sufficient for a second welding project.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">The ability to differentiate the wire 102 based on the number of interruptions encountered during the production and/or transfer of the wire 102 can also be used as a quality control mechanism. For example, if the stop control logic 138 of the system 100 determines that the number of interruptions for the storage device 108 of wire 102 exceeds a predetermined threshold value, the production run can be aborted or the storage device 108 or wire 102 rejected. Likewise, if the stop control logic 216 of the<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> system 200 determines that the number of interruptions for the package 202 of wire 102 exceeds a predetermined threshold value, the transfer run can be aborted or the package 202 of wire 102 rejected.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The above description of specific embodiments has been given by way of example. From the disclosure given, those skilled in the art will not only understand the general inventive concepts and attendant advantages, but will also find apparent various changes and modifications to the structures and methods disclosed. For example, a production run might involve multiple drawing processes, wherein a material is drawn through multiple drawing stations to form wire. It is sought, therefore, to cover all such changes and modifications as fall within the spirit and scope of the general inventive concepts, as defined by the appended claims, and equivalents thereof.<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> -->
