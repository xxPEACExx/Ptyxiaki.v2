The perturbation may be great enough to induce failure in the circuit, or at least, to bring the results of the measurement into question.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, there is shown a simplified schematic of a conventional active probe input circuit 10 that includes a probe buffer amplifier 12 with a damped compensated attenuator input. The probe amplifier 12 is located in the probe head in order to drive the probe cable transmission line that is coupled to the measurement instrument, such as an oscilloscope or the like. The probe amplifier 12 also needs to be located physically close to the probing tip in order to reduce interconnect parasitics and maintain high frequency response. A compensated RC passive attenuator having a parallel resistive/capacitive pair R1 and C1 acting as the series elements of the attenuator and parallel resistive/capacitive pair R2 and C2 acting as the shunt elements of the attenuator is commonly used in front of the probe amplifier 12 to increase the probe input dynamic range and reduce the effective probe input capacitance. The compensated RC attenuator structure is used to provide flat transmission response over a broad frequency range. The simplifief schematic of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> also includes an input damping resistor 14, which is used to adjust the probe risetime and aberrations. The damping resistor 14 may have some effect on the probe high frequency loading depending on the probe tip parasitics. The conventional active probe the impedance is usually very high at low frequencies because of the input resistance, but begins to drop off at 20dB/decade due to the effect of the input capacitance.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A newer probe input structure uses a current mode amplifier approach as representatively shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>. The current mode amplifier 20 has a resistive<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> input element 22 coupled to parallel resistive/capacitive elements R1 and C1. The parallel resistive/capacitive elements R1 and C1 are coupled to a coaxial transmission line 24 in the form of a coaxial cable. The other end of the coaxial cable 24 is series coupled to a resistive element 26 that terminates the coaxial cable 24 in its characteristic impedance. The resistive element 24 is coupled to the inverting input of a transimpedance probe amplifier 28 that has the non-inverting input coupled to ground. The inverting input node of the transimpedance probe amplifier 28 is coupled to the output of the amplifier via a parallel resistive/capacitive elements R2 and C2. The attenuated input voltage signal is converted to a current signal at the probe amplifier 28 virtual ground node. The resulting current signal is then converted by the amplifier feedback components R2 and C2 to a buffered output voltage. Although the passive input network is not a conventional compensated attenuator structure, because of the large coaxial cable capacitance, the amplifier topology makes the feedback components R2 and C2 act like the shunt elements of a compensated attenuator with the probe head components, resistive elements 22, R1 and 26, and capacitor C1 acting as the series elements.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6822463B"><text>US 6822463</text></patcit> discusses an active differential test probe with a transmission line input structure.

The wide bandwidth attenuator input circuit has a resistive element R<sub>D</sub> that is implemented as a series combinations of a probing tip resistance element R1 and an attenuator resistive element R2 functioning as a series element of a Z<sub>0</sub> attenuation circuit. The resistive element is coupled to a first resistive/capacitive pair R<sub>A</sub> and C<sub>A</sub> acting as the series elements of a compensated RC attenuator circuit. The first resistive/capacitive pair R<sub>A</sub> and C<sub>A</sub> is coupled to one side of a controlled impedance transmission line 32. The other side of the controlled impedance transmission line 32 is coupled to a termination resistive element R<sub>T</sub> for the transmission line 32 that also functions as the shunt element of the Z<sub>0</sub> attenuation circuit.

A buffer amplifier 34 having an input capacitance of C<sub>IN</sub> is<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> coupled to the junction node of the transmission line 32 with the termination resistive element R<sub>T</sub>.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The resistance of the probing tip resistive element R1 has a preferred value in the range of 50 to 150 ohms.

The resistive element R1 isolates the parasitics at the probe tip while the attenuator resistive element R2 is trimmed to provide the desired attenuation factor for the Z<sub>0</sub> attenuation circuit. This is in contrast to the conventional active probe input circuit 10 where the damping resistor 14 is trimmed for risetime and aberrations.

For a lossless transmission line, R<sub>S</sub> has a value of "0" while the resistive transmission line has a value of 10 to 50 ohms per foot. The resistive transmission line has a length of approximately 6 cm and a resistance of approximately 4 ohms.

In the case of the wide bandwidth attenuator input circuit 30, the buffer amplifier 34 has a fixed input capacitance C<sub>IN</sub> and C<sub>B</sub> is in series with the termination resistor R<sub>T</sub>. Where the resistance Rs of the transmission line 32 is "0" C<sub>B</sub> goes to infinity which indicating a short across the capacitance leaving R<sub>T</sub> terminating the transmission line. In the case where the transmission line 32 has resistance, the termination of the transmission line requires a resistive element in series with a capacitive element. In the case of the wide bandwidth attenuator input circuit 30, Rs has a resistive value of approximately 4 ohms which results in the C<sub>B</sub> having a capacitive value that is in series with the termination resistor R<sub>T</sub>.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In operation, DC to low frequency input signals are attenuated by the resistive<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> attenuator R<sub>A</sub> and R<sub>B</sub> since the resistive contributions of R<sub>D</sub> and R<sub>T</sub> are insignificant compared to the values of the resistive attenuator R<sub>A</sub> and R<sub>B</sub>.

R<sub>T</sub> and the series combination of C<sub>A</sub> and C<sub>B</sub> form a frequency domain pole that extends the bandwidth of wide bandwidth attenuator input circuit 30 over the conventional active probe input circuit 10.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">It should be noted that the Z<sub>0</sub> attenuator circuit and the compensated RC attenuator circuit may be implemented with R2 in series with C<sub>A</sub> and parallel with R<sub>A</sub> and R<sub>T</sub> in series with C<sub>B</sub> and parallel with R<sub>B</sub>. This implementation is electrically equivalent to having R2 in series with the parallel combination of R<sub>A</sub> and C<sub>A</sub> and R<sub>T</sub> in series with the parallel combination of R<sub>B</sub> and C<sub>B</sub>. At DC and low frequencies, the capacitive reactance of the C<sub>A</sub> and C<sub>B</sub> act as open circuits causing the input signals to pass through the resistive attenuator of R<sub>A</sub> and R<sub>B</sub>. As the frequencies of the input signals increase, the capacitive reactance of C<sub>A</sub> and C<sub>B</sub> decreases causing the input signals to pass through the compensated RC attenuator circuit of R<sub>A</sub>/C<sub>A</sub> and R<sub>B</sub>/C<sub>B</sub>.

Alternately, the separate<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> amplifier circuits 76, 78 could be a single differential output stage. Resistivecapacitive feedback elements R<sub>BP</sub>, C<sub>BP</sub> and R<sub>BN</sub>, C<sub>BN</sub> are coupled between the respective first input and output and the second input and output. The impedance of the feedback elements varies as a function of the frequency of the differential input signal producing a low pass filtered differential output signal. The complementary negative low pass filtered signal is coupled to second high frequency signal path 54 after the blocking capacitor C<sub>AN</sub> via output resistor R<sub>XP</sub> and the complementary positive low pass filtered signal is coupled to the first high frequency signal path 52 after the blocking capacitor C<sub>AP</sub> via output resistor R<sub>XN</sub>. The voltage amplifier 72 has low impedance outputs resulting in R<sub>XN</sub> being in parallel with R<sub>TN</sub> and R<sub>XP</sub> being in parallel with R<sub>TP</sub>. Therefore, the resistance values for the parallel combinations of R<sub>XN</sub> with R<sub>TN</sub> and R<sub>XP</sub> with R<sub>TP</sub> need to be set so that the resulting parallel resistances match the impedances of the controlled impedance transmission lines 58, 60.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The high pass filtered differential signal on the first and second high frequency signal paths 52, 54 is combined with the low pass filtered differential output signal from the voltage amplifier circuit 70 to generate a common mode rejected differential signal having frequency response from DC to greater than 15 GHz. The common mode rejected differential signal is coupled to the inputs of the differential amplifier 56. The step response of the common mode rejected differential signal at the input to the differential amplifier 56 is the combination of the step responses of the high pass filtered first and second high frequency input signal paths 52, 54 and the step response of the low pass filter voltage amplifier circuit 70 as represented by the time response graph 80. The frequency response of the common mode rejected differential signal at the input to the differential amplifier 56 is the combination of the frequency responses of the low pass filter voltage amplifier circuit 70 and the high pass filtered first and second high frequency input signal paths 52, 54 as represented by the frequency response graph 82. A flat frequency response occurs when τ for the circuit equals C<sub>BP</sub> x R<sub>BP</sub> = C<sub>AP</sub> x (Z<sub>0</sub> × R<sub>DP</sub>)/(Z<sub>0</sub> + R<sub>DP</sub>) where Z<sub>0</sub> equals R<sub>TP</sub> and C<sub>BN</sub> × R<sub>BN</sub> = C<sub>AN</sub> × (Z<sub>0</sub> × R<sub>DN</sub>)/(Z<sub>0</sub> + R<sub>DN</sub>) where Z<sub>0</sub> equals R<sub>TN</sub>.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The circuit of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6A</figref> may also by implemented using other circuit designs or methods using off the shelf components or an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) so long as the result has a one-pole, low pass response, which in combination with the high frequency paths 52, 54 produces a flat low to intermediate frequency response.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6B</figref> illustrates an transconductance amplifier 90 having a transconductance of "gm" and first and second inputs for receiving the differential input voltage signal and generating an amplified, low pass filtered differential output current signal coupled to first and second outputs. First and second high frequency<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> signal paths 52, 54 are tapped prior to the blocking capacitors C<sub>AP</sub> and C<sub>AN</sub> to provide the differential input signal to the first and second inputs of the transconductance amplifier 90 via input resistors R<sub>AP</sub> and R<sub>AN</sub>. As with the previously described voltage amplifier circuit 70, R<sub>AP</sub> and R<sub>AN</sub> have resistive values that present a high impedance to the differential input signal at low frequencies. Within the transconductance amplifier, one of the complementary positive and negative signals of the differential input signal is inverted and summed with the other complementary differential signal in a summing circuit 92 to reject common mode signals that may be present on the differential input signal. In the specific embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6B</figref>, the complementary negative signal is inverted. The summed differential input signal is coupled to separate transconductance amplifier circuits 94, 96 and amplified. The output of one of the transconductance amplifiers 76, 78 is inverted to generate the amplified, low pass filtered differential output current signal. Alternately, the separate transconductance amplifier circuits 76, 78 could be a single differential transconductance amplifier output stage. The complementary negative low pass filtered current signal is coupled to second high frequency signal path 54 after the blocking capacitor C<sub>AN</sub> via output resistor R<sub>XP</sub> and the complementary positive low pass filtered current signal is coupled to the first high frequency signal path 52 after the blocking capacitor C<sub>AP</sub> via output resistor R<sub>XN</sub>. The combination of the high impedance outputs of the transconductance amplifier 90 and the output resistors R<sub>XP</sub> and R<sub>XN</sub> provides a high impedance to R<sub>TP</sub> and R<sub>TN</sub>. As a result, the resistive values of R<sub>TP</sub> and R<sub>TN</sub> are set to match the impedances of the controlled impedance transmission lines 58, 60. A flat frequency response occurs when τ for the circuit equals C<sub>AP</sub> × (Z<sub>0</sub> × R<sub>DP</sub>)/(Z<sub>0</sub> + R<sub>DP</sub>) where Z<sub>0</sub> equals R<sub>TP</sub> and C<sub>AN</sub> x (Z<sub>0</sub> × R<sub>DN</sub>)/(Z<sub>0</sub> + R<sub>DN</sub>) where Z<sub>0</sub> equals R<sub>TN</sub>.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">An advantage of the above described wide bandwidth attenuator input circuit 50 is a reduction in the number of capacitors in the high frequency input paths 52, 54. In the previously described differential circuit, each of the high frequency circuits have two capacitors C<sub>AP</sub>, C<sub>BP</sub> and C<sub>AN</sub>, C<sub>BN</sub>. Blocking capacitors can generate parasitics at high frequencies so reducing the number of capacitors in the high frequency input paths 52, 54 reduces the chances of unwanted parasitics. The ability to terminate R<sub>TP</sub> and R<sub>TN</sub> directly to ground improves the high speed termination design, allowing termination on an integrated circuit implementation of the design. In addition, the differential active low pass filter circuit 62 does not pass common mode signals at low frequencies simplifying biasing of the differential amplifier 56 since many very high speed differential amplifiers have limited DC common mode range. Further, any trimming is done in the differential active low pass filter circuit 62 and not in the high frequency input paths 52, 54.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">It will be obvious to those having skill in the art that many changes may be made to the details of the above-described embodiments of this invention without departing from the underlying principles thereof.
