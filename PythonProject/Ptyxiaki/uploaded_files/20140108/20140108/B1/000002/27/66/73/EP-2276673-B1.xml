In addition, the invention relates to a packaging blank intended for forming such a package.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Particularly milk, cream, sour milk products, juices, and wine are commonly packed in parallelogram-shaped or ridge-topped, so-called gable top cartons, which are heat sealed from polymer-coated paperboard. Packaging blanks are supplied to a packaging machine in a continuous web, which the machine first bends and seals for a tube into which the packaged product is introduced, and then chops the filled-up tube for individual packages while closing the packages at same time by sealing the same at the bottom and top. At a vertical joint present on a side of the package, the edges of a blank become overlapped, and at the package ends, the segments of a blank corresponding thereto become folded for a flat bottom as well as for a flat top of the parallelogram-shaped package or for a ridge top of the gable top package, depending on the shapes, fold lines, and dimensioning of a blank. Hence, the closed package develops three sealing lines, on a vertical side of the package and at each end of the package. Such packages and the packaging technology required thereby lend themselves well to factory-scale packaging with a packaging machine. On the other hand, they are not suitable for small-scale packaging in which the packed product consists not of a running liquid but of a solid matter, possibly sizable solid pieces, and in which, as opposed to liquid containers, the package is not filled to the brim.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5314112A"><text>US Patent publication 5,314,112</text></patcit> discloses a parallelogram-shaped portfolio folded from a blank of paperboard, which is intended for storing sheets of paper or documents. The portfolio is of such a construction that its permanent assembled condition does not require sealing or other such fasteners. The blank sheet, from which the portfolio is foldable, is rectangular in shape and thereby considerably simpler in terms of its shape and fold lines than those required by sealed liquid containers as described above.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Publication <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO9916675A"><text>WO 99/16675</text></patcit> discloses a cube-shaped carton box, which is foldable simply from a quadratic blank, wherein fold lines define a diagonal cross which<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> constitutes a bottom and a vertical side for the box, and the blank's triangular corners are foldable for a top of the box. The cube-shaped box has not been sealed and its purpose is indeed to open and spread out for use e.g. as a game board. On the other hand, the box and blank design is such that closing the box by heat sealing would not even be possible.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="GB504528A"><text>GB 504528 A</text></patcit>, upon which the preambles of the independent claims 1 and 7 are based, describes a packaging blank obtained by removing parts from the edges of a rectangular piece of uncoated paper, to have end flaps separated from each other by cut-out stretches. The blank is folded to form a container, in which the end flaps form a top ridge for closing the container. Arguably the container cannot be made fully gas-tight, as the cut-outs in the blank form leak-prone stretches to the root of the closing ridge.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US20020192405A1"><text>US 2002/0192405 A1</text></patcit> describes a gable-top carton of polymer coated paper or paperboard. Such a carton has at least three sealing lines, the first extending along the top ridge, the second through one of the sidewalls, and the third across the bottom of the carton. The blank to be folded and sealed to form the carton has not rectangular but a more complicated shape.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, there is a demand for a rectangular outline blank for a foldable package, which is closable by a simple, single-step heat sealing process of blank panels abutted against each other. Another objective within the scope of the invention is to find an application, wherein a regular rectangle-shaped blank is foldable and heat-sealable for a tightly closed package whose liquid and gas tightness are defined by the barrier properties of a coating polymer.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A heat-sealed package of the invention, as defined in independent claim 1 is characterized in that the package has been formed by folding from a rectangular packaging blank, comprising edge flaps, which extend continuously around the blank and that the package has been closed by heat sealing together the edge flaps of the blank abutted in such a way that the flaps make up a ridge co-directional with the side walls of the package and protruding from the top of the package, the ridge constituting the only sealing line to hold the package together.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Thus, in terms of its construction, the package is a bundle gathered up around its edges, the integrity of which is up to the heat sealing of a polymer coating present at the edges. If the packaging material is polymer-coated on both sides, all material layers of the sealing line shall bond to each other over the entire surface area<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> thereof the same way as in a laminate. In addition, as the blank is rectangular in shape, its edges shall extend all the way to the package ridge constituted by a sealing line, whereby the package is closed in a liquid and gas tight manner by the sealing.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The number of sealing lines needed for a package being just one, the package lends itself to a post-filling closing procedure by means of a simple heat sealer established by heatable jaws pressing against each other. The closed package is openable by tearing the sealing line open, starting from either end of the package. If the sealing joint is opened only partially, the package forms a draining aperture the way of a pouring spout, whereby the package contents need not be drained out at one time. If the packaging material comprises thin polymer-coated paper, its opening is also implementable by tearing off partially or completely the package ridge formed by the joint. If the sealing joint is torn open all the way, the package spreads open and exposes its contents all at once. This is particularly handy in the case of lunch packages containing e.g. sandwiches or similar snacks.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Sealed product packages according to the invention are suitable for industrial fabrication, but a particularly beneficial application for the invention can be found in stores, kiosks and the like sales and distribution outlets, in which the packages can be filled and closed in small production batches or even one at a time, according to customers' orders. Notable products to be packed according to the invention include snacks and traveling lunches, whereby a single package can be adapted to contain even several different products or ingredients, including cutlery, disposable dishes, and small pouches of condiments and flavors. The package contents may also consist of a single dry product, to mention for example coffee, tea, spices, candy, cereal, popcorn, etc.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Depending on the measurements of various segments included in a blank that makes up a package of the invention, the blanks comprising basically corresponding segments and fold lines can be used for forming a parallelogram-shaped package or ridge-topped gable top package, wherein the top consists of sloping side panels interconnected by a sealed top ridge. A particularly preferred embodiment for a package of the invention comprises a gable top package, having its bottom provided with a longitudinal fold line co-directional with the package side walls and the package having its gables provided with vertical and inclined fold lines to make the package collapsible at its gables. This makes it possible for the packaging blank to be folded consistently with the package and then flattened to enable stacking the blanks in such a flattened condition. Such pre-folded blanks resemble<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> bags, making the filling and closing thereof particularly convenient at a sales or distribution outlet. A further benefit is that, as its draining progresses, the package collapses to a more flattened condition to claim less space, and a half-empty package is easy to carry along, for example in a pocket.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The package according to the invention is folded and sealed from a rectangular packaging blank. Such blanks can be supplied to a store or a distribution outlet where the packages are fabricated, preferably in the form of a rolled-up continuous web. Thus, the lines between successive blanks must be provided with perforations or other such weaknesses for easy separation of the blanks. The web of blanks can also be pleated for a zigzag-shaped stack or the blanks may come in separate stacked sheets.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Another virtue of the rectangular packaging blank is that, in the process of folding a blank for a package, the blank's edge turns up over its entire length to extend along the sealing-line forming ridge of the package. Since the packaging material has a polymer coating on both sides thereof, the blank's edges become sealed to each other in full extent for a leakproof joint. The resulting liquid and aroma tight package is particularly suitable for dry, powdered products, such as coffee, tea or condiments, which may be subjected to a prolonged storage before the package is opened.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A packaging blank of the invention according to independent claim 7, which is made of a polymer-coated fiber-based material, such as paper or paperboard, and which is provided with segments corresponding to a bottom, side and gable walls, as well as a top of the package and separated from each other by fold lines, as well as with flaps abutting each other in the process of folding the blank and being sealable to each other for closing the package, is characterized in that the blank is rectangular in shape, comprising a continuous edge flap, which extends around the blank and in an abutted condition makes up a ridge, which protrudes from the package top and which constitutes the only sealing line holding the package together.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The invention will now be described in more detail by way of examples with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which

The package's bottom 2 side walls 3, upright end walls 4, and the top's side panels 6 are rectangular in shape, and the gable triangles 5 consist of inward-folded triangular segments defined by fold lines 8. The package 1 consists of a bilaterally extrusion-coated packaging material, the coating of which comprises a heat-sealable polymer, such as e.g. polyethylene. The package is closed in a water and air tight manner by sealing together the layers of packaging paper which make up the ridge 7.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The packaging blank 9 visualized in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1</figref>, from which the package 1 of <figref idrefs="f0001">figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">3</figref> is foldable and heat-sealable, consists of a rectangular-shaped sheet of packaging paper. The blank 9 comprises segments 2a-7a, corresponding to the package parts 2-7 and defined by the fold lines 8. The edge flap 7a, extending around the blank 9, has its segments pleating on top of each other in the folding process and bonding to each other in the heat-sealing process the same way as in a laminate, resulting in the protruding ridge 7 holding the package together. Segments 10a, present in the blank's 9 corners, are pleated inside the package in the process of folding the package 1.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The package's 1 dimensions, i.e. its width, height, the steepness of its top 6, and the protrusion of its ridge 7, can be varied by modifying the measurements of the blank's 9 various segments 2a-7a. In the extreme event that the top's side segment 6a has an area which half of the bottom's 2 area, the package turns out in the shape of a parallelogram as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 4</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">Figs. 5-7</figref> illustrate, as in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">figs. 1-3</figref> respectively, a second embodiment of the invention, which only differs from that shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">figs. 1-3</figref> in the sense that the package has its bottom 2 provided with a longitudinal fold line 8' co-directional with the side walls 3, and the package has its end walls 4 provided with inclined fold lines 8" and upright fold lines 8"'. This results in a package collapsible transversely in the direction of the end walls 4, in which the end walls 4, provided with the fold lines 8" and 8"', are pleated inwards. The empty package is compressible to complete flatness and enables stacking in this condition.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">It is obvious for a skilled artisan that the embodiments of the invention are
