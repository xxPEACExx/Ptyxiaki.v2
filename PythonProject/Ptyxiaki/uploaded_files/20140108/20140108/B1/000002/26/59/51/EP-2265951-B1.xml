mxw-id="PDES63960401" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for sensing a chemical, and in particular to an immunoassay employing a chemical sensing device containing a piezo/pyroelectric transducer.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">An immunoassay is a test which measures the presence or more usually the concentration of an analyte in a biological fluid. It typically involves the specific binding of an antigen to an antibody. The antibody can be polyclonal or monoclonal, monoclonal antibodies having several benefits, including reproducibility of manufacture and containment of binding to one epitope of an analyte. In order to provide a quantifiable measure of the concentration of the analyte, the response is compared to standard samples of known concentration. The concentration of the antibody or antigen may be determined by a variety of methods, although one of the most common is to label either the antigen or antibody and detect the presence of the label.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Immunoassays can be competitive or non-competitive. In a competitive immunoassay, the antigen in the unknown sample competes with labelled antigen to bind to antibodies, which are typically immobilised on a solid phase. The amount of labelled antigen bound to the antibody site is then measured, usually by separating and measuring the labelled antigen bound to the solid phase. Clearly the response will be inversely proportional to the concentration of antigen in the unknown sample. In an analogous assay principle, labelled antibody in solution competes with antigen immobilised on a solid phase and that present in the sample, giving a similar inverse proportionality. In a non-competitive immunoassay, also referred to as an immunometric assay, the antigen in the unknown sample binds to an excess of immobilised antibodies (the "capture" antibodies) and the amount of bound antigen is measured. Unlike the competitive method, the results of the non-competitive method will be directly proportional to the concentration of the antigen. In a so-called "two-site" immunometric assay, also termed a "sandwich assay", the antigen is bound to the capture antibody site, and then labelled antibody is introduced which binds to the antigen bound to the capture antibody. The amount of labelled antibody at the site is then measured.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In a typical sandwich immunoassay, an antibody specific for an antigen of interest is attached to a polymeric support such as a sheet of polystyrene. A drop of the sample to be tested, e.g. a cell extract or a sample of serum or urine, is laid on the sheet, which is washed after formation of the antibody-antigen complex. Antibody specific for a different site on the antigen is then added, and the support is again washed. This second antibody carries a label (the labelled reporter) so that it can be detected with high sensitivity. The amount of second antibody bound to the sheet is proportional to the quantity of antigen in the sample. This assay and other variations on this type of assay are well known, see, for example, "The Immunoassay Handbook, 2nd Ed." David Wild, Ed., Nature Publishing Group, 2001.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Immunoassays of this type work particularly well for large molecular mass analytes, principally because two or more epitopes may be addressed; areas of complementarity between analyte and antibody are relatively large and relatively large differences occur between analytes, e.g. by at least an amino acid in peptides. With small molecule immunoassays, the absence of two epitopes prohibits the formation of a "sandwich". This has provided motivation for further techniques to be developed.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">One relatively new immunoassay technique is the so-called "anti-complex antibody" immunoassay which is designed to improve specificity and sensitivity of small molecule detection (see <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>C.H. Self at al. Clin. Chem. 1994, 40, 2035-2041</text></nplcit>; ibid 1994, 40, 2035-2041; and <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>L.A. Winger et al J. Immunol. Methods 1996, 199, 185-191</text></nplcit>). This immunoassay also has the advantage that it provides a direct relationship between the concentration of the analyte and signal, rather than the inverse relationship commonly seen in competitive immunoassays.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The protocol is based on the ability to raise secondary antibodies to the complex formed when the small molecule analyte binds to a specifically raised primary antibody which is immobilised on (attached to) a support. By judicious selection of the second antibody, reactivity can be chosen against an epitope formed at the junction of the primary antibody and the antigen. The binding to the complex is therefore selective in that the labelled reporter cannot bind to the "unoccupied" capture antibody or to the free analyte since the epitope is not generated until the first binding event occurs. This has been shown to be very sensitive and specific but, as currently practised, requires a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> number of washing steps, most importantly to eliminate excess unbound label before determination of the amount of labelled antibody present. This significantly adds to the complexity of the assay and substantially limits the applicability of the technique.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for detecting an analyte in a sample, comprising the steps of:
<ul><li>providing a transducer having a pyroelectric or piezoelectric element and electrodes which is capable of transducing a change in energy to an electrical signal, a first reagent immobilised on the transducer, the first reagent having a binding site which is capable of binding the analyte or a derivative of the analyte,</li><li>exposing the sample to the transducer thereby allowing the analyte or a derivative of the analyte to bind to the first reagent to form a first reagent-analyte complex;</li><li>introducing a second reagent, the second reagent having a binding site which is capable of selectively binding the first reagent-analyte complex, wherein the second reagent has a label attached thereto which is capable of absorbing electromagnetic radiation to generate energy by non-radiative decay, wherein the label is selected from a carbon particle, a coloured-polymer particle, a dye molecule, an enzyme, a fluorescent molecule, a metal particle, a haemoglobin molecule, a magnetic particle, a nanoparticle having a non-conducting core material and at least one metal shell layer, a red blood cell, and combinations thereof;</li><li>irradiating the sample with electromagnetic radiation;</li><li>transducing the energy generated into an electrical signal; and</li><li>detecting the electrical signal.</li></ul></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Thus, the labelled second reagent (the reporter) can only bind to the complex of the first reagent (immobilised capture reagent) and analyte. No binding of the reporter to the transducer surface takes place in the absence of the analyte, rather like a conventional two-site immunometric immunoassay. However, in this case the reporter only requires a single epitope (generated from the analyte-first reagent complex) rather than the two required for a conventional sandwich assay, thereby facilitating small molecule detection. As a result of the use of a transducer having a piezo/pyroelectric film, the benefit of being able to detect the binding of the second (labelled) reagent in real time without separation and washing steps is achieved.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention also provides a kit comprising: (i) a device for detecting an analyte in a sample comprising a transducer having a pyroelectric or piezoelectric element and electrodes which is capable of transducing a change in energy to an electrical signal, a first reagent immobilised on the transducer, the first reagent having a binding site which is capable of binding the analyte or a derivative of the analyte, a source of electromagnetic radiation, and a detector for detecting the electrical signal; and (ii) a second reagent, the second reagent having a binding site which is capable of selectively binding a complex formed between the first reagent and the analyte or the derivative of the analyte, wherein the second reagent has a label attached thereto which is capable of absorbing the electromagnetic radiation generated by the radiation source to generate energy by non-radiative decay, wherein the label is selected from a carbon particle, a coloured-polymer particle, a dye molecule, an enzyme, a fluorescent molecule, a metal particle, a haemoglobin molecule, a magnetic particle, a nanoparticle having a non-conducting core material and at least one metal shell layer, a red blood cell, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings, in which:
<ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> shows a device according to <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2004090512A"><text>WO 2004/090512</text></patcit>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> shows a schematic representation of the method of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> shows a device according to the present invention; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> shows a graph of counts against time, using the method of the present invention.</li></ul></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The method of the present invention provides for the detection of an analyte in a sample. As a first step, the method includes the provision of a transducer having a pyroelectric or piezoelectric element and electrodes which is capable of transducing a change in energy to an electrical signal and exposing the sample to the transducer. Such transducers are known in the art, see for example <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO9013017A"><text>WO 90/13017</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2004090512A"><text>WO 2004/090512</text></patcit>. In this regard, <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> shows the principle of the chemical sensing device 1 suitable for use in the present invention. The device 1 relies on heat generation in a substance 2 on irradiation of the substance 2 with electromagnetic radiation. The device 1 comprises a pyroelectric or piezoelectric transducer 3 having electrode coatings 4,5. The transducer 3 is preferably a film, e.g. a poled polyvinylidene fluoride film. The electrode coatings 4,5 are preferably formed from indium tin oxide having a thickness of about 35 nm, although almost any thickness is possible from a lower limit of 1 nm below which the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> electrical conductivity is too low and an upper limit of 100 nm above which the optical transmission is too low (it should not be less than 95%T). A substance 2 is held on or proximal to the transducer 3 using any suitable technique, shown here attached to the upper electrode coating 4. The reagent may be in any suitable form and a plurality of reagents may be deposited. Preferably, the substance 2 is adsorbed on to the upper electrode, e.g. covalently coupled or bound via intermolecular forces such as ionic<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> bonds, hydrogen bonding or van der Waal's forces. A key feature of this device is that the substance 2 generates heat when irradiated by a source of electromagnetic radiation 6, such as light, preferably visible light. The light source may be, for example, an LED. The light source 6 illuminates the substance 2 with light of the appropriate wavelength (e.g. a complementary colour). Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the substance 2 absorbs the light to generate an excited state which then undergoes non-radiative decay thereby generating energy, indicated by the curved lines in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. This energy is primarily in the form of heat (i.e. thermal motion in the environment) although other forms of energy, e.g. a shock wave, may also be generated. The energy is, however, detected by the transducer and converted into an electrical signal. The device of the present invention is calibrated for the particular reagent being measured and hence the precise form of the energy generated by the non-radiative decay does not need to be determined. Unless otherwise specified the term "heat" is used herein to mean the energy generated by non-radiative decay. The light source 6 is positioned so as to illuminate the substance 2. Preferably, the light source 6 is positioned substantially perpendicular to the transducer 3 and electrodes 4,5 and the substance 2 is illuminated through the transducer 3 and electrodes 4,5. The light source may be an internal light source within the transducer in which the light source is a guided wave system. The wave guide may be the transducer itself or the wave guide may be an additional layer attached to the transducer. The wavelength of illumination depends on the label used; for example, for 40 nm gold labels the preferred wavelength is 525 nm and for carbon labels the preferred wavelength is 650 nm.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The energy generated by the substance 2 is detected by the transducer 3 and converted into an electrical signal. The electrical signal is detected by a detector 7. The light source 6 and the detector 7 are both under the control of the controller 8.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In one embodiment, the light source 6 generates a series of pulses of light (the term "light" used herein means any form of electromagnetic radiation unless a specific wavelength is mentioned) which is termed "chopped light". In principle, a single flash of light, i.e. one pulse of electromagnetic radiation, would suffice to generate a signal from the transducer 3. However, in order to obtain a reproducible signal, a plurality of flashes of light are used which in practice requires chopped light. The frequency at which the pulses of electromagnetic radiation are applied may be varied. At the lower<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> limit, the time delay between the pulses must be sufficient for the time delay between each pulse and the generation of an electrical signal to be determined. At the upper limit, the time delay between each pulse must not be so large that the period taken to record the data becomes unreasonably extended. Preferably, the frequency of the pulses is from 2-50 Hz, more preferably 5-15 Hz and most preferably 10 Hz. This corresponds to a time delay between pulses of 20-500 ms, 66-200 ms and 100 ms, respectively. In addition, the so-called "mark-space" ratio, i.e. the ratio of on signal to off signal is preferably one although other ratios may be used to advantage in certain situations. Sources of electromagnetic radiation which produce chopped light with different frequencies of chopping or different mark-space ratios are known in the art. The detector 7 determines the time delay (or "correlation delay") between each pulse of light from light source 6 and the corresponding electrical signal detected by detector 7 from transducer 3. The applicant has found that this time delay is a function of the distance, d.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Any method for determining the time delay between each pulse of light and the corresponding electrical signal which provides reproducible results may be used. Preferably, the time delay is measured from the start of each pulse of light to the point at which a maximum in the electrical signal corresponding to the absorption of heat is detected as by detector 7.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Thus substance 2 may be separated from the transducer surface and a signal may still be detected. Moreover, not only is the signal detectable through an intervening medium capable of transmitting energy to the transducer 3, but different distances, d, may be distinguished (this has been termed "depth profiling") and that the intensity of the signal received is proportional to the concentration of the substance 2 at the particular distance, d, from the surface of the transducer 3.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> shows the incorporation of the device 1 from <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> in an anti-complex immunoassay of in accordance with the present invention. The transducer 3 is shown in a vertical arrangement, although other orientations are possible and even advantageous in some circumstance. The transducer 3 is coated with a first reagent shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> as a first antibody 9 (an immobilised capture antibody). The sample also contains an<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> analyte 10 and a second antibody 11 bound to a label 12 (which corresponds to the substance 2 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The first reagent 9 has a binding site (a paratope) which is capable of binding the analyte 10 or a derivative of the analyte. The analyte 10 or a derivative of the analyte binds to the first reagent to form a first reagent-analyte complex. A region (epitope) is formed in the first reagent-analyte complex by the binding of the first reagent to the analyte 10 or derivative thereof. The second reagent 11 has a binding site (paratope) which is capable of selectively binding the region thus formed on first reagent-analyte complex and hence when the second reagent 11 is added, it binds to the complex. The binding is selective because the region formed in the first reagent-analyte complex is not present until that first binding event occurs. In a preferred embodiment, the sample and the second reagent are introduced simultaneously.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The first antibody 9 has been raised against the analyte 10 and selectively binds to the analyte 10 when the sample is introduced. By judicious choice of the second antibody 11, reactivity can be chosen against an epitope formed at the junction of the first antibody 9 and the analyte 10, i.e. second reagent 11 has a binding site which is capable of selectively binding the first reagent-analyte complex 13. Thus, the second antibody 11 can only bind to the complex 13 of the first antibody 9 and the analyte 10. No binding of the second antibody 11 can take place in the absence of the analyte 10 and hence the signal obtained from the label 12 attached to the second antibody 11 is directly proportional to the analyte concentration. However, since the second antibody 11 recognises an epitope in the complex, the assay does not require two separate epitopes to be present in the analyte 10, facilitating small molecule detection. Importantly, the method of the present invention permits detection of the binding of the second antibody 11 to the first reagent-analyte complex 13 in real time, without separation and washing steps. This is a significant advantage in the art. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the assay is carried out without removing the sample from the transducer 3 between the steps of exposing the sample to the transducer 3 and irradiating the sample. Moreover, no further intervention (e.g. to separate bound and unbound second reagent) is required between exposing the transducer to the sample and irradiating the sample.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The second reagent which is not bound to the surface is free to diffuse away from the surface.

Thus, although the first and second reagents are preferably antibodies, other reagents may also be used, such as nucleic acids. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method of performing an anti-complex antibody immunoassay to detect an analyte (sometimes referred to as a "hapten", being a small molecule which, when attached to a large carrier such as a protein, can elicit an immune response) in a sample, comprising the steps of: providing a transducer having a pyroelectric or piezoelectric element and electrodes which is capable of transducing a change in energy to an electrical signal, a first antibody immobilised on the transducer, the first antibody having a binding site which is capable of binding the analyte or a derivative of the analyte, exposing the sample to the transducer thereby allowing the analyte or a derivative of the analyte to bind to the first antibody to form a first antibody-analyte complex; introducing a second antibody, the second antibody having a binding site which is capable of selectively binding the first antibody-analyte complex, wherein the second antibody has a label attached thereto which is capable of absorbing electromagnetic radiation to generate energy by non-radiative decay; irradiating the sample with electromagnetic radiation; transducing the energy generated into an electrical signal; and detecting the electrical signal. The first antibody is raised to the analyte or derivative thereof, and the second antibody is raised to the complex such that it contains an epitope present in the complex formed between the first antibody and the analyte or derivative thereof, but not present either of the first antibody or analyte/derivative thereof when taken alone.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The first reagent 9 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> attached to the surface of the transducer 3 and is preferably adsorbed on to the transducer.

The label 12 is capable of absorbing the electromagnetic radiation generated by<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> the radiation source to generate energy by non-radiative decay. Thus, to detect the presence of the label 12 proximal to the transducer 3, the sample is irradiated with a series of pulses of electromagnetic radiation.

The label is selected from a carbon particle, a coloured-polymer particle (e.g. coloured latex), a dye molecule, an enzyme, a fluorescent molecule, a metal (e.g. gold) particle, a haemoglobin molecule, a magnetic particle, a nanoparticle having a non-conducting core material and at least one metal shell layer, a red blood cell, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the case of a magnetic particle, the electromagnetic radiation is radio frequency radiation. All of the other labels mentioned hereinabove employ light, which can include IR or UV radiation. Preferably the label is a gold particle or a carbon particle. Carbon particles, have benefits in that they absorb essentially uniformly at all wavelengths of interest and are much less dense than most metallic particles minimising their sedimentation during the assay. Gold particles are commercially available or may be prepared using known methods (see for example <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>G. Frens, Nature, 241, 20-22 (1973</text></nplcit>)).

That is, the label is sufficiently close to the surface of the transducer for the transducer to be able to detect the energy generated by the label on irradiation of the sample. The actual distance between the label and the surface of the transducer will, however, depend on a number of variables, such as the size and nature of the label, the size and nature of the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> first and second antibodies and the analyte, the nature of the sample medium, and the nature of the electromagnetic radiation and the corresponding setting of the detector. With regard to the nature of the electromagnetic radiation, the device of the present invention may include a radiation source which is adapted to generate a series of pulses of electromagnetic radiation and the detector is adapted to determine the time delay between each pulse of electromagnetic radiation from the radiation source and the generation of the electric signal thereby allowing a precise determination of the position of the label with respect to the transducer as discussed with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The unknown sample is expected to contain the analyte, but of course the assay of the present invention may be used to determine the presence or absence of the analyte. The analyte is preferably a small molecule insofar as the assay is ideally suited for such a molecule, although the present invention is not limited thereto. The term "small molecule" used herein is a term of the art and is used to distinguish the molecule from macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. A small molecule is often referred to in the field of immunoassays as a "hapten", being a small molecule which, when attached to a large carrier such as a protein can elicit an immune response and includes molecules such as hormones and synthetic drugs. A small molecule of this type will typically have a molecular weight of 2,000 or less, often 1,000 or less and even 500 or less. The first reagent may be adapted to bind to the analyte itself, although the analyte can undergo a chemical reaction or initial complexing event before binding to the first reagent. For example, the analyte might be protonated/deprotonated in the pH of the assay conditions. Thus, the analyte which is bound to the first reagent may be analyte itself or a derivative of the analyte; both are included within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The sample which may or may not contain the analyte of interest will generally be a fluid sample and usually a biological sample (hence aqueous), such as a bodily fluid, e.g. blood, plasma, saliva, serum or urine. The sample may contain suspended particles and may even be whole blood. An advantage of the method of the present invention is that the assay may be performed on a sample which does contain suspended particles without unduly influencing the results of the assay. The sample will typically be in the order of microlitres (e.g. 1-100 µL, preferably 1-10 µL). In order to hold a fluid sample, the transducer is preferably located in a sample chamber and more preferably a<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> well. In a preferred embodiment, the transducer is integral with the chamber, i.e. it forms one of the walls which define the chamber.

The kit further comprises the second reagent. In a preferred embodiment, the second reagent is releasably attached to one of the interior surfaces of the chamber prior to use. By releasably attached is meant that the second reagent is attached to the surface, e.g. by being dried down on to the surface, but is released when the sample is introduced. In a preferred embodiment, the device consists essentially of the above-described features. By "essentially" is meant that no other features are required to perform the assay.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The device may take the form of a hand-held portable reader and a disposable device containing the transducer.
