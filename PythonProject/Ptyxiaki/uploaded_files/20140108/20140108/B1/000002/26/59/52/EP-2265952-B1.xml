mxw-id="PDES63960400" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for sensing a chemical, and in particular to an immunoassay employing a chemical sensing device containing a piezo/pyroelectric transducer.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">An immunoassay is a test which measures the presence, or more usually the concentration, of an analyte in a biological fluid. It typically involves the specific binding of an antigen to an antibody. The antibody can be polyclonal or monoclonal, monoclonal antibodies having several benefits, including reproducibility of manufacture and containment of binding to one epitope of an analyte. In order to provide a quantifiable measure of the concentration of the analyte, the response is compared to standard samples of known concentration. The concentration of the antibody or antigen may be determined by a variety of methods, although one of the most common is to label either the antigen or antibody and detect the presence of the label.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Immunoassays can be competitive or non-competitive. In a competitive immunoassay, the antigen in the unknown sample competes with labelled antigen (reporter) to bind to the antibodies present. The amount of labelled antigen bound to the antibody site is then measured. Clearly the response will be inversely proportional to the concentration of antigen in the unknown sample. In a non-competitive immunoassay, also referred to as an immunometric assay, the antigen in the unknown sample binds to a capture antibody in the presence of an excess of labelled antibodies, thus forming a "sandwich" and the amount of bound antigen in this "sandwich" is measured. Unlike the competitive method, the results of the non-competitive method will be directly proportional to the concentration of the antigen.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In a typical competitive immunoassay, an antibody specific for an antigen of interest is immobilised (i.e. attached to) a polymeric support such as a sheet of polystyrene. A drop of the sample to be tested, e.g. a cell extract or a sample of serum or urine, is laid on the sheet. In addition, a known amount of reporter (i.e. labelled) antigen is also added to the sample. The labelled and unlabelled antigen then compete for binding to the antibodies immobilised on the polymeric support. The polymeric support is<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> washed after formation of the antibody-antigen complexes. The concentration of the reporter antigen bound to the sheet is determined. The signal from the reporter antigen is then inversely proportional to the quantity of antigen in the sample. This assay and other variations on this type of assay are well known, see, for example, "<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>The Immunoassay Handbook, 2nd Ed." David Wild, Ed., Nature Publishing Group, 2001</text></nplcit>.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A variation on this immunoassay is the so-called "displacement immunoassay". In this assay, the reporter antigen is pre-attached to the antibodies present on the polymeric support. The unknown antigen is then added to the system and the antigen displaces the reporter antigen from the surface of the support. The loss of the reporter antigen is determined and equated with the concentration of the unknown antigen in the sample. However, the measurement of the displacement of the reporter antigen is far from straight forward.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For example, Giese at al (<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4801726A"><text>US 4,801,726</text></patcit>) describe a similar procedure. In a so-called "hit-and-run" immunoassay, a fluorescently-labelled antibody pre-bound to an immobilised-antigen column is displaced when an aliquot of a sample is added to the aqueous stream passing over the column. If the aliquot contains the analyte, a small fraction of the reporter antibody is displaced and measured fluorimetrically in the downstream effluent. This is designed as a "repetitive" immunoassay, reusing the same column many times. This concept has been developed for the continuous screening and very intermittent detection of explosives.<patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5183740A"><text> Ligler et al (US 5,183,740</text></patcit>) describe a very similar fluorimetric column-based system for TNT. This is further developed into a membrane-based system by the same group (<patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6750031B"><text>US 6,750,031</text></patcit> and <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Rabbany et al. Biosensors &amp; Bioelectronics 1998, 13, 939-944</text></nplcit>). In all these cases the immuno-displacement occurs in the column or membrane and the detection occurs in a downstream instrument.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6979567B"><text>Herron et al (US 6,979,567</text></patcit>) describe the use of a total internal reflection fluorescent detector in competitive immunoassay, including monitoring the displacement of an analyte from a saturated surface. <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>V.I.

As a first step, the method includes the provision of a transducer having a pyroelectric or piezoelectric element and electrodes which is capable of transducing a change in energy to an electrical signal and exposing the sample to the transducer. Such transducers are known in the art, see for example <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO9013017A"><text>WO 90/13017</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="WO2004090512A"><text>WO 2004/090512</text></patcit>. In this regard, <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> shows the principle of the chemical sensing device 1 suitable for use in the present invention. The device 1 relies on heat generation in a substance 2 on irradiation of the substance 2 with electromagnetic radiation. The device 1 comprises a pyroelectric or piezoelectric transducer 3 having electrode coatings 4,5. The transducer 3 is preferably a poled polyvinylidene fluoride film. The electrode coatings 4,5 are preferably formed from indium tin oxide having a thickness of about 35 nm, although almost any thickness is possible from a lower limit of 1 nm below which the electrical conductivity is too low and an upper limit of 100 nm above which the optical transmission is too low (it should not be less than 95%T). A substance 2 is held on or proximal to the transducer 3 using any suitable technique, shown here immobilised on the upper electrode coating 4. The reagent may be in any suitable form and a plurality of reagents may be deposited. Preferably, the substance 2 is adsorbed on to the upper electrode, e.g. covalently coupled or bound via<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> intermolecular forces such as ionic bonds, hydrogen bonding or van der Waal's forces. A key feature of this device is that the substance 2 generates heat when irradiated by a source of electromagnetic radiation 6, such as light, preferably visible light. The light source may be, for example, an LED. The light source 6 illuminates the substance 2<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> with light of the appropriate wavelength (e.g. a complementary colour). Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the substance 2 absorbs the light to generate an excited state which then undergoes non-radiative decay thereby generating energy, indicated by the curved lines in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. This energy is primarily in the form of heat (i.e. thermal motion in the environment) although other forms of energy, e.g. a shock wave, may also be generated. The energy is, however, detected by the transducer and converted into an electrical signal. The device of the present invention is calibrated for the particular reagent being measured and hence the precise form of the energy generated by the non-radiative decay does not need to be determined. Unless otherwise specified the term "heat" is used herein to mean the energy generated by non-radiative decay. The light source 6 is positioned so as to illuminate the substance 2. Preferably, the light source 6 is positioned substantially perpendicular to the transducer 3 and electrodes 4,5 and the substance 2 is illuminated through the transducer 3 and electrodes 4,5. The light source may be an internal light source within the transducer in which the light source is a guided wave system. The wave guide may be the transducer itself or the wave guide may be an additional layer immobilised on the transducer. Preferably a wavelength of 525 nm is used, although other suitable wavelengths may be used with advantageous properties described, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="WO2007107716A"><text>WO 2007/107716</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The energy generated by the substance 2 is detected by the transducer 3 and converted into an electrical signal. The electrical signal is detected by a detector 7. The light source 6 and the detector 7 are both under the control of the controller 8.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In one embodiment, the light source 6 generates a series of pulses of light (the term "light" used herein means any form of electromagnetic radiation unless a specific wavelength is mentioned) which is termed "chopped light". In principle, a single flash of light, i.e. one pulse of electromagnetic radiation, would suffice to generate a signal from the transducer 3. However, in order to obtain a reproducible signal, a plurality of flashes of light are used which in practice requires chopped light. The frequency at which the pulses of electromagnetic radiation are applied may be varied. At the lower limit, the time delay between the pulses must be sufficient for the time delay between each pulse and the generation of an electrical signal to be determined. At the upper limit, the time delay between each pulse must not be so large that the period taken to<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> record the data becomes unreasonably extended. Preferably, the frequency of the pulses is from 2-50 Hz, more preferably 5-15 Hz and most preferably 10 Hz. This corresponds to a time delay between pulses of 20-500 ms, 66-200 ms and 100 ms, respectively. In addition, the so-called "mark-space" ratio, i.e. the ratio of on signal to off signal is preferably one although other ratios may be used without deleterious effect. Sources of electromagnetic radiation which produce chopped light with different frequencies of chopping or different mark-space ratios are known in the art. The detector 7 determines the time delay (or "correlation delay") between each pulse of light from light source 6 and the corresponding electrical signal detected by detector 7 from transducer 3. The applicant has found that this time delay is a function of the distance, d.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Any method for determining the time delay between each pulse of light and the corresponding electrical signal which provides reproducible results may be used. Preferably, the time delay is measured from the start of each pulse of light to the point at which a maximum in the electrical signal corresponding to the absorption of heat is detected as by detector 7.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Thus substance 2 may be separated from the transducer surface and a signal may still be detected. Moreover, not only is the signal detectable through an intervening medium capable of transmitting energy to the transducer 3, but different distances, d, may be distinguished (this has been termed "depth profiling") and that the intensity of the signal received is proportional to the concentration of the substance 2 at the particular distance, d, from the surface of the transducer 3.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">Fig. 2</figref> shows the device 1 from <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> in a displacement immunoassay in accordance with the present invention. In this embodiment, the first reagent is an antibody and the second reagent is a labelled analyte. The transducer 3 is shown in a vertical arrangement in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2a</figref>. The advantages of this arrangement are discussed in more detail hereinbelow. The transducer 3 is coated with a first reagent shown in <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">Fig. 2</figref> as an antibody 9 (an immobilised capture antibody). The antibody 9 has been raised against the analyte 10 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2b</figref>) and selectively binds to the analyte 10 when the sample is introduced. The transducer also has a labelled analyte 11 (which corresponds to the substance 2 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>). The labelled analyte 11 includes a label 12<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> having a plurality of analyte moieties 13 attached thereto, optionally via a linker 14. The antibody 9 is pre-incubated with an excess of the labelled analyte 11. The transducer 3 having a layer of the antibodies 9 is then typically covered with a preservative layer (not shown) and dried. In this state, the transducer may be stored for extended periods of time.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In use, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2b</figref>, the transducer is exposed to the sample containing an unknown concentration of the analyte 10. The analyte 10 diffuses rapidly to the transducer surface and displaces the labelled analyte 11 from the antibodies 9, see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2c</figref>. The displacement will usually occur because the analyte has a higher binding constant than the labelled analyte (second reagent), i.e. because it has faster "on" rate of reaction compared with the "on" rate of the labelled analyte (second reagent), or a slower "off" rate of reaction compared with the "off" rate of the labelled analyte or both.. The reaction can be monitored in real time using the transducer 3 in the manner explained hereinabove with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. Since the assay may be performed without any reagents other than those presented on the transducer surface at the start of the assay, the assay may be termed "reagentless". Preferably the first and second reagents are the sole reagents present. The assay shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2c</figref> is a schematic representation of the displacement of the labelled analyte in the presence of a high concentration of analyte in the sample. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 2d and 2e</figref>, respectively, show displacement at low concentrations of analyte. This leads to fewer labelled analytes 11 being released from the surface of the transducer 3. The second reagent released from the surface is free to diffuse away from the surface. Although the removal of the second reagent from the surface may be facilitated, for example under the force of gravity/buoyancy, preferably the second reagent is allowed to become separated from the surface solely by diffusion.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The method of the present invention permits detection of the binding of the analyte 10 (albeit indirectly by monitoring the displacement of the labelled analyte 11) in real time, without separation and washing steps. This is a significant advantage in the art. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the assay is carried out without removing the sample from the transducer 3 at any time during the assay. Moreover, no further intervention (e.g. to separate bound and unbound second reagent) is required between exposing the transducer to the sample and irradiating the sample<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 3</figref> shows an embodiment where first reagent is an immobilised analyte and the second reagent is a labelled antibody.

The binding will typically be through non-covalent intermolecular forces, e.g. the binding between an antibody and antigen or between complementary nucleic acids. The binding is releasable in that the binding may be disrupted by the analyte or derivative thereof leading to displacement of the second reagent from the first reagent. The binding site which allows binding of the first reagent to the second reagent may be present on the first reagent, the second reagent or on both reagents, and is capable of preferentially binding to the analyte or a derivative of the analyte. The binding is preferential in that the presence of the analyte leads to disruption of the binding between the first reagent and the second reagent and the reagent which has the binding site for the analyte or derivative thereof becomes bound to the analyte or derivative thereof.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Although the relevant reagents are exemplified in <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">3</figref> by antibodies, i.e. an immobilised capture antibody (<figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">Fig. 2</figref>) or a reporter antibody (<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 3</figref>), the present invention is not limited thereto.

In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method of performing a (displacement) immunoassay to detect an analyte (hapten) in a sample, comprising the steps of: providing a transducer comprising a pyroelectric or piezoelectric element and electrodes which is capable of transducing a change in energy to an electrical signal, a capture antibody immobilised on the transducer, and a labelled analyte bound to the capture antibody having a label attached thereto which is capable of absorbing electromagnetic radiation to generate energy by non-radiative decay; exposing the transducer to the sample thereby allowing the analyte or a derivative of the analyte to bind to the immobilised capture antibody and displace the labelled analyte from the transducer; irradiating the sample with electromagnetic radiation; transducing the energy generated into an electrical signal; and detecting the electrical signal.

That is, the label is sufficiently close to the surface of the transducer for the transducer to be able to detect the energy generated by the label on irradiation of the sample. The<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> actual distance between the label and the surface of the transducer will, however, depend on a number of variables, such as the size and nature of the label, the size and nature of the antibodies and the analyte, the nature of the sample medium, and the nature of the electromagnetic radiation and the corresponding settings of the detector. With regard to the nature of the electromagnetic radiation, the device of the present invention may include a radiation source which is adapted to generate a series of pulses of electromagnetic radiation and the detector is adapted to determine the time delay between each pulse of electromagnetic radiation from the radiation source and the generation of the electric signal thereby allowing a precise determination of the position of the label with respect to the transducer as discussed with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The unknown sample is expected to contain the analyte, but of course the assay of the present invention may be used to determine the presence or absence of the analyte. The analyte is preferably a small molecule insofar as the assay is ideally suited for such a molecule, although the present invention is not limited thereto. The term "small molecule" used herein is a term of the art and is used to distinguish the molecule from macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. A small molecule is often referred to in the field of immunoassays as a "hapten", being a small molecule which, when attached to a large carrier molecule such as a protein, can elicit an immune response and includes molecules such as hormones and synthetic drugs. A small molecule of this type will typically have a molecular weight of 2,000 or less, often 1,000 or less and even 500 or less. The first reagent may be adapted to bind to the analyte itself, although the analyte can undergo a chemical reaction or initial complexing event before binding to the first reagent. For example, the analyte might be protonated/deprotonated in the pH of the assay conditions. Thus, the analyte which is bound to the first reagent may be analyte itself or a derivative of the analyte; both are included within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The sample which may or may not contain the analyte of interest will generally be a fluid sample and usually a biological sample, such as a bodily fluid, e.g. blood, plasma, saliva, serum or urine. The sample may contain suspended particles and may even be whole blood. An advantage of the method of the present invention is that the assay may be performed on a sample which does contain suspended particles without<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> unduly influencing the results of the assay. The sample will typically be in the order of microlitres (e.g. 1-100 µL, preferably 1-10 µL). In order to hold a fluid sample, the transducer is preferably located in a sample chamber having two side walls, an upper surface and a lower surface and more preferably a well. In a preferred embodiment, the transducer is integral with the chamber, i.e. it forms one of the side walls, or upper or lower surface which define the chamber. Clearly, the reagent 9 and the labelled analyte 11 will be on the interior surfaces of the chamber to allow contact with the sample. The sample may simply be retained by surface tension forces, for example, inside a capillary channel.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In an embodiment of the present invention, gravity may be used to assist in the displacement of the labelled analyte 11 from the surface of the transducer. That is, the transducer forms the upper surface of the chamber and the labelled analyte is more dense than the medium of the sample, or the transducer forms the lower surface of the chamber and the label is less dense than the medium of the sample. Where the labelled analyte is more dense than the liquid medium of the sample the labelled analyte settles towards the lower surface (the base) of the sample chamber under the influence of gravity. Alternatively, the labelled analyte may be less dense than the liquid medium of the sample so that the labelled analyte floats towards the upper surface of the sample chamber (the lid) under the force of buoyancy. In other words, the displacement of the labelled analyte is assisted by sedimentation or by floatation under the force of gravity/buoyancy. This is shown in greater detail with reference to <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Fig. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Fig. 4a-4e</figref> shows the assay of the present invention where the transducer forms the upper surface of the sample chamber.

The displacement of the labelled analyte 11 is shown schematically for low, intermediate and high analyte concentrations in <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Figs 4c-4e</figref>.
