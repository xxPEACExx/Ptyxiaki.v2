Currently available biomarkers for diagnosing such a heart failure include atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP). Assaying such a marker can determine whether or not a patient suffers from heart failure, and how severe the heart failure is.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, since the cause of many diseases including heart failure cannot be determined as a single factor, in actual clinical settings a specific disease cannot be definitely diagnosed through assaying only one type of biomarker. In addition, since they are found in blood, urine, etc. in response to progress of pathological conditions,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> biomarkers may fail to specifically diagnose the target pathological conditions when the progress of the conditions varies among individual patients. Therefore, currently, many diseases are generally diagnosed by use of a variety of markers in combination.</p><heading id="h0003">Disclosure of the Invention</heading><heading id="h0004">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">Thus, for the diagnosis of heart failure keen demand exists for development of a novel marker other than known markers such as ANP and BNP.</p><heading id="h0005">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present inventor has carried out extensive studies in an attempt to develop a novel biomarker for diagnosing heart disease, and has paid attention to a free immunoglobulin light chain dissociated from an immunoglobulin heavy chain (i.e., free light chain (FLC)), which has never been employed for the diagnosis of heart disease.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Hitherto, FLC assay has been employed for the diagnosis of blood diseases such as myeloma and amyloidosis. In myeloma, FLC assay results vary depending on the type of tumor cells. Specifically, when the tumor cells produce kappa (κ) chains, the kappa chain level and the kappa/lambda ratio increase, whereas when the tumor cells produce lambda (λ) chains, the lambda chain level increases and the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> kappa/lambda ratio decreases. The type of myeloma has been diagnosed on the basis of the assay characteristics.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Mayo Clin.

Therefore, if FLC can be employed for the diagnosis of heart failure, activation of B lymphocytes can possibly be detected in the diagnosis of heart failure. If the activation can be detected, screening and development of a novel heart failure therapeutic drug can be attained through regulating activation of B lymphocytes. Thus, FLC is a promising candidate for a useful marker, which differs from conventional markers.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present inventor has further carried out extensive studies on application of FLC to the diagnosis of heart disease, and have found that FLC, which has never been employed for the diagnosis of heart disease, can be applied to the diagnosis of heart disease including heart failure. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding.

Therefore, heart failure can be diagnosed through quantitation of the free light chains (kappa chain and lambda chain) in specimens.<br/>
The specimen to be analyzed is blood, body fluid, tissue, excretions, etc. separated from subjects, clinical specimens, etc. Among these specimens, blood-originating specimens such as blood, serum, and plasma, and urine specimens are particularly preferred.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">FLC assay may be performed through a known immunoassay technique (ELISA, RIA, etc.).<br/>
Specifically, in a preferred immunoassay procedure, a microamount of FLC present in a specimen can be determined at sufficient sensitivity, and no cross-reactivity to intact immunoglobulin is observed (e.g., ≤1%), whereby effects of components other than FLC can be minimized. Preferably, an enzymatic immunoassay method developed by <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Nakano et al. is employed (J. Immunol. Methods, 2003, 275, 9-17</text></nplcit>).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In order to determine FLC at higher sensitivity, preferably employed is an immunoassay method in which an FLC-specific polyclonal antibody is used as an antibody for trapping FLC in a specimen, and an FLC-specific monoclonal antibody is used as an antibody for detecting the trapped FLC.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The two types of antibodies that may be employed in the invention<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> are selected from FLC-specific monoclonal antibodies and FLC-specific polyclonal antibodies. Such antibodies may be antibodies <i>per se</i> or active fragments thereof [F(ab')<sub>2</sub>, Fab', etc.].</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The FLC-specific antibody refers to an antibody which exhibits very weak reactivity to a light chain bound to the heavy chain present in intact immunoglobulin or which does not recognize the light chain, but which strongly reacts with a light chain not bound to the heavy chain.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">These FLC-specific monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies may be produced through a conventional method. For example, monoclonal antibodies are prepared by use of a free kappa chain or a free lambda chain as an antigen, and an antibody which does not bind to intact immunoglobulin and which specifically binds to FLC is selected from the thus-produced antibodies.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The FLC-specific polyclonal antibody may be produced through a conventional method. For example, polyclonal-antibodies are prepared by use of a free kappa chain or a free lambda chain, and an antibody which binds to intact immunoglobulin is absorbed and removed from the thus-produced polyclonal-antibodies. Such antibodies, which are now commercially available, may also be employed. However, FLC specificity of such commercial products must be checked in<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> advance.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The immunoassay method employed in the invention is the same as conventionally employed method in terms of technique, procedure, etc. Specifically, examples of the antibody for trapping FLC in a specimen include an immobilized antibody fixed on a support.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Examples of the support employed for preparing such an immobilized antibody include generally employed supports, including synthetic organic polymer compounds such as polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, styrene-divinylbenzene copolymers, styrene-maleic anhydride copolymers, nylon, polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamide, polyacrylonitrile, polypropylene, and polymethylene methacrylate; polysaccharides such as dextran derivatives (e.g., Sephadex), agarose gel (e.g., Sepharose or Biogel), and cellulose (e.g., paper disk or filter paper); and inorganic polymer compounds such as glass, silica gel, and silicone. Such a support may have an introduced functional group (e.g., an amino group, a carboxyl group, a carbonyl group, a hydroxyl group, or a sulfhydryl group).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Such a support may assume any form, such as a plate form (e.g., microtiter plate or disk), a particulate form (e.g., beads), a tubular form (e.g., test tube), a fibrous form, a membrane form, a microparticulate form (e.g., latex<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> particles), a capsule form, or an endoplasmic reticulum form. A support of suitable form may be appropriately selected in consideration of the assay method employed.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Binding of an antibody to a support may be carried out through a known technique such as physical adsorption, ionic binding, covalent binding, or entrapment [see, for example, "<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="b"><text>Koteika Koso" ("Immobilized Enzyme") (edited by Ichiro Senhata, published by Kodansha Ltd. on March 20, 1975</text></nplcit>)]. Particularly, physical adsorption is preferred, from the viewpoint of convenience. An antibody may be bound directly to a support, or a linker may be provided between an antibody and a support.<br/>
In order to suppress non-specific binding, the thus-prepared immobilized reagent may be subjected to blocking treatment by use of a generally employed blocking agent such as gelatin or BSA.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Examples of the antibody for detecting trapped FLCs include an antibody labeled with a labeling agent.
