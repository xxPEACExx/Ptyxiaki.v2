The crystallization temperature is usually from 0 to 50°C, and preferably from 10 to 30°C.

Accordingly, it is desirable to recycle the first crystallization mother liquor for use in the hydrolysis reaction in the step (3). In the meantime, this mother liquor contains impurities, e.g., amino acids such as glycine and alanine, other than metionine, and a coloring component, attributed to the impurities in the stating material or the side reaction of the hydrolysis. Therefore, these impurities are brought into a hydrolysis reaction by recycling the mother liquor. To avoid this disadvantage, it is needed to recycle the first crystallization mother liquor in such an amount that these impurities are not allowed to accumulate, but not the entire amount thereof. The proportion of the first crystallization mother liquor to be recycled is usually from 50 to 90% by weight, preferably from 70 to 90% by weight, based on the entire weight of the first crystallization mother liquor.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Prior to the recycling of the first crystallization mother liquor, desirably, the same mother liquor is concentrated, and the resulting concentrate is used as a recycled solution. By this concentration, carbon dioxide is distilled off from the first crystallization mother liquor, and thus, a recycled solution with an increased basic property,<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> advantageous for the hydrolysis reaction, can be obtained. Also, the concentration carried out at so high a temperature as from 100 to 140°C is effective to facilitate a reaction for converting potassium hydrogencarbonate in the mother liquor, into potassium carbonate (2KHCO<sub>3</sub> → K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub>), so that a recycled solution with a further increased basic property, advantageous for the hydrolysis reaction, can be obtained. While this concentration may be done under an atmospheric pressure, a reduced pressure or a raised pressure, it is effective to employ a pressurizing condition in order to carry out the concentration at a high temperature as described above. The concentration ratio is usually from 2- to 4-fold, preferably from 1.5- to 3.5-fold. In this regard, the concentration ratio means a ratio of the weight of the solution before concentration thereof to the weight of the same solution after the concentration thereof (the weight of the solution before concentration thereof/the weight of the same solution after the concentration thereof), and this term means the same, unless otherwise specified.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">A portion of the first crystallization mother liquor (concentrated), which is not recycled, is crystallized so as to recover therefrom methionine and potassium hydrogencarbonate as second crystals. This crystallization is allowed to take place by introducing carbon dioxide into a<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> mixture of the concentrated first crystallization mother liquor with a lower alcohol, and the resulting slurry is separated into a precipitate and a mother liquor by filtration or decantation, so that the precipitated methionine and potassium hydrogencarbonate are recovered as the second crystals [the second crystallization step]. In this connection, the concentrated first crystallization mother liquor may be entirely subjected to this crystallization, without recycling the same.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">As the lower alcohol, any of alkyl alcohols each having a C<sub>1-5</sub> alkyl group is usually used. Preferable among those is an alkyl alcohol which can be admixed with water at an optional ratio, such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol or t-butyl alcohol, among which isopropyl alcohol is particularly preferred. The amount of the lower alcohol to be used is usually 0.05 to 5 times, preferably 0.1 to 2 times larger in weight than the amount of the first crystallization mother liquor to be subjected to crystallization. The mixing of the first crystallization mother liquor with the lower alcohol may be done before the introduction of carbon dioxide or simultaneously with the introduction of carbon dioxide.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The first crystallization mother liquor to be subjected<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> to the second crystallization is concentrated, as well as the first crystallization mother liquor to be recycled. By this concentration, the recovery of the second crystals can be improved. This concentration may be carried out under the same conditions as those for the concentration of the first crystallization mother liquor to be recycled; or otherwise, the entire amount of the first crystallization mother liquor may be concentrated, and then may be divided into a portion for recycling and a portion for the second crystallization.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">During the concentration of the first crystallization mother liquor, the basic property of the mother liquor is enhanced, so that the free methionine formed by the conversion in the first crystallization step is again formed into a potassium salt of methihonine. Accordingly, also in the second crystallization step, carbon dioxide is introduced into a mixture of the concentrated first crystallization mother liquor with a lower alcohol to thereby convert the potassium salt of methionine into free methionine.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Preferably, the concentrated mother liquor is subjected to a heat treatment. By doing so, methionine dipeptide (a dehydro-condensation product of two methionine molecules) contained in the mother liquor is hydrolyzed to facilitate reproduction of methionine. Preferably, this heat treatment<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> is carried out at a temperature of from about 140 to about 180°C under a gauge pressure of 0.5 to 2 MPa, and the heat-treating time is usually from 10 minutes to 24 hours.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The introduction of carbon dioxide is done under a gauge pressure of usually from 0.1 to 1 MPa, preferably from 0.2 to 0.5 MPa, as well as that in the first crystallization step.<br/>
The crystallization temperature is usually from 0 to 50°C, preferably from 5 to 20°C. The crystallization time may be selected based on a period of time during which carbon dioxide saturates in the above-described solution mixture to sufficiently precipitate methionine and potassium hydrogencarbonate, and it is usually from 10 minutes to 24 hours.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Preferably, the recovered second crystals (a mixture of methionine and potassium hydrogencarbonate) are recycled for use in the hydrolysis reaction in the step (3). In this regard, from the viewpoint of operating efficiency, it is preferable to dissolve the second crystals in the first crystallization mother liquor to be recycled, and to recycle the resulting solution.</p><heading id="h0009"><b>Examples</b></heading><p id="p0042" num="0042">Next, Examples of the present invention will be<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> illustrated.
