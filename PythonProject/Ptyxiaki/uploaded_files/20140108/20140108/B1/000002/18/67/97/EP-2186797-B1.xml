Methionine is useful as an additive to feeds for animals.

In this process, carbon dioxide is introduced into the reaction solution obtained after the hydrolysis, to thereby cause crystallization, so that methionine is separated and obtained as crystals. The mother liquor obtained after the separation of methionine still contains methionine at a concentration equivalent to a solubility and also contains potassium hydrogen carbonate which can be recycled as the above-described basic potassium compound. This mother liquor, therefore, should be recycled for use in the above-described hydrolysis reaction. In this step, when the entire amount of the mother liquor is recycled, impurities tend to accumulate, and therefore, the mother liquor is needed to be purged of at a given rate. To treat the mother liquor thus purged of as liquid-waste leads to a loss of methionine and potassium hydrogen carbonate contained in the mother liquor, and a cost for the treatment of liquid-waste is considerably high. Therefore, this method is not advisable.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Under such a circumstance, there are reported many methods for recovering, from mother liquors as described above, methionene and potassium hydrogen carbonate as so-called second crystals. For example, the following method<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP54009174B"><text>JP-B-54-9174</text></patcit>: the above-described mother liquor is mixed with a water-soluble solvent such as an alcohol (e.g., methyl alcohol) or acetone; and then, carbon dioxide is introduced into the resulting mixture to cause crystallization. The following method is also disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP51001415A"><text>JP-A-51-1415</text></patcit>: the above-described mother liquor is concentrated; and then, carbon dioxide is introduced into the resulting concentrate to cause crystallization. The following method is further disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP5320124A"><text>JP-A-5-320124</text></patcit>: the above-described mother liquor is mixed with isopropyl alcohol; and then, carbon dioxide is introduced into the resulting mixture to cause crystallization. The following method is further disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2007063141A"><text>JP-A-2007-63141</text></patcit>: the above-described mother liquid obtained after the separation of the first crystals is concentrated; then, the resulting concentrate is subjected to a heat treatment at 165°C; then, the treated solution is mixed with isopropyl alcohol; and then, carbon dioxide is introduced into the resulting mixture to cause crystallization. This Patent Publication also discloses a method of recovering methionine as the third crystals as follows: the mother liquor obtained after the separation of the second crystals is concentrated; and carbon dioxide is introduced into the resulting concentrate to cause crystallization.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to provide a cost-effective process for producing methionine while efficiently recovering useful components.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present inventors made the following trial: that is, the mother liquor obtained after the separation of the second crystals was concentrated, and then, the resulting concentrate was recycled for use in the second crystallization step. However, the filtration rate for separation became poor, which leads to a higher production cost.<br/>
As a result of the present inventors' further studies, it is found that the amount of methionine dipeptide in the mother liquor obtained after the separation of the second crystals gives an influence on a filtration rate of methionine: in other words, when the amount of methionine dipeptide is large, the crystallinity of methionine obtained by the crystallization becomes poor, so that the filtration rate of methionine becomes lower. Then, based on this finding, the mother liquor obtained after the separation of the second crystals was concentrated; and then, the resulting concentrate was treated by heating to hydrolyze methionine dipeptide and convert the same into<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> methionine; and after this step, the resulting mother liquor was recycled for use in the second crystallization step. By doing so, it is found that the crystallinity of methionine obtained by the crystallization was improved, so that the filtration rate of methionine was remarkably improved.

The amount of the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> basic potassium compound to be used is usually from 2 to 10 equivalents, preferably from 3 to 6 equivalents, in terms of potassium, per one equivalent of 5-[2-(methylthio)-ethyl]imidazolidine-2,4-dione. The amount of water to be used is usually 2 to 20 times larger in weight than that of 5-[2-(methylthio)ethyl]imidazolidine-2,4-dione.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Preferably, the hydrolysis reaction is carried out under a gauge pressure of from about 0.5 to about 1 MPa, by heating the starting material to a temperature of from about 150 to about 200°C. The reaction time is usually from 10 minutes to 24 hours.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">To obtain methionine from the hydrolysis reaction solution thus obtained, carbon dioxide is introduced into the reaction solution to cause crystallization, and the resulting slurry is separated into a precipitate and a mother liquor by filtration or decantation, to thereby obtain the precipitated methionine as the first crystals [the first crystallization step (2)].</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The reaction solution is allowed to absorb carbon dioxide by the introduction of carbon dioxide, so that a potassium salt of methionine is precipitated as free methionine.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> -->Preferably, the introduction of carbon dioxide is carried out under a gauge pressure of usually from 0.1 to 1 MPa, preferably from 0.2 to 0.5 MPa.<br/>
The crystallization temperature is usually from 0 to 50°C, preferably from 10 to 30°C. The crystallization time may be determined based on a period of time during which the carbon dioxide saturates in the hydrolysis reaction solution to sufficiently precipitate methionine, and it is usually from 30 minutes to 24 hours.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">If needed, the separated methionine is washed or adjusted in pH, and then is dried to obtain a product. Preferably, the drying is carried out by heating at about 50 to about 120°C under a very mild reduced pressure. The drying time is usually from 10 minutes to 24 hours.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The mother liquor obtained after the separation of methionine (hereinafter referred to as "a first crystallization mother liquor") still contains methionine at a concentration equivalent to solubility, and also contains potassium hydrogen carbonate which can be recycled as the above-described basic potassium compound. Accordingly, it is desirable to recycle the first crystallization mother liquor for use in the hydrolysis reaction in the step (1). In the meantime, this mother<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> liquor contains impurities, e.g., amino acids such as glycine and alanine, other than methionine, and a coloring component, attributed to the impurities in the starting material or the side reaction of the hydrolysis. Therefore, these impurities are brought into the hydrolysis reaction by recycling the mother liquor. To avoid this disadvantage, it is needed to recycle the first crystallization mother liquor in such an amount that these impurities are not allowed to accumulate, but not the entire amount thereof. The proportion of the first crystallization mother liquor to be recycled is usually from 50 to 90% by weight, preferably from 70 to 90% by weight, based on the entire weight of the first crystallization mother liquor.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Prior to the recycling of the first crystallization mother liquor, desirably, the same mother liquor is concentrated, and the resulting concentrate is used as a recycled solution. By this concentration, carbon dioxide is distilled off from the first crystallization mother liquor, and thus, a recycled solution with an increased basic property, advantageous for the hydrolysis reaction, can be obtained. Also, the concentration carried out at so high a temperature as from 100 to 140°C is effective to facilitate a reaction for converting potassium hydrogencarbonate in the mother liquor, into potassium<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> carbonate (2KHCO<sub>3</sub> → K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub>), so that a recycled solution with a further increased basic property, advantageous for the hydrolysis reaction, can be obtained. While this concentration may be done under an atmospheric pressure, a reduced pressure or a raised pressure, it is effective to employ a pressurizing condition in order to carry out the concentration at a high temperature as described above. The concentration ratio is usually from 2- to 4-fold, preferably from 1.5- to 3.5-fold. In this regard, the concentration ratio means a ratio of the weight of the solution before concentration thereof to the weight of the same solution after the concentration thereof (the weight of the solution before concentration thereof/the weight of the same solution after the concentration thereof), 1 and this term means the same, unless otherwise specified.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">A portion of the first crystallization mother liquor (concentrated), which is not recycled, is crystallized so as to recover therefrom methionine and potassium hydrogen carbonate as second crystals. In the present invention, this crystallization is allowed to take place by introducing carbon dioxide into a mixture of the concentrated first crystallization mother liquor with a lower alcohol, and the resulting slurry is separated into a<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> precipitate and a mother liquor by filtration or decantation, so that the precipitated methionine and potassium hydrogen carbonate are recovered as the second crystals [the second crystallization step (3)]. In this connection, the concentrated first crystallization mother liquor may be entirely subjected to this crystallization, without recycling the same.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As the lower alcohol, any of alkyl alcohols each having a C<sub>1-5</sub> alkyl group is used. Preferable among those is an alkyl alcohol which can be admixed with water at an optional ratio, such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol or t-butyl alcohol, among which isopropyl alcohol is particularly preferred. The amount of the lower alcohol to be used is usually 0.05 to 5 times, preferably 0.1 to 2 times larger in weight than the amount of the first crystallization mother liquor to be subjected to crystallization. The mixing of the first crystallization mother liquor with the lower alcohol may be done before the introduction of carbon dioxide or simultaneously with the introduction of carbon dioxide.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The first crystallization mother liquor to be subjected to the second crystallization is concentrated, as well as the first crystallization mother liquor to be<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> recycled. By this concentration, the recovery of the second crystals can be improved. This concentration may be carried out under the same conditions as those for the concentration of the first crystallization mother liquor to be recycled; or otherwise, the entire amount of the first crystallization mother liquor may be concentrated, and then may be divided into a portion for recycling and a portion for the second crystallization.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">During the concentration of the first crystallization mother liquor, the basic property of the mother liquor is enhanced, so that the free methionine formed by the conversion in the first crystallization step is again formed into a potassium salt of methionine. Accordingly, also in the second crystallization step, carbon dioxide is introduced into a mixture of the concentrated first crystallization mother liquor with a lower alcohol to thereby convert the potassium salt of methionine into free methionine.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Preferably, the concentrated mother liquor is subjected to a heat treatment. By doing so, methionine dipeptide (a dehydro-condensation product of two methionine molecules) contained in the mother liquor is hydrolyzed to facilitate reproduction of methionine. Preferably, this<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> heat treatment is carried out at a temperature of from about 140 to about 180°C under a gauge pressure of 0.5 to 2 MPa, and the heat-treating time is usually from 10 minutes to 24 hours.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The introduction of carbon dioxide is done under a gauge pressure of usually from 0.1 to 1 MPa, preferably from 0.2 to 0.5 MPa, as well as that in the first crystallization step.<br/>
The crystallization temperature is usually from 0 to 50°C, preferably from 5 to 20°C. The crystallization time may be selected based on a period of time during which carbon dioxide saturates in the above-described solution mixture to sufficiently precipitate methionine and potassium hydrogen carbonate, and it is usually from 10 minutes to 24 hours.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Preferably, the recovered second crystals (a mixture of methionine and potassium hydrogen carbonate) are recycled for use in the hydrolysis reaction in the step (1).
