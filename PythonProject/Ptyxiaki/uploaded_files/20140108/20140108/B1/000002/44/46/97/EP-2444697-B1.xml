load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0002">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to geared, multiple-ratio power transmission mechanisms having dual clutches to permit selective engagement and disengagement of ratio change clutches for operation in a given ratio while preselecting ratio change clutches for an adjacent ratio during a shift sequence in separate speed ratio ranges.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventional automotive vehicle powertrains typically have multiple-ratio transmission mechanisms that establish power delivery paths from an engine to vehicle traction wheels. Adequate powertrain performance for heavy-duty or medium-duty powertrains requires more than one range of gear ratios so that the speed and torque characteristic of the engine will provide optimum traction wheel power throughout the operating speed range for the vehicle. Ratio range gearing, therefore, typically is used with a transmission mechanism in such high torque capacity powertrains so that sufficient overall gear ratio coverage is provided. The overall gear ratio coverage will be equal to the product of the number of gear ratios for the transmission and the number of gear ratios in the ratio range gearing.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">One class of transmission mechanisms in automotive vehicle powertrains includes countershaft gearing having power delivery gears journaled on a transmission mainshaft and countershaft gear elements journaled on a countershaft arranged in spaced, parallel disposition with respect to the mainshaft. The countershaft gear elements typically mesh with the gears mounted on a mainshaft axis. Operator-controlled clutches, which may be either positive drive dog clutches or synchronizer clutches, selectively connect torque transmitting gears on the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> mainshaft axis to the mainshaft, thereby establishing a power delivery path from the engine to the traction wheels. In other countershaft transmission mechanisms, the dog clutches or the synchronizer clutches may be mounted on the countershaft axis to selectively engage countershaft gear elements with torque transmitting gears on the mainshaft.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is known design practice to use a dual clutch arrangement for selectively connecting the engine to first and second torque input gears, sometimes called headset gears, of a countershaft transmission mechanism. An example of a dual clutch countershaft transmission mechanism of this type may be seen by referring to <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2006096414A"><text>US 2006/096 414</text></patcit>, entitled "Dual Clutch Assembly For A Heavy-Duty Automotive Powertrain." That application is assigned to the assignee of the present invention.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A dual clutch arrangement makes it possible for a countershaft transmission mechanism to be power-shifted from one ratio to another. As one of the dual clutches is engaged, the other is disengaged. The engaged clutch will establish a power delivery path through the countershaft gear elements and through the main transmission gears as one or more of the ratio change clutches are engaged. A ratio change clutch for a main transmission gear, or a countershaft gear element that is not involved in a given selected power flow path, can be pre-engaged in preparation for a ratio change to an adjacent ratio. When a ratio change is initiated, the ratio change clutch for one main gear or for one countershaft gear element is disengaged, and a power flow path is established by the pre-engaged ratio change clutch for a second main gear or a second countershaft gear element. The dual clutches of the dual clutch arrangement are alternately engaged and disengaged ("swapped" or "traded") thereby providing a smooth transition from one ratio to an adjacent ratio in a seamless fashion.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">If a multiple gear ratio power transmission mechanism of the type previously described is intended for use in a powertrain for a medium-duty or heavy-duty vehicle or truck, an increased number of gear ratios is required throughout the engine speed range. Typically, an increased number of gear ratios is achieved by combining a two-speed range gearing arrangement at a torque output portion of the multiple gear ratio transmission. Although a two-speed range<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> gearing arrangement is typical, a range gearing arrangement adapted for an increased number of ranges can be used if a particular application for the vehicle requires broader ratio coverage. A two-speed range gearing arrangement will double the number of gear ratios available in the powertrain. If a multiple ratio transmission mechanism has dual clutches, it can be power-shifted between ratios without torque interruption between the engine and the vehicle traction wheels.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">If the powertrain includes multiple speed range gearing in a torque flow path from the multiple ratio transmission mechanism to the vehicle traction wheels, it is necessary with known heavy-duty or medium-duty powertrains for the torque flow path to be interrupted during a transition from one range to the other. That torque interruption may deteriorate the shift quality because of inertia forces that are created. Further, the time needed to execute a ratio change in the range gearing increases the time needed to execute a shift between the highest overall ratio for one range to the adjacent lowest overall ratio for another range.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">An example of a multiple range gearing arrangement with an eight-speed transmission is described in a publication entitled "<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>Automotive Handbook," Third Edition, published by Bosch in 1993, page 544</text></nplcit>. The overall number of gear ratios in the transmission described in the Handbook is sixteen, which is twice the number of ratios available in the transmission gearing.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="GB2412148A"><text>GB 2 412 148 A</text></patcit>, which discloses the preamble of claim 1, discloses a power transmission mechanism for an engine-powered vehicle comprising a multiple ratio gear system including a first countershaft having countershaft gears mounted thereon, a second countershaft arranged concentrically about the first countershaft, and countershaft range gearing with a high range and a low range. The multiple ratio gear system has first and second torque input shafts. A dual clutch assembly with dual clutches is arranged for alternately connecting a vehicle engine selectively to the first and second torque input shafts. Ratio change clutches are provided in the gear system for selectively connecting and disconnecting elements of the gear system whereby a torque flow path for the gear system is defined for each ratio and a torque flow path for an adjacent gear ratio in a ratio change sequence is preselected. The countershaft range gearing has a low range pinion, which is secured to the second countershaft and continuously meshes with a low range output gear secured to an output shaft,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> and a high range pinion, which is journalled on the first countershaft and continuously meshes with a high range output gear secured to the output shaft. A countershaft range clutch is located between the low and high range pinions for releasably connecting the first countershaft alternately to those pinions depending on the selected range. The countershaft range clutch is placed in a neutral state disengaged from both pinions for operation in the forth gear to allow subsequent clutch shifting in preparation for a change into the high range or a downshift in the low range.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention provides a power transmission mechanism for an engine-powered vehicle having the features of independent claim 1. Preferred embodiments of present invention are subject-matter of dependent claims.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The invention comprises a multiple-speed transmission mechanism with dual clutches that selectively connect an engine in a vehicle powertrain to separate torque input elements of multiple ratio transmission gearing. A multiple-range gearing arrangement is compounded with the gears of multiple-ratio transmission gearing so that a transition may be made from a first range to a second range without torque interruption in the torque flow path between the engine and the traction wheels. In the case of a two-speed range gearing arrangement, the first speed range would be a so-called low range and the second speed range would be a so-called high range.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In accordance with present invention a power transmission mechanism for an engine-powered vehicle comprises a multiple ratio gear system and countershaft range gearing with at least two ranges including a high range and a low range, wherein the multiple ratio gear system has first and second torque input shafts. A dual clutch assembly with dual clutches is arranged for alternately connecting a vehicle engine selectively to the first and second torque input shafts. Ratio change clutches are provided in the gear system for selectively connecting and disconnecting elements of the gear system whereby a torque flow path for the gear system is defined for each ratio and a torque flow path for an adjacent gear<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> ratio in a ratio change sequence is preselected. The countershaft range gearing has a countershaft gear element engaged with a first countershaft gearing low ratio gear. A countershaft range clutch is provided for connecting a torque transmitting member of the multiple ratio gear system to a torque output shaft to establish a high range and connecting a second countershaft gearing low ratio gear to a torque transmitting member of the multiple ratio gear system to establish low range.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In each of the disclosed embodiments of the invention, the dual clutches between the torque input elements of the multiple ratio transmission and the engine can be selectively engaged and disengaged so that each gear ratio in the overall speed ratio range can be preselected as power is transferred through the powertrain with an adjacent overall ratio. This preselection is achieved for all power shifts between ratios regardless of whether the ratio change occurs in a low speed range or a high speed range. Torque interruption is avoided during transitions between the ranges.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of a powertrain that includes a multiple-speed, dual clutch transmission in combination with two-speed range planetary gearing, which powertrain is not covered by present invention as claimed;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 1a</figref> is an enlarged view of the two-speed range planetary gearing illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2</figref> is a schematic drawing of a dual clutch assembly for use with the transmission of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURE 3</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of an embodiment of a powertrain according to present invention with a multiple-ratio, four-speed transmission in combination with a two-speed range gearing arrangement with countershaft gear elements;<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIGURE 4</figref> is an illustration of the power flow path during operation of the transmission of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> in the first gear ratio in the low range, together with a preselected power flow path for the second gear ratio;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIGURE 5</figref> is an illustration of the power flow path for the transmission illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> during operation in the second ratio in the low range, together with a preselected power flow path for the third ratio;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIGURE 6</figref> is an illustration of a power flow path for the transmission of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> during operation in the third ratio in the low range, together with a preselected power flow path for the fourth ratio;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIGURE 7</figref> is an illustration of the power flow path for the transmission of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> during operation in the fourth ratio in the low range, together with a preselected power flow path for the fifth ratio;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIGURE 8</figref> is an illustration of the power flow path for the transmission of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> during operation in the fifth ratio in the high range, together with a preselected power flow path for the sixth ratio;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIGURE 9</figref> is an illustration of the power flow path for the transmission of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> during operation in the sixth ratio in the high range, together with a preselected power flow path for the seventh ratio;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIGURE 10</figref> is an illustration of the power flow path for the transmission of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> during operation in the seventh ratio in the high range, together with a preselected power flow path for the eighth ratio;<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">FIGURE 11</figref> is an illustration of the power flow path for the transmission of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> during operation in the first ratio in the low range, together with a preselected power flow path for the second ratio;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0012">FIGURE 12</figref> is an illustration of the transmission of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> showing the power flow path during operation in the second ratio in the low range, together with the preselected power flow path for the third ratio;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0013">FIGURE 13</figref> is an illustration of the transmission of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> showing the power flow path during operation in the third ratio in the low range, together with the preselected power flow path for the fourth ratio;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0014">FIGURE 14</figref> is an illustration of the transmission of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> showing the power flow path during operation in the fourth ratio in the low range, together with a preselected power flow path for the fifth ratio;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0015">FIGURE 15</figref> is an illustration of the transmission of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> showing the power flow path during operation in the fifth ratio in the high range;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0016">FIGURE 16</figref> is an illustration of the transmission of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> showing the power flow path during operation in the sixth ratio in the high range;

The clutch sleeve for clutch 84 is shifted to the left so that gear 64 becomes drivably connected to mainshaft 28. The clutch sleeve for range clutch 76 is shifted to the right, thus establishing a mechanical connection between ring gear 72 and the transmission housing.

The low range gearing remains unchanged. A transition from the first ratio to the second ratio, which may be considered to be a power shift, then is accomplished by "trading" or "swapping" clutches as the clutch for hollow input shaft 16 is released and the clutch for power input shaft 14 is applied.
