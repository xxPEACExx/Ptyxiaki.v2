load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to the transmission of digital information between electronic devices, particularly in the domain of digital multimedia communication, where such digital information is subject to conditional access constraints.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>STATE OF THE ART</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">As it is well known in the domain of digital multimedia data transmission, and especially in the transmission of audio/video digital information, such information is generally transmitted as part of a transport stream. A transport stream is made up of data packets, each data packet comprising a plurality of bits of information. Transport streams in the field of digital multimedia communication generally adhere to an MPEG format such as MPEG-2.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">United States Patent Publication number <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6226291B1"><text>6,226,291 B1</text></patcit> discloses that a transport stream is made up of a number of data packets and gives details of the construction of a data packet. The data packet comprises two parts, namely a header and a payload. In general, for a data packet length of I bits, I is greater than or equal to 2. Of those I bits, the header comprises n bits, where n is greater than or equal to 1 and the payload comprises the remaining I minus n bits. In the publication mentioned, the data packet is 188 bytes long, 4 bytes (32 bits) of which comprise the header, with the remaining 184 bytes comprising the payload. These are generally accepted values within the state of the art. The actual useful digital information forming the object of the communication is comprised within the payload. The header on the other hand comprises meta-information such as packet identifier (PID) for example.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Different types of data packets are known in the domain concerned, including content packets and stuffing packets. Content packets, or more particularly, the payloads of the content packets, comprise the actual digital information to be transmitted whereas the stuffing packets comprise dummy information not necessarily related to the actual audio/video content. By actual digital information to be transmitted it is understood to include portions of programming (i.e. audio/video content), system information and/or other related information. The use of stuffing packets is known<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> within the industry and is described in United States Patent Application Publication number <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20030133446A1"><text>2003/0133446 A1</text></patcit>, where they are used in a broadband packet-switching network environment to enable the reconstruction of a synchronous transport stream from a received asynchronous transport stream, the stuffing packets serving as markers to reserve space where content packets will be inserted once they are received.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Insomuch as the multimedia data transmission may comprise content of commercial value, distributors of such multimedia data, such as PayTV operators for example, generally transmit the data in encrypted format. In order to be able to decrypt the data at a receiving end, a user equipped with an appropriate multimedia reception module comprising a conditional access module is required to obtain appropriate authorisation to decrypt the data, usually through the purchase of necessary rights from the operator. The multimedia reception module works together with a security module in which the rights are stored, as well as any necessary decryption keys and other such secure information. The security module is usually detachable and portable and generally takes the form of a chip housed on a credit card sized device. United States Patent Application Publication number <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US20060176909A1"><text>2006/0176909 A1</text></patcit> gives a background to the use of such security modules in the domain of PayTV.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In spite of the security precautions employed in today's conditional access systems, it is still conceivably possible for a third party to intercept a communication between say a multimedia reception module and a security module. Even though the information thus intercepted may be in encrypted format, it may still be possible for a determined third party to obtain knowledge of the encryption algorithm and/or decryption keys and to be able to decrypt the intercepted information. In United States Patent Application Number <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US20090172171A1"><text>2009/0172171 A1</text></patcit>, a method for disguising a flow of data packets in a communication session is disclosed. This method renders difficult the job of reconstruction of the transmission by an intercepting party. By disguised, in this context, it is meant that the communication session has one or more characteristics, including its origin or source, changed in order to avoid the identification thereof by an intercepting party. Use may be made of a plurality of different communication routes to complete a single communication, thereby making it more difficult for an intercepting party to reconstruct the communication.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">United States Patent Application Publication number <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US2002154631A1"><text>2002/154631 A1</text></patcit> discloses a method for transmitting a message as packets over a network. Dummy packets are included in the transmission in order to confuse a potential malicious third party. An ordering key is added to the packets at random places, the ordering key of dummy packets being different from the ordering key of true packets and allowing for the position of the dummy packets within the transmission to be predicted.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In International Patent Application Publication number <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO9955052A1"><text>99/55052 A1</text></patcit> there is disclosed a method for filtering packets using digital signatures.

<ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> showing a transport stream according to the state of the art;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> showing a transport stream according to an embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 3</figref> showing details of the content of a first type of enhanced packet according to an embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 4</figref> showing details of the content of a second type of enhanced packet according to an embodiment of the present invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">An embodiment of the present invention may be deployed in a system comprising a first electronic device and a second electronic device connected together via a communication channel. The communication may bi-directional in that at a given time during a communication either of the first electronic device or the second electronic device may function as a transmitter while the remaining electronic device functions as a receiver.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In such a system, a third party may attempt to intercept a transmission being made on the communication channel, such transmission intended to be kept secret from the third party. As is commonly practiced in the domain of digital multimedia communication, especially audio/video content transmission, where the content to be transmitted has commercial value, the content is generally transmitted in encrypted format. However, it is still possible for a determined third party to intercept the transmission. The third party may be able to decrypt the transmission and may then forward the decrypted transmission to other non-authorised parties. By way of example, the third party may intercept a transmission between a multimedia module or set top box and a removable security module.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> illustrates a transport stream as is generally used in the state of the art to transmit audio/video content in MPEG format for example. The transport stream comprises a plurality of data packets each having a header and a payload.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to an embodiment of the present invention, digital information to be transmitted between a transmission entity and a reception entity is assembled at the transmission entity into a transport stream comprising enhanced packets. An enhanced packet comprising an enhanced header and an enhanced payload is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>. The enhanced header is similar to the header of a standard content packet as generally used in the state of the art, and indeed is designed such that a non-authorised third party is unable to detect that it may not be the header of a standard content packet. The enhanced payload may be interpreted as having two parts: a tag and a payload. The tag is represented by the first b bits of the enhanced payload and the payload is represented by the remaining bits of the enhanced payload.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In another embodiment of the present invention, the total length of an enhanced packet is increased with respect to a standard data packet. In this embodiment the enhanced payload comprises an entire standard data packet embedded within it, i.e. the enhanced payload comprises the header and the payload of the standard data packet. In this case, the tag of the enhanced payload is represented by the header of the standard packet comprised within the enhanced payload and the payload of the enhanced payload is the entire payload of the standard data packet.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Although the enhanced header of content enhanced packets and stuffing enhanced packets look, for all intents and purposes, the same as a header of a standard content packet to a third party, the structure of these headers may be defined as required by the particular application within the given constraint of appearing to be a standard header. These headers may therefore include such indicators as a timestamp, a serial number or a packet identifier for example.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As is the case with standard data packets, enhanced packets can be one of two types: content enhanced packets or stuffing enhanced packets. A content enhanced packet, i.e. an enhanced packet which is used to communicate a given valid content, comprises an enhanced header and an enhanced payload, where the enhanced payload comprises a tag (of b bits) and a payload, the payload being based on the payload of a standard content packet intended to communicate the same given valid content. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the tag is considered to be the first b bits of the enhanced payload. According to another embodiment, the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> tag is based on the header of a standard content packet intended to communicate the same given valid content. The total length of the content enhanced packet in this case is therefore longer than a standard data packet. According to different embodiments of the invention, the tag may be in encrypted format or in clear format. Similarly, the payload may be in encrypted or clear format. However, it is preferable for the tag and the payload to both be in encrypted format.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the case that the enhanced packet is a stuffing enhanced packet, the enhanced payload comprises a tag and a payload. The tag is based on a code selected from a subset of codes and is preferably in encrypted form although in some embodiments it may be in clear. The payload may be based on a pseudo-random number or it may be based on a payload of an existing content enhanced packet. The content of the payload is not important for a stuffing enhanced packet since such payloads will be ignored by authorised receivers. The main point is that the structures of stuffing enhanced packets and content enhanced packets must be such that they may not be differentiated by simple inspection.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">It is worth noting at this point that although the terms enhanced packet, content enhanced packet, enhanced header, enhanced payload, tag and payload are used throughout this description, in actual practice of a system in which an embodiment of the present invention is deployed an enhanced packet may look exactly the same as a standard data packet. For example, it could be that a content enhanced packet has an enhanced header which is identical to a header of a standard packet and a payload which is identical to the payload of a standard packet. The difference is that we refer to the payload as an enhanced payload for the purpose of describing the invention. In fact, we could equally refer to an enhanced packet having a header and a payload, of which the first b bits is a tag. In a content enhanced packet the tag plus the remainder of the enhanced payload is identical to the payload of an equivalent standard data packet which conveys the same content. In other words the content enhanced packet is identical to an equivalent standard data packet. The stuffing enhanced packet will have a header similar to a standard data packet, a tag which is created at the transmission entity and the remainder of the enhanced payload being either random or copied data.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to the invention, the enhanced packets are easy for a transmission entity to construct. Furthermore it is easy for a valid, or authorised, reception entity to detect which enhanced packets are content enhanced packets and which ones are stuffing enhanced packets. It is therefore easy for the authorised reception entity to efficiently discard the stuffing enhanced packets, even when the stuffing enhanced packets appear at unpredictable positions between the content enhanced packets within the transport stream. However, it is practically unfeasible for a non-authorised reception entity to tell the difference between content enhanced packets and stuffing enhanced packets and so in an endeavour not to lose what might be important data, the third party is obliged to attempt to treat all enhanced packets, thereby wasting processing time. Furthermore, even if the third party were to devise a means for processing all of the transmitted data, he still would not be able to reconstruct the useful content.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">By taking advantage of the opportunity afforded by the ability to efficiently construct stuffing enhanced packets and content enhanced packets by a transmission entity and the ability of a reception entity to efficiently recognise such packets, a very large number of stuffing enhanced packets can be included in a transport stream at unpredictable positions between the enhanced content packets. Indeed, according to the invention, the transport stream is transmitted across the data channel at a transmission rate which is largely increased with respect to the standard transmission rates used in the generally accepted transmission protocols in the industry, such as an MPEG format used within an IP network for example. Typically, a transmission of audio/video content in MPEG format between two components of a conditional access system, for example, would be made at a rate of 30-40 megabits per second. In a system in which an embodiment of the present invention is deployed, such a communication may be made at a rate of 500 megabits per second for example. This way, a maximum use of available bandwidth is possible, with stuffing enhanced packets being used to occupy bandwidth. As previously mentioned, the stuffing enhanced packets are unfeasibly difficult to recognise by an unauthorised reception entity or eavesdropper and so a potential eavesdropper is therefore led to try to intercept and process the entirety of the transport stream since he is unable to detect and reject stuffing packets. In order to do be able to intercept such a large amount of data, he must resort to the use of a dedicated hardware interception device rather<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> then a standard device such as a personal computer for example. Furthermore, even if the eavesdropper did manage to process all of the intercepted data, he would not be able to make any sense of it.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a content enhanced packet of bit length I comprises an enhanced header of n bits and an enhanced payload of I minus n bits. The enhanced header is in clear format. The enhanced payload comprises two parts: a tag and a payload. The tag has a length of b bits and is preferably in encrypted format. Since the enhanced payload, comprising the tag and the payload, has a bit length of I minus n bits, the payload therefore has a bit length of I minus n minus b bits. The payload is preferably in encrypted format and comprises the content to be transmitted. According to one embodiment of the present invention the tag is based on the header of a standard data packet which would communicate the same content to be transmitted. In another embodiment the b bit tag is based on the first b bits of the payload of a standard data packet which would communicate the same content to be transmitted.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A stuffing enhanced packet, also of bit length I bits, has an enhanced header of n bits, which is also in clear format, and an enhanced payload of I minus n bits. The enhanced payload also comprises a tag, preferably in encrypted format, of bit length b bits, however in this case, the payload of I minus n minus b bits is preferably based on a pseudo-random number or may be based on any other data since it will be ignored by authorised receivers. The structure of the stuffing enhanced packet is the same as the structure of the content enhanced packet.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The creation of a stuffing enhanced packet, according to an embodiment of the present invention may be described in two parts. First there is the preparation of the tag then there is an encryption. For the preparation of the tag, the transmission entity has knowledge of an efficient probabilistic algorithm, Sample(), which returns a random string from a predetermined subset, S, of strings of digital data. The reception entity has knowledge of an efficient algorithm, Test(x), which returns (with a high probability) a value of 1 if x is a member of the subset S and returns a 0 if x is not a member of the subset S. In other words, the transmission entity can select a code from a predetermined subset of codes, which an authorised reception entity can test to determine whether the code came from the predetermined subset or not.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Whether or not a code is tested as belonging to the predetermined subset indicates whether the associated enhanced packet should be discarded or not. Such algorithms are related to the domain of combinatorial property testing. Applications of this have been made in the fields of Learning Theory, Coding Theory and Complexity Theory, as described by <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Avrim Blum, Adam Kalai, Hal Wasserman in "Noise-tolerant Learning, the Parity Problem, and the Statistical Query Model" in Journal of the ACM 50(4): 506-519, 2003</text></nplcit>, and by <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="b"><text>Dana RON in "Handbook on Randomization, Volume II, 2001</text></nplcit>, Property Testing". A simple example of a suitable subset S is a random linear code of length b and rank strictly less than b, wherein code words have at least B errors for some fixed B. For a good choice of B, the reception entity can efficiently test that the word received belongs to S, for example using parity-check equations. This task is unfeasible for a third party which does not know S, as showed in "<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>On Lattices, Learning with Errors, Random Linear Codes, and Cryptography" by Oded Regev in the Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2005, on pages 84-93</text></nplcit>.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The type of code described above is suitable for the present invention in the sense that the application of the algorithms Sample() and Test(x) are convenient and efficient. The encryption part requires that the transmission entity and the authorised reception entity both share knowledge of a secret key (K) of k bits in length (i.e. a secret bit-string of k bits) and knowledge of a block cipher (or cryptographic algorithm) using blocks of b bits of data and a k-bit key. The two algorithms Sample() and Test(x) and the description of the subset S are kept secret from unauthorised third parties. However, the choice of the block cipher need not be kept secret: if an unauthorised third party were to gain knowledge of the block cipher or the k-bit key, then thanks to the invention, the security of the transmission would not be compromised.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The stuffing enhanced packets are created by the transmission entity. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 3</figref> shows an illustration of a stuffing enhanced packet. The enhanced header is constructed such that it looks like the header of a standard content packet. For example, the header could be identical to the header of a previously transmitted content enhanced packet. The actual details of the construction of a header depend on the specification of a legitimate header according to the system in question. The main point is that the header must not give any indication as to whether the enhanced payload comprises content information or stuffing information. In a transport stream comprising<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> stuffing enhanced packets then, since the headers of these packets are copied from content enhanced packets, it is likely that many packets exist with identical headers. In order not to allow a third party to guess where the content enhanced packet is within the plurality of packets having identical headers, it is convenient to arrange for the order of packets to vary such that the content enhanced packet does not appear systematically at the same position within the plurality of packets.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The enhanced payload of a stuffing enhanced packet is constructed in four steps:
<ul><li>the function Sample() is called to determine a value x of b bits in length;</li><li>the value x is encrypted using the block cipher under the key (K), giving (Enc<sub>K</sub> (x));</li><li>the first b bits of the enhanced payload are set to the encrypted value of x (in other words the tag is set to (Enc<sub>K</sub> (x));</li><li>the I minus n minus b remaining bits of the enhanced payload are set to a pseudorandom value</li></ul></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The content enhanced packets are also created by the transmission entity. A content enhanced packet is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 4</figref>. The header is constructed in the same way as above. The enhanced payload of a content enhanced packet is actually based on a corresponding standard content data packet, including its header and its payload. The tag, i.e. the first b bits, is generated by encrypting the b bits of the corresponding standard content packet using the block cipher and the k-bit key. The remaining I minus n minus b bits of the enhanced payload may also be generated by encrypting the payload using the block cipher and the k-bit key. The encryption may be done by using the cipher in CBC mode (Cipher Block Chaining).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Upon reception of a packet, the reception entity decrypts the tag of the enhanced packet, i.e. the first b bits of the enhanced payload, using the block cipher (i.e. Enc<sub>k</sub><sup>-1</sup> (b)). The reception entity then applies the algorithm Test(x) on the decrypted tag. If the result obtained is 1, then the enhanced packet is recognised as a stuffing enhanced packet and the packet is discarded. If the result is 0, then the packet is recognised as a content enhanced packet and the payload is decrypted using the block cipher. An encrypted transport stream is decrypted when the content enhanced packets comprised therein are decrypted and assembled to form a decrypted transport stream.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Examples of parameters which may be used in a preferred embodiment of the present invention to give a sufficiently high probability of correctly detecting stuffing packets by an authorised reception entity are as follows:
<ul><li>Packet length, I = 1536 bits;</li><li>Header length, n = 64 bits;</li><li>Block length (tag length), b = 128 bits;</li><li>Payload of stuffing enhanced packets: pseudo-random value;</li><li>Block cipher: AES-128 (Advanced Encryption Standard) (i.e. with b=k=128) used in CBC mode;</li><li>Subset, S: codeword of length 128 bits from a linear code of dimension 64 with a bounded number of errors; recognition based on detecting that the number of errors is below the bound.</li></ul></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">With the latter choice of efficiently samplable and testable subset, S, the problem of recognition of stuffing enhanced packets for an eavesdropper who knows the block cipher and the key is related to the Learning With Errors (LWE) computational problem, which is disclosed in the report "<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>On Lattices, learning with errors, random linear codes, and cryptography" by Oded Regev in the Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2005, on pages 84-93</text></nplcit>.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, instead of using the algorithms Sample() and Test(x), the transmission entity generates a list of codes that are deemed to be useful as markers in that the probability of such codes appearing as a tag in a content enhanced packet is negligibly small. In this embodiment, the transmission entity communicates its list of codes to authorised reception entities. The transmission entity then selects codes from the generated list, encrypts the codes and uses the encrypted codes as tags to mark stuffing enhanced packets before including them in a transmission. Since the authorised reception entities have knowledge of currently valid encryption keys, they may generate at a given time a valid list of encrypted tags and, by simple comparison of the received incoming encrypted tags, can efficiently detect and reject stuffing enhanced packets.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Different methods may be used to minimise the probability of one or more of the codes selected to generate tags coinciding with a code which may actually appear in the first b bits of a payload. For example, it could be determined that the first b bits of<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> a payload only cover a certain range, in which case the codes used for the tag would come from outside of that range. However, it may still be possible for a collision to occur, a collision meaning an instance where the first b bits of a payload are equal to one of the values selected to be usable in generating a tag. If a payload like this exists, then the reception entity will wrongly reject the packet as being a stuffing packet. According to an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the transmission entity is able to predict a collision by systematically comparing the first b bits of all payloads with all members of the subset of codes used in generating tags. Statistical information may be kept related to the number of collisions thus found with a view to continuously improving the quality of the set of codes used for creating tags. If the length b is selected to be sufficiently large, then the probability of such collisions appearing is very small and the consequence of a reception entity wrongly rejecting a packet negligible, however with such a prediction mechanism deployed in the system ongoing improvements in the quality of the tag subset are possible. Rather than merely providing statistics, the subset of codes could simply be continuously updated by removing each code which is detected to have caused a collision.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56985215" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Verfahren zum Erzeugen eines verbesserten Datenstroms aus einem Transportstrom, mit einer Vielzahl von Standarddatenpaketen, jedes mit einem Dateikopf und Nutzdaten, wobei der verbesserte Datenstrom mindestens ein verbessertes Stuffing-Paket und mindestens ein verbessertes Content-Paket aufweist, wobei das verbesserte Stuffing-Paket und das verbesserte Content-Paket je einen Dateikopf und verbesserte Nutzdaten umfassen, wobei der Dateikopf des verbesserten Content-Pakets nicht von dem Dateikopf des verbesserten Stuffing-Pakets zu unterscheiden ist, wobei das Verfahren folgendes umfasst:
