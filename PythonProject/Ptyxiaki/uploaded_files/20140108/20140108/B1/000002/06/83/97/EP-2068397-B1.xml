Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a radome for protecting a radio wave device from the outside environment, and a method of producing the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a radome for use in aircraft, vehicles, etc., and a method of producing the same.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Radomes must not block the radio waves to be received, transmitted, or received/transmitted by a radio wave device and must have the structural strength required to protect the radio wave device from the outside environment.<br/>
Mentioned as a conventional radome having such properties there are radomes using a composite material having reinforced fiber in a matrix resin, i.e., a single layer panel formed of a fiber reinforced plastic. Moreover, there are also radomes using sandwich structure panels in which a core formed of a low density dielectric such as a foamed body is sandwiched between a first composite material facing having a reinforced fiber in a matrix resin and a second composite material facing opposite to the first composite material facing (e.g., see <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2007519298T"><text>JP 2007-519298 T</text></patcit>). Such sandwich structure panels can reduce the dielectric constant as a whole while maintaining the structural strength by sandwiching a low density dielectric therein. Therefore, the sandwich structure panels can improve the transmission loss of radio waves to thereby improve the properties of a radome as compared with a single layer panel formed of a fiber reinforced plastic.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Here, as the reinforced fiber, a glass fiber is generally used. From the viewpoint of further reducing the dielectric constant, it is also known to use a fiber such as polyester-polyarylate fibers and ultrahigh molecular weight olefin fibers in which the dielectric constant of the fiber itself is low (e.g., <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2007519298T"><text>JP 2007-519298 T</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP6010233A"><text>JP 06-10233 A</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, in the case of using a fiber reinforced plastic in which a glass fiber is used as a reinforced fiber, a large amount of glass fiber needs to be added to a matrix resin so as to achieve the rigidity required in a radome. Since the dielectric constant of generally-used glass is about 4 to about 7 (e.g., the dielectric constant of E-Glass which is a glass fiber generally used for electrical applications is 6.6), such a fiber reinforced plastic cannot reduce the dielectric constant. Thus, a radome using such a material has increased transmission loss of radio waves.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In contrast, in the case of using, as a reinforced fiber, an organic fiber having a low dielectric constant such as polyester-polyarylate fibers and ultrahigh molecular weight olefins, the dielectric constant can be reduced. However, since organic fibers having a low dielectric constant generally have a weak adhesion force with a matrix resin, the interface between the organic fiber and the matrix becomes slippery. As a result, a radome using such a material is likely to suffer from plastic deformation when distortion in the bending direction is applied by a load such as wind.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Moreover, by the use of a glass cloth as a reinforced fiber for the composite material facing of the sandwich structure panels of <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2007519298A"><text>JP 2007-519298 A</text></patcit>, plastic deformation can be prevented. However, since the dielectric constant of the core is considerably different from the dielectric constant of the composite material facing, reflection is likely to occur when a radio wave transmits between the composite<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> material facing and the core and, moreover, the number of side lobes increases remarkably, resulting in increased transmission loss of radio waves.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Further prior art documents are <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US5408244A"><text>US 5408244 A</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US7242365B1"><text>US 7242365 B1</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further, a method of producing a radome using sandwich structure panels has problems with workability. More specifically, although it is possible to form a radome having a curved surface shape, it is difficult to form a radome having an angled portion. Specifically, when the core material of the sandwich structure panels is folded or two or more of the core materials are connected in producing the sandwich structure panels, the density becomes coarse due to the formation of cracks and compression parts in the core material, which become a singular point of the dielectric constant, resulting in increased transmission loss of radio waves. Moreover, in the method of producing a radome using sandwich structure panels, the first composite material facing, the second composite material facing, and the core are produced separately, and then the composite material facings and the core need to be laminated with each other, giving rise to problem that the production process is complicated.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention has been made in order to solve the above-mentioned problems. An object of the present invention is to provide a radome which has excellent transmission loss of radio waves and structural strength, which can be easily produced, and which has favorable workability, and a method of producing the same.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The inventors of the present invention have conducted extensive research in order to solve the above-mentioned problems. As a result, the inventors of the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> present invention found that: by impregnating an olefin woven material and a glass cloth with a matrix resin to thereby integrate them, changes in the dielectric constant in a radome material can be reduced while reflecting the low dielectric constant of the olefin woven material; and by disposing a glass cloth at the inner side of a radome where the radome is most severely distorted by a load applied to the radome in the bending direction from the outside environment side, the glass cloth and the matrix resin easily form a hydrogen bond to thereby increase the structural strength, to thus accomplish the present invention.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">That is, the present invention provides a radome according to claims 1-6.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Further, the present invention provides a method of producing a radome according to claim 7.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present invention can provide a radome which has excellent transmission loss of radio waves and structural strength, which can be easily produced, and which has favorable workability, and a method of producing the same.</p><heading id="h0005"><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the accompanying drawings:

In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a radome 1 is fixed to a base 2 with fixing screws 4, and a radio wave device 3 containing an antenna is disposed inside the radome 1.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The radome 1 protects the radio wave device 3 from the outside environment (e.g., natural environment such as wind, sunlight, rain, and seawater, impact from the outside, and dust). When a radio wave is received/transmitted between the outside and the antenna, the radio wave passes through the radome 1. Here, although the shape of the radome 1 may be suitably determined, if the radio wave<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> device 3 moves, the radome 1 must be structured in such a manner that it does not interfere with the radio wave device 3. Moreover, the radome 1 is disposed in such a manner that the distance from the central part of the antenna to the radome 1 is as equal as possible in the direction of the output radio wave of the antenna and that a radio wave enters perpendicular to the radome 1.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In order for a radio wave to pass through the radome 1, a dielectric may be chosen as a material to be used in the radome 1, However, in order for a radio wave to reach a distant place and to receive a very weak radio wave, a material with little radio wave transmission loss needs to be used. Then, there is a method of reducing the transmission loss due to reflection by reducing the dielectric constant of a material used for the radome 1 so that it is close to the dielectric constant of air. Moreover, there is also a method of reducing the heat loss of the radome 1 by using a material with little dielectric loss as a material for the radome 1 or reducing the thickness of the radome 1. It should be noted that when the thickness of the radome 1 is reduced, it is also necessary to increase the rigidity of the material used for the radome 1.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> is an enlarged cross sectional view illustrating a part of the radome according to this embodiment. In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, the radome 1 is formed of a substance obtained by impregnating an olefin woven material 5 and a glass cloth 6 with a matrix resin 7 to be integrated with each other. The glass cloth 6 is disposed closer to the inner side of the radome than the olefin woven material 5. The inner side of the radome as used herein refers to the side in contact with the internal space of the radome 1 where the radio wave device 3 is disposed.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A portion where the olefin woven material 5 has been impregnated with the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> matrix resin 7 forms an olefin woven material-containing area layer 8, and a portion where the glass cloth 6 has been impregnated with the matrix resin 7 forms a glass cloth-containing area layer 9. It should be noted that since the olefin woven material 5 and the glass cloth 6 are integrated with each other using a single matrix resin 7, the boundaries of each of the olefin woven material-containing area layer 8 and the glass cloth-containing area layer 9 are not clear.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Further, the outside environment is in contact with a radome outer surface 10, and the internal space where the radio wave device 3 is disposed is in contact with a radome inner surface 11. It should be noted that, although <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> illustrates one olefin woven material 5 and one glass cloth 6, a plurality of olefin woven materials 5 and glass cloth 6 may be used insofar as the positional relationship between the olefin woven material 5 and the glass cloth 6 is satisfied.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the radome 1, since the radio wave from the antenna enters perpendicular to the radome 1, the main transmission direction of the radio wave is the thickness direction of the radome 1.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">When a load is applied to the radome 1 in the thickness direction from the outside environment side by wind or the like, the radome 1 is distorted in the thickness direction; the compressive strain in the plane direction becomes large in the vicinity of the radome outer surface 10; and the elongation strain in the plane direction becomes large in the vicinity of the radome inner surface 11 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Here, the interface between the olefin woven material 5 and the matrix resin 7 is schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref>. The olefin woven material 5 has a low dielectric constant because the olefin woven material 5 has an outermost surface with<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> a molecular structure in which there are few or no functional groups other than C-H and there are no polar groups. However, since the olefin woven material 5 has an outermost surface with a molecular structure in which there are few or no functional groups other than C-H, neither a chemical bond nor a hydrogen bond is formed between the olefin woven material 5 and the matrix resin 7. Thus, van der Waals force, which is very weak force as compared with the above-mentioned bindings, serves as the main adhesion force between the olefin woven material 5 and the matrix resin 7. Therefore, stress occurs in the interface between the olefin woven material 5 and the matrix resin 7, and sliding is likely to occur. Thus, the stress is not transmitted to the olefin woven material 5. Moreover, the molecular structure of the outermost surface of the olefin woven material 5 can be reformed by subjecting the olefin woven material 5 to surface treatment such as corona discharge treatment. However, the adhesion force is not sufficient. As a result, the matrix resin 7 is destroyed, resulting in the occurrence of plastic deformation. The plastic deformation is likely to occur particularly when the volume fraction of the olefin woven material 5 to the matrix resin 7 is increased so as to reduce the dielectric constant or when a load is applied in the compression direction.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Next, the interface between the glass cloth 6 and the matrix resin 7 is schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>. Since the glass cloth 6 has an outermost surface with a molecular structure in which there are a large number of polar groups such as a hydroxy group, a hydrogen bond 12 is easily formed with high density between the polar groups such as hydroxy groups of the glass cloth 6 and the polar groups such as hydroxy groups of the matrix resin 7. Therefore, even when stress occurs in the interface between the glass cloth 6 and the matrix resin 7, the stress is sufficiently<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> transmitted to the glass cloth 6, and thus plastic deformation is less likely to occur due to a sufficiently high adhesion force between the glass cloth 6 and the matrix resin 7.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the radome 1 of this embodiment, the glass cloth 6 is disposed at the inner side of the radome (i.e., in the vicinity of the radome inner surface 11) where the elongation strain in the plane direction is the largest to thereby form the glass cloth-containing area layer 9. Even when a load is applied to the radome 1 in the thickness direction from the outside environment side, stress is sufficiently transmitted to the glass cloth 6, and plastic deformation is less likely to occur.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In contrast, the dielectric constant of the radome 1 can be reduced by the use of a material having a lower dielectric constant. However, the effect of reducing the dielectric constant of the radome 1 does not vary depending on the position of the material having a lower dielectric constant in the thickness direction. Therefore, by disposing the olefin woven material 5 serving as the material having a lower dielectric constant at the outer side of the radome with respect to the glass cloth 6, the dielectric constant of the radome 1 can be reduced to thereby improve the transmission loss of radio waves.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">It should be noted that, in this embodiment, the glass cloth 6 is disposed at the inner side of the radome where the elongation strain in the plane direction is the largest to thereby form the glass cloth-including area layer 9, whereby plastic deformation is less likely to occur. Therefore, even when the olefin woven material 5 is disposed closer to the outer side of the radome than the glass cloth 6, the structural strength of the radome 1 is sufficiently secured.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Moreover, in the radome 1 of this embodiment, by using the olefin woven<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> material 5 and the glass cloth 6 as reinforced fibers, and integrating them with one matrix resin 7, the boundaries of each area layer are not made clear. Therefore, reflection (side lobe) of a radio wave can be suppressed to thereby improve the transmission loss of radio waves.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">There is no limitation on the olefin woven material 5 used in this embodiment, and any substances known in the art can be used.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">It is preferable that the dielectric constant of the olefin woven material 5 be lower, and be lower than that of the glass fiber, specifically 4 or lower. When the dielectric constant thereof exceeds 4, a desired effect (effect of reducing a dielectric constant) to be obtained by the use of the olefin woven material 5 may not be achieved. Moreover, as the olefin woven material 5, woven materials using long fibers are preferable because the strength in the stretching direction can be maintained and the impregnation of the matrix resin 7 is facilitated. Further, from the viewpoint of increasing the adhesiveness with the matrix resin 7, the surface of the olefin woven material 5 may be subjected to surface treatment, such as corona discharge treatment.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">A preferable example of the olefin woven material 5 includes a woven material formed of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene fiber. Such a woven material can reflect the outstanding tensile strength and elastic modulus to the properties of the radome 1. As the ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene fiber, Dyneema (dielectric constant: 2.2, molecular weight: 4,000,000) commercially available from Toyobo Co., Ltd., can be used, for example.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In the radome 1 of this embodiment, the portion where the olefin woven material 5 has been impregnated with the matrix resin 7 forms the olefin woven<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> material-containing area layer 8. It is preferable that the thickness of the olefin woven material-containing area layer 8 be 1/20 or lower of a wavelength of a target radio wave from the view point of preventing the reflection of the target radio wave in the radome 1. When the thickness thereof exceeds 1/20 of a wavelength of the target radio wave, reflection of the object radio wave may occur in the radome 1. Here, there is no limitation on the target radio wave, and a broadband radio wave including a high frequency region from several GHz to 40 GHz is acceptable.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Moreover, the radome 1 of this embodiment is structured in such a manner that: a portion through which the target radio wave passes and a portion through which the target radio wave does not pass are separated; electrical properties are prioritized in the portion through which the target radio wave passes; and mechanical properties are prioritized in the portion through which the target radio wave does not pass. Specifically, it can be structured in such a manner that, in the portion through which the target radio wave does not pass, no olefin woven material 5 is disposed, i.e., the olefin woven material-containing area layer 8 is not formed. This is because the dielectric constant does not need to be decreased in the portion through which the target radio wave does not pass; and when the olefin woven material-containing area layer 8 is not formed, the design flexibility, the tensile strength, and the elastic modulus of the radome 1 become high, which makes it possible to partially increase the structural strength of the radome 1.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Moreover, in the portion through which the target radio wave does not pass, the glass cloth 6 can be disposed in place of the olefin woven material 5 from the viewpoint of improving workability. Further, from the viewpoint of improving the buckling resistance, the thickness of portions through which the target radio wave<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> does not pass can be increased as compared with portions through which the target radio wave passes.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">There is no limitation on the glass cloth 6 used in this embodiment, and any substances known in the art can be used.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Examples of the glass cloth 6 include a cloth using NE-Glass (manufactured by Nitto Boseki Co., Ltd., dielectric constant: 4.7) which is a glass cloth having low dielectric properties.
