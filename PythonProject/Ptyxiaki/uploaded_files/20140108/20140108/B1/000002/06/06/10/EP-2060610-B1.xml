When the recording paper curls, paper conveyance in ink-jet printers becomes troublesome; paper conveyance may possibly become difficult, especially at the time of high-speed<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> printing or double-sided printing.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Because of the above-mentioned problem, a formulation of ink capable of reducing the occurrence of paper curling related to the amount of ink attached is hoped for.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As to high-speed ink-jet printers with line heads, in particular, there is a much greater need for the formulation of ink than in the case of serial printers. To reduce curling of recording paper, the following methods have been proposed, for example: a method of adding into an ink a copolymer of acrylic acid and vinylpyrrolidone having a molecular weight of approximately 80,000 to 250,000 (refer, for example, to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP10001629A"><text>10-1629</text></patcit>); a method of adding into an ink a pigment and colloidal silica having an average particle diameter of 5nm to 100nm (refer, for example, to <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP9227812A"><text>JP-A No. 09-227812</text></patcit>); and a method of adding into an ink a water-soluble organic solvent whose solubility parameter is greater than or equal to 8 and less than 12 and a metal oxide colloid (refer, for example, to <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2006321876A"><text>JP-A No. 2006-321876</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, any of those conventionally proposed methods for reducing curling of recording paper is a method of reducing absorption of moisture in the ink into the recording paper, namely cellulose fiber, by adding a certain solid content into the ink. To reduce curling of the recording paper, it is necessary to maintain hydrogen bonds which<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> act between cellulose molecules constituting the cellulose fiber; mere addition of a solid content into the ink allows an ink solvent (based upon alcohol, water, etc.) to permeate between the cellulose molecules, thereby causing the cellulose fiber to swell, and so cannot reduce the occurrence of curling of the recording paper.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Also, when an attempt is made to sufficiently reduce permeation of the ink solvent (based upon alcohol, water, etc.) between the cellulose molecules by adding a large amount of solid content into the ink, there is such a problem that the continuous ejection stability of the ink from an ink-jet head degrades, and the ejection stability of the ink from the ink-jet head degrades after left unused.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention examines a composition of an ink-jet O/W emulsion ink having an aqueous continuous phase and a nonaqueous discontinuous phase and is aimed at reducing the occurrence of curling of recording paper by reducing permeation of an ink solvent (based upon alcohol, water, etc.) between cellulose molecules of the recording paper, without impairing the ink's favorable continuous ejection stability from an ink-jet head and the ink's favorable ejection stability from the ink-jet head after left unused.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Means for solving the problems are as follows.
<ul><li>&lt;1&gt; An ink-jet O/W emulsion ink including an aqueous continuous phase (a), and a nonaqueous discontinuous phase (b), wherein the aqueous continuous phase (a) includes water, at least one pigment and at least one ionic or nonionic surfactant, and the nonaqueous discontinuous phase (b) includes at least one water-insoluble organic material having a hydroxyl group, wherein the at least one water-insoluble organic material having a hydroxyl group, contained in the nonaqueous discontinuous phase (b), is a hydroxy fatty acid ester of a polyhydric alcohol.</li><li>&lt;2&gt; The ink-jet O/W emulsion ink according to &lt;1&gt;, wherein the nonaqueous discontinuous phase (b) occupies 1% by mass to 74% by mass of the ink-jet O/W emulsion ink.</li><li>&lt;3&gt; The ink-jet O/W emulsion ink according to &lt;1&gt;, wherein the aqueous continuous phase (a) contains a nonvolatile water-soluble organic solvent.</li><li>&lt;4&gt; An ink-jet recording method including performing recording by ejecting an ink from an ink-jet head fixed in the form of a line, wherein the ink is the ink-jet O/W emulsion ink according to any one of &lt;1&gt; to &lt;3&gt;.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The ink-jet O/W emulsion ink of the present invention has made it possible to effectively reduce the occurrence of curling of recording paper and also to practically maintain the ink's favorable continuous ejection stability and the ink's favorable ejection stability after left unused.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Specifically, due to the structure in which a nonaqueous discontinuous phase that contains at least one water-insoluble organic material having a hydroxyl group is dispersed and emulsified in an aqueous continuous phase, the at least one water-insoluble organic material having a hydroxyl group, which is a discontinuous phase component, permeates between cellulose molecules, with a water-insoluble component covering hydrogen bonds that lie between the cellulose molecules, and thus permeation of the aqueous continuous phase (based upon alcohol, water, etc.) can be reduced. More specifically, this is possible because the water-insoluble organic material has fewer hydrogen bond portions, as is evident from its insolubility in water, and thus the water-insoluble organic material has lower surface tension and tends to permeate between the cellulose molecules sooner. Additionally, this is possible also because the hydroxyl group of the water-insoluble organic material undergoes hydrogen bonding with a hydroxyl group of a cellulose molecule and remains in the cellulose molecule portion, and the water-insoluble<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> component of the water-insoluble organic material covers the hydrogen bond of the cellulose molecule, thereby preventing contact between the hydrogen bond and the aqueous continuous phase (based upon alcohol, water, etc.).</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Furthermore, what covers the hydrogen bond of the cellulose molecule and thusly prevents contact between the hydrogen bond and the aqueous continuous phase (based upon alcohol, water, etc.) is the discontinuous phase of the O/W emulsion, in other words, a liquid; therefore, even if the aqueous continuous phase volatilizes, precipitation of a solid content, solidification and reduction in fluidity do not easily arise, and so the ink's continuous ejection stability and the ink's ejection stability after left unused are favorable.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a structural model diagram of an ink-jet O/W emulsion ink of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> is a model diagram composed of parts (a), (b) and (c), showing how the occurrence of curling of recording paper is prevented.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic structural diagram of an ink-jet recording apparatus.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><heading id="h0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">The following specifically explains an ink-jet O/W emulsion ink of the present invention, and a recording method using the same.

More specifically, the water infiltrates into the paper, and thus the hydrogen bond between the cellulose molecules is broken as shown in the figure. This causes the fiber to slacken and elongate. Here, when the water disappears from its position as it dries up or moves, the fiber contracts and the broken hydrogen bond re-forms. However, such pressure that is applied at the time of papermaking is not applied to the paper on this occasion; thus, in the drying process, the fiber is subjected to hydrogen bonding in positions where the fiber is slack, which causes the paper to have a different form.
