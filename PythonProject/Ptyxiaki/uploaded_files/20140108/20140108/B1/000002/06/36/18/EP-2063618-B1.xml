Such fast transmission is achieved by utilizing frequencies that are normally not used by a voice telephone call, in particular, frequencies higher than normal human hearing.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">VDSL (Very High Speed DSL) is an xDSL technology providing faster data transmission over a single twisted pair of wires. High bit rates are achieved at a range of about 300 meters (1000 ft), which allows for 26 Mbit/s with symmetric access or up to 52 Mbit/s in downstream - 12 Mbit/s in upstream with asymmetric access.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">According to its high bandwidth, VDSL is capable of supporting applications like HDTV, as well as telephone services (e.g., Voice over IP) and general Internet access, over a single connection.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">VDSL2 (Very High Speed Digital Subscriber Line 2) is an access technology that exploits the existing infrastructure of copper wires that were originally used for plain old telephone service (POTS). It can be deployed from central<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> offices, from fiber-fed cabinets preferably located near the customer premises, or within buildings.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">VDSL2 is designed to support the wide deployment of Triple Play services such as voice, video, data, high definition television (HDTV) and interactive gaming. VDSL2 enables operators and carriers to gradually, flexibly, and cost efficiently upgrade existing xDSL infrastructure.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">ITU-T G.993.2 (VDSL2) is an enhancement to G.993.1 (VDSL) that permits the transmission of asymmetric and symmetric (full duplex) aggregate data rates up to 200 Mbit/s on twisted pairs using a bandwidth up to 30 MHz.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The xDSL wide band modulation approaches are problematic relating to crosstalk interference that is introduced to the twisted pair transmission line and received by the modem.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Crosstalk occurs when wires are coupled, in particular between wire pairs of the same or a nearby bundle that are used for separate signal transmission. Hence, data signals from one or more sources can be superimposed on and contaminate a data signal. The crosstalk comprises a near-end crosstalk (NEXT) and a far-end crosstalk (FEXT).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Based on such crosstalk, data signals transmitted over twisted-pair lines can be considerably degraded by the crosstalk interference generated on one or more adjacent twisted-pair phone lines in the same and/or a nearby multicore cable or bundle. With an increasing transmission speed, this problem even deteriorates, which may significantly limit a maximum data rate to be transmitted via a single line.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A multiple-input-multiple-output system (hereinafter referred to as MIMO system) is of significant importance in modern communication technology. Such MIMO system allows to model crosstalk interference of a telecommunication system.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1</figref> illustrates in particular crosstalk comprising NEXT and FEXT components between a central office (CO) comprising several transceivers COO to CON and several Customer Premises Equipments CPE0 to CPEN, connected via a Cable Binder.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">An impact of NEXT can be reduced by utilizing frequency-division duplex between upstream and downstream direction. Current VDSL2 deployments are (indirectly) FEXT limited due to the choice of a relatively conservative Power Spectral Density (PSD) mask, thereby allowing to reduce NEXT in conjunction with a strong loop attenuation at frequencies beyond 1 MHz.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Downstream precompensation (achieved in particular by precoding) or upstream cancellation may allow utilization of more aggressive PSD masks (in particular with full binder deployments); at least, improvements regarding the reach and/or the data rate can be achieved by reducing crosstalk at existing PSD levels.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><b>In "</b><nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Binder MIMO channels" by Bin Lee et al., IEEE Transactions on Communications, vol. 55, no. 8, 1 August 2007</text></nplcit><b>, a channel model that can be used for precompensation is introduced.
