invention relates to a control apparatus for an internal combustion engine including a particulate collection filter and a three-way catalyst in an exhaust passage.</p><heading id="h0003">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally, there has been known a control apparatus for an internal combustion engine which collects particulates (particulate matter (PM); i.e., nano-particulates such as SOF and soot) discharged from a diesel engine, by use of a particulate collection filter (particulate filter) disposed in an exhaust passage, and, when a predetermined condition is satisfied, regenerates the particulate collection filter by burning particulates collected by the particulate collection filter. One of such conventional control apparatuses is configured such that it detects an air-fuel ratio upstream of the particulate collection filter and an air-fuel raio downstream of the particulate collection filter, determines on the basis of the detected air-fuel ratios whether or not the particulate collection filter is being regenerated (whether or not the collected particulates is burning), and changes over the operation mode of an engine on the basis of the results of the determination (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (<i>kokai</i>) No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2005240719A"><text>JP 2005-240719 A</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In order to burn particulates collected by a particulate collection filter, the particulate collection filter must be high in temperature, and oxygen must be supplied to the particulate collection filter. The above-described<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> conventional control apparatus is applied to a diesel engine in which a gas mixture to be supplied to the engine is very lean. Therefore, oxygen for burning particulates is sufficiently supplied to the particulate collection filter. Thus, the above-described conventional control apparatus elevates the temperature of the particulate collection filter by, for example, delaying the timing of fuel injection, increasing the amount of injected fuel, or decreasing the amount of intake air by means of an intake throttle valve, to thereby burn the collected particulates.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In recent years, in order to reduce the amount of particulates discharged from a gasoline engine, disposing a particulate collection filter in an exhaust passage of the gasoline engine has been considered. Meanwhile, in a general gasoline engine, in order to reduce the amount of unburned substances (HC, CO, etc.) discharged to the atmosphere and the amount of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) discharged to the atmosphere, a three-way catalyst is provided in the exhaust passage, and the amount of fuel is controlled such that the air-fuel ratio of a gas mixture to be supplied to the engine (hereinafter also referred to as the "air-fuel ratio of the engine") becomes equal to an air-fuel ratio close to a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As described above, oxygen must be supplied to the particulate collection filter in order to regenerate the particulate collection filter (in order to burn particulates). However, when the air-fuel ratio of the engine is controlled to an air-fuel ratio near the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, oxygen is hardly supplied to the particulate collection filter. In particular, in the case where an upstream catalyst, which is a three-way catalyst, is provided upstream of the particulate collection filter, oxygen is consumed and stored by the upstream catalyst, so that the amount of oxygen flowing into the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> particulate collection filter becomes very small. Accordingly, in order to regenerate the particulate collection filter in the gasoline engine, oxygen must be supplied to the particulate collection filter by controlling the air-fuel ratio of the engine to a lean-side air-fuel ratio in relation to (compared to) the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (hereinafter referred to as a "lean air-fuel ratio"). However, setting the air-fuel ratio of the engine to a lean air-fuel ratio irrespective of the state of the three-way catalyst may cause a case where "a large amount of nitrogen oxides, which are discharged from the engine when the air-fuel ratio of the engine is a lean air-fuel ratio, cannot be removed by the three-way catalyst, and thus, a large amount of nitrogen oxides may be discharged to the atmosphere."<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2002086301A"><text>WO 2002/086301 A</text></patcit> discloses a control apparatus for a Diesel engine having a particulate collection filter in an exhaust passage, and a downstream catalyst which is a three-way catalyst.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Document <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP1953358A"><text>EP 1 953 358 A</text></patcit> discloses a control apparatus for a Diesel engine having a catalyst which is downstream of a particulate collection filter.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide a control apparatus for an internal combustion engine (gasoline engine) including a particulate collection filter and a three-way catalyst in an exhaust passage, the control apparatus being capable of regenerating the particulate collection filter (burning particulates collected by the particulate collection filter), without increasing the discharge amount of nitrogen oxides.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The above object is solved by a control apparatus for an internal combustion engine having the features of claim 1. Advantageous further developments are subject matter of the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">This control apparatus for an internal combustion engine according to the present invention<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> comprises a particulate collection filter, a downstream catalyst, reduced-state determination means, and air-fuel-ratio control means.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The particulate collection filter is disposed in an exhaust passage of the internal combustion engine. In the case where the internal combustion engine is a multi-cylinder internal combustion engine, the particulate<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> collection filter is interposed in an exhaust passage at a location downstream of a merging portion of an exhaust manifold connected to the cylinders (the merging portion is a portion where branch portions connected to the cylinders merge together). The control apparatus may comprise an upstream catalyst, which is a three-way catalyst and has an oxygen storage function and which is disposed in the exhaust passage at a location upstream of the particulate collection filter (however, downstream of the merging portion of the exhaust manifold).</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The downstream catalyst is disposed in the exhaust passage at a location downstream of the particulate collection filter. The downstream catalyst is a three-way catalyst and has an oxygen storage function.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The reduced-state determination means determines whether or not the downstream catalyst (the state of the downstream catalyst) has reached a "reduced state in which the downstream catalyst can remove at least a predetermined amount (a predetermined amount or more) of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>)." Such a "reduced state" can be said to be a state in which the amount of oxygen stored in the downstream catalyst is smaller than the maximum oxygen storage amount of the downstream catalyst by a certain amount (for example, a first predetermined amount), and, the downstream catalyst can store oxygen molecules taken from the nitrogen oxides even when the predetermined amount of nitrogen oxides flow into the downstream catalyst.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The air-fuel-ratio control means controls the averaged air-fuel ratio of a gas mixture (gas mixture containing air and fuel) to be supplied to the engine to a "first air-fuel ratio" within a "predetermined air-fuel ratio range including the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio." This control is also called "near<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> stoichiometric air-fuel ratio control." When the downstream catalyst is determined to have reached the reduced state, the air-fuel-ratio control means controls the averaged air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine to a "second air-fuel ratio" which is "on the lean side in relation to (compared to) the first air-fuel ratio and on the lean side in relation to (compared to) the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio." This control is also called "filter regeneration control" and is executed over a predetermined period of time (filter generation period). When the averaged air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine is controlled to the second air-fuel ratio, excessive oxygen discharged from the engine is supplied to the particulate collection filter, and particulates collected by the particulate collection filter are burned. That is, the particulate collection filter is regenerated.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The above-described "first air-fuel ratio within a predetermined air-fuel ratio range including the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio" means an air-fuel ratio within the range of a so-called "window" of the downstream catalyst. This "window" is an air-fuel ratio range in which unburned substances (HC, CO) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) can be removed simultaneously at respective high removal ratios (or high conversion ratios, high purifying efficiency) equal to or greater than a predetermined ratio. Therefore, according to the above-described control apparatus, unburned substances and nitrogen oxides discharged from the engine in an ordinary state are removed by means of the near stoichiometric air-fuel ratio control and the downstream catalyst (and, by means of the upstream catalyst, when provided).</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The first air-fuel ratio is desirably an air-fuel ratio which falls within the predetermined air-fuel ratio range and is slightly shifted toward the rich<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> side from the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, because of the following reason. Whereas the "unburned substance removal ratio" of the three-way catalyst drops relatively gently even when the air-fuel ratio of the engine shifts slightly toward the rich side from the window range, the "nitrogen oxide removal ratio" of the three-way catalyst drops sharply when the air-fuel ratio of the engine shifts slightly toward the lean side from the window range.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As described above, oxygen must be supplied to the particulate collection filter in order to burn particulates collected by the particulate collection filter. In order to supply oxygen to the particulate collection filter, the engine must be operated to discharge excessive oxygen by means of setting the averaged air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine to an air-fuel ratio (the second air-fuel ratio) shifted toward the lean side from the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. However, when the averaged air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine is an air-fuel ratio shifted toward the lean side from the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, a large amount of nitrogen oxides are discharged from the engine.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In view of the above, the control apparatus of the present invention determines whether or not the downstream catalyst has reached the "reduced state in which the downstream catalyst can remove the predetermined amount of nitrogen oxides." When the downstream catalyst is determined to have reached the "reduced state," the control apparatus controls the averaged air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine to an air-fuel ratio (the second air-fuel ratio) which is on the lean side in relation to (or compared to) the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. As a result, oxygen is supplied to the particulate collection filter, whereby particulates collected by the particulate collection filter burn, and thus, the particulate<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> collection filter is regenerated. Moreover, nitrogen oxides discharged from the engine are removed (reduced) by the "downstream catalyst in the reduced state." Accordingly, the control apparatus of the present invention can regenerate the particulate collection filter, without increasing the discharge amount of nitrogen oxides.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Further, in the case where the control apparatus includes a downstream air-fuel ratio sensor which is disposed in the exhaust passage to be located between the particulate collection filter and the downstream catalyst and which outputs an output value corresponding to an air-fuel ratio of a gas flowing through a region where the sensor is disposed, the air-fuel-ratio control means may be configured as follows.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">That is, the air-fuel-ratio control means is configured to execute sub feedback control in order to execute the near stoichiometric air-fuel ratio control, in such a manner that, when the output value output from the downstream air-fuel ratio sensor is a value corresponding to a lean-side air-fuel ratio in relation to (or compared to) a downstream target air-fuel ratio set as the first air-fuel ratio, the air-fuel-ratio control means changes the air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine to a further rich-side air-fuel ratio; and, when the output value output from the downstream air-fuel ratio sensor is a value corresponding to a rich-side air-fuel ratio in relation to (or compared to) the downstream target air-fuel ratio, the air-fuel-ratio control means changes the air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine to a further lean-side air-fuel ratio.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The expression of "changes the air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine to a further rich-side air-fuel ratio" means to change the air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine to an air-fuel<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> ratio which is shifted toward the rich side from the air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture supplied to the engine at that point in time. That is, the expression means to shift the air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine toward richer side. The expression of "changes the air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine to a further lean-side air-fuel ratio" means to change the air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine to an air-fuel ratio which is shifted toward the lean side from the air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture supplied to the engine at that point in time. That is, the expression means to shift the air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine toward leaner side.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">By virtue of this configuration, the sub feedback control for realizing the near stoichiometric air-fuel ratio control is executed over a portion or the entirety of a period in which the downstream catalyst is determined to have not yet reached the reduced state. Upon execution of this sub feedback control, the averaged air-fuel ratio of the gas flowing into the downstream catalyst falls within the range of the window of the downstream catalyst more reliably, so that unburned substances and nitrogen oxides are removed efficiently.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Further, the air-fuel-ratio control means is configured to execute lean maintaining control so as to execute (or realize) the filter regeneration control when the downstream catalyst is determined to have reached the reduced state. In the lean maintaining control, even when the output value output from the downstream air-fuel ratio sensor is a value corresponding to a lean-side air-fuel ratio in relation to (or compared to) the downstream target air-fuel ratio, the air-fuel-ratio control means maintains the averaged air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine at the second<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> air-fuel ratio, without changing the air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine to a further rich-side air-fuel ratio.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In this case, the air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine may be always controlled to the second air-fuel ratio, which is shifted toward the lean side from the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. Alternatively, the air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine may be alternately controlled to rich-side and lean-side air-fuel ratios in relation to (or compared to) the second air-fuel ratio such that the average thereof is controlled to the second air-fuel ratio.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">By virtue of this configuration, when the downstream catalyst is determined to have reached the reduced state, the lean maintaining control is executed, whereby oxygen is supplied to the particulate collection filter. As a result, particulates collected by the particulate collection filter burn, and thereby, the particulate collection filter is regenerated. Further, a large amount of nitrogen oxides, which are discharged from the engine as a result of the air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine being maintained at an "air-fuel ratio shifted toward the lean side from the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio", are removed (reduced) by the downstream catalyst having reached the reduced state. Accordingly, the control apparatus of the present invention can regenerate the particulate collection filter, without increasing the discharge amount of nitrogen oxides.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In this case, in order to execute the filter regeneration control, the air-fuel-ratio control means is desirably configured to stop the above-described sub feedback control.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Further, when the control apparatus includes the above-described downstream air-fuel ratio sensor, preferably, the air-fuel-ratio control means<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> is configured to continue the filter regeneration control up to a point in time when the output value output from the downstream air-fuel ratio sensor becomes equal to a value corresponding to a lean-side air-fuel ratio in relation to (or compared to) the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio after the output value has become equal to a value corresponding to the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio after start of the filter regeneration control.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">When the filter regeneration control is started, oxygen is supplied to the particulate collection filter, and particulates start to burn within the particulate collection filter. As a result, the particulates burning within the particulate collection filter consume oxygen, and no oxygen flows out of the particulate collection filter. Therefore, the output value output from the downstream air-fuel ratio sensor becomes equal to a value corresponding to the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. That is, the fact that the output value output from the downstream air-fuel ratio sensor coincides with a value corresponding to the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio after a point in time when the filter regeneration control has been started means that the particulates may be burning (the particulate collection filter may be in the middle of regeneration). When the particulates are burning as mentioned above, oxygen is not supplied to the downstream catalyst, so that the state of the downstream catalyst (the reducing capacity of the downstream catalyst for removing nitrogen oxides) hardly changes. When substantially all the particulates have burned afterward, oxygen supplied to the particulate collection filter is not consumed within the particulate collection filter, and flows out of the particulate collection filter. As a result, the output value output from the downstream air-fuel ratio sensor becomes equal to a value corresponding to a lean-side air-fuel ratio in relation to (or compared to) the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> stoichiometric air-fuel ratio.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In view of the above, the present control apparatus continues the filter regeneration control at least up to a point in time when the output value output from the downstream air-fuel ratio sensor becomes equal to a value corresponding to an air-fuel ratio shifted toward the lean side from the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio by a predetermined amount (that point in time will be referred to as the "lean inversion time") after the output value has become equal to a value corresponding to the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio after start of the filter regeneration control. In other words, the present control apparatus stops the filter regeneration control at a predetermined point in time after that "lean inversion time." By virtue of this configuration, it becomes possible to prevent the filter regeneration control from being stopped even when particulates to be burned remain within the particulate collection filter and the downstream catalyst is still in a state in which it can sufficiently remove nitrogen oxides. Further, it is possible to prevent the filter regeneration control (the lean maintaining control) from being continued unnecessarily, which would otherwise cause nitrogen oxides to flow into the downstream catalyst in an excessive amount or an amount in excess of the nitrogen oxide removal capacity (the reducing capacity) of the downstream catalyst. Accordingly, discharge of a large amount of nitrogen oxides can be avoided.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Incidentally, the reduced-state determination means may be configured to obtain a "first cumulative value" corresponding to a cumulative value of a "reduction component excessive amount" obtained by subtracting, from an "amount of reduction components," which are unburned substances discharged from the engine to the exhaust passage, an "amount of oxidation<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> components" which are discharged from the engine and oxidize the reduction components, and be configured to determine on the basis of the first cumulative value whether or not the downstream catalyst has reached the reduced state.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The amount of oxygen stored in the downstream catalyst (hereinafter referred to as the "oxygen storage amount of the downstream catalyst") decreases as reduction components (components which take oxygen from oxidation components) flow into the downstream catalyst in an excessive amount as compared with the oxidation components (components capable of supplying oxygen to the reduction components which are unburned substances). As the oxygen storage amount of the downstream catalyst decreases, the downstream catalyst can store more oxygen, and thus, can reduce (remove) a larger amount of nitrogen oxides. Therefore, the determination as to whether or not the downstream catalyst has reached the reduced state can be readily made by obtaining the "first cumulative value" corresponding to the "cumulative value of the reduction component excessive amount" and by determining the state of the downstream catalyst on the basis of the first cumulative value as described above.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In the case where the control apparatus of the present invention comprises fuel cut means for stopping supply of fuel to the engine when the engine enters a predetermined fuel-cut operating state, preferably, the reduced-state determination means is configured to obtain the first cumulative value whose cumulative calculation is started at "predetermined first accumulation start time" after a "fuel-cut end time" at which the stoppage of supply of fuel to the engine by the fuel cut means is canceled and the supply of fuel to the engine is resumed, determine whether or not<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> the first cumulative value has become equal to or greater than a first predetermined value, and determine that the downstream catalyst has reached the reduced state when the first cumulative value is determined to have become equal to or greater than the first predetermined value.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">When the engine enters a fuel-cut operating state, in which the supply of fuel to the engine is stopped, a large amount of oxygen is discharged from the engine. As a result, in general, the oxygen storage amount of the downstream catalyst reaches the maximum oxygen storage amount (or an amount near the maximum oxygen storage amount). Therefore, the "first cumulative value" having been being calculated from the "predetermined first accumulation start time" after a point in time when the fuel cut state ends (i.e., after the fuel-cut end time) becomes a value corresponding to a decrease amount of the oxygen storage amount of the downstream catalyst. Therefore, the determination as to whether or not the downstream catalyst has reached the reduced state can be readily made by determining whether or not the first cumulative value obtained in the above-described manner has become equal to or greater than the first predetermined value. It should be noted that, in the case where the engine includes the above-described upstream catalyst, the first cumulative value becomes a value corresponding to a decrease amount of the oxygen storage amount from the sum of the oxygen storage amount of the upstream catalyst and the oxygen storage amount of the downstream catalyst. In this case, the oxygen storage amount of the upstream catalyst first reaches "0" and the oxygen storage amount of the downstream catalyst then starts to decrease.

Accordingly, the main feedback correction value KFmain and the sub feedback correction value Fisub do not correct variations of the air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine, in a manner in which correction inference occurs.<br/>
In addition, the main feedback control suppresses an abrupt change of air-fuel ratio in a transitional operating state, and the sub feedback control eliminates a "slow deviation of air-fuel ratio which appears as a variation of air-fuel ratio at the downstream side of the upstream catalyst 53."<br/>
Moreover, the sub feedback control can prevent the "averaged air-fuel ratio of the gas mixture to be supplied to the engine" from deviating from the window W, the deviation being caused due to a detection error associated with the averaged air-fuel ratio, which is caused by "the shift of the characteristics of the upstream air-fuel ratio sensor 66," "the position where the upstream air-fuel ratio sensor 66 is disposed," etc..</p><heading id="h0020">&lt;Calculation of base correction value&gt;</heading><p id="p0171" num="0171">As described above, the PID controller A9 calculates the sub feedback correction value Fisub by performing proportional plus integral plus derivative processing (PID processing) on the low-pass-filter passed output deviation DVoxslow.

Accordingly, in the case where a steady-state error caused by the detection accuracy of the air flow meter and the estimation accuracy of the air-amount estimation model increases relatively sharply due to, for example, an abrupt<!-- EPO <DP n="73"> --> change of the operating region, excessiveness or insufficiency of the fuel injection amount caused by the steady-state error cannot be compensated immediately by the sub feedback control only.</p><p id="p0172" num="0172">Meanwhile, in the main feedback control which is not influenced by the delay due to the oxygen storage function, the high-pass filter processing by the high-pass filter A14 substantially achieves a function equivalent to derivative processing (D processing).

Therefore, the main feedback control cannot compensate the steady-state error of the fuel injection amount due to the detection inaccuracy of the air flow meter and the estimation inaccuracy of the air-amount estimation model.

Therefore, excessive reduction components discharged from the engine 10 after the fuel cut end time are first oxidized (consumed) by the upstream catalyst 53.

As a result, during the filter regeneration control, it becomes possible to prevent nitrogen oxides from flowing into the downstream catalyst 55 in an amount exceeding the nitrogen oxide removal capacity of the downstream catalyst 55.

It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments, and various modifications can be employed within the scope of the present invention. For example, in the above-described embodiments, the filter regeneration control is started when the first cumulative value tGaSR becomes greater than the first predetermined value (first threshold) Rth. However, the above-described embodiments may be modified such that the filter regeneration control is executed when the first cumulative value tGaSR is greater than the first predetermined value (first threshold) Rth, and a cumulative value of the intake air amount having been calculated since the end of the previous (last) filter regeneration control is equal to or greater than a predetermined value<!-- EPO <DP n="142"> --> or a cumulative value of operation time of the engine 10 having been calculated since the end of the previous (last) filter regeneration control is equal to or greater than a predetermined value.</p><p id="p0353" num="0353">Further, the sub feedback control may be such that the air-fuel ratio detected by the upstream air-fuel ratio sensor 66 is outwardly corrected such that the output value Voxs of the downstream air-fuel ratio sensor 67 coincides with the downstream target value as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (<i>kokai</i>) No. <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP2007278186A"><text>JP 2007-278186 A</text></patcit>.
