Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The present invention relates to a stereolithography apparatus and, more specifically, relates to a stereolithography apparatus capable of improving the lamination precision and forming a highly precise three-dimensional model when stereolithography is performed by a constrained surface method.</p><heading id="h0004">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the related art, stereolithography methods include a free surface method in which photocurable resin is irradiated with light from above and the resin is cured at the liquid surface, and a constrained surface method in which photocurable resin in a transparent container is irradiated with light from the bottom and the resin is cured at the bottom surface of the container (for example, refer<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2001328175A"><text>2001-328175</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, with a stereolithography apparatus configured to carry out fabrication by the free surface method, the fluid surface of photocurable resin 12 in a container 11 is exposed to the atmosphere. Here, the fluid surface of the photocurable resin refers to the interface of the photocurable resin to be irradiated with light.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">With such a stereolithography apparatus, a stage 13, which is a platform for a three-dimensional model 14 to be fabricated, is lowered by a distance equal to the thickness of one cured layer from the fluid surface of the photocurable resin 12 so as to focus a fabrication laser beam at the interface of the atmosphere and the photocurable resin 12. In this way, a cured layer is formed at the fluid surface of the photocurable resin 12. By repeating this process, a plurality of cured layers is stacked to form the three-dimensional model 14.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, with the free surface method, since the fluid surface of the photocurable resin 12 is exposed to the atmosphere, the surface precision of the cured layer is determined by surface tension and other factors. Thus, there is a limit to the lamination precision of the cured layers. Therefore, it is difficult to fabricate the three-dimensional model 14 with high precision.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, with the stereolithography apparatus configured to carry out fabrication by the constrained surface method, the fluid surface of the photocurable resin 12 contained in a container 21 is not exposed to the atmosphere and is constrained by a glass plate 23, which is provided at the bottom surface of the container 21. With this stereolithography apparatus, a stage 22, which is a platform for the three-dimensional model 14 to be fabricated, is lifted by a distance equal to the thickness of one cured layer from the fluid surface of the photocurable resin 12 so as to focus a fabrication laser beam at the interface of the glass plate 23 and the photocurable resin 12.

For example, in order to focus the fabrication laser beam to approximately 1 µm, the thickness of the glass plate 23 should be approximately 1.2 mm.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">However, if the thickness of the glass plate 23 is reduced in this way, warpage occurs in the glass plate 23, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 3</figref>. For example, when the glass plate 23 is constructed of silica glass having a diameter of 20 cm and a thickness of approximately 1.2 mm, the warpage is about 10 µm.

The objective lens 31A is covered with the position constraining mechanism 32. The surface in contact with the bottom surface of the glass window 36 of the position constraining mechanism 32 has a rectangular opening of a predetermined size (hereinafter referred to as a "small exposure area"). The UV light that has passed through the objective lens 31A passes through this opening to the glass window 36 to expose an area on the fluid surface of the UV-curable resin 37 having a shape corresponding to the sectional data is exposed in units of the small exposure area.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The position constraining mechanism 32 is moved in the Z direction, which is a direction orthogonal to the fluid surface of the UV-curable resin 37, by the driving unit 34.
