load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a friction clutch and a vehicle having the same.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally, a vehicle which has a friction clutch for engaging/disengaging transmission of engine drive force and a clutch operator for operating a friction clutch has been well known. As an example of a clutch operator, there is a clutch lever of a motorcycle.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Generally, as the size of a vehicle is larger, the capacity of a friction clutch is larger, and force necessary for disengaging a friction clutch is also larger. This increases a burden of a clutch operation. In order to reduce a burden of a clutch operation, a technique for attaching a so-called power-assisting device to a friction clutch is suggested as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP52004955A"><text>52-004955</text></patcit> or Japanese Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP3381442B"><text>3381442</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A friction clutch having a power-assisting device disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP52004955A"><text>52-004955</text></patcit> includes a drive force transmission side rotator having a drive force transmission side friction member, a driven force transmission side rotator having a driven force transmission side friction member, and a pressure contact member for receiving urging force of a pressure contact spring to press the drive force transmission side friction member and the driven force transmission side friction member into contact each other. As a power-assisting device, the friction clutch includes an operating side rotator which rotates integrally with the driven force transmission side rotator, an operated side rotator opposite to the operating side rotator through a friction member, and a ball cam for moving a pressure contact member in a direction which separates the drive force transmission side friction member and the driven force transmission side friction member from each other when the operated side rotator receives torque.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">This friction clutch, when disengaged, presses the operating side rotator against the operated side rotator through the friction member, transmitting torque to the operated side rotator from the operating side rotator. A ball cam moves the pressure contact member in a direction which separates the drive force transmission side friction member and the driven force transmission side friction member from each other. As a result, the friction clutch uses part of torque of the driven drive force transmission side rotator as force which separates the drive force transmission side friction member and the driven force transmission side friction member from each other. Therefore, force necessary for separating the drive force transmission side friction member and the driven force transmission side friction member from each other, that is, force necessary for disengaging a clutch, can be decreased.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, the friction clutch has a problem in that a shift-shock is large when a clutch is engaged in an idling state like shifting gears from a neutral to a first gear. That is, since the friction clutch has a power-assisting device, force necessary for disengaging a clutch decreases, but when a clutch is engaged, since the drive force transmission side friction member and the driven force transmission side friction member which are rotating are pressed into contact with each other by the large capacity of the pressing contact spring, a relatively large shock occurs in engaging a clutch. Therefore, there is a problem that a riding feeling deteriorates. The present invention is devised in consideration of the above problems.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Documents <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6957730B"><text>US 6,957,730</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US20040238315A"><text>US 2004/0238315</text></patcit> disclose centrifugal friction clutches according to the preamble of claim 1.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is an objective of the present invention to provide a friction clutch which can reduce not only an operational burden necessary for disengaging a clutch, but also a shock occurring when the clutch is engaged in an idling state.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the present invention, said objective is solved by a friction clutch, comprising: a drive side rotator having at least one first plate; a driven side rotator having at least one second plate opposite to the first plate in a predetermined direction; a pressure plate configured to rotate together with the drive side rotator and to move in the predetermined direction to contact the first plate and the second plate with each other; a power-assisting mechanism configured to receive a torque of the pressure plate when<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the friction clutch is disengaged, and to convert the torque into a force for moving the pressure plate to separate the first plate and the second plate from each other; and a centrifugal weight configured to move outward in radial direction of the pressure plate by a movement amount corresponding to a centrifugal force acting on the centrifugal weight and to press the pressure plate in a direction for contacting the first plate and the second plate by a force corresponding to the movement amount.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Since the friction clutch has the power-assisting mechanism, force necessary for disengaging the clutch can be reduced. Further, according to the friction clutch, when rotating at a high speed, a centrifugal weight greatly moves outward in a radial direction to press the pressure plate with relatively large force. As a result, the first plate and second plate contact each other with relatively large force, so that relatively large friction force occurs therebetween. Therefore, the first plate and the second plate can be prevented from slipping, and consequently relative large torque can be effectively transmitted to the driven side rotator from the drive side rotator. Meanwhile, when rotating at a low speed, the centrifugal weight is located in a relatively inner position of a radial direction, and therefore, force with which the centrifugal weight presses the pressure plate is relatively small. Therefore, a shock occurring when the clutch is engaged in an idling state can be decreased.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As described above, a friction clutch which decreases not only an operational burden necessary for disengaging a clutch and but also a shock occurring when a clutch is engaged in an idling state can be achieved.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Preferably, the pressure plate is supported or connected to the drive side rotator to rotate according to the drive side rotator.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Further, preferably a cam face is formed on the pressure plate on an opposite surface facing away from the first plate and the second plate, the cam face being configured to guide the centrifugal weight in a direction to draw apart the first plate and the second plate from each other as the centrifugal weight moves outward in radial direction of the pressure plate.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Still further, preferably the centrifugal weight is located between an abutment member and the pressure plate, said abutment member being configured to apply a repulsive force to the centrifugal weight toward the cam face when the centrifugal weight abuts.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to a preferred embodiment, the friction clutch comprises a sub clutch including: a friction plate configured to rotate together with the pressure plate and having a first friction surface provided on one side of the predetermined direction and a second friction surface provided on the other side, and, preferably, a pressing member configured to come into

torque transmission member which is opposite to the second friction surface of the friction plate and which is configured to be pressed into contact with the friction plate pressed by the pressing member to receive torque of the pressure plate and to transmit the torque to the power-assisting mechanism when the friction clutch is disengaged.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Preferably, the drive side rotator is a clutch housing formed in a substantially cylindrical shape, and the driven side rotator is a clutch boss disposed at an inner side of a radial direction of the clutch housing.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Further, preferably the abutment member is supported in the clutch housing, and/or the sub clutch is disposed between the clutch boss and the abutment member with regard to the predetermined direction.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to another preferred embodiment, a rotation shaft is supported or connected to the driven side rotator to rotate according to the driven side rotator, wherein a hole extends in axial direction of the rotation shaft, and, preferably, an operating shaft is at least partially inserted into the hole of the rotation shaft to push the pressing member from one side of the predetermined direction to the other side when the friction clutch is disengaged.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Preferably, an oil supply path configured to supply oil to the sub clutch is formed inside the operating shaft.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Further, preferably a slide shaft is provided at the other side of the operating shaft and is configured to rotate according to the torque transmission member to transmit torque of the pressure plate to the power-assisting mechanism, and/or a clutch release mechanism is configured to operate the operating shaft to move the pressing member from one side of the predetermined direction to the other side.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Preferably, the torque transmission member includes an outer rod having a hole passing through in axial direction thereof and being configured to rotate in circumferential direction of an axis to transmit torque of the pressure plate to the power-assisting mechanism, and, preferably an inner rod is received by the hole of the outer rod to freely move relative to the outer rod in axial direction and to press the pressing member to the friction plate, and, preferably, a clutch release mechanism is at least partially disposed at the other side of the power-assisting mechanism and is configured to pull the inner rod in axial direction

Either or both of the transmission gear 34 of the multi-stage transmission gear 34 excluding the selected transmission gear 34 and the transmission gear 35 of a plurality of transmission gears 35 excluding the selected transmission gear 35 are rotatable with respect to the main shaft 33 or the drive shaft 23. That is, at least one of the non-selected transmission gear 34 and the non-selected transmission gear 35 runs idle with respect to the main shaft or the drive shaft 23.

In detail, the transmission gears 34 and 35 are selected by a shift cam 37 of the gear selection mechanism 36. A plurality of cam grooves 37a are formed on an outer circumferential surface of the shift cam 37. A shift fork 38 is mounted on each cam groove 37a. The shift forks 38 are engaged with predetermined transmission gears 34 and 35 of the main shaft 33 and the drive shaft 23, respectively. As the shift cam 37 rotates, a plurality of shift forks 38 are guided into the cam grooves 37a respectively to move in an axial direction of the main shaft 33, so that gears which are engaged with each other are selected from the transmission gears 34 and 35. In detail, among the multi-stage transmission gear 34 and the plurality of transmission gears 35, only one pair of gears located corresponding to a rotation angle of the shift cam 37 are fixed with respect to the main shaft 38 and the drive shaft 23 by a spline. As a result, a location of the transmission gear is determined, and a rotation between the main shaft 33 and the drive shaft 23 is transmitted at a predetermined transmission gear ratio through the transmission gears 34 and 35.

The two plates 51 and 52 are fixed to each other by a fixture such as a rivet or a screw with respect to an axial<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> direction of the main shaft 33.

Therefore, a distance between each of the scissors gear 45, the needle bearing 53 and the spacer 54 and the clutch boss 48 is restricted by the slide bearing 63 not to be within a predetermined distance.

As the pressure plate 77 moves to the left, the pressing portion 77b presses the plate group 66 to the left.

The roller retainer 78 is formed in a shape of orbicular zone viewed in the axial direction of the main shaft 33. The roller retainer 78 is opposite to the cam face 81 of the pressure plate 77.

The roller weight 41 pivots as the clutch housing 46 rotates, and moves on the cam face 81 outward in a radial direction by centrifugal force generated when it pivots. When the centrifugal force is equal to or more than a predetermined value, the roller weight 41 receives repulsive force from the abutment member 70 to press the pressure plate 77 toward the plate group 66.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In a case where a rotation speed of the crankshaft 32 is lower than a predetermined value, such as an idling state, a rotation speed of the clutch housing 46 also becomes lower. Therefore, centrifugal force applied to the roller weight 41 is relatively small, and<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> so the roller weight 41 is located in the relatively inside portion. Therefore, force which the roller weight 41 presses the pressure plate 77 to the left becomes substantially zero. As a result, the plate group 66 enters a substantially non-contact state where it is not pressed from the pressure plate 77. Therefore, rotation of the clutch housing 46 is not transmitted to the clutch boss 48. That is, the clutch 2 enters a disengaged state.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Meanwhile, as a rotation speed of the crankshaft 32 becomes relatively higher, a rotation speed of the clutch housing 46 also becomes relatively higher. Therefore, as a rotation speed of the clutch housing 46 increases, centrifugal force applied to the roller weight 41 increases. If centrifugal force applied to the roller weight 41 is equal to or more than a predetermined value, the roller weight 41 moves outward. The pressure plate 77 is thereby pressed toward the left side by the roller weight 41 and thus moves toward the plate group 66. As a result, the plate group 66 is pressed into contact with each other, and the clutch 2 enters an engaged state.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">When the plate group 66 is pressed into contact with each other and the clutch 2 is engaged as described above, rotation of the clutch housing 46 is transmitted to the clutch boss 48 through the clutch group 66.

Therefore, the roller weight 41 moves inward in a radial direction. As a result, force that the pressure plate 77 presses the plate group 66 becomes substantially zero, whereby the clutch 2 is disengaged.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">As described above, in the motorcycle 1, the centrifugal clutch 2 is provided.

The second pressing plate 103 has a boss 103a which extends in a right direction. The boss 103a rotatably supports the pressure plate 77 through a bearing 104.

The ball 43c and the short push rod 43a also move to the right, and the first pressing plate 102 of the sub clutch 100 moves to the right. The friction plate 101 of the sub clutch 100 is thereby fitted between the first pressing plate 102 and the second pressing plate 103, so that the sub clutch 100 enters an engaged state. As a result, the slide shaft 201 of the power-assisting mechanism 200 rotates together with the pressure plate 77 in a predetermined direction.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">If the slide shaft 201 rotates in a predetermined direction, the second cam plate 203 of the power-assisting mechanism 200 rotates in the same direction. The ball 204a of the ball plate 204 moves up from between the first cam face 202a and the second cam face 203a, and the second cam plate 203 is pressed to the right by the ball 204a. Therefore, the slide shaft 201 is also pressed to the right. As a result, the pressure plate 77 moves to the right due to force that the short push rod 43a pushes the pressure plate 77 to the right through the first pressing plate 102 and the friction plate 101 and force that the slide shaft 201 pulls the pressure plate 77 to the right through the second pressing plate 103 and the bearing 104.

Then, the ball 43c and the short push rod 43a also move to the left, and the first pressing plate 102 of the sub clutch 100 moves to the left. The first pressing plate 102 of the sub clutch 100 is thereby separated from the friction plate 101. In addition, the second pressing plate 103 becomes hard to be pushed to the right by the first pressing plate 102. Therefore, rightward pressing force with respect to the slide shaft 201 disappears, and the second cam plate 203 which receives urging force of the coil spring 205 rotates in a reverse direction, so that the second cam plate 203 and the slide shaft 201 move to the left.

In detail, if a rotation speed of the pressure plate 77 is high, the roller weight 41 moves outward in a radial direction. As a result, the roller weight 41 moves to the right to greatly transform the disc spring 83. Therefore, urging force which the pressure plate 77 receives from the disc spring 83 relatively increases because the disc spring 83 is greatly transformed by the roller weight 41 without increasing an elastic coefficient of the disc spring 83 itself. Meanwhile, if a rotation speed of the pressure plate 77 is low, the roller weight 41 moves inward in a radial direction. As a result, the roller weight 41 moves to the left, the transformation of the disc spring 83 decreases.

Therefore, sufficient pressing force can be obtained without increasing an elastic coefficient of the disc spring 83 is not greatly increased. Therefore, the elastic coefficient of the disc spring 83, that is, the spring capacity, can be suppressed relatively small.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">However, when rotating at a low speed such as an idling state, the roller weight 41 moves inward in a radial direction, and so it enters a state which the pressure plate 77 does not press the plate group 66 into contact with each other. That is, it enters a disengaged state. If an engine speed increases in an idling state, the roller weight 41 moves outward in a radial direction, and so it enters a state which the pressure plate 77 presses the plate group 66 into contact with each other. That is, it enters an engaged state. However, in the clutch 2 according to the first embodiment, since the elastic coefficient of the disc spring 83 is relatively small, an engine speed is not very high at the moment when the clutch is engaged and the transformation of the disc spring 83 is relatively small, force that the pressure plate 77 presses the plate group 66 into contact with each other is also relatively small. Therefore, the plate group 66 is not abruptly pressed into contact with each other, and the clutch 2 is smoothly engaged.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">As described above, according to the first embodiment, the clutch 2 includes a power-assisting mechanism 200 and so can reduce force necessary for disengaging the clutch 2. The clutch 2 also includes a roller weight 41 which moves outward in a radial direction by the movement amount according to the magnitude of centrifugal force and presses the pressure plate 77 toward the plate group 66 with force according to the movement amount. Therefore, if an engine speed is high, the roller weight 41 moves outward in a radial direction, so that force that the pressure plate 77 presses the plate group 66 into contact with each other can be made relatively large. Therefore, even though an engine speed is high, slipping in the plate group 66 can be prevented, and power transmission efficiency of the clutch 2 can be improved. Meanwhile, if an engine speed is low, the roller weight 41 moves inward in a radial direction, so that force that the pressure plate<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> 77 presses the plate group 66 into contact with each other can be kept relatively small. Therefore, a shock occurring when the clutch 2 is engaged in an idling state can be reduced.

The clutch 2 includes an abutment member 70 which is disposed at a location opposite to the cam face 81 of the pressure plate 77 through the roller weight 41. The abutment member 70 applies repulsive force which goes to the cam face 81 to the roller weight 41 when the roller weight 41 abuts on it.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">The pressure plate 77 has a function which presses the plate group 66 into contact with each other and a function which supports and guides the roller weight 41.

However, a multi-plate type clutch is typically larger in clutch capacity than a single-plate type clutch. In other words, drive force transmitted through the clutch is larger.

As the pinion wheel 42 rotates in a predetermined direction, the inner rod 44b rotates a circumferential direction of an axis in a predetermined direction while moving it to the right. Then, the stopper 116 and the bearing 115 contact each other, and the inner rod 44b, the stopper 116 and the bearing 115 move to the right in an axial direction.

The friction plate 121 and the first pressing plate 122 of the sub clutch 120 are thereby separated from the second pressing plate 123.

At this time, the friction plate 121 of the sub clutch 120 is separated from the second pressing plate 123.</p><p id="p0149" num="0149">In the clutch 2 according to the second embodiment, urging force which the pressure plate 77 receives from the disc spring 83, the elastic member 300 and the off-spring 401 changes depending on a position in a radial direction of the roller weight 41. In detail, if a rotation speed of the pressure plate 77 is high, the roller weight 41 moves outward in a radial direction. As a result, the roller weight 41 moves to the right to greatly transform the disc spring 83, the elastic member 300 an the off-spring 401. Therefore, urging force which the pressure plate 77 receives from the disc spring 83 relatively increases because the disc spring 83 is greatly transformed by the roller weight 41 without increasing an elastic coefficient of the disc spring 83 itself. In addition, so urging force which the pressure plate 77 receives from the spring 302 relatively increases because the spring 302 is greatly transformed by the roller weight 41 without increasing an elastic coefficient of the spring 302 of the elastic member 300. In addition, urging force which the pressure plate 77 receives from the off-spring 401 is relatively greater because the off-spring 401 is greatly transformed by the roller weight 41 without increasing an elastic coefficient of the off-spring 401. Meanwhile, if a rotation speed of the pressure plate 77 is low, the roller weight 41 moves inward in a radial direction. As a result, the roller weight 41 moves to the left, and the transformation of the disc spring 83, the elastic member 300 and the off-spring 401 decreases. Therefore, urging force which the pressure plate 77 receives from the disc spring 83, the elastic member 300 and the off-spring 401 relatively decreases.</p><p id="p0150" num="0150">If an engine speed is high, the plate group 66 needs to be pressed into contact with each other with large pressing force by the pressure plate 77. In the clutch 2 according to the second embodiment, as an engine speed increases, the roller weight 41 moves outward in a radial direction, and the transformation of the disc spring 83 and the elastic member 300 thereby increases. Therefore, sufficient pressing force can be obtained without<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> increasing an elastic coefficient of the disc spring 83 and the elastic member 300. Therefore, the elastic coefficient of the disc spring 83 and the elastic member 300, that is, the spring capacity, can be kept relatively small.</p><p id="p0151" num="0151">However, at a low speed such as an idling state, the roller weight 41 moves inward in a radial direction, and the pressure plate 77 enters a state of pressing the plate group 66 into contact with each other. That is, it enters a disengaged state. If an engine speed increases in an idling state, the roller weight 41 moves outward in a radial direction, and so it becomes a state which the pressure plate 77 presses the plate group 66 into contact with each other. That is, it enters an engaged state. However, in the clutch 2 according to the second embodiment, the elastic coefficient of the disc spring 83 and the elastic member 300 is relatively small. In addition, an engine speed is not very high at the engaged moment and the transformation of the disc spring 83 and the elastic member 300 is relatively small, and therefore, force that the pressure plate 77 presses the plate group 66 into contact with each other is relatively small. In addition, the off-spring 401 urges the pressure plate 77 in a reverse direction of a direction that the pressure plate 77 presses the plate group 66 into contact with each other. That is, the off-spring 401 urges the pressure plate 77 in an opposite direction to a direction that the disc spring 83 and the elastic member 300 urge the pressure plate 77.

In addition, the elastic member 300 presses the pressure plate 77 toward the plate group 66 through the elastic member retainer 79 and the roller weight 41. Therefore, the pressure plate 77 can press the plate group 66 into contact with each other by using centrifugal force of the roller weight 41. Meanwhile, adjusting urging force of the disc spring 83, the elastic member 300 and the off-spring 401 adjusts force that the pressure plate 77 presses the plate group 66 into contact with each other.
