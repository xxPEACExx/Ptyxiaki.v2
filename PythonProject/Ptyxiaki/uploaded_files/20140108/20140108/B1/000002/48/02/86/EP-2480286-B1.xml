The high intensity focused ultrasound can be used for heating a region within the subject, it can be used for rupturing tiny capsules of a drug and activating the drug, it can be used for ablating tissue, and at higher powers cavitation can be used to destroy regions within the subject. High intensity focused ultrasound is focused onto a region of the subject using a transducer. Very often the transducers have multiple elements and by controlling the phase and amplitude of the individual elements the focus of the ultrasound within the subject can be adjusted to a certain degree. In addition to controlling the phase and amplitude of ultrasound emitted by elements of the ultrasound transducer, very typically the transducer is physically moved. For treatment of the breast, typically three degrees of freedom are used for mechanically moving the high intensity focused ultrasound transducer. In other modes of treatment therapy, such as for treating fibroids, five degrees of freedom are used.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">When a region of a subject is sonicated, detailed information about the anatomy or internal structure of the subject is beneficial. As a result sonication of the subject is typically guided using a medical imaging modality. An example of such a medical imaging modality is magnetic resonance imaging.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">International Patent application publication <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2008026134A1"><text>WO 2008/026134 A1</text></patcit> discloses a manipulator for controlling the position of an energy radiator.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The invention provides for a high intensity focused ultrasound positioning mechanism, a high intensity focused ultrasound unit, a magnetic resonance imaging system, a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> method of actuating a high intensity focused ultrasound positioning mechanism, and a computer program product in the independent claims. Embodiments are given in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">When using magnetic resonance imaging for guiding high intensity focused ultrasound, there are special requirements that are placed on the mechanism which is used for actuating or moving the high intensity focused ultrasound transducer. For instance all the parts may be non magnetic materials and may be able to tolerate the ultrasound conducting medium which the high intensity focused ultrasound transducer is immersed in, the construction of the mechanism is placed into a watertight container so the mechanism may also be watertight, the space available for the mechanism is extremely limited, because the bore or the region of the magnet for magnetic resonance imaging needs to accommodate both the patient, the mechanism and the high intensity focused ultrasound unit. Using a larger mechanism requires the use of a magnet with a larger bore and therefore increases the cost of the combined magnetic resonance imaging and high intensity focused ultrasound unit. Conversely, if the mechanism is made smaller and more compact, then the required bore or region adapted for accommodating a subject within the magnetic resonance imaging magnet is reduced. In addition it is also beneficial if motors and sensors which are incorporated into the mechanism do not generate radio frequency noise.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The invention provides for a high intensity focused ultrasound positioning mechanism for positioning a high intensity focused ultrasound transducer. The mechanism comprises a positioning plate adapted for receiving the high intensity focused ultrasound transducer. The physical location or position of the positioning plate is adjusted or manipulated by actuating the positioning mechanism. As a high intensity focused ultrasound transducer may be mounted to the positioning plate, adjusting the position or location of the positioning plate adjusts the position or location or orientation of the high intensity focused ultrasound transducer. The mechanism further comprises a mechanism support adapted for mounting the positioning mechanism. The mechanism further comprises six rods. Each rod has a first end and a second end, wherein the first end of each rod forms a separate ball joint with the positioning plate.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A rod as used herein is understood to be a rigid body. A rod functions or is equivalent to a link in a linkage or mechanical linkage. The mechanism further comprises a at least three linear drives. The at least three linear drives is mounted to the mechanism support. Each of the linear drives comprises a drive block. The second end of each of the six rods forms a separate ball joint with one of the drive blocks. A mechanism which embodies this<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> has several advantages. A very compact mechanism can be constructed. The number of sliding parts can also be reduced. In addition an embodiment of such a mechanism allows the calculation of how the mechanism may be positioned to put the positioning plate in a particular position or place. This allows precise control and positioning of a high intensity focused ultrasound transducer.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A linear drive as used herein is an actuating mechanism or component which is adapted for moving in a linear or a straight direction. A linear drive may be constructed using a screw mechanism, a rod that is actuated, a hydraulic system, a linear motor, or a pneumatic system. A drive block as used herein is a block or a component to which a ball joint or a component of a ball joint may be mounted. A ball joint as used herein is a joint which provides a spherical degree of movement. A ball joint may use a ball and a socket or it may use a system of swiveling hinges. A ball joint may be constructed using a ball and a socket. A ball joint may be formed by placing either a socket or a ball at either of the first or second ends of one of the six rods. If a ball is on a particular end of one of the six rods, then a socket is mounted onto the piece with which the rod forms a ball joint. If a socket is located on the rod, then a ball which is adapted to be received by the socket is mounted on the plate or block to which the rod forms a ball joint. The positioning block may be a separate component or an ultrasonic transducer for a high intensity focused ultrasound system may function as a positioning block.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In another embodiment, the six rods comprises a first rod, a second rod, a third rod, a fourth rod, a fifth rod and a sixth rod. The at least three linear drives comprises a first linear drive, a second linear drive and a third linear drive. The first linear drive comprises a first drive block. The second linear drive comprises a second drive block. The third linear drive comprises a third drive block.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The first end of the first rod forms a first ball joint with the positioning plate. The first end of the second rod forms a second ball joint with the positioning plate. The first end of the third rod forms a third ball joint with the positioning plate. The first end of the fourth rod forms a fourth ball joint with the positioning plate. The first end of the fifth rod forms a fifth ball joint with the positioning plate. The first end of the sixth rod forms a sixth ball joint with the positioning plate.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The first rod forms a seventh ball joint with the first drive block. The second rod forms an eighth ball joint with the first drive block. The third rod forms a ninth ball joint with the second drive block. The fourth rod forms a tenth ball joint with the second drive block. The fifth rod forms an eleventh ball joint with the third drive block. The sixth rod<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> forms an twelfth ball joint with the third drive block. This embodiment is advantageous, because a mechanism that embodies this will have three orthogonal degrees of freedom.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In another embodiment the first and second ball joints are mounted on a first common axis. The second and third ball joints are mounted on a second common axis. The fourth and fifth ball joints are mounted on a third common axis. The seventh and eighth ball joints are mounted on a fourth common axis. The ninth and tenth ball joints are mounted on a fifth common axis. The eleventh and twelfth ball joints are mounted on a sixth common axis. By stating that a ball joint is mounted on a common axis, it is understood that herein this means that the center of rotation for the ball joints which are mounted on a common axis are fixed on this axis.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In another embodiment the six rods comprises a first rod, a second rod, a third rod, a fourth rod, a fifth rod and a sixth rod. The at least three linear drives comprises a first linear drive, a second linear drive, a third linear drive, a fourth linear drive and a fifth linear drive. The first linear drive comprises a first drive block. The second linear drive comprises a second drive block. The third linear drive comprises a third drive block. The fourth linear drive comprises a fourth drive block. The fifth linear drive comprises a fifth drive block.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The first end of the first rod forms a first ball joint with the positioning plate. The first end of the second rod forms a second ball joint with the positioning plate. The first end of the third rod forms a third ball joint with the positioning plate. The first end of the fourth rod forms a fourth ball joint with the positioning plate. The first end of the fifth rod forms a fifth ball joint with the positioning plate. The first end of the sixth rod forms a sixth ball joint with the positioning plate.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The first rod forms a seventh ball joint with the first drive block. The second rod forms an eighth ball joint with the second drive block. The third rod forms a ninth ball joint with the third drive block. The fourth rod forms a tenth ball joint with the third drive block. The fifth rod forms an eleventh ball joint with the fourth drive block. The sixth rod forms a twelfth ball joint with the fifth drive block. This embodiment is advantageous, because the mechanism may be compact and has five degrees of freedom. This allows complex actuation of a high intensity focused ultrasound unit with a mechanism that uses a reduced amount of space.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In another embodiment the second, third, fourth and fifth ball joints are mounted on a first common axis. The ninth and tenth ball joints are mounted on a second common axis. This embodiment is advantageous, because placing these combinations of ball<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> joints on these common axes provides for a mechanism where its position can be calculated more simply.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In another embodiment at least one of the at least three linear drives comprises a linear slide, a screw drive, and a bearing. At least one of the at least three linear drives is actuated by an ultrasound motor. A screw drive as used herein is a drive which translates rotational into translational motion. A screw drive can function with threads or it may also be a ball screw drive or a sliding screw drive. A sliding screw drive uses elements which slide over the threads of a drive rod. A linear side as used herein is a block which is driven in a linear or straight fashion. A linear slide may also function as a drive block. The terms linear slide and drive block may be used as synonyms herein. If a linear slide and a drive block are separate components, a drive block may be attached to the linear slide. The linear slide may be prevented from rotating by a surface or a rod. The friction between the linear slide and the guiding surface or rod may be reduced by the bearing. The at least one of the at least three linear drives is actuated by an ultrasound motor.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In another embodiment at least one of the at least three linear drives is actuated using a hand crank.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In another embodiment the linear slide, the screw drive and the bearing are ceramic. This embodiment is advantageous, because high intensity focused ultrasound units are typically immersed in a liquid for the purpose of conducting ultrasound. A ceramic linear slide, screw drive and bearing would be able to survive in a fluid or liquid environment for an extended period of time.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In another embodiment at least one of the six rods comprises plastic. The use of plastic for the rods is advantageous in several situations. In a magnetic resonance imaging system this is advantageous because the amount of metal which is used is reduced. In addition the rod can be constructed of a single piece with the sockets for the ball joint molded in the ends. This eliminates the need for fixing sockets for the ball joints on the rods.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In another embodiment, at least one of the six rods comprises acetal polyoxynethylene plastic.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In another embodiment at least one of the first through twelve balls comprises a titanium ball. The use of titanium balls is advantageous, because titanium is compatible with large magnetic fields and can thus be used in a magnetic resonance imaging system. In general titanium is a very hard metal and is very suitable for use as a bearing. Titanium is<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In another aspect, the invention provides for a high intensity focused ultrasound unit. The high intensity focused ultrasound unit comprises a mechanism according to an embodiment of the invention. The high intensity focused ultrasound unit further comprises an actuation system for actuating the mechanism. The high intensity focused ultrasound unit further comprises a control system for controlling the actuation system. The high intensity focused ultrasound unit further comprises a high intensity focused ultrasound transducer. The high intensity focused ultrasound unit further comprises a patient support adapted for receiving a subject.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">An actuation system is any system which is adapted for actuating the mechanism. In the case of a screw drive, the actuation system would provide for rotational motion. An ultrasonic or stepping motor would be an example of an embodiment of an actuation system. The mechanism functions using linear motion, so a piston which uses air or pneumatic fluid could also be used for actuating the mechanism. A control system for controlling the actuation system could have several different embodiments. A control system could simply be a system which receives instructions from another controller or computer system and then the control system simply executes these commands and controls the actuation system to properly actuate the mechanism.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The control system could also be more sophisticated, it could include a processor which is capable of performing the calculations necessary to actuate the mechanism along a predetermined path between a first point and a second point. In this case the control system may be a processor which is capable of modeling the motion of the mechanism. An embodiment of this invention of this high intensity focused ultrasound unit is advantageous, because the mechanism may use a reduced amount of space. This provides for a more compact high intensity focused ultrasound unit.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In another aspect, the invention provides for a magnetic resonance imaging system. The magnetic resonance imaging system comprises a high intensity focused ultrasound unit according to an embodiment of the invention. The magnetic resonance imaging system further comprises a magnet for generating a magnetic field for orientating the magnetic spins of nuclei. The magnetic resonance imaging system further comprises a radio frequency system comprising a coil calibrated for acquiring magnetic resonance imaging data. Magnetic resonance imaging data is defined herein as data which is received by the coil and was emitted by the magnetic spins of nuclei. Magnetic resonance imaging data may be reconstructed into magnetic resonance imaging images.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The magnetic resonance imaging system further comprises a magnet field gradient coil for spatial encoding of the orientation of magnetic spins of nuclei. The magnetic resonance imaging system further comprises a magnetic field gradient coil power supply for supplying current to the magnetic field gradient coil. The magnetic resonance imaging system further comprises a computer system for constructing images from the magnetic resonance imaging data and for controlling the operation of the magnetic resonance imaging system. The computer system is adapted for controlling the high intensity focused ultrasound unit. The computer system may actually control the operation of the high intensity focused ultrasound unit, or alternatively it may send commands to the high intensity focused ultrasound unit and a computer system or onboard processing system in the high intensity focused ultrasound unit uses these commands to generate commands which control the production of ultrasound by the ultrasound transducer and also control the actuation of the mechanism.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">A computer system as used herein is defined as a machine adapted for performing machine executable instructions. A computer system may be a single computer, a group of computers, a network of computers, an embedded system, a microcontroller or other system adapted for executing machine executable computer programs.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In another aspect the invention provides for a method of actuating a high intensity focused ultrasound positioning mechanism according to an embodiment of the invention. The method comprises the step of calculating a trajectory of the mechanism from a first position to a second position. The trajectory of the mechanism is a path that the mechanism follows. The trajectory may simply be a path, or it may also be a time dependent path. Part of a treatment plan could be a trajectory that the high intensity focused ultrasound unit follows. The method further comprises generating an actuation plan using the calculated trajectory. The actuation plan is a representation of the actuation of the mechanism which is necessary for following the trajectory. The actuation plan could be a machine readable actuation plan and contain instructions for a controller to send to the actuators to move the mechanism along the trajectory. The actuation plan could also be a set of coordinates that could be used to move the mechanism along the trajectory. In the case of manual actuation these could be a set of dial settings or coordinates that an operator dials on the mechanism. Calculating a trajectory of the mechanism from a first position to a second position it is understood that the trajectory is a predetermined position on the positioning plate. The first position and the second position can also be defined in terms of the geometry of the high intensity focused ultrasound transducer which may be attached to the positioning plate. The<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> method further comprises actuating the mechanism from the first position to the second position using the actuation plan. In an automated system the actuator plan is used by a controller or computer system to control an actuation system. In the case of a manual operator an operator manually actuates the mechanism using a manual system or by using control levers or switches or buttons.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In another aspect the invention provides for a computer program product comprising machine executable instructions for execution by a control system.

This mechanism has three linear drives 146, 148, 150. The mechanism 100 is adapted for moving the positioning plate 108 along three orthogonal axes, the x axis 102, the y axis 104, and the z axis 106. The choice of x, y and z for labeling the axes is an arbitrary choice. In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> a first rod 110, a second rod 112, a third rod 114, a fourth rod 116, a fifth rod 118, and a sixth rod 120 are shown. The first rod 110 forms a first ball joint 122 with the positioning plate 108. The second rod 112 forms a second ball joint 124 with the positioning plate 108. The third rod 114 forms a third ball joint 126 with the positioning plate 108. The fourth rod 116 forms a fourth ball joint 128 with the positioning plate 108. The fifth rod 118 forms a fifth ball joint 130 with the positioning plate 108. The sixth rod 120 forms a sixth ball joint 132 with the positioning plate 108. The first rod 110 forms a seventh ball joint 134 with the first drive block 164. The second rod 112 forms an eighth ball joint 136 with the first drive block 164. The third rod 114 forms a ninth ball joint 138 with the second drive block 166. The fourth rod 116 forms a tenth ball joint 140 with the second drive block 166. The fifth rod 118 forms an eleventh ball joint 142 with the third drive block 168. The sixth rod 120 forms a twelfth ball joint 144 with the third drive block 168.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a first linear drive 146, a second linear drive 148 and a third linear drive 150. Each linear drive comprises rods 156. The rods are used for guiding the drive blocks. The first linear drive 146 comprises the first drive block 164. The second linear drive 148 comprises the second drive block 166. The third linear drive 150 comprises the third drive block 168. The rods 156 prevent the drive blocks from turning or twisting as they<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> are driven by the screw drive rod 158. Also mounted within each of the drive blocks 164, 166, 168 are threaded elements 160. The threaded elements 160 in this embodiment contains threads. In another embodiment a ball screw drive could be used. The screw drive rods 158 are driven by ultrasonic motors 162. The use of ultrasonic motors allows the very precise control of the mechanism. The linear drives 146, 148, 150 are mounted onto the mechanism support 174. In this case the mechanism support is a plate. This plate can be bolted into a high intensity focused ultrasound unit and may form a watertight seal as it is bolted into place. The rods 156 are mounted onto the mechanism support. Opposing the mechanism support is a plate 176 which the rods 156 are also attached to. The combination of the plate 176, the mechanism support 174 and the rods 156 forms a rigid structure for the mechanism. Visible on the positioning plate 108 are threaded holes 178 for mounting an ultrasonic transducer. The first ball joint 122 and the second ball joint 124 are mounted along a first common axis 180. The second 124 and third 126 ball joints are mounted along a second common axis 182. The third ball joint 126 and fourth ball joint 128 are mounted along a third common axis 184. The first 180, second 182 and third 184 axes pass through the positioning plate 108. The seventh ball joint 134 and eighth ball joint 136 form a fourth common axis 186. The fourth common axis passes through the first drive block 164. The ninth ball joint 138 and the tenth ball joint 140 are mounted on a fifth common axis 188. The fifth common axis 188 passes through the second drive block 166. The eleventh ball joint 142 and the twelfth ball joint 144 are mounted along a sixth common axis 190. The sixth common axis 190 passes through the third drive block 168.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In this embodiment the first 146, second 148, and third 150 linear drives are mounted on the mechanism support 174 such that they provide linear motion that is parallel to the y axis. It is not required that all three linear drives are aligned nor is it required that they are along the so called y axis 104. However, it is beneficial because then the positioning plate 108 moves orthogonally to the x 102, y 104, and z 106 axes. In this embodiment the first common axis 180, the third common axis 184, the fourth common axis 186 and the sixth common axis 190 are all parallel with the z axis 106. The second common axis 182 and the fifth common axis 188 are parallel with the x axis 102. Again, it is not necessary that these axes are aligned such, however, the alignment of the axes in this fashion in combination with the alignment of the linear drives 146, 148, 150 with the y axis 104 allows for a simplified calculation of the position of the positioning plate 108 and also ensures that the motion of the positioning plate 108 is orthogonal with the x axis 102, y axis 104 and z axis 106.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In operation the first linear drive 146, second linear drive 148 and third linear drive 150 would typically all be operated at the same time. The reason for this is that when any one ultrasonic motor 162 is activated the positioning block 108 will move in more than one of the orthogonal directions indicated by the x axis 102, y axis 104 or z axis 106. It is therefore beneficial to move all three simultaneously such that the mechanism moves following a predefined path or moving following just one of the axes 102, 104, 106.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2a</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0003">2b</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0004">2c</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">2d</figref> show the same embodiment of a mechanism 200 according to the invention from different views. <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2a</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">2b</figref> show perspective views. <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 2c</figref> shows a top view and <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 2d</figref> shows a side view. In this embodiment there are five linear drives 246, 248, 250, 252, 254. This mechanism 200 has five degrees of freedom. These are illustrated in the Fig. with the x axis 102, the y axis 104, and the z axis 106.

The third rod 214 and the positioning plate 208 form a third ball joint 226. The fourth rod 216 and the positioning plate 208 form a fourth ball joint 228. The fifth rod 218 and the positioning plate 208 form a fifth ball joint 230. The sixth rod 220 and the positioning plate 208 form a sixth ball joint 232. There is a first linear drive 246, a second linear drive 248, a third linear drive 250, a fourth linear drive 252, and a fifth linear drive 254. The first linear drive 246 has a first drive block 264. The second linear drive 248 has a second drive block 266. The third linear drive 250 has a third drive block 268.

The fourth rod 216 and the third drive block 268 form a tenth ball joint 240. The fifth rod 218 and the fourth drive block 270 form an eleventh ball joint 242. The sixth rod 220 and the fifth drive block 272 form a twelfth ball joint 244.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Each of the linear drives 246, 248, 250, 252, 254 have rods 156 which guide the drive blocks 264, 266, 268, 270, 272 and ensure that they move in a linear fashion. Each of the linear drives 246, 248, 250, 252, 254 also have screw drives rods 158, threaded elements 160, and ultrasonic motors 162 as were described in the embodiment in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> also.

The linear drives 246, 248, 250, 252, 254 are secured to a mechanism support 174. The mechanism support 174 and the rods 156 form a stable framework for the mechanism 200. As with the embodiment in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> the linear drives 246, 248, 250, 252, 254 are all aligned with the y axis 104 such that the drive blocks 264, 266, 268, 270, 272 all move parallel with the y axis 104.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The first ball joint 222, the second ball joint 224, the fifth ball joint 230, and the sixth ball joint 232 are all mounted such that they are aligned with a first common axis 280. The first common axis 280 passes through the positioning plate 108. The ninth ball joint 238 and the tenth ball joint 240 are both aligned and mounted on a second common axis 282. The second common axis is with the x axis 102. The linear drives and the second common axis 282 do not need to be aligned in this fashion, but it is advantageous because it allows for a mechanism which it is easier to calculate the actuation of the linear drives such that the positioning plate 108 is moved into a desired position.
