The system, in which that abutment post is used, comprises an implant in a bone and an universal adapter, a stem of which fits inside the implant and is connected thereto by an anchor screw. To extend the restoration of the implant into the oral cavity a tapered gingival collar of varying length is used. The collar has internal openings to receive from the bottom an opposite end of the adapter and from the top the abutment post. The abutment post is fixed to the implant by means of a fixation screw passing through the abutment post and the collar. The abutment post, which is preferably made from a thermoplastic material, can be angulated to compensate for an otherwise angulated implant that is not parallel to other teeth or implants. In another embodiment, the post can be offset to change the restoration of the implant.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US6048203A"><text>US 6048203 A</text></patcit> document relates to a system and method for filling a dental occlusion with a metal-free prosthesis.

The abutments are attached to the implants by means of mounting screws. The prosthesis is joined to the abutments by means of a light curable polymer resin coated on the prosthesis and/or abutment. Supplementary to the polymer resin, an attachment screw can be used to create a mechanical connection between the prosthesis and abutment.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">An object of this invention, being an improvement of the solution of patent application No. <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="EP2106768A1"><text>EP 2106768 A1</text></patcit>, is to provide an improved retention system to fix a complete denture in a mandible, by providing such construction of a connection between<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> a bar and connectors, which would enable setting up the bar and the connectors that eliminates stress formation, and in that the connector has at its lower part, beneath its support flange, an eccentric annular projection adapted for mounting the connector inside a hole of the implant, dimensions and shape of which correspond to a periphery of the hole of the implant.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to the invention, there is provided an improved retention system to fix a complete denture, in which an axis of a hole of a connector is eccentrically offset with respect to an axis of an outer surface of the connector, enabling, by rotation of the connector, a precise setting of a bar in relation to an implant, and thus elimination of stress formation.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Preferably, the connector of the retention system is a sleeve, the hole of which has the axis being eccentrically offset with respect to the axis of the outer surface of the sleeve, wherein the outer surface of the sleeve is a cylindrical surface having a negative shape of a hole in the sleeve of the bar.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Advantageously, the support flange on outer surface of the connector of the retention system according to the invention is adapted for resting on a bottom surface of the sleeve of the bar.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Further, the value of the eccentricity between the axis of the hole of the connector and the axis of the outer surface of the connector ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 mm.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Preferably, the connector according to the invention has, on its top surface, a groove for a screwdriver.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Advantageously, the connector according to the invention has a clamping screw adapted for connecting the implant with the bar by means of the connector, the clamping screw having a shank, an external thread at the lower part of the shank, and a flanged head with an opening for a key at the upper part of the shank, wherein the external thread of the clamping screw is adapted to mate with an internal thread in the hole of the implant.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A clinical research on the retention system according to the invention revealed, that due to possibility of an easy setting of the bar with respect to the implants in the mandible, any stresses, which would cause a pressure of the implants exerted on bones of the mandible and on gums surrounding the bones, have been eliminated.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Moreover, using the camping screws in the retention system according to the invention, which connect the connector with the bar, eliminates currently used, very inconvenient gluing of the bar with the connector.</p><heading id="h0003">BRIEF DECRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">A retention system to fix a complete denture in a mandible according to the invention is herein described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:
