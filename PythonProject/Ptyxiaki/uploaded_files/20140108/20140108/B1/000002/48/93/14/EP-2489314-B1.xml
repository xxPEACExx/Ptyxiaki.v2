disclosure relates to an apparatus for performing an electrosurgical procedure. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to an electrosurgical apparatus including an end effector assembly having a pair of jaw members that provide a mechanical advantage at the end effector.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Description of Related Art</u></b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Electrosurgical instruments, e.g., e!ectrosurgicat forceps (open or closed type), are well known in the medical arts and typically include a housing, a handle assembly, a shaft and an end effector assembly attached to a distal end of the shaft. The end effector includes jaw members configured to manipulate tissue (e.g., grasp and seal tissue). Typically, the electrosurgical forceps utilizes both mechanical clamping action and electrical energy to effect hemostasis by heating the tissue and blood vessels to coagulate, cauterize, seal, cut, desiccate, and/or fulgurate tissue. Typically, one or more driving mechanisms, e.g., a drive assembly including a drive element, is utilized to cooperate with one or more components operatively associated with the end effector to impart movement to one or both of the jaw members.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">To facilitate moving the jaw members from an open position for grasping tissue to a closed position for clamping tissue (or vice versa) such that a consistent, uniform tissue effect (e.g., tissue seal) is achieved, one or more types of suitable devices may be operably associated with the electrosurgical forceps. For example, in some instances, one or more cam members, e.g., a cam pin, may operably couple to the drive element, e.g., a drive rod, wire, cable, etc., and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> operably couple to the drive element, e.g., a drive rod, wire, cable, etc., and operably couple to a cam slot that is operably associated with one or both of the jaw members. Typically, the cam slots are operably disposed on proximal end of the jaw members. In certain instances, to facilitate movement of the jaw members, the proximal ends of the jaw members are configured to extend outside of the shaft profile. In this extended position, the proximal ends of the jaw members are commonly referred to as "flags."</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In certain instances, the shaft may bend or deform during the course of an electrosurgical procedure. For example, under certain circumstances, a clinician may intentionally bend or articulate the shaft to gain a desired mechanical advantage at the surgical site. Or, under certain circumstances, the surgical environment may cause unintentional or unwanted bending or flexing of the shaft, such as, for example, in the instance where the shaft is a component of a catheter-based electrosurgical forceps. More particularly, shafts associated with catheter-based electrosurgical forceps are typically designed to function with relatively small jaw members, e.g., jaw members that are configured to pass through openings that are 3mm or less in diameter. Accordingly, the shaft and operative components associated therewith, e.g., a drive rod, are proportioned appropriately. That is, the shaft and drive rod are relatively small.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As can be appreciated, when the shaft is bent or deformed (either intentionally or unintentionally) the frictional losses associated with "flags" extending through the shaft profile may be transferred to one of the drive rod, drive element, and/or a spring operably associated with the drive assembly, which, in turn, may diminish, impede and/or prevent effective transfer of the desired closure force that is needed at the jaw members. Moreover, the frictional losses may also lessen the operative life of the spring, which, in turn, ultimately lessens the operative life of the electrosurgical instrument.<br/>
<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1568330A"><text>EP 1 568 330</text></patcit> describes a high-frequency medical treatment device for staunching the flow of blood. The device<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> comprises an insertion member and a pair of jaws each representing a longitudinal direction, taking on an electrode function along the entire longitudinal region of each jaw, and having a gripping surface. In the device, a link member holds the jaws to be opened and closed in a direction allowing their gripping surfaces to be opposed to each other and links the jaws to a tip of the insertion member to keep electrical insulation between the jaws. An electricl short circuit between the jaws is prevented even when the jaws are mutually closed. A power line applies a high-frequency voltage to the jaws via the link member to cause a high-frequency current to flow through the jaws. An operation wire transmits open/close movements to the jaws by the link member.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY</u></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention is defined in claim 1.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present disclosure provides an endoscopic forceps. The endoscopic forceps includes a housing having a shaft that extends therefrom and defines a longitudinal axis therethrough. An end effector assembly is operatively connected to a distal end of the shaft and includes a pair of first and second jaw members. The first and second jaw members are pivotably coupled to one another. The first and second jaw members are movable relative to one another from an open position, wherein the first and second jaw members are disposed in spaced relation relative to one another, to a clamping position, wherein the first and second jaw members cooperate to grasp tissue therebetween. A drive mechanism includes a driving structure with a bifurcated distal end having two substantially resilient legs. A driving structure guide is operably associated with the shaft and is operably disposed adjacent the end effector assembly. The driving structure guide includes at least two grooves each configured to receive respective ones of the two legs of the bifurcated distal end.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The driving structure is movable to extend and retract the legs relative to the guide to move the jaw members between the open and clamped positions.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The endoscopic forceps may further comprise a movable<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> handle that is operably associated with the endoscopic forceps and configured to actuate the driving mechanism when the movable handle is moved proximally such that jaw members move from the clamping position to the open position, wherein proximal movement of the movable handle causes distal movement of the driving structure such that the first and second jaw members move from the clamping position to the open position.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The drive mechanism is movable to move the cam to move the jaw member between the open and clamping positions.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the various aspects of the invention, the jaw members have proximal flag portions on a proximal side of a pivot about which the jaw members open and close. The flag portions are contained longitudinally within the shaft. That is, the pivot is located at or proximal of a distal end of the shaft, yet the jaw members extend beyond the distal end of the shaft for clamping tissue therebetween.
