tank-replenishing device assembly.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>BACKGROUND ART</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">As is known many pourable food product comprising not only food product like milk, fruit juice or beverages in general, but also detergents are sold in containers having different shape and dimension.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Such container are typically made within bottling lines, which comprise a plurality of units for carrying out respective operations on containers.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Very briefly, bottling line comprises at least a rinsing unit for rinsing containers, a filling unit for filling containers with a pourable food product, a capping unit for capping the containers and a grouping unit for forming groups of containers.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Filling unit substantially comprises a carousel rotating about a rotation axis, a tank containing the pourable food product, and a plurality of control valves which are fluidically connected with the tank and are supported by the carousel in a radially external<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> position with respect to the rotation axis of the carousel.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Different methods are known to fill the tank with the pourable product by using a replenishing device.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">More precisely, the replenishing device comprises a hollow tube defining a pouring opening and a replenishing valve movable between a closure position and an open position.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Replenishing valve comprises, in turn, a shutter and a stem which may slide within the hollow body.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In particular, the shutter prevents the pourable product from flowing through the pouring opening in the closed position of the replenishing valve, and allows the pourable product to flow through the pouring opening in the open position of the replenishing valve.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to a first replenishing method, tank is replenished from the top.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">More precisely, as disclosed for example in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="GB694086A"><text>GB 694,086</text></patcit>, the pouring opening of the replenishing tube is arranged below the free level of the pourable product within the tank and the replenishing valve is arranged considerably above such free level.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As a result, when the replenishing valve is arranged in the open position, the pourable product falls downwards under the action of the gravity within the end portion of the tube defined between the replenishing valve and the pouring opening.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">More precisely, the distance between the control<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> valve and the pouring opening of the replenishing tube may range between 1 and 2 metres.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The fall of the pourable product for such a distance may generate turbulence and foam, which may penalize the correct replenishment of the tank.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Furthermore, the fall of the pourable product accelerates the pourable product. As a consequence, the pressure of pourable product within the tube decreases.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In case that it is necessary to preserve the sterility of pourable food product, it is of the uttermost importance to keep the pressure of pourable product higher than the environment pressure both within the replensihing tube and within the tank. In this way, in case that a portion of it reaches the external environment due for example to a leakage, aseptic pourable product flows away from the tube towards such external environment, so preventing the contamination of such pourable product with external agents like bacteria.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The fall of pourable product may reduce its pressure under the environment pressure. Accordingly, in case that only a portion of it reaches the external environment due for example to a leakage, the whole pourable product may be contaminated by external agents.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to a second method, tank is filled from the bottom at a certain pressure and by using a pump, so as to prevent the generation of foam and the reduction of the pressure of the pourable product falling within<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the tube.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A drawback of this second method is that it is necessary to provide some couplings, e.g. O-rings and/or collector, between fixed and rotating components.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Such couplings may, under some circumstances, create a passage between the inner volume of the tube and the external environment.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Accordingly, the sterility of the pourable product could be lost.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A need is felt in the industry to fill the tank with any kind of pourable product, either aseptic or not, without generating foams and turbulence.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In particular, a need is felt within the industry to fill the tank with an aseptic pourable product while preserving the sterility of the pourable product and avoiding the generation of foams and turbulence.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="GB555658A"><text>GB-A-555658</text></patcit> discloses a tank-replenishing device, according to the preamble of claim 1.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0025" num="0025">It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for replenishing a tank with a pourable product designed to meet at least one of the above-mentioned requirement in a straightforward and low-cost manner.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The aforementioned object is achieved by the present invention as it relates to a tank-replenishing device assembly as defined in claim 1.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">A need is also felt in the industry to ensure that<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the vibrations induced by the flow of pourable product when the replenishing valve is in the open position do not penalize the position of the shutter, especially if the length of the stem is particularly high.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A need is finally felt in the industry to ensure that when the replenishing valve is its closed position, the shutter correctly engages the pouring opening, especially if the length of the stem is particularly high.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0029" num="0029">One preferred embodiment is hereinafter disclosed for a better understanding of the present invention, by way of non-limitative example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
