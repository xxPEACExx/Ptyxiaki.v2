Also, commercially available epidaunorubicin hydrochloride can be used which is to be further purified. It is also possible to use epidaunorubicin hydrochloride which is produced by use of suitable microorganisms and converted into the corresponding hydrochloride in a subsequent step.

As for its structure, solvent A is selected from the group consisting of C1 and C2 halogenated solvents and mixtures thereof. Solvent A can be a single solvent or a mixture of solvents, but is preferably a single solvent. Generally, as solvent A every kind of solvent can be used as long as it has<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> one or two carbon atoms, comprises at least one halogen atom and is suitable to dissolve epidaunorubicin hydrochloride. Preferably, solvent A contains 1- 3 and more preferably 2 or 3 halogen atoms. As halogens, chlorine and bromine are preferred. The halogen atoms can be the same or different. For example, solvent A can be a compound which has at least one chlorine atom and/or at least one bromine atom. It is preferred that the halogen atom(s) present in solvent A is a (are) chlorine atom(s). The compound or compounds used as solvent A can contain further functional groups in addition to the halogen atom(s). On the other hand, it may be preferred that solvent A does not contain such further functional group(s). According to a preferred embodiment, solvent A is a saturated compound and thus does not contain a double bond. It can furthermore be preferred that solvent A has only one carbon atom. Preferably, solvent A is selected from the group consisting of, dichloromethane, dibromomethane, chloroform, bromoform, dichloroethanes (such as 1,1-dichloroethane or 1,2-dichloroethane), dibromoethanes (such as 1,2-dibromoethane), trichloroethanes (such as 1,1,1-trichloroethane or 1,1,2-trichloroethane), tetrachloroethanes (such as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane) and mixtures thereof. More preferably, solvent A is selected from chloroform, dichloromethane and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Solvent B is selected on its ability to purify epidaunorubicin hydrochloride from common impurities. It is selected from the group consisting of C1- C5 straight and branched alcohols and mixtures thereof. Solvent B can be a single solvent or a mixture of solvents, but is preferably a single solvent. Every alcohol having a C1 - C5 carbon skeleton can be used as solvent B as long as it is able to allow for purification of epidaunorubicin hydrochloride. In particular, solvent B can be a monoalcohol or a polyalcohol. Furthermore, solvent B includes alcohols having further functional groups in addition to the hydroxyl group(s). It may be preferred, however, that solvent B has no further functional groups. Furthermore, it may be preferred that solvent B is a saturated compound and therefore does not contain double or triple bonds. According to a preferred embodiment, solvent B is selected from the group consisting of C1 - C3 straight and branched alcohols and mixtures thereof. According to a further preferred embodiment, solvent B is selected from the group consisting of C1 straight and branched alcohols, C2 straight and branched alcohols, C3 straight alcohols and mixtures thereof. Most preferably, solvent B is selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Solvent C is selected to be an antisolvent to epidaunorubicin hydrochloride. It is selected from the group consisting of C1 - C5 straight and branched alcohols and mixtures thereof. Solvent C can be a single solvent or a mixture of solvents, but is preferably a single solvent. Solvent C is also selected to provide lower solubility to epidaunorubicin hydrochloride than solvent B. In this<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> context, it is submitted that it is within the expert knowledge of a person skilled in the art, to identify from the alcohols described herein as solvent C those alcohols which provide lower solubility to epidaunorubin hydrochloride than solvent B. For example, the skilled person may dissolve epidaunorubin hydrochloride in a solvent selected from the group consisting of C1 - C5 straight and branched alcohols and mixtures thereof, and determine the dissolution capacity of this solvent for epidaunorubin hydrochloride. In a next step, the skilled person may dissolve epidaunorubin hydrochloride in a different solvent selected from the group consisting of C1 - C5 straight and branched alcohols and mixtures thereof, and determine the dissolution capacity of this solvent for epidaunorubin hydrochloride. From the two kinds of solvents examined, the skilled person designates as solvent B the alcohol(s) in which the solubility of epidaunorubin hydrochloride is higher. Accordingly, he designates as solvent C the alcohol(s) in which the solubility of epidaunorubin hydrochloride is lower. Every alcohol having a C1 - C5 carbon skeleton can be used as solvent C as long as it is able to act as an antisolvent to epidaunorubicin hydrochloride. For example, solvent C can be a monoalcohol or a polyalcohol. Furthermore, solvent C includes alcohols having further functional groups in addition to the hydroxyl group(s). It may be preferred, however, that solvent B has no further functional groups. Furthermore, it may be preferred that solvent C is a saturated compound and therefore does not contain double or triple bonds. According to a preferred embodiment, solvent C is selected from the group consisting of C3 - C5 straight and branched alcohols and mixtures thereof. According to a further preferred embodiment, solvent C is selected from the group consisting of C3 branched alcohols, C4 straight and branched alcohols, C5 straight and branched alcohols, and mixtures thereof. Most preferably, solvent C is selected from the group consisting of isopropanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol and 1-pentanol.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to a preferred embodiment, the solvent system of the present invention comprises 0,1- 20 % by volume of solvent A, 7 - 50 % by volume of solvent B and 45 - 92 % by volume of solvent C.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to another preferred embodiment, the solvent system comprises 1 - 6 % by volume of solvent A, 10 - 40 % by volume of solvent B and 54 - 89 % by volume of solvent C.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">It can furthermore be preferred that the solvent system is devoid of solvents other than solvents A, B or C. According to this embodiment, the solution does not contain solvents apart from solvents A, B and C. However, the solvent system is allowed to contain, apart from epidaunorubicin hydrochloride, other ingredients, such as for example, salts.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to another preferred embodiment, the solvent system consists of epidaunorubicin hydrochloride, and solvents A, B and C. In this case, no further ingredients are allowed to be present in the solvent system.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The process of the present invention is preferably performed by dissolving epidaunorubicin hydrochloride in a solvent mixture I and, subsequently, contacting the resulting solution of epidaunorubicin hydrochloride with a solvent mixture II.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Solvent mixture I is characterized in comprising solvent A and having the capability to dissolve epidaunorubicin hydrochloride. Solvent mixture I is also allowed to consist only of solvent A. In this case, however, solvent mixture II must comprise solvents B and C. Nevertheless, it is preferred that solvent mixture I comprises, in addition to solvent A, also solvent B or solvent C, or a mixture of solvents B and C. In this case, it is preferred that solvent mixture I comprises (i) solvent A, on the one hand, and (ii) solvent B or C or a mixture thereof, on the other hand, in a volume ratio between 1 : 2 and 4:1. Preferably, the volume ratio between (i) solvent A and (ii) solvent B, C or a mixture thereof, is between 0,75 : 1 and 3 : 1, and most preferably between 1 : 1 and 2 : 1.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Solvent mixture II comprises solvent C. Solvent system II is generally allowed to consist only of solvent C. In this case, however, solvent mixture I has to comprise solvent A and solvent B. According to a preferred embodiment, solvent mixture II comprises solvents B and C.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Solvent mixture I is able to dissolve epidaunorubicin hydrochloride. Accordingly, in a first step of the process of the present invention, epidaunorubicin hydrochloride is dissolved completely in solvent mixture I. If necessary, one can assist in dissolving epidaunorubicin hydrochloride in solvent mixture I by increasing the temperature of solvent mixture I. For example, dissolution of epidaunorubicin hydrochloride in solvent mixture I can be performed at a temperature in the range between 40 - 80°C, preferably between 50 - 70°C, and most preferably between 55 and 65°C, Preferably, heating of solvent mixture I is accompanied by stirring.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Subsequently, the solution of epidaunorubicin hydrochloride in solvent mixture I is contacted with solvent mixture II. Therefore, solvent mixture II can be added to the solution of epidaunorubicin hydrochloride in solvent mixture I. On the other hand, it is also possible to add the solution of epidaunorubicin hydrochloride in solvent mixture I to solvent mixture II. The solvent mixtures<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> can be brought into contact by every conceivable means. For example, it is possible to drop, inject or pour the epidaunorubicin hydrochloride-containing solvent mixture I in solvent mixture II or vice versa. Preferably, the solvent mixtures are brought into contact by slowly dropping the epidaunorubicin hydrochloride-containing solvent mixture I in solvent mixture II or vice versa. Dropping can be performed, for example, for a period of 1 second to 1 hour, such as 1 minute to 40 minutes, or 5 minutes to 30 minutes.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to a preferred embodiment, upon contact of the solution of epidaunorubicin hydrochloride in solvent mixture I with solvent mixture II, the resulting solvent system comprises 0.1-20 % by volume, preferably 0.1 - 15 % by volume, more preferably 0,1 - 12 % by volume, and most preferably 0.1 - 10 % by volume, of solvent A.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">By reducing the concentration of solution A by means of contact with solvent mixture II not containing solvent A, solubility of epidaunorubicin hydrochloride is reduced. When the concentration of solvent A in the solvent system decreases below 20 % by volume, preferably below 15 % by volume, more preferably below 12 % by volume, and most preferably below 10 % by volume, crystallization of epidaunorubicin hydrochloride is initiated under suitable conditions. In this context, however, it has been found that decreasing the concentration of solvent A below a certain level is not sufficient to cause crystallization. It is essential that the solvent(s) used for diluting solvent A and thus to reduce the concentration of solvent A in the solvent mixture is (are) suitable solvent(s). In particular, it has been found that contacting the solution of epidaunorubicin hydrochloride in solvent A with conventionally used antisolvents, such as ethers, ketones, esters, and nitriles causes sudden precipitation of epidaunorubicin hydrochloride.

In a single X-Ray analysis, the crystalline epidaunorubicin hydrochloride produced according to the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> process of the present invention has monoclinic crystal structure. In the monoclinic system, the crystal is described by vectors of unequal length, as in the orthorhombic system. They form a rectangular prism with a parallelogram at its base. Hence two pairs of vectors are perpendicular, while the third pair makes an angle other than 90°.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Therefore, the present invention discloses crystalline epidaunorubicin hydrochloride having a monoclinic phase content of at least 10 %. According to further preferred embodiments, the monoclinic phase content of the crystalline epidaunorubicin hydrochloride is at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95% or at least 99%. According to a particular preferred embodiment, the crystalline epidaunorubicin hydrochloride consists only of the monoclinic form.

Therefore, it can be beneficially used in downstream processes for the production of anthracyclines. For example, crystalline epidaunorubicin hydrochloride can be used to produce epirubicin. The process for producing epirubicin from epidaunorubicin hydrochloride as a starting material is well-known in the art. Because of its high purity and good solubility in methanol, the use of crystalline epidaunorubicin hydrochloride as a starting material for the synthesis of epirubicin is beneficial over the use of amorphous epidaunorubicin hydrochloride.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The following figures provide supplementary information on the 4'-epidaunorubicin hydrochloride as produced according to the present Invention:
