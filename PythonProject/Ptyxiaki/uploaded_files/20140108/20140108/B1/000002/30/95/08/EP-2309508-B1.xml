Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">Aspects of the present invention relates to an information storage medium, and more particularly, to a recording and/or reproducing method, and a recording and/or reproducing apparatus allowing recording management information to be easily retrieved from an information storage medium, and an information storage medium therefor.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A Blue-ray disc recordable (BD-R) disc has a recording function which can replace a defect on the disc with a normal recording area. This function is referred to as a defect management function. Also, a user data area of the disc can be divided into a plurality of sequential recording ranges (SRRs). In each SRR, incremental recording can be performed and this incremental recording mode is referred to as a sequential recording mode (SRM). Further, a write command of a host in relation to an area in which data has been already recorded can instead be redirected to an area in which no data has been recorded. This function is referred to as a logical overwrite (LOW). These information items required for overall usage and management of the disc are stored in a place which is referred to as a temporary disc management area (TDMA). The TDMA is assigned and used in a lead-in area on the disc. Additionally, a part of a spare area in a user data area can be allocated and used as a TDMA. Accordingly, a plurality of TDMA areas can be allocated on a disc.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">TDMA information is divided into a temporary disc definition structure (TDDS), a temporary defect list (TDFL), and sequential recording range information (SRRI). Since a plurality of TDMA areas can be allocated, an access information area (ATDMA) is additionally required in order to easily and quickly find location information on a location in which a final TDMA is recorded.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The TDDS includes information on the size and location of an allocated spare area, and location information on locations in which the SRRI and TDFL are recorded. The TDFL includes replacement information by LOW, information on a defect which is<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> found while the disc is used, and replacement information in relation to the defect. The SRRI includes SRR information in relation to sequential recording.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the case of an information storage medium for recording, while the information storage medium is used for recording data, if a user only desires to use the information storage medium for reproduction without further recording data on the medium, then, the information storage medium is finalized. When the information storage medium is finalized, final recording management information is copied from recording management information which was temporarily recorded, and is recorded into a predetermined area. In this case, unless management of the final recording management information is performed well, it may become difficult to easily find the final recording management information in the finalized information storage medium. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20050270946A"><text>US2005/0270946</text></patcit> discloses a method and apparatus for recording management information on a recording medium.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Aspects of the present invention provide a recording and/or reproducing method, and a recording and/or reproducing apparatus allowing recording management information to be easily found in an information storage medium, and an information storage medium therefor, as set forth in the appended claims.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a recording method of recording data on an information storage medium, the method including: rearranging an order of a first information structure with a variable size and a second information structure with a fixed size, both of which being included in management information of the information storage medium, so that the first information structure with the variable size can be positioned following the second information structure with the fixed size;

The embodiments are described below in order to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a finalized information storage medium. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the finalized information storage medium 100 includes a lead-in area 110, a data area 120, and a lead-out area 130. In the data area 120, user data 121 is recorded. In the lead-in area 110 and the lead-out area 130, information on data recording management or defect management, and disc management information is recorded. While not required in all aspects, the medium 100 can be a write once disc, such as a BD-R or a write-once HD-DVD, but is not limited thereto. Aspects of the invention can be applied to rewriteable media as well as to non-optical media, such as magnetic media.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">While the information storage medium 100 is used by recording user data in the data area 120, if a user does not want to record data any more and wants to use the information storage medium only for reproduction of data (that is, the information storage medium is desired to be used only for reproduction without further recording data on the medium), then the user performs finalization of the information storage medium 100.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">There may be a variety of methods of finalizing an information storage medium. A method will now be explained with reference to the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. In order to prevent data from being recorded further on the data area 120, the remaining area in the data area 120 where user data 121 has not been recorded is filled with predetermined padding data 122. Then, a final temporary disc management structure (TDMS) among TDMSs recorded in a temporary disc management area (TDMA) 112 is copied into a disc management area (DMA) 111 and 131. The remaining TDMSs relate to defects occurring during recording operations prior to a last recording operation prior to finalization. Hereinafter, the TDMS copied into the DMA 111 and 131 will be referred to as a disc management structure (DMS). When data is reproduced from the thus finalized information storage medium 100 in the future, the DMS is read from the DMA 111 and 131, and by referring to the read DMS, data is reproduced from the information storage medium 100. While not required in all aspects, the DMA and the TDMA can be referred to as or include a Defect Management Area and a Temporary Defect Management Area, respectively.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0052" num="0052">As described above, a TDMS includes a temporary disc definition structure (TDDS), a temporary defect list (TDFL), and sequential recording range information (SRRI). The TDMS is recorded in the TDMA 112. Then, the TDDS, the TDFL, and the SRRI are updated in predetermined units as data is recorded to the information storage medium 100. For example, three types of units for updating the TDMS may be considered. A first TDMS update unit includes all of the TDFL, the SRRI, and the TDDS. A second TDMS update unit includes the SRRI and the TDDS. A third TDMS update unit includes the TDFL and the TDDS.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of the first TDMS update unit. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the first TDMS update unit 200 includes a TDFL 210, padding data 220, SRRI 230, and a TDDS 240. The TDFL 210 includes defect information, and the SRRI 230 includes recording management information. According to the amount of defects detected in an information storage medium or the information required for recording management, the sizes of the TDFL 210 and the SRRI 230 may be made to be variable. In a method of flexibly setting the sizes of the TDFL 210 and the SRRI 230, both having variable sizes, information in the TDFL 210 is recorded from the farther end of the TDFL 210 from the SRRI 230 towards the SRRI 230, and information in the SRRI 230 is recorded from the farther end of the SRRI 230 towards the TDFL 210 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>. If the amount of data is insufficient, the padding data 220 is used to fill the gap between the TDFL 210 and the SRRI 230. As such, the padding data 220 need not be used in all aspects.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The remaining part in which data is not recorded between the TDFL 210 and the SRRI 230 is filled with padding data 220. The TDDS 240 includes disc definition information. In particular, because the sizes of the TDFL 210 and the SRRI 230 are variable, the TDDS 240 has a TDFL pointer 242 and an SRRI pointer 241 which indicate the start addresses of the TDFL 210 and the SRRI 230, respectively. The TDDS 240 has a fixed size. In this way, the TDFL 210 and the SRRI 240 with variable sizes and the TDDS 240 with a fixed size are included in one update unit in an ordered arrangement of information structures, i.e., the TDFL 210, the SRRI 230, and the TDDS 240, in which the information structures are arranged in order of the TDFL 210, the padding data 220, the SRRI 230, and the TDDS 240.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example in which the first TDMS update unit 200 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is formed of one block. When the first TDMS update unit 200 can be recorded as one block, the first TDMS update unit 200 can have a shape as<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref>. When the first TDMS update unit 200 is recorded as more than one block, the first TDMS update unit 200 can have a shape as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 3B</figref> by using two blocks. In each case, the start locations of the TDFL 210 and the SRRI 230 are different, and therefore the TDDS 240 includes the SRRI pointer 241 and the TDFL pointer 242.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram illustrating another example of a second TDMS update unit 400. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 4</figref>, the second TDMS update unit 400 includes padding data 410, SRRI 420, and a TDDS 430. The TDDS 430 is formed as a fixed size of one sector, and includes an SRRI pointer 431 indicating the start address of the SRRI 420. The SRRI 420 is formed in a variable size of K sectors. In the second TDMS update unit 400, the remaining part which is not recorded as the SRRI 420 is filled with padding data 410. In order to correspond to the structure of the first TDMS update unit 200 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the SRRI 420 is arranged adjacent to the location of the TDDS 430. If the amount of data is insufficient, the padding data 410 is used to fill the gap. However, it is understood that the padding data 410 need not be used in all aspects.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Copying of a final TDMS having the shape of the second TDMS update unit 400 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 4</figref>, into a DMA 111 or 131 when an information storage medium is finalized will now be explained. <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 5</figref> is a reference diagram illustrating a concept of copying a final TDMS into a DMA 111 or 131.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 5</figref>, a final TDMS 500 recorded in a TDMA 112 is formed with padding data 510, final SRRI 520, and a final TDDS 530. Since the final TDDS 530 includes an SRRI pointer 531 indicating the start address of the final SRRI 520, the start address of the final SRRI 520 can be found by using the final TDDS 530. When this information storage medium is finalized, the final TDMS 500 in the TDMA 112 is copied into a DMA 111. The final TDMS copied into the DMA 111 will be referred to as a DMS 600. That is, the padding data 510, the final SRRI 520, and the final TDDS 530 of the final TDMS 500 are copied as the padding data 610, the SRRI 620, and the DDS 630, respectively, of the DMS 600. If the amount of data is insufficient, the padding data 510 is used to fill the gap. However, it is understood that the padding data 510 need not be used in all aspects.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 6</figref>, the DMS 600 in the DMA 111 has the exact same contents as those of the final TDMS 500. Accordingly, the SRRI pointer 631 in the DDS 630<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> included in the DMS 600 indicates only the start address of the final SRRI 520 included in the final TDMS 500, but cannot indicate the start address of the SRRI 620 included in the DMS 600. Accordingly, the start address of the SRRI 620 of the DMS 600 cannot be found.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">In order to solve this problem, according to an aspect of the present invention, when a final TDMS 500 recorded in a TDMA 112 is copied into a DMA 111 during finalization of an information storage medium 100, the TDMS 500 is not directly copied into the DMS 600. Instead, after rearranging the information structures included in the TDMS 500, the TDMS is then copied into the DMS 600.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> is a reference diagram illustrating a concept of copying a final TDMS 500 into a DMS 700 according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>, when a final TDMS 500 is copied into a DMS 700, a final TDDS 530 with a fixed size is copied as a DDS 710 in the first location in the DMS 700. A final SRRI 520 with a variable size is arranged at a location following the DDS 710, and followed by padding data 730. That is, the SRRI 720 begins to be recorded in a data frame following a data frame in which the DDS 710 is finally recorded in the DMA 112 of the information storage medium 100, and meaningless data (i.e., the padding data 730) is recorded in the remaining data frames after recording the DDS 710 and the SRRI 720. Thus, by arranging the SRRI 720 with a variable size following the DDS 710 with a fixed size, it can be known even without referring to an SRRI pointer included in the DDS 710, that the SRRI 720 begins from a fixed location (i.e., after a sector which is the fixed size of the DDS 710).</p><p id="p0062" num="0062"><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram illustrating the contents of SRRI 720 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>, the SRRI 720 includes SRRI header information 721 and SRR entry information 722. The SRR header information 721 includes an SRRI ID 723 for identifying SRRI, and the number of SRR entries 724. The SRR entry information 722 includes SRR entry #1 725, SRR entry #2 726, through to SRR entry #N 727, an SRR terminator 728, and 00h 729.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063"><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a structure of a recording and/or reproducing apparatus 900 according to an embodiment of the present invention.

According to control of the control<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> unit 910, the recording/reading unit 920 records data on the disc 10 (that is, an information storage medium according to the present invention), and reads data from the disc 10 in order to reproduce the recorded data.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The control unit 910 controls the recording/reading unit 920 so that data can be recorded in predetermined recording unit blocks. The control unit 910 also obtains valid data by processing data read by the recording/reading unit 920. In particular, according to aspects of the present invention, when a method of using the disc 10 changes, the control unit 910 controls the recording/reading unit 920, thereby rearranging the order of a first information structure with a variable size and a second information structure with a fixed size, both included in management information of the disc 10, so that the first information structure with the variable size can be placed following the second information structure with the fixed size, and then, the rearranged management information can be recorded to the disc 10. By way of example, the control unit 910 performs the rearranging described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008">FIGs. 1 through 8</figref> when the disc 10 is finalized.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065"><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 10</figref> is a detailed diagram of the recording and/or reproducing apparatus 900 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 9</figref> according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 10</figref>, a disc drive has a pickup as the recording/reading unit 920. A disc 10 is placed on the pickup. Also, as the control unit 910, the disc drive has a host interface (I/F) 911, a digital signal processor (DSP) 912, a radio frequency amplifier (RF AMP) 913, a servo 914, and a system controller 915.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">While the disc 10 is used by recording data on the disc 10, if a user does not want to further record data on the disc 10, and wants to use the disc 10 only for reproduction of data, the user commands a host 930 to finalize the disc 10, and the host 930 transfers the finalization command to the system controller 915 through the host I/F 911.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The system controller 915 receives the finalization command from the host I/F 911 and performs finalization of the disc 10. In particular, according to an aspect of the present invention, when the information storage medium 10 is finalized, the order of SRRI 520 with a variable size and a TDDS 530 with a fixed size, both of which are included in the final TDMS 500 of the disc 10, is rearranged so that the SRRI 720 with the variable size can be placed following the TDDS 710 with the fixed size. The final TDMS 700 may be stored in a memory of the system controller 915 or may be<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> recorded in a TDMA of the disc 10.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Then, the system controller 915 controls the DSP 912 and the servo 914 so that the rearranged TDMS 700 can be recorded in a DMS 600 of a DMA 112 of the disc 10. The DSP 212 adds additional data, such as a parity for error correction, to the data that is to be recorded, and performs error correction code (ECC) encoding, thereby generating an ECC block, and modulates the ECC block according to predetermined methods. The RF AMP 913 converts the data output from the DSP 912 into an RF signal. The pickup 920 records the RF signal output from the RF AMP 913 on the disc 10. The servo 914 receives a command required for servo control, from the system controller 915, and performs servo control.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">When data is reproduced, the host I/F 911 receives a reproduction command from the host 930.

That is, according to the contents of the SRRI 720, data is reproduced from the information storage medium 100.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">According to aspects of the present invention as described above, recording management information can be found in a fixed location of a finalized information storage medium, thereby allowing the recording management information to be found easily and quickly. However, it is understood that aspects of the invention can be applied during other operations beyond finalization of the medium, and that aspects can be used with data structures having multiple variable sizes and/or fixed sizes<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> without being limited to the SRRI, TDFL, and TDDS structures described herein by way of non-limiting examples.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The present invention can also be embodied as computer readable codes on a computer readable recording medium. The computer readable recording medium is any data storage device that can store data which can be thereafter read by a computer system. Examples of the computer readable recording medium include read-only memory (ROM), random-access memory (RAM), CD-ROMs, magnetic tapes, floppy disks, and optical data storage devices. Further aspects can be embodied in carrier waves (such as data transmission through the Internet). The computer readable recording medium can also be distributed over network coupled computer systems so that the computer readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion. Also, functional programs, codes, and code segments for accomplishing the present invention can be easily construed by programmers skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Although a few preferred embodiments have been shown and described, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications might be made without departing from the scope of the invention, as defined in the appended claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56985911" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Aufzeichnungsverfahren zum Aufzeichnen von Daten auf einem Informationsspeichermedium, das einen Benutzerdatenbereich (121), der in mehrere sequentielle Aufzeichnungsbereiche (Sequential Recording Range - SRR) geteilt ist, in denen Benutzerdaten aufgezeichnet werden, einen temporären Plattenmanagementbereich (112) und einen Plattenmanagementbereich (111) aufweist, der sich vom temporären Plattenmanagementbereich (112) unterscheidet, wobei das Verfahren Folgendes aufweist:
