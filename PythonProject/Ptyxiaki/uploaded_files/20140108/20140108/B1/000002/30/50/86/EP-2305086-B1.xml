This stack of sheets consists of sheet bodies each of which is formed by folding a sheet and then further folding it in the same direction and has a fold and an opening which are formed by the first folding and a gap formed by the second folding.

The sheets are folded and stacked such that the two-ply lower portion of each sheet and the two-ply upper portion of the underlying sheet are overlapped. Thus, when the first sheet is taken out through the opening, the next sheet is left in the packaging member with its portion protruding through the opening to facilitate take-out of<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the next sheet.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The known stack of sheets consists of sheet bodies each formed by folding a sheet and then further folding it in the same direction. Therefore, the height of the stack of sheets in the stacking direction is increased. Accordingly, the height of the case that contains the stack of sheets is increased.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is, accordingly, an object of the invention to provide a technique for taking out folded sheets without increasing the height of a stack of sheets in a stacking direction.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">One aspect of the invention relates to a stack of sheets which is formed by stacking a plurality of sheets one on another, as defined in appended claim 1. The stack of sheets can be formed by stacking various kinds of sheets such as wet tissues. The sheets are typically quadrangular (square or rectangular).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In this invention, the stack of sheets consists of first sheet bodies and second sheet bodies which are formed by folding the sheets. Each of the first sheet bodies is formed by folding a sheet once and has a fold and an opening. The first sheet body is typically formed by folding a quadrangular sheet along a folding line extending from a center of one side of the quadrangular sheet in parallel to the other side which crosses the one side. Further, each of the second sheet bodies is formed by folding a sheet and then further folding it in the same direction (by folding the sheet twice) and has a fold and an opening which are formed by the first folding and a gap formed by the second folding. The second sheet body is typically formed by folding a quadrangular sheet along a folding line extending from a center of one side of the quadrangular sheet in parallel to the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> other side which crosses the one side and further folding the sheet along a folding line extending from a center of a side corresponding to the one side in parallel to the other side. Naturally, the folding positions of the first and second sheet bodies can be appropriately selected.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The first sheet bodies are arranged along the stacking direction in such orientation that the folds and the openings are alternately reversed in position with respect to a direction perpendicular to the stacking direction, when viewed from the direction perpendicular to the folding lines of the first sheet bodies (from the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> direction of the width). Further, the second sheet bodies are arranged along the stacking direction with a predetermined spacing in the direction perpendicular to the stacking direction such that the gaps are open in the directions that face each other and such that the fold of the second sheet body is placed to one side (take-out opening side) of the opening in the stacking direction, when viewed from the direction perpendicular to the folding lines of the second sheet bodies (from the direction of the width). Typically, the second sheet bodies consist of second sheet bodies of a first group and second sheet bodies of a second group which are arranged along the stacking direction with a predetermined spacing in the stacking direction. In this case, each of the second sheet bodies of the first and second groups is arranged such that the fold of the second sheet body is placed to one side of the opening in the stacking direction and such that the gaps of the second sheet bodies of the first and second groups are open in the directions that face each other. Further, the fold and the opening of each of the first sheet bodies are inserted into a region on the other side in the gap in the stacking direction in one of two second sheet bodies oriented such that the gaps are open in the opposite directions with respect to each other and into a region on one side in the gap in the stacking direction in the other second sheet body, respectively. Typically, the fold and the opening of the first sheet body are inserted into the gap of the second sheet body of the first group and the gap of the second sheet body of the second group, respectively. The "one side in the stacking direction" typically represents the side (take-out opening side) from which the first or second sheet bodies are taken out.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In this invention, sheets can be taken out in the folded state (the first sheet bodies or the second sheet bodies), so that the usability is enhanced. Further, the stack of sheets is formed by stacking first sheet bodies each formed by folding a sheet once and the second sheet bodies each formed by folding a sheet twice, so<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> that the height of the stack of sheets in the stacking direction can be reduced. Further, the fold and the opening of each of the first sheet bodies are inserted respectively into the gaps of two second sheet bodies which are oriented such that the gaps are open in the opposite directions with respect to each other, respectively. With this arrangement, when the stack of sheets according to this invention is contained in a case with a take-out opening, the amount of the part of the first or second sheet body to be exposed (drawn out) through the take-out opening can be reduced.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In another embodiment according to this invention, the opening of the first sheet body inserted into the region on one side in the gap in the stacking direction in the second sheet body is placed in a position displaced to the open side of the gap of said second sheet body from the fold of the first sheet body inserted into the region on the other side in the gap in the stacking direction in said second sheet body, when viewed from the direction perpendicular to the folding lines of the first and second sheet bodies.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In this embodiment, the contact area between the two first sheet bodies inserted into the gap of the second sheet body along the stacking direction can be reduced. As a result, when the first sheet body inserted into a region on one side in the gap in the stacking direction is taken out, the fold side of the first sheet body inserted into a region on the other side in the same gap in the stacking direction can be prevented from being exposed (drawn out).</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In a further embodiment according to this invention, the second sheet body is folded in such a manner that the fold of the second sheet body is placed in a position displaced from the opening of the second sheet body to an open side of the gap, when viewed from the direction perpendicular to the folding lines of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> first and second sheet bodies.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In this embodiment, even if the opening of the first sheet body inserted into the region on one side in the gap of the second sheet body in the stacking direction is placed in a position displaced to the open side of the gap of the second sheet body from the fold of the first sheet body inserted into the region on the other side in the gap of the second sheet body, increase of the width of the stack of sheets can be prevented.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In a further embodiment according to this invention, wet tissues are used as the sheets. In this embodiment, the wet tissues can be suitably stacked one on another.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Another aspect of the invention relates to a sheet container which includes a case with a take-out opening and a stack of sheets which is formed by stacking a plurality of sheets one on another and contained within the case, and from which sheets forming the stack of sheets are taken out one by one through the take-out opening of the case. In this invention, any one of the above-described stacks of sheets is used as the stack of sheets.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In this invention, the height of the sheet container can be reduced.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In one embodiment of the sheet container according to the other aspect, the first sheet bodies and the second sheet bodies are stacked one on another in such a manner that, when the first sheet body or second sheet body lying on an end of the stack of sheets which faces the take-out opening of the case is taken out, the fold of the second sheet body or first sheet body which immediately underlies said<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> sheet body or second sheet body is exposed (drawn out) through the take-out opening. Various manners can be used to stack the first sheet bodies and the second sheet bodies one on another.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In this invention, sheets can be taken out in the folded state (the first sheet bodies or the second sheet bodies), so that the usability is enhanced. Further, the stack of sheets is formed by stacking first sheet bodies each formed by folding a sheet once and the second sheet bodies each formed by folding a sheet twice, so that the height of the stack of sheets in the stacking direction can be reduced.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As a result, according to the invention, sheets can be taken out in the folded state without increasing the height of a stack of sheets or the height of a sheet container.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> shows a first sheet body forming a stack of sheets according to an embodiment of the invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> shows a second sheet body forming the stack of sheets according to the embodiment.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> shows the stack of sheets as viewed from the direction perpendicular to folding lines of the first and second sheet bodies.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref> shows a sheet container which contains the stack of sheets in a case.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref> shows the state in which a sheet is taken out of the stack of sheets.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6</figref> shows a sheet container which contains a stack of sheets according to another embodiment in a case.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0007">(First representative embodiment)</heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">A first embodiment of the invention is now described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>. In this embodiment, a stack of wet tissues (sheets) is described as an representative example of the invention. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> shows a first sheet body 12 formed by folding a sheet 11 once, as viewed from a direction perpendicular to the folding line (from the direction of the width). <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> shows a second sheet body 13 formed by folding the sheet 11 twice, as viewed from a direction perpendicular to the folding line (from the direction of the width). <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> shows a stack of sheets<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> 10 formed by stacking first and second sheet bodies 12 and 13 one on another, as viewed from a direction perpendicular to the folding lines (from the direction of the width). <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref> shows a sheet container 20 which contains the stack of sheets 10 according to this embodiment in a case 1, as viewed from a direction perpendicular to the folding lines (from the direction of the width).</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, for example, the wet tissue 11 is an impregnated sheet of a rectangular shape having a long side M (having a length m) and a short side N (having a length n). Naturally, the wet tissue 11 can be provided in various shapes such as a square (m=n). The impregnated sheet is formed by impregnating a base sheet with impregnating liquid. The base sheet may be, for example, a sheet made of pulp, a sheet made of pulp and thermoplastic resin, or a sheet made of nonwoven fabric. The impregnating liquid may be, for example, water or water-soluble alcohol.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The stack of sheets 10 of this embodiment consists of first sheet bodies 12 and second sheet bodies 13 which are formed by folding wet tissues 11.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the first sheet bodies 12 is formed by folding a wet tissue 11. In this embodiment, the wet tissue 11 is folded along a folding line (dashed line in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) extending from a center of one side (long side M) of the wet tissue 11 in parallel to a side (short side N) which crosses the one side. Thus, the first sheet body 12 has a fold 12a and an opening 12b of a gap formed by folding. In <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the wet tissue 11 is folded at a center of one side (long side M) so that the opening is formed in a position where the opposite ends of the one side (long side M) face each other. The position of the opening 12b, however, varies by the folding position.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, the second sheet body 13 is formed by folding a wet tissue 11 once and then folding it again in the same direction. In this embodiment,<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> first, the wet tissue 11 is folded along a folding line (dashed line in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>) extending from a center of one side (long side M) of the wet tissue 11 in parallel to a side (short side N) which crosses the one side.
