As a result, in addition to the telephone-based methods, the PC (Personal Computer) based methods have been increased as the methods of using radio apparatuses, such as a portable radio apparatus (terminal). Along with the diversification of utilization forms of the portable radio apparatus, the shape of the portable radio apparatus itself has also been diversified. As a result, along with the conventional foldable type and the slide type (expressed as long-side direction slide type in this specification for convenience of explanation), a radio apparatus (expressed as short-side direction slide type in this specification for convenience of explanation) which has an easily usable large and wide screen (lateral display), and which has first and second housings configured to be slidably opened and closed in the short-side direction of the housing, has been attracting attention.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In general, when a high frequency signal is supplied to an antenna attached to the small housing, induced current is generated in the vicinity of the antenna of the second housing at which the antenna is arranged. In the case where the first housing is connected to the second housing in a state equivalent to a short-circuit state, induced current is also generated in the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> first housing similarly to the second housing, and these induced currents contribute to the radiation characteristics of the antenna.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">At present, the frequency band mainly used in the radio apparatus is, in many cases, a frequency band corresponding to a wavelength, about one fourth of which (λ/4) is the short-side direction length of the housing, and the above described induced current is generated so as to flow in the direction of λ/4 which is the resonance length of the induced current, that is, in the short-side direction of the housing. It is possible to obtain excellent antenna characteristics by controlling the induced current generated on the housing.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For example, a technique relating to the improvement of antenna characteristics of a long-side direction slide type portable radio apparatus is disclosed in Patent Document 1 as will be described below. According to Patent Document 1, it is possible to widen the frequency band of the antenna and to control the radiation pattern of the antenna. However, since the load connected to widen the band is inductive, and since the load connected to control the radiation pattern is capacitive, the reactance constants of the connected loads need to be different from each other. For this reason, both the purpose of widening the band of the antenna and the purpose of controlling the radiation pattern are difficult to be realized in the same frequency band.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Further, Patent Document 2 as will be described below discloses a technique for improving antenna characteristics of a small and thin long-side direction slide type apparatus in a free space. However, Patent Document 2 originally proposes a new technique for solving the problem that the antenna characteristics cannot be secured.

This problem will be described below.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">When electric power is supplied to the antenna, the above described induced current is generated in the second housing at which the antenna is arranged. The induced current flows from the antenna feeding point toward the other end section along the short-side direction of the housing having the length of about λ/4 which is the resonance length.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">On the other hand, induced current is also generated on the side of the first housing similarly to the second housing. This induced current flows from the side of the antenna feeding point toward the other end section along the short-side direction of the housing, similarly to the induced current generated on the side of the second housing.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Here, the induced currents generated in the first housing and the second housing are currents which flow in the directions opposite to each other from the feeding point as the center in the state where the housings are opened. That is, the induced currents generated in the first housing and the second housing have phases opposite to each other and hence mutually cancel one another. The cancelled current components are components which contribute to a vertically polarized wave component serving as a main polarized wave at the time when data communication is performed in the state where the housings are opened.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Meanwhile, the polarization surface of vertically polarized waves is mainly used as the polarization surface of the base station antenna for portable communication. That is, the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> above described current line segments which are cancelled by each other are the main polarized wave components at the time when data communication is performed in the state where the housings are slidably opened. When the main polarized wave components are reduced, it is not possible to secure excellent communication quality.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">An object of the present invention is to solve the above described problem and to secure excellent communication quality in a short-side direction slide type radio apparatus.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Note that unlike the conventional vertically sliding type portable radio apparatus, very excellent antenna characteristics are obtained, as the free space characteristics, in the vicinity of the antenna at the time when the housings are laterally slidably opened, because the first housing, which is regarded as a ground conductor when viewed from the antenna, does not exist in the vicinity of the antenna.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>Means for Solving the Problems</b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention is devised in order to solve the above described problem of the short-side direction slide type radio apparatus, and includes: a first housing; a second housing, conductive members which are respectively included in the first and second housings; an antenna which is configured by arranging a radiation element in the second housing along the short-side direction of the housing; a slide mechanism section which connects the first housing to the second housing slidably relative to each other; an antenna feeding point which is arranged in the second housing at an end side in the sliding direction of the first housing at the time when the housings are slidably opened; and a reactance element which connects the slide mechanism section to the conductive member included in one of the first housing and the second housing.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a short-side direction slide type radio apparatus which has a first housing and a second housing that are made<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> slidable relative to each other in the short-side direction of the housing, and which is featured by including: first and second conductive members which are respectively provided in the first housing and the second housing; an antenna which is configured by arranging a radiation element in the second housing along the short-side direction of the second housing; a slide mechanism section which connects the first housing to the second housing slidably relative to each other; and a reactance element which connects the slide mechanism section to one of the first conductive member and the second conductive member that are respectively provided in the first housing and the second housing.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">It is preferred that, in the state where the first housing and the second housing are opened by being slid relative to each other in the short-side direction of the housing, the slide mechanism section is connected to at least one of the first and second conductive members by the reactance element, and is DC connected to the conductive member which is not connected by the reactance element. It is preferred that the slide mechanism section is connected to at least one of the first and second conductive members by the reactance element so that the induced current generated in the first conductive member and the induced current generated in the second conductive member are in phase with each other. It is also preferred that the characteristics of the reactance element are adjusted so that the phase of the induced current on the side of the first housing is adjusted to be the same as the phase of the induced current on the side of the first housing.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">It is preferred that the current induced in the first housing is set substantially in phase with the induced current in such a manner that the phase of the current induced in the first housing is advanced or delayed by about n/2 by adjusting the characteristic value of the reactance element of the joining section nearest to the antenna feeding point so as to set the phase of the current induced in the first housing to the same direction as the induced current. Thereby, it is possible to reduce the components which are cancelled by each other. Therefore, the total sum of the induced currents is made to have substantially the same direction as the sliding direction, so as to contribute to the radiation of vertically polarized<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> wave components at the time of slidable opening of the housings, that is, at the time of data communication.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">It is preferred that the short-side direction length of the first housing is set to about λ/4 of at least one frequency band used for communication.</p><heading id="h0006"><b>Advantages of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to the present invention, the phase of the induced current generated in the first housing can be controlled by the reactance element so as to become substantially equal to the phase of the induced current generated in the second housing.

In the above described first embodiment, the single band configuration of 2 GHz band is described, but according to the present invention, the same effect can also be obtained even in the case corresponding to a multi-band. In the case where a plurality of radio communication frequency bands are used in the radio apparatus, and where the first use (communication) frequency band fa of the lower frequency side and the second use (communication) frequency band fb of the higher frequency side are relatively separated from each other, a value of a reactance element 4, which is optimum for the frequency band fa, and a value of the reactance element 4, which is optimum for the frequency band fb, may be different from each other.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">At present, the frequency bands mainly used as the frequency bands for portable radio apparatuses are the 800 MHz band, the 900 MHz band, the 1.7 GHz band, the 1.8 GHz band, the 1.9 GHz band, and the 2 GHz band. Here, when the 800 MHz band and the 900 MHz band are set as the first frequency band fa, and when the respective adjoining frequency bands from the 1.7 GHz band to the 2 GHz band are set as the second frequency band fb, the relationship between the frequency bands fa and fb is approximately expressed as fb ≈ 2fa.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Further, as for approximate dimensions of a most popular portable radio apparatus, the dimension in the housing short-side direction is about λb/4 of the wavelength λb corresponding to fb, that is, 40 to 50 mm, and the dimension in the housing long-side direction<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> is about λa/4 of the wavelength λa corresponding to fa, that is, 85 to 95 mm. When the induced current distribution at the time of slidable opening of the housings is considered in relation to the first frequency band fa, the induced current is mainly generated in the housing long-side direction in which the housing dimension is λa/4. At this time, when at least one of the reactance elements 41 to 44 is adjusted in matching with fa, it is possible to obtain the radiation characteristics in which the total sliding direction length of the first and second housings is about λa/2, that is, the radiation characteristics in which the vertical polarized wave components are close to those of one quarter wavelength (λ/4) dipole.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">At this time, the values of the reactance elements 41 to 44, which are optimum for the frequency band fa, are different from the values of the reactance elements 41 to 44, which are optimum for the frequency band fb. However, the values of the reactance elements can be simultaneously adjusted for different frequency bands according to the configuration of the reactance elements.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The configuration of the reactance element will be exemplarily described by using a LC filter having a simplest configuration with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 4(a) and (b).

When the reactance element and the antenna feeding point are close to each other, the phase change of the current until the current reaches the reactance element after being generated is small, and hence the distribution of the impedance depending on the current is narrow. This makes it possible to control the phase of the current in a wide range. On the contrary, when the reactance element and the antenna feeding point are away from each other, the phase of the current is changed until the current reaches the reactance element after being generated, and hence the distribution of the impedance depending on the current is widened. This makes it impossible to achieve the intended control of the phase of the current.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0050" num="0050">That is, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 7</figref>, in the case of the above described short-side direction slide type portable radio apparatus according to the second embodiment, which is configured so that the first frequency band represented by fa and the second frequency band represented by fb are separated by a frequency range denoted approximately as fb ≈ 2fa, the short-side direction length of the housing is about λb/4, and the long-side direction length of the housing is about λa/4 ≈ λb/2. At this time, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 7(b)</figref>, the reactance element 43 is located at a position third nearest to the antenna feeding point 6.

That is, in the case of the short-side direction slide type portable radio apparatus according to the present embodiment, the sliding direction and the long-side direction of the housing of the radio apparatus are orthogonal to each other, and hence the adjustment only in a desired frequency band can be effectively performed in dependence upon a place at which the reactance element is arranged.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><heading id="h0013">(Summary)</heading><p id="p0053" num="0053">In the short-side direction slide type portable radio apparatus according to the embodiments of the present invention, the reactance element, which connects the slide mechanism section for sliding the first housing and the second housing relative to each other, to the conductive member provided in one of the first housing and the second housing, is provided, and the induced current generated in the first housing is controlled by the reactance element so as to have substantially the same phase as the phase of the induced current generated in the second housing.
