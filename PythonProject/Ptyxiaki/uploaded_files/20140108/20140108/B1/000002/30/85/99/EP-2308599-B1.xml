In general, at a stage during manufacturing of paper from wood, paper receives a high degree of processing in order to render cellulose fibers finely softened, such that paper is a functional material having a value-added structure. Therefore, waste paper is also a functional material having a value-added structure. Moreover, waste paper is a material that is effectively zero in terms of its environmental impact. Consequently, proposals have been made for using resin compositions containing paper, in which pulverized waste paper is mixed, for molding process materials.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, in Patent Document 1, a resin composition containing paper is disclosed in which a composite paper having a polyethylene resin on one or both surfaces thereof is shredded in a small piece state, a granular state, or a powdered state of about 1 mm to 5 mm square by a chopper or pulverizer type of shredder or the like, and such shredded paper components are mixed at 50% by weight or greater with a synthetic resin component of polyethylene or the like.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In Patent Document 2, a resin composition containing paper is disclosed in which collected waste paper, such as laminated paper or the like from liquid containers, is crushed to a particle diameter of 0.5 mm to 2.5 mm, and the crushed paper is mixed at not less than 51% by mass with a polyethylene or polypropylene resin.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In Patent Document 3, a resin composition containing paper for use in molding processes is disclosed, which contains in excess of 50% by weight and at or below 70% by weight of a low combustion component in powder form consisting mainly of paper powder and having a particle size of 50 µm or greater and 200 µm or less made by grinding waste paper or the like, and 30% or more by weight and less than 50% by weight of a high combustion component made up mainly from a thermoplastic resin.</p><heading id="h0003">Background Art Documents:</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP10138241A"><text>10-138241</text></patcit><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></li><li>Patent Document 2: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2007045863A"><text>2007-045863</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 3: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2001181511A"><text>2001-181511</text></patcit></li></ul></p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US4228964A"><text>US 4 228 964 A</text></patcit> discloses an apparatus for grinding paper into cellulose fiber insulation in which a hammermill or rotary beater has a paper feed inlet which establishes a low pressure zone at the entrance to the hammermill housing whereby to encourage reverse flow of partially ground materials from the outer perimeter of the hammermill into the low pressure zone, the partially ground material tending to collect in the form of a vortex and to recombine with the main stream of material being supplied into the feed inlet.

In the case that resin compositions of this type are used for manufacturing a complicatedly designed product with a fine structure by injection molding, the crushed paper, which does not exhibit fluidity even by heating thereof, disrupts the smooth flow of the resin composition, so that defects such as filling failures occur easily, and due to poor pattern transferability, high quality molded products with good yield cannot be obtained.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further, in the case that a resin composition as disclosed in Patent Document 3 containing paper in powder form with a particle size of 50 µm or greater and 200 µm or less is used to produce a composite molded article having a fine structure by injection molding, similarly, the crushed paper in powder form, which does not exhibit fluidity even<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> by heating thereof, disrupts the smooth flow of the resin composition, so that defects such as filling failures occur easily, and due to poor transferability, high quality molded products with good yield cannot be obtained.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The inventors of the present application have come to the understanding that if paper particles included in the resin composition are made into a powder with a particulate diameter of less than 50 µm, it becomes possible to carry out injection molding of high quality molded products with good yield.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Notwithstanding, it also was understood that when paper powder is pulverized using a crushing machine, such as a rod mill, ball mill, pan mill, pin mill or the like, there is a limitation of particle diameter size, on the order of 100 µm on average. Further, even if the crushing machine continues in operation, the paper fibers become intertwined in a flocculated condition, so that further progression of pulverization cannot be achieved.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Further, in the case that paper is pulverized by a vertical roller mill, a drug research mill, or a stone mill, upon achieving a particle diameter on the order of 50 µm or less, there is a problem of pulverizing efficiency decreases remarkably, and the benefit of using waste paper with a substantially zero environmental impact tends to be spoiled.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Taking into consideration the aforementioned points, the present invention has the object of providing a method for manufacturing fine paper powder, which enables one to produce fine paper powder with a particle diameter of less than 50 µm without incurring a substantial environmental impact, as well as a resin composition for molding process use, which contains fine paper powder therein obtained according to the aforementioned manufacturing method.</p><heading id="h0006">Means for Solving the Problem:</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The method for producing fine paper powder according to the present invention comprises a first fine pulverizing step of pulverizing coarsely ground paper powder using a first vertical roller mill equipped with a plurality of first pulverizing rollers, each having grooves formed on an outer circumferential surface thereof, in order to obtain a fine paper powder having an average particle diameter of 50 µm or greater and less than 150 µm, and a second fine pulverizing step of pulverizing the fine paper powder obtained in the first fine pulverizing step using a second vertical roller mill equipped with a plurality of second pulverizing rollers, each having grooves formed on an outer circumferential surface thereof, in order to obtain a fine paper powder having an average particle diameter of 25 µm or greater and less than 50 µm, wherein an angle of inclination of the grooves of the first pulverizing rollers with respect to axes of rotation of the first pulverizing<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> rollers is smaller than an angle of inclination of the grooves of the second pulverizing rollers with respect to axes of rotation of the second pulverizing rollers.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to the method for producing fine paper powder of the present invention, in the first fine pulverizing step, coarsely ground paper powder is pulverized using the first vertical roller mill until reaching an average particle diameter of 50 µm or greater and less than 150 µm. The angle of inclination of the grooves of the first pulverizing rollers with respect to axes of rotation of the first pulverizing rollers is small. As a result thereof, because the distance (time) at which paper particles are continuously bitten into gaps between the outer circumferential surface of the first pulverizing rollers and the inner circumferential wall surface of the pulverization chamber is short, and opening of the intertwined structure of the paper fibers progresses, pulverization efficiency up to a particle diameter of 50 µm or greater and less than 150 µm is superior while environmental impact is reduced. Further, by means of the first fine pulverizing step, the paper powder more preferably is pulverized to a particle diameter of 50 µm or greater and less than 100 µm.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Further, in the second fine pulverizing step, the fine paper powder having an average particle diameter of 50 µm or greater and less than 150 µm obtained in the first fine<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> pulverizing step is further pulverized using the second vertical roller mill until reaching an average particle diameter of 25 µm or greater and less than 50 µm. The angle of inclination of the grooves of the second pulverizing rollers with respect to axes of rotation of the second pulverizing rollers is large. As a result thereof, because the distance (time) at which paper particles are continuously bitten into gaps between the outer circumferential surface of the second pulverizing rollers and the inner circumferential wall surface of the pulverization chamber is long, and mashing of the fine paper powder progresses and the opened paper fibers are made even finer, pulverization efficiency up to a particle diameter of 25 µm or greater and less than 50 µm is superior, while environmental impact is reduced.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">For example, in the method for producing fine paper powder of the present invention, preferably, the angle of inclination of the grooves of the first pulverizing rollers with respect to axes of rotation of the first pulverizing rollers is greater than or equal to 5° and less than or equal to 45°, whereas the angle of inclination of the grooves of the second pulverizing rollers with respect to axes of rotation of the second pulverizing rollers is greater than or equal to 45° and less than or equal to 85°.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Further, in the method for producing fine paper powder of the present invention, preferably, bottom portions of<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the grooves of the first pulverizing rollers and the second pulverizing rollers are of a circular arc shape when viewed from the side.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In this case, although there is a tendency for fine paper powder to become collected in and clog the grooves of the first pulverizing rollers and the second pulverizing rollers, thereby worsening pulverizing efficiency, by making the bottom portions of the grooves circular arc shaped when viewed from the side, clogging of the grooves can effectively be prevented.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The resin composition containing fine paper powder of the present invention is characterized by a mixture of fine paper powder having an average particle diameter of 25 µm or greater and less than 50 µm obtained according to the aforementioned method for producing fine paper powder, mixed with at least one resin selected from the group consisting of polyethylene, polypropylene, an olefin-based elastomer, polystyrene, an acrylonitrile-styrene copolymer synthetic resin, an acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer synthetic resin, nylon, polybutylene terephthalate, and polyethylene terephthalate, wherein a weight ratio of the fine paper powder lies within a range of from 50% to 60% by weight.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In accordance with the resin composition containing fine paper powder of the present invention, because fine paper powder having an average particle diameter of 25 µm or<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> greater and less than 50 µm is contained therein, when a molding process is performed using the resin composition containing fine paper powder, transferability is excellent and therefore high quality molded products with good yield can be obtained.</p><heading id="h0007">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0022" num="0022"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is an outline view showing a fine pulverizing apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is an outline view showing the interior of a first vertical roller mill;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates respective side surface views, showing (a) a first pulverizing roller and (b) a second pulverizing roller.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0008">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0023" num="0023">An embodiment of the method for producing fine paper powder according to the present invention shall be described below with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The present method for producing fine paper powder includes a coarse grinding step and fine pulverizing steps, for pulverizing raw material waste paper until a fine paper powder having an average particle diameter of 25 µm or greater and less than 50 µm is obtained. Among such waste paper products may be included various types of waste paper<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> from newspapers and magazines, waste paper from printed matter, waste wrapping paper, discarded cardboard boxes, office paper, etc., broken and damaged sheets that occur upon manufacturing of virgin paper, cutting wastage from magazines and the like, grinding powders, shredder scraps, etc. Such waste papers typically are discarded in great amounts from offices, publishing houses, manufacturing companies and the like, and are valued as having a substantially zero negative effect on the environment. The average particle diameter of paper powder was measured by a laser diffraction-type particle size distribution measuring instrument (Mastersizer S Model, made by Marvern Instruments Ltd.).</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">By means of the coarse grinding step, using a coarse grinding machine such as a roll crusher, a hammer crusher, a cutter mill or the like, waste paper is ground into paper cuttings of a few millimeters to several tens centimeters square, and more preferably 2 to 4 millimeters square. In the case that the waste paper comes from damaged or discarded paper in rolls or sheet form, a cutting machine may be used as the coarse pulverizer. Further, in the case that the waste paper is already below several mm square, such as grindings from ground up books, shredder scraps or the like, the coarse grinding step may not be necessary.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The fine pulverizing step is a step by which the coarsely ground paper obtained in the coarse grinding step<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> is finely pulverized to obtain fine paper powder having an average particle diameter of 25 µm or greater and less than 50 µm. Herein, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the fine pulverizing step is carried out using a fine pulverizing apparatus in which two vertical roller mills 10, 20 are connected in series. Such a vertical roller mill is representative of roller mills, and is a roller type grinder, which may also simply be referred to as a "roller mill" in general.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the first fine pulverizing step, the coarsely ground paper obtained in the coarse grinding step is finely pulverized using the first vertical roller mill 10 in order to obtain fine paper powder having an average particle diameter of 50 µm or greater and less than 150 µm. The coarsely ground paper obtained in the coarse grinding step is supplied to the interior of a pulverization chamber 11 of the first vertical roller mill 10. More specifically, via a supply hopper (raw material supply port) 12 and a supply screw 13, paper particles are supplied to the interior of the pulverization chamber (housing) 11. Although not shown, the paper particles are supplied at a constant rate into the hopper 12 using a rotary valve, a screw feeder, or the like.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the first vertical roller mill 10 comprises a rotary table 14 disposed inside the cylindrically shaped pulverization chamber 11 and which is driven rotatably by a motor (not shown), and a plurality of<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> vertically oriented first pulverizing rollers 15, which are arranged and spaced at given intervals in the direction of rotation of the rotary table 14. The first pulverizing rollers 15 are free rollers on which loads are imposed toward the rotary table by means of hydraulic pressure, springs or the like, and which rotate in following relation to rotation of the rotary table 14. Accompanying rotation of the rotary table 14, the first pulverizing rollers 15 press against the inner circumferential wall surface of the pulverization chamber 11, so that paper particles are bitten between the lands 15b of the first pulverizing rollers 15 and the inner circumferential wall surface of the pulverization chamber 11 in order to pulverize the paper particles.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3(a)</figref>, helical grooves 15a are recessed into the outer circumferential surface of each of the first pulverizing rollers 15. The grooves 15a are inclined with respect to an axis of rotation L1 of the first pulverizing roller 15, wherein the angle of inclination θ1 preferably is greater than or equal to 5° and less than or equal to 45°, and more preferably is greater than or equal to 5° and less than or equal to 30°. In the present embodiment, the angle of inclination θ1 is 10°. In this manner, the angle of inclination θ1 of the grooves 15a is small, with the grooves 15a being oriented roughly in a vertical direction.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Incidentally, in normal grinding rollers such as those used when crushing foods or grains, the cross section of the grooves of such rollers are trapezoidal as viewed from the side and have corners at the bottom thereof. However, paper powder in particular easily adheres to such angled portions, and jamming or clogging of the grooves occurs rapidly. When clogging of the grooves occurs, grinding efficiency is reduced. Consequently, the bottoms of the grooves 15a are formed to be arcuate as viewed from the side, and it is difficult for clogging of the grooves 15a to occur.

Paper powder having a particle diameter of 50 µm or greater is impaled by the rotary vane and falls back down naturally, where the paper powder is repulverized.

Such a produced resin can be used suitably as a material for molding processes. The term weight ratio<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> implies a ratio with respect to the total weight of fine paper powder contained within the resin composition.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In the case that the contained amount of fine paper powder is less than 50% by weight, functional expressions are suppressed, such as the ability to absorb warping during molding based on a flexible structure having such paper particles therein, and environmental performance becomes degraded as well. Conversely, in the case that the contained amount of fine paper powder exceeds 60% by weight, the paper particles, which do not exhibit melt-fluidity by heating, hinder flowability of the resin, the likelihood for molding defects to occur becomes higher, energy consumption due to a rise in the molding pressure and the like increases, and environmental performance is degraded.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The resin is a resin composed of one or two or more selected from among any of polyethylene, polypropylene, an olefin-based elastomer, polystyrene, an AS resin (acrylonitrile-styrene copolymer synthetic resin), an ABS resin (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer synthetic resin), nylon, PBT (polybutylene terephthalate) and PET (polyethylene terephthalate). The weight ratio of the resin is 40% or greater by weight and less than 50% by weight.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Preferably, a surface active agent to improve mixing of the fine paper powder with the resin is included, whereby a surface modification treatment is implemented.<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> The surface active agent preferably is composed of one or two or more types selected from among any of various silane coupling agents, higher fatty acids such as stearic acid, various highly fatty acid esters, higher fatty acid amide, ethylene oligomers, polyethylene wax, maleic modified ester wax and maleic acid modified wax, and low molecular weight crystalline polyolefin. Silane coupling agents increase interaction between inorganic particles and the resin, thereby improving mixing with the resin by absorption of inorganic pigments contained in the paper. The other surface active agents also improve mixing by increasing interaction between the paper powder and the resin.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The surface active agent preferably is included within a range of 0.1% by weight or greater and 5% by weight or less. If the additive amount of the surface active agent is less than 0.1% by weight, sufficient improvement in the mixing effect cannot be obtained, whereas if the additive amount thereof exceeds 5% by weight, the possibility of adverse effects, such as exudation phenomena imparted to the surface of molded products, increases.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Further, preferably, a resin modifying agent also is contained therein. The resin modifying agent is composed of one or two or more selected from among any of maleic acid modified polyolefin, an olefin-maleic anhydride copolymer, maleic acid modified wax, and maleate modified wax. Such resin modifying agents mix well with resins, in particular<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> olefin resins, to introduce polar groups, thereby enhancing interaction with the paper powder and improving kneadability.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The resin modifying agent preferably is included within a range of 0.5% by weight or greater and 10% by weight or less. If the additive amount of the resin modifying agent is less than 0.5% by weight, the modifying effect thereof is poor. On the other hand, if the additive amount thereof exceeds 10% by weight, there is a possibility that the characteristics of strength and rigidity possessed inherently by the resin could be lost.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">A composition containing fine paper powder can be manufactured using an extruder. From an insertion port (hopper), which is disposed on a rear end portion of the extruder, fine paper powder and a resin are injected together with a surface active agent and/or a resin modifying agent as needed. The interior of the extruder is heated, and the resin and fine paper powder are mixed and kneaded by means of a rotating screw to produce a molten mixture in which fine paper powder is dispersed into the resin substantially uniformly. The molten mixture is extruded from a die (mold) that is disposed on a front end portion of the extruder, and a resin composition containing fine paper powder with a predetermined cross sectional shape is produced. Corresponding to the shape of the lip of the die, the resin composition containing fine paper powder<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> may be formed in the shape of pellets, plates, sheets or the like. A resin composition containing fine paper powder in the form of pellets can be used suitably as a material for various molding processes, such as injection molding, blow molding, inflation molding, vacuum molding, melt-compression molding, press molding and the like.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In this manner, because a fine paper powder having an average particle diameter of 25 µm or greater and less than 50 µm is included therein, when a molding process is performed using the resin composition containing fine paper powder, since transferability is superior, high quality molded products with good yield can be obtained. Further, because waste paper is used as a raw material, resources are used effectively, and since there is little environmental impact due to the waste paper pulverizing operations, environmental performance is excellent.</p><heading id="h0009">(Embodiment 1)</heading><p id="p0055" num="0055">Cut waste paper from paperboard was pulverized to 4 mm square by a cutter mill.

Using such materials, no abnormal strand breaking occurred during manufacturing of the pellets, and pellets could be stably manufactured. Using such pellets, a bowl-shaped molded product was obtained by performing injection molding. The molded article had a good appearance without spots due to poor dispersion of the fine paper powder therein. Also, a molded product in the shape of a box was injection molded, which exhibited only slight molding warpage therein and was favorable overall.</p><heading id="h0010">(Comparative Example 1)</heading><p id="p0057" num="0057">Cut waste paper from paperboard was pulverized to 4 mm square by a cutter mill.
