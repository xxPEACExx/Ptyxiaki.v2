State-of-the-art electrostatic actuating devices are configured with an angular degree of freedom and are driven by electrostatic forces. Electro-static comb drives can be divided to an in-plane comb drive ("IPCD") and vertical comb drive ("VCD").</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The IPCD and VCD actuators are used to generalize the working principle of a double-sided comb-drive actuator and to obtain an angular motion. They are constructed from two sets of combs, a moving part (henceforth rotor) and static part (stator) interlaced together, for example the MOEMS illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGs. 1A and 1B</figref>. The use of the two combs forms a free space capacitor, whereas the motion between the two combs changes the capacity of the free-space capacitor thus formed. Accordingly, upon applying a voltage difference between the stator and rotor combs, it induces vertical electrostatic force that creates a motion. However, in addition to the tilt motion, the voltage difference might also produce unwanted vertical and lateral motions of the mirror. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1C</figref> illustrates an example of a schematic cross-sectional view of the pure rotational actuation. In this example the forces that<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> cause vertical and lateral piston motions are canceled by the symmetric layout of the comb stators. The electrostatic forces are generated in the gaps between the combs shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1B</figref>. Since the capacity of a capacitor as described above is mainly influenced by its geometric shape, the dimensions of the combs strongly influence the obtained electrostatic force. A larger electrostatic force can be acquired when the aspect ratio increases (the aspect ratio is defined as the ratio between the height of the comb and the distance between every pair of adjacent teeth comprised in the comb).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Several methods are known in the art for fabricating VCD. These prior art methods can generally be segmented to methods for fabricating the VCD from a two device layer wafers, which may be considered as a "self aligned" mode and methods for fabricating each of the combs of the VCD separately, using a different wafer followed by bonding the two (rotor and stator) wafers to create a single VCD. An example of such a self aligned mode for fabricating a VCD is described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6713367B"><text>US 6,713,367</text></patcit>. The method described by this publication includes the steps of etching in a semiconductor wafer a first comb with a coarse set of teeth, then a second semiconductor wafer is bonded to the first set of teeth, and another set of teeth is etched in the second wafer with teeth overlapping the teeth in the first comb. Even though both top and bottom comb teeth of the VCD actuator are defined by a single fabrication mask, the difficulty of this method lies in the fact that it highly depends upon the accuracy of the machine to obtain sufficiently accurate alignment. The problems associated with wafers' bonding method are described in length by <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Jin-Woo Cho et al in "Electrostatic 1D Micro Scanner with Vertical Combs for HD resolution Display", Proc.

The DSOI wafer typically comprises either a substrate and two active layers or a substrate and one active layer, wherein the substrate itself is used as one of the two active layers. The active layer(s) and the substrate are bonded together before the starting of the fabrication process. The DSOI presented in this figure has (from bottom to top) a first active layer 110, an oxide layer 115, a second active layer 120, an oxide layer 125 and a silicon substrate 130. Each of the three semiconductor layers, i.e. first active layer 110, second active layer 120 and substrate 130, is electrically isolated from the other by the respective oxide layer. Oxide layer 115 is located between the first and second active layers, and oxide layer 125 is located between the second active layer and the substrate. Each active layer may have a thickness of few to few tens of microns, whereas the oxide layers are typically narrower than the active layers and their thickness changes from less than a micron to few microns.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The steps of a process used according to the present invention for fabricating a comb structure for vertical comb drive are demonstrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2A- 2F</figref>. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the process exemplified herein is one example of fabricating a comb structure for vertical comb drive out of several processes or certain variations in the process described herein,<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> that can be carried out without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">All dimensions of the respective layers and of resulting product of the process should be understood as being illustrative for demonstration purposes only. A typical wafer 200 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref> which comprises two active layers 210 and 220, a substrate layer (handle) 230 and two oxide layers 215 and 225. Oxide layer 215 separates the first active layer 210 from the second active layer 220 whereas a second oxide layer 225 separates the second active layer 220 from substrate 230.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The first step of the process is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2B</figref>, where the first active layer 210 has been etched by applying a dry etch step, or by applying any other suitable process that is known in the art <i>per se</i>, in order to form the teeth of stator 240. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the present invention should not be considered as being limited to which of the active layers would function as the rotor and which as the stator, although in this example active layer 210 is designated to be the stator and active layer 220 is designated to be the rotor. During this step, and in addition to etching the stator teeth, markers 250 and 250' are also being etched. Since this Fig, illustrates a view side of the wafer, only two cavities that are adapted to be used as markers are shown. Preferably, more markers' cavities are used (and located on a different longititudal axis), to provide a two dimensional match of the mask to be prepared for the etching of the second active layer. The etching of the markers' cavities is carried out up to the oxide layer and is preferably carried out together with the etching of the stator's teeth. The markers' cavities may be etched at pre-defined locations, but in addition or in the alternative, they may be etched in non<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> pre-determined locations but preferably close to the edges of the first active layer (so as not to interfere with the etching of stator 240). In the next step, shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2C</figref>, upon etching the markers' cavities 250 and 250' and stator comb teeth 240, a glass layer 260 is bonded to the first active layer 210. Once wafer 200 is bonded to the glass layer 260, the substrate layer 230 and oxide layer 225 are removed as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2D</figref>, thereby revealing the second active layer 220. The next step is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2E</figref> where two cavities (270 and 270') were etched in active layer 220. These two cavities are centered approximately in places that would match the centers of the markers' cavities etched in the first active layer. According to the present invention, the accuracy in etching cavities 270 and 270' is not highly important because these cavities are used for providing reference point(s) for etching the second active layer. Once cavities 270 and 270' are etched, markers' cavities 250 and 250' become visible when viewing them from the top surface of the second active layer, i.e. from the surface of the cavities' top apertures, because the oxide layer 215 is very thin hence it is practically transparent. The next step is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2F</figref>, where the locations of the markers' cavities are used as reference points for preparing a mask to be used for etching active layer 220 in the exact designated places, so that a precise etching of the rotor comb teeth 280 is achieved. Applying the suggested method allows fabricating a vertical comb drive with an accuracy that is higher than any accuracy that may be achieved while implementing another fabricating method known in the art. The aspect ratio obtained while using the above method was higher than 1:40 and the accuracy obtained better than ±0.5µm.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIGs. 3A and 3B</figref> illustrate two examples of deploying markers' cavities according to an embodiment of the invention in a DSOI wafer. These FIGs. show wafer 300 in which various cavities were etched (but without showing the etched rotor comb). The illustrated DSOI wafer, comprises a first active layer 310, a second active layer 320, an oxide layer 315 separating between the first and the second active layers, a glass layer 360 bonded to the active layer 310. Cavities 350, 353 and two other cavities (not shown in this FIG.) are used as marker cavities. Once they are etched, cavities 370, 373, 376 and 379 are etched in the second active layer at locations that essentially match those of marker cavities 350, 373 and the other two marker cavities in the first layer. The etching of cavities 370, 373, 376 and 379 is carried out until reaching oxide layer 315. Thereafter, the exact locations of the centers of the marker cavities are identified and compared each with the centers of the respective cavities etched in the second layer. Upon determining the match between the centers of the marker cavities and the second layer cavities, any offset may be calculated and based thereon, the mask for etching the second layer device is prepared.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A similar process is described in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B</figref> where the 4 marker cavities (of which only 350 is shown in this FIG.) and their corresponding cavities of the second layer, are located at different positions to enable different way of obtaining reference points for preparing the mask that would allow etching the second active layer with the required accuracy.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56985272" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Verfahren zum Herstellen einer MOEMS-Vorrichtung aus einem DSOI-Substrat, wobei DSOI für doppelte Aktivschicht Silizium auf Isolator steht, wobei das Substrat zwei aktive Schichten (210, 220; 310, 320) beinhaltet, die durch eine isolierende Schicht (215; 315) getrennt sind, wobei das Verfahren aufweist:
