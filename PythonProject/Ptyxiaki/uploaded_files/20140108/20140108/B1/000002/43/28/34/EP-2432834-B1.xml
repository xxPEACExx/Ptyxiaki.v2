Higher extrusion rates may be readily obtained by increasing the rate of revolution of the extruder screw. However, this technique is subject to limitations imposed by the viscoelastic properties of the polymer substrate. Thus, at very high extrusion rates an unacceptable amount of thermal decomposition of the polymer can result. Further, extrudates having a rough surface are often obtained which can lead to formation of an undesirable pattern on the surface of the extrudate.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US3125547A"><text>Blatz, U.S. Pat. No. 3,125.547</text></patcit>, it is disclosed that the use of 0.01-2.0 wt.% of a fluorocarbon polymer that is in a fluid state at the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> process temperature, such as a fluoroelastomer, will reduce die pressure in extrusions of non-fluorinated polymers such as high and low density polyethylenes and other polyolefins. Further, use of this additive allows significant increase in extrusion rates without melt fracture.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">More recently, improved fluoropolymer process aid compositions have been disclosed in, for example, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US4855360A"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 4.855,360</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6642310B2"><text>6,642.310 B2</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US20060025523A1"><text>US 2006/0025523 A1</text></patcit>. These compositions contain both a fluoropolymer and an interfacial agent such as a polyalkylene oxide or a polycaprolactone. The number average molecular weight (Mn) of these interfacial agents may be anything between about 400 to over 200,000. Low Mn (&lt;5000) polyethylene glycol (PEG) works especially well in some process aids to reduce the time required to eliminate melt fracture of extrudable compositions, However, the low Mn PEG is moderately soluble in water which can cause massing problems in humid environments. Low Mn PEG is also susceptible to production of very low molecular weight fragments through thermally induced oxidative decomposition, making it potentially unstable during processing of the non-fluorinated melt processible polymer. These very low molecular weight PEG fragments can impart undesirable odor or taste characteristics in the extrudate, or cause unreliable printing or sealing of extruded films as the fragments bloom out of the polyethylene host polymer.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Thus there is a need for a process aid composition which reduces melt fracture in non-fluorinated melt processible polymers without massing or decomposing.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">It has been surprisingly discovered that a process aid comprising a fluoroelastomer of Mooney viscosity and at least two different interfacial agents of specific number average molecular weight, rapidly reduces or eliminates melt fracture in non-fluorinated melt processible polymers<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> without massing problems or excessive thermal decomposition of the process aid.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention is a process aid composition comprising.

By the term non-fluonnated" it is meant that the ratio of fluorine atoms to carbon atoms present in the polymer is less than 1 1 The non-fluorinated melt-processible polymers that may be employed with the process aid<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> compositions of this invention may be selected from a variety of polymer types. Such polymers include hydrocarbon polymers having melt indexes (measured according to ASTM D1238 at 190° C, using a 2160 g weight) of 5.0 g/10 minutes or less, preferably 2.0 g/10 minutes or less. The hydrocarbon polymers may be elastomeric copolymers of ethylene, propylene, and optionally a non-conjugated diene monomer, for example 1,4-hexadiene. In general, hydrocarbon polymers also include any thermoplastic hydrocarbon polymer obtained by the homopolymerization or copolymerization of a monoolefin of the formula CH<sub>2</sub>=CHR, where R is H or an alkyl radical, usually of not more than eight carbon atoms. In particular, this invention is applicable to polyethylene, of both high density and low density, for example, polyethylenes having a density within the range 0,85 to 0.97 g/cm<sup>3</sup>; polypropylene; polybutene-1, poly(3-methylbutene); poly(methylpentene): and copolymers of ethylene and alpha-olefins such as propylene, butene-1. hexerte-1, octene-1, decene-9. and octadecene. Hydrocarbon polymers may also include vinyl aromatic polymers such as polystyrene. Because specific hydrocarbon polymers exhibit differing melt characteristics, the practice of this invention may have greater utility in some hydrocarbon polymers than in others. Thus, hydrocarbon polymers such as polypropylene and branched polyethylene that are not of high molecular weight have favorable melt flow characteristics even at lower temperatures, so that surface roughness and other surface defects can be avoided by adjustment of extrusion conditions. These hydrocarbon polymers may only require the use of the process aid compositions of this invention under unusual and exacting extrusion condition. However, other polymers such as high molecular weight, high density polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene copolymers, high molecular weight polypropylene, and propylene copolymers with other olefins, particularly those with narrow molecular weight distributions, do not permit this degree of freedom in variation of extrusion conditions. It is particularly with these resins that improvements<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> in the surface quality of the extruded product are obtained with the process aid compositions of this invention</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Preferably the non-fluonnated melt processible polymer is a polyolefin selected from the group consisting of linear low density polyethylene. high molecular weight, high density polyethylene, high molecular weight polypropylene, and propylene copolymers with other olefins. particularly those with narrow molecular weight distributions Most preferably the polyolefin is linear low density polyethylene</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Fluoroelastomers useful in the process aid compositions of this invention are fluoropolymers that are normally in the fluid state at room temperature and above, i.e fluoropolymers which have values of T<sub>g</sub> below room temperature and which exhibit little or no crystallinity at room temperature It is preferred but not essential, to employ fluoroelastomers having a fluonne to hydrogen ratio of at least 15 Fluorinated monomers which may be copolymenzed to yield suitable fluoroelastomers include, but are not limited to vinylidene fluoride hexafluoropropylene, chlorotrifluoroethylene, tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoroalkyl perfluorovinyl ethers Specific examples of the fluoroelastomers which may be employed include, but are not limited to copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and a comonomer selected from hexafluoropropylene. chlorotrifluoroethylene, 1-hydropentafluoroprapylene and 2-hydropentafluoropropylene, copolymers of vinylidene fluoride, tetrafluoroethylene and a comonomer selected from hexafluoropropylene 1-hydropentafluoropropylene or 2-hydropentafluoropropylene and copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene, propylene and, optionally vinylidene fluoride, all of which are known in the art In some cases these copolymers may also include bromine-containing comonomers as taught in Apotheker and Krusic, <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US4035565A"><text>U S Patent 4,035 565</text></patcit>, or terminal iodo-groups, as taught in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US4243770A"><text>U S Patent 4 243,770</text></patcit> The latter patent also discloses the incorporation of iodo group-containing fluoroolefin comonomers into fluoroelastomers When fluormated monomers are present in these<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> copolymers in certain molar ratios, the glass transition temperature of the polymer is near or below 0°C, and the compositions are useful elastomers that are readily available articles of commerce.
