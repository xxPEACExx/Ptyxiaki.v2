Consequently, since the aide plate is no longer required, the clutch-width can be taken that much, resulting in an increased torque. In addition, the construction can be simplified and assembly of the ont-way clutch becomes easy.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Since the roller movement preventive means for preventing the movement of the roller in the axial direction, is installed on one end of the springs, the movement of the roller in the axial direction to limited. By this, as the roller fitted into the window of the cage is moved in the axial direction, It is possible to prevent the cage from being moved in the axial direction.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Since the cage movement preventive means, which is on the opposite side to the roller movement<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Preventive means In the axial direction and which Prevents the cage from dropping off in the axial direction an the opposite side to the other end of the spring in the axial direction, is formed in the cage, it is possible to prevent the movement of the cage in both axial directions. That is, the movement of the cage in prevented by the roller movement preventive mama in one direction of the axial direction, and by the cage movement preventive means in the other direction of the axial direction.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Further, since one end of the spring is secured to the outer race, and the other end is bent to the roller side and is used as the roller movement preventive memo, it is possible to fix the spring and prevent the movement of the roller in the axial direction by an inexpensive and easy processing.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Further, it is possible to easily form the cage movement preventive means by forming the flange part or extension part on the cage, or installing a retaining ring on the cage.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Further, since the circumferential width of the window of the cage is smaller them the roller diameter, it is possible to prevent the roller from dropping off in the redial direction when the clutch le being conveyed. That is, the drop-off of rollers in the inside diameter side can be prevented even before installing the inner race, and due to the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> Synergetic effect of forming the cage movement preventive means, there is not a case that the roller is dropped off even when the clutch is conveyed without installing the inner race. Thus, the installation of the inner race is also easily achieved.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Further, since the roller-type one-way clutch is installed on the relative member on the side where the cage movement preventive means is formed, it is possible to prevent the cage, roller and spring from falling out in the axial direction during their use.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Further, a free relative rotation of the cage with respect to the outer race enables to definitely actuate the roller-type one-way clutch, without obstructing the movement of the roller, even if the circumferential width of the window of the cage is smaller than the roller diameter.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Since annular shoulders with which a flange part of the cage engages are installed to the edge part in the axial direction of the inner surface of the outer race, it is not necessary to reduce the axial length of the outer race as much as the thickness of the flange part, and the axial length of the outer race can therefore be secured.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In addition, since dropping-off of rollers or springs can be prevented in the axial and radial directions, all the rollers definitely engage with<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> each other even in environmental Conditions with large vibration such as two-wheelers, etc.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DROCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0025" num="0025"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a front view that shows a roller-type one-way clutch according to an embodiment of the present invention and shows the condition before engaging;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-ooctional view taken on line A-A of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a front view as seen from the rear side of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIG. 4</b></figref> is a front view that shown the roller-type one-way clutch according to the embodiment of the present invention, showing the condition at the time of engaging;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross-seational view taken on line B-B of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 6</figref> ;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 6</figref> is a front view as seen from the rear side of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 7</figref> is a partial front view of the roller-type one-way clutch before mounting an inner race;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 8</figref> is a partial side view of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 7</figref> as seen from the inside diameter side;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 9</figref> is a partial front view for explaining the actuation or the roller-type one-way clutch, showing the idling state of the inner race;<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></li><li>10 is a partial front view for explaining the actuation of the roller-type one-way clutch, showing the interval in which the inner race rotates from idling to reversing;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 11</figref> is a partial front view for explaining the actuation of the rollex-type one-way clutch, showing the state in which the inner race reverses;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 12</figref> is a front view that shows a roller-type one-way clutch us a variant of the embodiment according to the present Invention, showing the condition before engaging:</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 13</figref> is a front view that shows a roller-type one-way clutch as another a variant of the embodiment according to the present invention, showing the condition at the time of engaging</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 14</figref> is a oross-seational view taken on line D-O-D of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 13</figref>; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 15</figref> is a partially enlarged view of <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 14</figref>.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0026" num="0026">An embodiment of the invention will hereinafter be described in detail with reference to the drawings.

The flange part 17 functions as the cage movement preventive means for preventing the cage 6 from droppin-off in the axial direction by engaging with the shoulder 13 of the outer race 1. since the outside diameter of the shoulder 13 is slighter larger than the outside diameter of the flange part 17 of the cage 6, a minute clearance is present in the radial direction between the shoulder 13 and flange part 17.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Consequently, since it is no longer necessary to reduce the axial length of the outer race 1 by the thickness of the flange part 17, the axial length of the outer race 1 can be sufficiently secured, and an extra allowance is provided in the engaging allowance<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> of the cam surface 12 and the roller 3.

Accordingly, drop-off of the cage to any side of the axial direction does not occur. Also, since the roller-type one-way clutch 30 is installed on the relative member on the side where the cage movement preventive means is formed, it is possible to prevent the cage 6, roller 3, and spring 5 from falling out in the axial direction during their use.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Since the flange part 17 or extension part 25, which to on the opposite side to the tab 16 as the roller movement preventive means in the axial direction and which functions as the cage movement preventive means for preventing the cage 6 from dropping off on the opposite side of the other and of the spring 5 in the axial direction, is formed in the cage 6, it is possible to prevent the movement of the cage 6 in both axial directions.
