Optocoupler circuit 10 may be represented as including parasitic capacitors 12, 14 connected between the input section 16 of optocoupler circuit 10, and the output section 18 of optocoupler circuit 10. Line 30 represents an isolation barrier over which there is no electrical contact.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Referring next to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, optocoupler circuit 10 may be controlled by a switch (SW1) 22 connected in parallel with photo LED 20. In one embodiment, using switch 22 to control photo LED 20 provides immunity and/or protection from common mode transients when switch 22 is connected in parallel with photo LED 20. Optocoupler circuit 10 includes an anode 24 of photo LED 20 connected to a power supply 26 via a decoupling capacitor 28 (C<sub>decoupler</sub>). In one embodiment, decoupling capacitor 28 may have a capacitance of about 0.1 micro-farads (µf). Opening switch 22 causes current to flow into photo LED 20 and the series resistor 32 to ground 34, switching photo LED 20 into an active or "on" state. Closing switch 22 causes current to flow through the switch 22 and the series resistor 32 (R<sub>series</sub>) to ground 34, and shunts current flow away from photo LED 20, thus, switching photo LED 20 to the off state. In one embodiment, series resistor 32 may have a resistance value of about 169 ohms, although higher or lower resistance values may be used for series resistor 32, provided that the current is directed through series resistor 32 rather than through photo LED 20.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Any current induced into anode 24 due to excessive common mode voltage transients are provided a direct path to power supply 26 and decoupling capacitor 28, whether switch 22 is in either the on or off state. Accidental activation or deactivation of photo LED 20 is thus prevented.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Any current induced into cathode 36 due to excessive common mode voltage transients can cause the optocoupler 10 to malfunction. The optocoupler circuit 10 may be analyzed under two different circumstances, one where current flows into the cathode 36 and the other when the current flows out of the cathode 36 of the photo LED 20. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, voltage transients induce current I cathode_from from cathode 36 of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> photo LED 20. If switch 22 is open, photo LED 20 is in the conductive state and current is flowing through photo LED 20. Current I cathode_from flowing from cathode 36 through coupling capacitor 14 can add current to photo LED 20, which is the already in the conductive state. Thus, current I<sub>cathode_from</sub> flowing from cathode 36 through coupling capacitor 14 cannot cause false triggering of optocoupler circuit 10. If, however, switch 22 is in the closed state, current I<sub>cathode_from</sub> drawn from cathode 36 of the photo LED can flow through switch 22. Switch 22 may have resistance in a range of a few hundred milliohms, which is common in electrical switches. Because of the low resistance value of the closed switch 22, the current flowing from cathode 36 has to be large for photo LED 20 to be activated by I cathode_from. In other words, the voltage drop across switch 22 caused by I<sub>cathode_from</sub> has to be as high as the forward bias voltage V<sub>F</sub> of the photo LED 20, in order for photo LED 20 to be unintentionally activated. The current through parasitic input-output capacitor 14 has to be extremely high, e.g., in the range of a few amperes, for an optocoupler circuit to false trigger, i.e., for the switch 22 to drop a voltage as high as V<sub>F</sub> of the photo LED 20. Typical values for parasitic input-output capacitance of optocouplers are in the pF range. Thus, the common mode voltage transient may have to be in the range of thousands of KV/µs for an accidental false triggering of photo LED 20 to occur.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref> shows voltage transients inducing a current I<sub>cathode_into</sub> flowing into cathode 36 of photo LED 20. Current I<sub>cathode_into</sub> flows into the series resistor 32 and adds to the voltage drop across series resistor 32 to decrease the voltage drop across the photo LED 20 and may cause photo LED 20 to turn off. Thus, there may be a tendency for photo LED 20 in an on state to switch to an off state unintentionally. For example, an increase in voltage drop in a range of a few tenths of a volt across the series resistor 32 can cause the photo LED to turn off unintentionally. Current through parasitic input-output capacitor 14 in the range of a few milliamperes can cause this additional voltage drop to occur across series resistor 32. A typical value of parasitic input-output capacitance of optocouplers is in a range of a few pico-farads (pF). A relatively small common mode voltage transient, e.g., a few KV/µs, can result in milliamperes of current and cause an accidental turnoff of a turned on photo LED 20. The situation of current flowing into cathode 36 of photo LED 20 when photo LED is turned on is of concern as<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> relatively small common mode voltage transients can cause the optocoupler 10 to malfunction. If switch 22 is closed, current flowing into cathode 36 of photo LED 20 can flow through switch 22 and into decoupling capacitor 28. The voltage drop across switch 22 induced by I<sub>cathode_into</sub> can increase the reverse bias voltage on photo LED 20, and hence cannot affect the turned off state of photo LED 20.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref> shows an embodiment of an optocoupler circuit 10 that provides additional or increased immunity or protection from common mode voltage transients. A second capacitor, or cathode capacitor 38 (C<sub>Cathode</sub>) is connected to the cathode 36 of the photo LED 20. Capacitor 38 is wired in series with a second switch 40 (SW2) and a current limiting resistor 42 (R<sub>limit</sub>) connected to ground 34. In one exemplary embodiment, cathode capacitor 38 may have a capacitance value of about 0.1 micro-farad (µf), and current limiting resistor 42 may have a resistance value of about 15 ohm (Ω). The use of capacitor 38, second switch 40 and current limiting resistor 42 can prevent unintentional turnoff for an optocoupler circuit 10 due to common mode voltage transients.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In order to increase common mode immunity of the optocoupler circuit 10 when photo LED 20 is on, cathode capacitor 38 cannot be connected directly between cathode terminal 36 of the photo LED 20 and ground 34, as it would repeatedly charge and discharge every time the photo LED switches state. Cathode capacitor 38 is only required when photo LED 20 is in the on state and switch 22 is open. Hence cathode capacitor 38 is connected in series with a switch 40 that operates complementary to switch 22, i.e., switch 40 is open when switch 22 is closed (photo LED is off), and switch 40 is closed when switch 22 is open (photo LED is on), thereby preventing the capacitor from discharging. Switches 22, 40 may be any type of mechanical or electronic switch. In at least one embodiment switches 22, 40 may be a complementary transistor pair which has a common input and interconnections such that one transistor is on when the other is off, and vice versa.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The additional switched R-C series circuit, i.e., cathode capacitor 38 and limiting resistor 42 can be used when switch 40 is closed. During the first switching<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> event, switch 22 is in an open position and switch 40 in a closed position. Cathode capacitor 38 charges during an initial activation of photo LED 20. To limit the peak current that can flow through photo LED 20 and cathode capacitor 38 during the initial charge, limiting resistor 42 is connected in series with cathode capacitor 38 and ground 34. If switches 22, 40 are not break-before-make type switches, then limiting resistor 42 may have a resistance value selected to limit the peak current through switches 22, 40 to a desired level. The charging of cathode capacitor 38 initially may result in peak current in the photo LED 20, which may cause photo LED 20 to malfunction or fail. The resistance value of resistor 42 should be selected to limit the peak current in photo LED 20 within specified ratings of photo LED 20. After cathode capacitor 38 charges, cathode capacitor 38 can remain charged. Thereafter, current flow through photo LED 20 is determined by series resistor 32. In one embodiment, cathode capacitor 38 may be a capacitor with low leakage current.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">When switch 22 is open, a current I<sub>cathode_from</sub> flows from power supply 26, decoupling capacitor 28 and cathode capacitor 38 through the parasitic capacitor 14. Current flowing from cathode capacitor 38 would be minimal as most of the current would be drawn from power supply 26 and capacitor 28 through the activated photo LED 20, since photo LED 20 provides a path with the least impedance. The common mode immunity in this case will be unaffected by series R-C circuit 44, and optocoupler circuit 10 will retain high common mode transient immunity ratings.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the opposite case, current I<sub>cathode_into</sub> is flowing into cathode terminal 36 from parasitic capacitance 14. Optocoupler circuit 10 includes photo LED 20 activated by switch 22 when open, with current flowing into cathode 36. Optocoupler circuits shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">FIGS. 2 through 4</figref> had lower immunity from common mode voltage transients when current I cathode_into flowed into cathode 36 - i.e., any current flowing into cathode 36 of the photo LED 20 would have flowed through series resistor 32 and increased the voltage drop across it, potentially causing photo LED 20 to turn off. In that case, a common mode voltage transient of a few KV/µs could have cause accidental turnoff of photo LED 20.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">With the addition of series R-C circuit 44, current flowing into cathode 36 of the photo LED has two paths to ground 34, one path through series resistor 32 and another path through series R-C circuit 44, i.e., cathode capacitor 38, switch 40 and limiting resistor 42. Most of the current flows through series R-C circuit 44, the path with lower impedance defined by cathode capacitor 38, switch 40 and limiting resistor 42. Series R-C circuit 44 can have a characteristic impedance that is about 1/100<sup>th</sup> that of series resistor 32. Thus, series R-C circuit 44 connected in parallel with series resistor 32 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref> will require a I<sub>cathode_into</sub> current about 100 times greater than the current I<sub>cathode_into</sub> for the original circuit <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, in order to generate the same voltage drop to cause a malfunction. Thus, the optocoupler circuit 10 of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref> provides immunity from common mode voltage transients that are about 100 times greater than the circuits shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">FIGS. 2-4</figref>. Optocoupler circuit 10 with series R-C circuit 44 connected between cathode 36 and ground 34 thus provides improved common mode transient immunity, an increase from several KV/µs to several hundreds of KV/µs.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Series R-C circuit 44 thus provides optocoupler circuit 10 the ability to function at increased levels of common mode voltage transients.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Referring next to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 6</figref>, a gate driver board circuit 50 for use in a VSD illustrates an exemplary embodiment and implementation of optocoupler circuit 10 with series R-C circuit 44.
