The anode is made by the batches of profiles which must be anodized. To these two electrodes a potential difference is imposed, through a direct current generator connected to the cathode with a negative sign and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> to the anode with a positive sign. In such conditions, a process is triggered of surface oxidation of the aluminium immersed in the basin, which generates so a hard and compact layer to protect it from aggressions of environmental agents.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The relation which determines the oxide layer that will form substantially depends on the current density value (expressed in A/dm<sup>2</sup>) to which the profiles immersed in the basin are exposed, and on the permanence time in the basin.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Obviously, just from the complexity of the hooking of the pieces in order to guarantee a suitable and individual specific electrical conductivity for this galvanic treatment, drawbacks derive meaning a loss of time, substantial manpower, handling of material to be treated in the different phases of processing and storing of themselves.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The anodizing station also comprises, in order to get an acceptable productivity, in general a rather important an
