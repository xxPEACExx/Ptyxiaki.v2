More particularly, the present disclosure relates to barbed sutures and systems and methods for affixing barbs on the suture.</p><heading id="h0003"><i>Background of Related Art</i></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Barbed sutures are generally made of the same materials as conventional sutures and offer several advantages for closing wounds compared with conventional sutures. A barbed suture includes an elongate body that has one or more spaced barbs that project from the surface of the elongate body along the length of the suture. The barbs are arranged to allow passage of the barbed suture in one direction through tissue but resist movement of the barbed suture in the opposite direction. Thus, one advantage of barbed sutures has been the provision of a non-slip attribute.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Barbed sutures are known for use in countless procedures. The number of barbs called for on a particular suture may be influenced by the type of tissue being sutured, the size of the wound and/or the strength required to hold the wound closed. Like a conventional suture, a barbed suture may be inserted into tissue using a surgical needle.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In some circumstances, a specific configuration of barbs on the exterior surface of the suture is preferred to achieve optimal wound closure holding for a particular wound. However, in other circumstances, where the wound or tissue repair needed is relatively small, a reduced number of barbs may be desired. In other circumstances, a two-way or bidirectional barbed suture is desirable where the barbs over a portion of the suture permit passing of the suture in one direction and barbs over another portion of the suture permit passing of the suture in a second direction to perform a tight closing stitch.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Various methods of forming barbs on sutures have been proposed. For example, barbs have been formed using mechanical cutting, laser cutting, injection molding, stamping, extrusion and the like. However, such methods may be difficult or costly to achieve the desired result with respect to getting the arrangement of barbs in a configuration needed for the appropriate procedure and for doing so in an efficient cost effective manner. These methods may also compromise the integrity of the suture as each relies on the suture for the material to create the barb.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20090248066A1"><text>US 2009/0248066 A1</text></patcit> discloses a system according to the preamble of claim 1.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, there is a continuing need for a system and method of forming barbed sutures that is less difficult, more effective and/or economical. There is also a continuing need for methods which are able to vary the size, the number, the location and/or the depth of the barbs. It would further be beneficial if the barb is not formed from the material making up the suture.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY</u></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">A system and method for affixing barbs on a suture according to independent claim 1 and claim 3 are provided.

barbed suture having at least one barb affixed along the length thereof. Referring now in detail to the drawings in which like reference numerals are applied to like elements in the various views, <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrate an example of a length of suture 10 having an elongate body 12 and a plurality of barbs 20 affixed thereto. Suture 10 has a proximal end 1 0a and distal end 1 0b. Either or both of proximal and distal ends 10a, 1 0b may include a needle (not shown). As shown, barbs 20 are formed projecting outward from elongate body 12 of suture 10 in a first direction, however, it is envisioned that a first set of barbs 20 may project in a first direction along a first portion of elongate body 12 and a second set of barbs 20 may project in a second direction along a second portion of elongate body 12, thereby forming a two-way or bidirectional barbed suture. Barbs 20<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> form an angle "α" (<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref>) of less than ninety degrees (90°) between barbs 20 and elongate body 12.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref>, suture 10 is formed of a mono filament thread. With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1B</figref>, as shown, suture 10 is formed of multifilament threads, e.g., a braided suture. As will become readily apparent from the following discussion, barbs 20 are particularly well suited for use with multifilament sutures. The braiding may be done by any method within the purview of those skilled in the art. Suture 10 may alternatively be formed of multifilament surgical fibers. The filaments and/or fibers used for forming suture 10 may be formed using any technique within the purview of those skilled in the art, such as, for example, extrusion or molding. In some embodiments, the suture may include a yarn made of more than one filament, which may contain multiple filaments of the same or different materials. Where suture 10 is made of multiple filaments, suture 10 may be made using any known technique such as, for example, braiding, weaving or knitting. The filaments may also be combined to produce a nonwoven suture. The filaments themselves may be drawn, oriented, crinkled, twisted, commingled or air entangled to form yarns as part of the suture forming process.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Suture 10 may be formed of degradable materials, non-degradable materials, or combinations thereof.
