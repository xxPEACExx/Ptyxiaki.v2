For example, in mobile devices, which are compact by nature, there has been a movement to replace traditional controls such as buttons or wheels with touch screen interfaces. By incorporating the controls into the touch screen, there is more flexibility in the design of the user interface and a larger portion of the device can be occupied by a viewable display.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Even with the enlarged displays on some mobile devices, it can be difficult for the device to accurately identify the user's intended touch point on the touch screen. In some cases, when a user is tapping quickly on the screen, such as when typing, during a touch the user's finger slides across the screen by some distance making the intended target difficult to detect. If the device is to presume that either the initial contact point or the release point is the target touch location, that may be incorrect as the actual target point may be somewhere between the two.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In other circumstances, the user may intentionally drag a finger across the screen. If, for example, the initially touches the screen at a first location, but intended to touch at a second location, the user may correct the touch point by dragging a finger across the screen towards the intended touch point. In that case, if the device presumes that the initial touch point or an intermediate point is the target touch point, the device may again inaccurately identify the target touch point.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As such, the identification of a user's intended target touch point on a touch screen is sometimes affected by the user's behavior while using the touch screen device.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Background art is provided in the following documents:</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US2010315366A1"><text>US 2010/315366 A1</text></patcit> describes a method for recognizing touch input in a touch screen by by checking whether the touched location is changed (step 215 in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2</figref>). If no change of the touched location is detected the released touch point is taken as input (step 245 in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2</figref> with [38]). If the touch location is changed it is differentiated between a small change which leads to the touch input start location being taken as input (step 235 in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2</figref> with [37]) and a greater change which leads to the recognition of a drag operation (step 250 in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2</figref> with [39]). <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP1914623A1"><text>EP 1 914 623 A1</text></patcit> describes a method for inputting text in a mobile terminal having a touch screen. When a touch-down is detected, the mobile terminal displays a character of the touch-down point and nearby characters in an enlarged size and indicates the character of the touch-down point in the enlarged display. If the user does not remove the finger from the touch screen (touch-up) but changes the position of the finger a dragging distance and direction is determined (step 140 in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2</figref> with [32]) and the touched location is changed according to the drag input (step 150 in <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2</figref> with [32]).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US2011007004A1"><text>US 2011/007004 A1</text></patcit> describes a software keyboard input method for implementing compound keys on an electronic device screen to assist a user in inputting text.

Portable electronic device 100 includes multiple components such as processor 102 that control the overall operation of portable electronic device 100. Communication functions, including data and voice<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> communications, are performed through communication subsystem 104. Data received by portable electronic device 100, if required, can be decompressed and decrypted by decoder 106. Communication subsystem 104 is configured to receive messages via and send messages through wireless network 150. Wireless network 150 may be any type of wireless network, including, but not limited to, data-centric wireless networks, voice-centric wireless networks, and dual-mode networks that support both voice and data communications over the same physical base stations. Portable electronic device 100 can be a battery-powered device and may include battery interface 142 for receiving one or more rechargeable batteries 144 or other portable energy supply devices.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Processor 102 also interacts with additional subsystems such as a Random Access Memory (RAM) 108, memory 110, display 112 with touch-sensitive overlay 114 connected to electronic controller 116 that together comprise touch-sensitive display or touch screen display 118, actuator 120, one or more force sensors 122, auxiliary input/output (I/O) subsystem 124, data port 126, speaker 128, microphone 130, short-range communications 132 and other device subsystems 134.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">User-interaction with the graphical user interface of personal electronic device 100 can be performed through touch-sensitive overlay 114. Information, such as text, characters, symbols, images, icons, and other items that may be displayed on a portable electronic device, can be displayed or rendered on touch-sensitive display 118 via processor 102.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">When a touch event is detected on touch-sensitive display 118, x and y coordinates of the touch event are determined, and the location of the touch may be associated with information displayed via a graphical user interface. Touch events can include touch down events, such as when a user initially presses a finger or other object (e.g., a stylus, or pen) against a surface of touch screen display 118, and touch up events, such a when a user lifts a finger or other object off a surface of touch screen 118. Each time a user interacts with touch screen display 118 (i.e., at each 'touch') there is both a touch down event and a touch up event.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Further information describing a detected touch, such as a contact area of the touch event, the pressure or force with which the touch is imparted on the touch screen display 118, or a touch path describing a number of contact points or continuous path between a touch down event and a touch up event, may be collected and provided to processor 102. Here, references to the contact area and the size of the contact area refer to the contact area and size of the contact area as<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> determined or detected by the portable electronic device, and may not precisely reflect the actual area physically contacted by a contact member. A touch can comprise one or more various actions, including, but not limited to, contact of or beyond a given pressure or other characteristic, contact including movement, contact over a period of time, and various combinations thereof.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Processor 102 may also interact with an accelerometer 136 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. Accelerometer 136 may include a cantilever beam with a proof mass and suitable deflection sensing circuitry. Accelerometer 136 can be used for detecting direction of gravitational forces or gravity-induced reaction forces acting on portable device 100.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">To identify a subscriber for network access according to the present disclosure, portable electronic device 100 can use Subscriber Identity Module or Removable User Identity Module (SIM/RUIM) card 138 inserted into SIM/RUIM interface 140 for communication with a network such as wireless network 150. Alternatively, user identification information may be programmed into memory 110 or retrieved from another data storage location.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Portable electronic device 100 also includes operating system 146 and software components 148 that are executed by processor 102 and are typically stored in a persistent, updatable storage medium such as memory 110 (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>). Additional applications may be loaded onto portable electronic device 100 through wireless network 150, auxiliary I/O subsystem 124, data port 126, short-range communications subsystem 132, or any other suitable device subsystem 134.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In use, a received signal such as a text message, e-mail message, or web page download is processed by communication subsystem 104 and input to processor 102. Processor 102 processes the received signal for output to display 112 or, alternatively, to auxiliary I/O subsystem 124. A subscriber may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, for example, which may be transmitted over wireless network 150 through communication subsystem 104. For voice communications, the overall operation of portable electronic device 100 is similar. Speaker 128 outputs audible information converted from electrical signals, and microphone 130 converts audible information into electrical signals for processing.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">A front view of portable electronic device 100 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>. Portable electronic device 100 includes housing 202 that supports touch screen display 118, mechanical or displayed buttons 204, and speaker 128.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Portable electronic device 100 includes one or more sensors for detecting a touch by a contact member, such as a finger, thumb, stylus, or other suitable object on touch screen display 118. The sensor(s) may be located below the touch-sensitive overlay 114 (shown on <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>), around a periphery of touch screen display 118, and/or beneath a tray that supports touch screen display 118 in the form of piezoelectric sensors. Alternatively, the sensor(s) may be located in other places in portable electronic device 100 or may be other types of sensor(s) depending on the particular type of touch-sensitive technology. Portable electronic device 100 can use any appropriate touch-sensitive technology and its associated sensor(s) including resistive, surface acoustic wave, capacitive, infrared, strain gauge, optical imaging, dispersive signal technology, acoustic pulse recognition, and so forth.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Each time the user's finger touches touch screen display 118, the sensor(s) detect a touch down event and a touch up event and may record associated touch data (e.g., location and time). In some cases, a size of the contact area is also determined and recorded. The manner of determining the location of the contact area may be direct when touch screen display 118 is capable of detecting a contact area and/or generating a signal or signals that processor 102 may use to determine a contact location. Alternatively, the location of the contact area may be determined using less direct or inferential means when direct measurement of a contact location may not be available.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In the example of portable electronic device 100 using capacitive technology, multiple layers, including electrically-separated driving electrodes and sensing electrodes, are oriented in directions perpendicular to one another to form a grid. The drive electrodes carry a current and cross over the sensing electrodes. When a finger or other suitable contact member locally disrupts the capacitance over adjacent sensing electrodes, a touch is detected. By measuring and comparing the signals generated by the electrodes as a result of the change in capacitance, processer 102 establishes coordinates and/or contact areas for a touch event.

Because the force applied by a non-moving contact member is rarely completely static, e.g., because a user may slide their finger while making contact, a single touch may be associated with a plurality of touch events having locations that vary over a period of time, including, in some cases, a relatively short period of time.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Portable electronic device 100 can incorporate profile management for multiple users such that when the user changes, the calibration of touch screen display 118 is adjusted based upon that user's preferences.

In other cases, though, the user may input data through the touch screen display 118 rapidly, such as when typing an email or text message quickly, manipulating controls in a game, or simply when entering input to device 100 quickly. When touching rapidly on touch screen display 118, the user's finger can slide across the surface of touch screen display 118 by some distance. Alternatively, when touching at a slower pace, the user may drag their finger across the touch sensitive display as part of a touch. In either case, for each touch, the touch down event and the touch up event will be detected in different locations.

By analyzing the duration of a particular touch event, for example, it is possible to bias or weight the identified touch point towards the touch down event, touch up event, or a midpoint defined on a path between the touch down and touch up events to more accurately identify the target touch point and to compensate for the user's finger sliding across the touch screen.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0047" num="0047">When a user is typing quickly, for example, the touch down event may be closer to the user's target touch point, whereas the touch up event is located away from the user's target touch point and results primarily from the user's finger sliding across the touch screen. In other cases, where the user is touching on the touch screen more deliberately, it can be more accurate to locate the target touch point away from the touch down event and towards the touch up event. For example, the user may initially touch the touch screen at an incorrect location due to missing the user's target touch point (e.g., by touching the wrong key or icon on the touch screen). After realizing that the user has missed his or her intended touch point, the user will then slide their finger across the touch screen towards the target touch point. In that case, the touch up event location may be relatively accurate, while the touch down event location is incorrect.

In some implementations, portable electronic device 100 implements preliminary touch detection algorithms to generate an initial estimate of the user's target touch point based upon the touch down and touch up events. The estimate may be rudimentary. For example, the preliminary position may always be equal to the touch down event location, the touch up event location, or a midpoint. Having created an initial guess, portable electronic device 100 can then use the system and method of the present disclosure to determine a weighting based upon user behavior. The weighting can then be used to modify the initial guess position based upon the user's behavior towards a more likely target touch point. Alternatively, in some cases the weightings of the present disclosure may be sufficient to determine the target touch point, without using or modifying any preliminary estimate of the portable electronic device 100.
