id="p0002" num="0002">Many spraying guns have been used widely for cleaning dust and dirt from a surface of an object, for watering, for spraying paint, and the like. The spraying guns remove dust and dirt by spraying a high pressure fluid, and perform watering and spraying paint with the use of a high pressure fluid mixed with water or other spraying liquid.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In order to uniform the spraying distribution, the spraying gun is manufactured to have a spraying tube with a bending shape and a rotating device is provided to couple with the spraying tube of the spraying gun. When rotating the spraying tube by the rotating device, a mixed fluid of a high pressured gas and a spraying liquid can be sprayed out in e in every direction with the rotation of the spraying tube. For example, the rotating device may be a fan having a plurality of fan blades, so as to be rotated by turning, by the high pressured gas introduced into the spraying gun, the fan blades. Alternatively, the rotating device may be a motor which is<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> driven by power supplying, so as to make the spraying tube rotating.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, because the fan blade has complicated structure and has low structural strength, the rotating device, which is a fan, is more difficultly in manufacturing and miniaturizing, and is easily damaged and deformed. The motor needs power supplying for operation so the rotating device wastes in production cost and power consumption.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In view of the above circumstances, the spraying tube is rotated by a fan or a motor according to a prior art of the spraying gun, so that the spraying gun is difficult in manufacture and costly in production.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a rotary spraying device with stronger structure which is also easy in manufacturing and is stable in rotating.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention overcomes the drawbacks of the prior art, and provides a rotary spraying device comprising: a fluid tube provided at one end thereof with a fluid inlet and the other end thereof with a spraying outlet, and a through hole provided on tube wall of the fluid tube; a rotary means, coupled with the fluid tube, provided with a drive wall inclining to a fluid output direction of the through hole and an outflow passage formed at an end of the drive wall, where the drive wall<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> is driven and pushed by a force of fluid output from the through hole via a fluid connection by a flow space; and a conveying tube provided at one end thereof with a fluid container inlet for connecting to a fluid container, and the other end thereof being disposed within the fluid tube to extend to the spraying outlet of the fluid tube.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the drive wall of the rotary means is formed extending along an involute curve.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the rotary means is further provided with a plurality of fastening ribs extending toward the fluid tube.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the rotary means includes a front fastening layer, a back fastening layer, and a flow channel layer disposed therebetween. Besides, said front fastening layer and said back fastening layer are made of a rigid material and said flow channel layer is made of a plastic material.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the fluid tube is further provided inside with a splitter for splitting the fluid flowing through the fluid tube into two portion, wherein one portion of the fluid flows toward the spraying outlet of the fluid tube and the other portion of the fluid flows toward the through hole of the fluid tube.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the conveying tube is further provided inside with a flow rate regulating means including a water stopper and a seal member, the water stopper is formed with a flow hole and the seal member is formed at one end thereof with a sharp section movably disposed in the flow hole of the water stopper.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the rotary spraying device further comprising a rotation speed adjusting means including a first adjusting member and a second adjusting member, wherein the first adjusting member is connected with the outflow passage of the rotary means and has an outlet surface formed with a plurality of first openings and the second adjusting member has an inlet surface coupled with the outlet surface of the first adjusting member to rotate with first adjusting member, and the inlet surface is formed with a plurality of second openings corresponding to the first openings.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Thereby, the fluid tube can be rotated without power supplying. The rotary means is stronger in structure and is easy in miniaturizing because the drive wall, the outflow passage, the flow space and so on are formed inside the rotary means. Further, the rotary means having such structure can be stable in rotating and rotate uniformly in high speed with low variation, and those effects are good for fluid spraying.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><p id="p0015" num="0015">The structure and the technical means adopted by the present invention to achieve the above and other objects can be best understood by referring to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the accompanying drawings.
