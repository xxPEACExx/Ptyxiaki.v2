Therefore, it is possible to estimate the flow characteristics of the sample and the flow rate and use the estimated values to correct the measurement result, thus obtaining a more accurate measurement result.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A biosensor is a device that converts information on an analyte into a detectable signal such as a color, fluorescent, or electrical signal using a biological component or imitating the biological component.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Especially, since a biosensor that utilizes a biological enzyme has excellent sensitivity and reaction specificity, it is expected that it will be useful in a wide range of applications such as medical/pharmaceutical field, process measurement in bioindustry, environmental measurement, stability evaluation of chemical materials, etc.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Measurement of chemical components in vitro is medically important, and thus the biosensors are widely used in the analysis of biological samples such as blood in the medical diagnosis field.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Among them, a biosensor using an enzyme analysis method in which a specific reaction between an enzyme and a substrate or between an enzyme and an inhibitor is used has advantages of simple application, excellent detection sensitivity, and fast response, and thus it is most widely used in hospitals and clinical chemistry analysis.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The enzyme analysis method for the measurement of chemical components in vitro may be classified into a chromatographic method for measuring optical transmittance by a spectroscopic method before and after an enzyme reaction, and an electrochemical method for measuring an electrochemical signal.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Compared to the electrochemical method, the chromatographic method has difficulties in analyzing critical biomaterials because the measurement time is long, a large amount of same is required, and measurement errors occur due to turbidity in biological samples.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Therefore, the electrochemical method, in which an electrode system including a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> plurality of electrodes is formed on a plastic film (insulating substrate) by etching, screen printing, or sputtering, and a reagent is fixed onto the electrodes, such that a specific substance in a sample is quantitatively measured by applying a predetermined electric potential to the sample, has been widely applied to the biosensor using the enzyme analysis method.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the case where the electrochemical method is employed, a measuring device for obtaining information on biological samples from the biosensor is required, and the measuring device includes a socket electrically connected to thin film electrodes of the biosensor. Accordingly, when the thin film electrodes of the biosensor are inserted into the measuring device through an inlet port, the thin film electrodes are connected to terminals formed in the socket of the measuring device such that the measuring device in an ON state obtains information on the biological material as an analyte.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">One of the most widely used biosensors employing the electrochemical method is a blood glucose meter, with which everyone can measure the concentration of glucose (sugar) in blood by easily taking a drop of blood.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the case of insulin-dependent diabetics who should measure blood glucose two to three times a day, they take a drop of blood by pricking a finger with a lancet to measure blood glucose. At this time, the blood glucose meter is used to measure blood glucose level from an electrical signal generated by an electrochemical reaction between a reactant in the biosensor and a sample (e.g., blood) taken from a diabetic.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The biosensor typically includes an electrode system having a plurality of electrodes formed on an insulating substrate by screen printing, and an enzyme reaction layer formed on the electrode system and including a hydrophilic polymer, an oxidoreductase and an electron acceptor. When a user injects a sample containing a substrate (glucose) through a sample injection port of the biosensor to come in contact with the enzyme reaction layer, the enzyme reaction layer dissolves the sample, the substrate in the sample reacts with an enzyme and is oxidized, and thus the electron acceptor is reduced. At this time, an oxidation current obtained when the reduced electron acceptor is electrochemically oxidized is measured by the measuring device, thereby obtaining the concentration of the substrate contained in the sample.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref> are diagrams showing a basic configuration of an electrochemical biosensor, and the configuration of a conventional biosensor will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is an exploded perspective view and <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is an assembled perspective view.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, a biosensor 10 includes a lower insulating substrate 11, on which a working electrode 12 and a reference electrode 13 are stacked in the longitudinal direction, and an enzyme reaction layer 14 as a reagent is immobilized onto the working electrode 12 and the reference electrode 13 in the width direction. The<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> electrodes 12 and 13 are formed by a thin film formation process such as etching, screen printing, or sputtering.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Moreover, spacers 15 and 16 are stacked on the top of the lower insulating substrate 11 on which the electrodes 12 and 13 are formed such that a sample (e.g., blood) is appropriately introduced into the entire enzyme reaction layer 14. Then, an upper insulating substrate 17 is stacked on the top of the spacers 15 and 16 such that the upper and lower insulating substrates 17 and 11, spaced from each other by the spacers 15 and 16, form a sample path 18 having a capillary structure on the top of the enzyme reaction layer 14.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Here, the working electrode 12 and the reference electrode 13 are insulated from each other by the spacers 15 and 16, and an inlet of the sample path 18, formed by the upper and lower insulating substrates 17 and 11 and the spacers 15 and 16, corresponds to a sample injection port 18a through which the sample is injected. Moreover, the working electrode 12 and the reference electrode 13 are exposed at a connection terminal of the biosensor 10 such that they can be connected to terminals formed in a socket of a measuring device (not shown) when the biosensor 10 is inserted into the measuring device.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">When the working electrode 12 and the reference electrode 13 are electrically connected to the measuring device in the above manner, an electrical signal generated by a reaction between a component (e.g., blood glucose) in the sample and the enzyme reaction layer 14 is detected. At this time, the oxidation-reduction reaction between the component in the sample and the enzyme reaction layer 14 takes place at the working electrode 12 to generate a predetermined current by an electrochemical mechanism at the working electrode 12. When the thus generated current is applied to the measuring device, the measuring device measures the current applied from the biosensor 10 to quantitatively analyze the component in the sample and display the result on a display.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Meanwhile, when blood is injected through the sample injection port 18a and introduced into the enzyme reaction layer 14, the component in blood reacts with the enzyme reaction layer 14 in the biosensor 10 to generate a current. At this time, it is necessary that a sufficient amount of blood be filled in the sample path 18 on the enzyme reaction layer 14 in order to obtain an accurate measurement result.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">That is, the blood injected into the sample injection port 18a and present in the sample path 18 on the enzyme reaction layer 14 sequentially passes through the first electrode 12 and the second electrode 13. At this time, only if the sample path 18 is completely filled with the blood reaching the second electrode 13, an accurate measurement is possible.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">However, since the reaction takes place immediately after the blood is in contact with the second electrode 13, the measurement may be made in a state that the blood has not<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> yet been filled in the sample path 18 and, in this case, an error may occur. Accordingly, it is necessary to determine whether a sufficient amount of blood reaches the second electrode and is filled therein. In the case of the conventional biosensor, it is impossible to accurately determine the time point at which the blood starts coming in contact with the second electrode 13 and is filled in the sample path 18.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Moreover, the rate at which the blood flows in the sample path 18 may differ according to the flow characteristics of blood, and the flow characteristics of blood may affect the measurement result. Accordingly, during the analysis, it is possible to correct the measurement error according to the flow characteristics of blood with a difference in flow rate. Furthermore, it is possible to estimate the properties of the sample from the difference in flow rate.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">However, in the case of the conventional biosensor, it is impossible to determine the rate at which the blood flows in the sample path 18, and thus it is impossible to correct the measurement error according to the flow characteristics of blood.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Disclosure of Invention</b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b>Technical Problem</b></heading><p id="p0023" num="0023">Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve the above-describe problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a biosensor, in which sensing electrodes are formed on an upper insulating substrate and a lower insulating substrate such that, using the sensing electrodes, a measuring device can determine whether a sample (e.g., blood) injected through a sample injection port is completely filled in a sample path and determine a time point at which the sample is injected and a time point at which the sample is completely filled.
