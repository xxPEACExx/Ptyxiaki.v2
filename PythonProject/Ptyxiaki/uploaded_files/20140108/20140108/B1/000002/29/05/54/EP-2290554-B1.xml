load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to the configuration management of devices. In particular, the invention is applicable to USB On-The-Go devices.</p><heading id="h0002">RELATED ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The approaches described in this section could be pursued, but are not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated herein, the approaches described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The concept of On-The-Go (OTG) devices has been developed in addition to the specifications of the Universal Serial Bus (USB), originally designed as an interface between Personal Computers (PCs) and peripherals. In particular, the specification "<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>On-The-Go and Embedded Host Supplement to the USB Revision 2.0 Specification" - Revision 2.0 - May 8, 2009</text></nplcit> has been introduced to allow many devices, for example mobile phones or cameras, that are not PCs in the classic sense, to connect directly to peripherals, without requiring them to support the full range of USB peripherals.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Typically, in order to manage a USB interface, an OTG device comprises a control unit, said unit being generally implemented, in large part, in the form of a computer program, and an interface unit generally made up, in large part, of hardware components. The control unit requires the use of a high speed clock (typically 60 MHz) to work.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An OTG device is configured according notably to the configurations of devices connected to the USB interface and user actions. For example, the OTG device can act as a Host or as a Peripheral. Any changes in the configuration of devices connected to the USB interface and user actions must be processed by the OTG device to adapt its own configuration.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is possible to detect such changes by measuring variations of physical characteristics on the USB interface. The OTG device reacts to a change in the configuration as explained hereinafter. On detection of a variation, the interface unit of the OTG device sends this information to the control unit. The control unit interprets the variation and gives instruction to the interface unit in writing flags or instructions via serial registers or by sending back commands to the interface unit.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">This approach relies on a dialog between the control unit and the interface unit. A drawback of this solution is that it introduces latencies in the processing of a change of the configuration, since several entities must cooperate and the control unit is mainly implemented by the way of a software executed by a processor with limited resources. Moreover, it creates additional power consumption needs as the involvement of the control unit requires the use of a high speed clocks and processing power.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">To address these needs, an embodiment relates to a method according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Thanks to an embodiment, upon detection of a change in the resistance value on the resistive line, the processing of this event is handled by the interface unit. In fact, the Interface unit manages the detection, the identification and the processing of this event. Contrary to the control unit generally implemented in the form of a computer program, the interface unit is generally made up in large part of hardware components. The processing of the event does not need anymore the involvement of the control unit. Thus, it is not anymore necessary to establish a bi-directional communication between the interface unit and the control unit, the interface unit being able to react almost instantly to a change of the configuration. It is then evident that latencies are reduced and power consumption can also be drastically scaled down.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">This embodiment is also interoperable with existing devices, in particular USB On-The-Go devices, thus allowing a faster response time compared to known solutions.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The step /b/ can comprise any combination of the following steps:

The adapter is adapted to modify the resistance value of said resistive line according to a connection state of said charger to the adapter and according to the configurations of the first device and the second device.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The communication interface may be compliant with the Universal Serial Bus specifications.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A second aspect of an embodiment relates to an Interface unit in a first device comprising a control entity and a communication interface able to link said first device to at least one second device. The communication interface comprises at least one resistive line having a resistance value. The resistance value allows the interface unit to identify a configuration of the second device.

Reference to the singular is also to be construed in be a reference to the plural and vice versa.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to a classical USB connection between two devices, one device is a Host and the other is a Peripheral. A Host is a physical entity acting as a host and generally includes a USB Host Controller. A Peripheral is a physical entity that performs a function.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">An USB interface comprises up to five physical lines: ground GND, power supply VBUS, data link D+ and D-, resistance ID. The resistance ID line of an USB interface can be qualified as a resistivity line. Typically, an USB interface comprises a cable with up to five wires equipped at each end with a connector designed to be connected to a USB connector, with up to five contacts.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Considering the USB terminology, a Session is the period of time that VBUS is powered up. An A-device is a Host at the start of a session and supplies power to VBUS. A B-device is a Peripheral at the start of a session. During a session, the role of host can be transferred back and forth between the A-device and<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the B-device any number of times. The session ends when applications running on it have completed.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">An OTG device is a portable device that uses an USB connector to operate sometimes as a Host and sometimes as a Peripheral. Consequently, OTG devices can be attached to each other. For example, a mobile phone is a Peripheral when it is connected via a removable USB cable to a computer acting as a Host. The same mobile phone is a Host for an USB storage key or a printer acting as Peripherals.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, there is shown therein a block diagram of an OTG device 10 according to an aspect of an embodiment, connected via a first USB interface 15 to an Accessory Charging Adapter (ACA) device 14. By way of an example, the OTG device 10 can be a mobile phone, a personal assistant, an embedded device...</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The features and the behaviour of ACA Devices are detailed in the <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="b"><text>chapter 6 of the USB specification "Battery Charging Specification" - Revision 1.1 - April 15, 2009</text></nplcit>. Also this document generally deals with charging and/or powering up from dedicated chargers, hosts, hubs and charging downstream ports.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In particular, the ACA device 14 is a USB device allowing the connection to the first USB interface 15 of:
<ul><li>a charger via an input 16 ; and</li><li>a USB accessory via a second USB interface 17.</li></ul></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The input 16 might be a USB interface or any another kind of interface, for example a co-axial connector to accommodate the output of a charger plugged into an electrical outlet. The ACA device 14 supplies power, through the charger when the former is connected to the input 16, on the VBUS line of the first USB interface 15 and the second USB interface 17. It has also to be pointed out that data transfers between the OTG device and the accessory are maintained, in a transparent manner independently of the presence of the ACA device.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The OTG device 10 comprises a control unit 12, said unit being generally implemented, in large part, in the form of a computer program, and an interface unit 13 is generally made up in large part of hardware components. Said control unit 12 and said interface unit 13 are coupled via an interface 16. The control unit 12 requires the use of a high speed clock (typically 60 MHz) to work.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the following description, by configuration it should be understood any combination of hardware or software components determining the essential characteristics of a device in operation. Several configurations of the OTG device may arise. In particular, the OTG device 10 can act as a Host or as a Peripheral. The charger may be present or not. The main different configurations are summed up hereinafter:
<ol><li>(a) OTG Device as an A-Device, Accessory as a B-device and no-charger present;</li><li>(b) OTG Device as a B-Device, Accessory as an A-device and charger present;</li><li>(c) OTG Device as a B-Device, no Accessory connected and charger present;</li><li>(d) OTG Device as an A-Device, Accessory as a B-device and charger present;</li><li>(e) OTG Device as a B-Device, Accessory as a A-device or no Accessory connected and charger not present.</li></ol></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The ACA device 14 is designed to identify the current configuration by detecting which device is connected to its input 16, its first USB interface 15 and its second USB interface 17. This information is communicated by the ACA device 14 to the OTG device 10. The ACA device 14 modifies the resistance value of the resistance ID line in connecting an appropriate resistance on the resistance ID line of the USB interface 15. Then, the OTG device 10 can determine the current configuration by checking the value of the resistance R of the resistance ID line of the USB interface 15. As described in<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the USB specifications, each configuration corresponds to a given value of the resistance R:
<ul><li>Configuration (a): R &lt; 1 kOhms ;</li><li>Configuration (b): R = 37 kOhms ;</li><li>Configuration (c): R = 68 kOhms ;</li><li>Configuration (d): R = 124 kOhms ;</li><li>Configuration (e): R &gt; 220 kOhms.</li></ul></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The OTG device must adapt its configuration for the first USB interface following a change of configuration. For example, if the OTG device was acting as a Host and a charger was present (configuration (d)), only the ACA device 14 was providing power to the VBUS line of the first USB interface 15. On removal of the charger (configuration (a)), the OTG device must provide power to the VBUS line of the first USB interface 15.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In the description above, the architecture of the OTG device 10 is based on two different chips respectively for the control unit 12 and for the interface unit 13 linked with the interface 16. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various other modifications may be made, and equivalents may be substituted, without departing from the true scope of the present invention. In particular, the control unit 12 and the interface unit 13 could be grouped for example on one chip.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The interface unit 13 comprises itself logic blocks 22. Logic blocks 22 are capable of adapting the configuration of the OTG device upon detection of a value change of the resistance R of the Resistance ID line of the first USB interface 15. To this end, logic blocks 22 comprise gates to receive such a value change and to emit suitable commands depending on the current configuration in order to configure the OTG device 10. In particular, logic blocks 22 can configure the OTG device to:
<ul><li>supply or not power to the VBUS line of the first interface 15;</li><li>enable or not charging from or to the VBUS line of the first interface 15;</li><li>check if a session is valid or not.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In one embodiment, notably adapted to manage the connection of an ACA device on the first interface 15, the logic blocks 22 are designed to configure the OTG device according to the following rules:
<ul><li>upon transition from configuration -d- (OTG Device as an A-Device, Accessory as a B-device and charger present) to configuration -a- (OTG Device as an A-Device, Accessory as a B-device and no-charger present), then:

<ul><li>o check the validity of the session ;</li></ul></li><li>upon transition from configuration -e- (OTG Device as a B-Device, Accessory as a A-device or no Accessory connected and charger not present) to configuration -b- (OTG Device as a B-Device, Accessory as an A-device and charger present), configuration -c- (OTG Device as a B-Device, no Accessory connected and charger present), or configuration -d- (OTG Device as an A-Device, Accessory as a B-device and charger present), then:
<ul><li>o enable charging from VBUS.</li></ul></li></ul></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In one embodiment, the logic blocks 22 are implemented using combinatorial logic blocks and/or logic circuits and/or truth tables. Such logic blocks 22 are<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> efficient since they are characterized by their low-latency, their speed and their very low power consumption, no clock or active component being involved.
