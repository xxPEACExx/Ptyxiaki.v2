People have to depend directly on ground water sources like wells, ponds and rivers. Often these water sources are contaminated by sewage, industrial effluents and agricultural by-products like pesticide residues. For water to be microbially safe, WHO recommends 6 log removal of bacteria, 4 log removal of virus and 3 log removal of cysts. Whilst bacteria and virus removal to the required extent is possible by using chemical disinfection (e.g. by contacting with halogen) or radiation-based disinfection (e.g. by exposure to ultraviolet radiation), these disinfection methods do not achieve 3 log removal of cysts.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Gravity fed devices are available where it is possible to achieve 6 log removal of bacteria, 4 log removal of virus and 3 log removal of cysts<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> using filtration in combination with biocide action. Gravity fed devices function in the absence of pressurised and running water.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2005095284A"><text>WO 2005095284 (Unilever, 2005</text></patcit>), discloses a gravity fed water purification system comprising a filtration unit adapted to separate particulate and soluble material from the input water and this is in the form of a carbon block and usually has an additional non-woven fabric filter, a chemical dispensing unit such that flow rate of water exiting the filtration unit is controlled by a flow control means before the water encounters a biocide dispensed by the chemical dispensing unit, the water thereafter being retained in a retention chamber for a predetermined period of time before exiting the water purification system through a scavenger means adapted to separate the dispensed biocide and its by-products from the exit water. This device is quite complex having a number of replaceable parts</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO07000238A"><text>WO07000238 (Unilever, 2007</text></patcit>), discloses a water purification device comprising an upper and a lower chamber comprising an outlet means for collecting purified water and a filter medium for removing suspended particulates and dissolved organics. The biocide system integral with it is a device which may dispense a unit dose of biocide and water may be fed into a chamber where the biocide could be dispensed. This designed only for a solid biocide and can not be adopted for a liquid biocide. The disadvantage with solid biocides is that they degrade on exposure to air.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO08083896A"><text>WO08083896 (Unilever, 2008</text></patcit>) discloses a gravity fed water purification device which may incorporate controlled dosing of a liquid biocide. The device uses a dosing passage comprising a venturi where a top chamber is in fluid communication with a bottom chamber, and water may flow from the top chamber to the bottom chamber. The water in this system has to flow at a high flow rate and the dosing rate depends on the rate of flow of water. Dosing of the biocide is caused by a negative (suction)<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> pressure at the discharge end of the liquid dosing tube, which is caused by water flowing through a venturi, which is connected to the discharge end of the tube in an air-tight manner. The air pressure in the compartment containing the liquid biocide, in this case, is at atmospheric pressure, which is "sucked" out of the biocide containing compartment by the negative pressure at its discharge end. In practice, the venturi based dosing system is highly sensitive to the physical dimensions, and control of dosage is more difficult. The system requires a lot of material for construction thus making it expensive.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present inventors have been able to design a novel biocide dosing system which is due to a positive pressure created inside the biocide dosing compartment. This dosing system is significantly less sensitive to physical dimensions allowing for improved control of biocide dosage. In addition the narrow venturi as used in the prior art get clogged due to poor quality input water, the risk of which is eliminated in the dosing system disclosed in the present invention.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It has now been possible to develop a single chamber water purification device which is capable of dosing a controlled level of a biocide to the water and provide a filtration unit that functions as a filter-cum-scavenger. This water purification device provides several advantages over the prior art especially in terms of reducing the complexity of the device thus making it economical and reducing the number of replaceable parts without affecting the performance in terms of microbial safety or flow rate. Another advantage of the system is that it can be adapted for use with solid and liquid biocides.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The object of the present invention is to provide a water purification device which is less complex and thus making it economical in its construction.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Another object of the present invention to provide a water purification device with reduced number of replaceable parts and thus making it economical in its construction.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Another object of the present invention is to provide a water purification device that can be adapted to use both solid and liquid biocides.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Another object of the present invention is to provide a water purification device that can be used as a gravity fed device as well as adapted to be used in inline systems.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the invention:</b></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the present invention there is provided a water purification device comprising:

The aperture of the porthole is substantially smaller than the inlet port of the fill cup which will ensure that the rate at which water is drained from the fill cup through the port is significantly slower than the rate at which the cup can be filled by the user. The water purification chamber is provided with a cover (8) opening which will allow the user to pour water into the fill cup as it is positioned at the top end of the water purification chamber. The inlet port of the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> water purification chamber to receive input water is in line with the inlet port of the fill cup such that substantially all the input water flows into the fill cup. It is also designed such that filling in the fill cup allows water to overflow into the water purification chamber. There is a tube (3) connecting the fill cup and biocide dispensing box (4) that is in fluid communication with biocide storage compartment (6) and a biocide dispensing port (5). Below the water purification chamber is provided a pure water discharge chamber (9) to receive the purified water. The input water in the water purification chamber after being treated with a biocide passes through a filter-cum-biocide scavenger (7) into the pure water discharge chamber. The filter is positioned on the partition wall that separates the water purification chamber and the pure water discharge chamber. The filter helps in removing the residual biocide, organics, any suspended dirt and particulate matter and residual micro-organisms. The purified water can be discharged from the pure water discharge chamber by a discharge mechanism (10). The discharge mechanism is a tap attached to the lower end of the pure water discharge chamber.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">When water flows into the fill cup through the inlet port of the water purification chamber and fills up the same, the level of water in fill cup creates an air pressure in the tube and enables the discharge of the biocide from the biocide dispensing box into the water purification chamber through the biocide dispensing port.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is another embodiment of the water purification device according to the invention. The water purification chamber (1) is provided with a lid which has an inlet port vertically above the fill-cup such that water that is poured in flows into the fill cup (2) and later fills the water purification chamber. As the water level rises in the fill cup an air pocket is formed in the tube (3) and when the water level reaches the top of 2, the air pressure in the tube is enough to dispense a few drops of the liquid biocide from the biocide dispensing port (5) into the water<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> purification chamber (1). Further addition of water into fill cup causes the water purification chamber to fill up, due to overflow, which also results in the uniform mixing of the liquid biocide throughout water purification chamber. After the mixing of biocide with the water, there is provided a filter-cum-biocide scavenger (7). Water from water purification chamber will pass through this scavenger and accumulate in pure water discharge chamber (9). <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> provides a different dispensing device as compared to <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>. Section (13) in the figure is connected to the pure water discharge chamber by means of a tube. Section (13) comprises of a non-return valve and a bellow. By pressing the bellow one can dispense the pure water from elevated dispensing tap (10). The elevated discharge point has several in-use advantages one of which is that the device need not be placed at the edge of a platform. At the time of pressing the bellow there will be a creation of pressure in the pure water discharge chamber as a result of which, water from the pure water chamber may go back to the water purification chamber (1) through the filter. To prevent this there is provided a non return valve (12) at the foot of the filter-cum-biocide scavenger (7). Due to this non-return valve the pressure created by pumping the bellow will help to dispense the water from elevated dispensing tap.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The biocide storage compartment has an opening through which the biocide can be replaced. When a liquid biocide is used, filling of the biocide storage compartment leads to the filling up of the biocide dispensing box. Alternately the biocide storage compartment could be a replaceable air-tight "bottle" which is in fluid communication with the biocide dispensing box like a closed inverted bottle over a liquid reservoir. This ensures discharge of the liquid biocide from the storage "bottle" only when the level of the biocide in the biocide dispensing box falls below the level of the lowest part of the inverted biocide storage "bottle".<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> represents another preferred embodiment of the water purifier. The water purification chamber (1), the fill cup (2), the filter-cum-biocide scavenger (7), the biocide dispensing port (5), the biocide dispensing box (4), the pure water discharge chamber (9) everything remains same as in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>. In <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> there is no non return valve at the foot of the filter-cum-scavenger as there is no bellow in the section 14. Section 14 only has a vent which is connected to the pure water discharge chamber. By opening the vent one can discharge the water from the tap (10). The opening of the air vent is either manually operated or actuated by a timer. The vent (14) is provided to control the residence time of water in the water purification chamber which has the biocide. By controlling the residence time one may get the desired level of purity of water.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> represents another embodiment of the water purification device showing a water purification chamber (1) provided at its bottom inner section a filter chamber (15) that encloses the filter-cum-biocide scavenger (7). The filter chamber is provided with a water-tight cover (16) and an air vent (17). A siphon discharge mechanism (18) is provided to operatively connect the water purification chamber and the filter chamber such that the water from the water purification chamber flows into the filter chamber only through the siphon discharge mechanism.<br/>
The air vent allows the siphon discharge mechanism to operate by allowing an upwardly directed passage for air to exit the filter chamber.<br/>
The exit from the filter chamber is through the filter-cum-biocide scavenger, while the entry of water into the filter chamber occurs through the siphon discharge mechanism. The water tight cover ensures that water enters the filter Chamber only through the siphon. As the water purification chamber (1) fills-up to the highest level of the siphon, the siphon begins to discharge water into the filter chamber. As the water with biocide fills the filter chamber, water flows through the filter cum scavenger which removes colloidal impurities from the water as well as the residual biocide, and discharges water into the pure water discharge<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> chamber (9), Pure water devoid of biocide is available from pure water discharge chamber, through a dispensing means such as a tap (10).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Water is poured into the fill cup (2), in order to fill the device. The device cover (8) has an opening vertically above the fill-cup such that it would be obvious to the user that water has to be filled in through it.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As the water level rises in the fill cup, an air pocket is formed in the tube (3). This pressure is transmitted into dispensing box (4). When the water level reaches the top of fill cup, the air pressure in the air pocket is enough to dispense a few drops of the liquid biocide out of biocide dispensing box, through the biocide dispensing port (5) into the water purification chamber (1).

There is a small opening at the bottom of fill up, which is provided to ensure that fill cup gets drained out over time. The drain rate of the hole at the bottom of fill cup ensures that the drain rate is significantly slower than the rate at which the cup can be filled by the user. It also ensures that the air pocket forms during the next re-fill thereby ensuring smooth operation over several litters of water.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><heading id="h0007"><b>Examples:</b></heading><heading id="h0008">Example 1</heading><heading id="h0009">i. <u>Test water:</u></heading><p id="p0036" num="0036">A test water having TDS of 1000ppm and the TSS of 15 ppm was used for testing the efficacy of the water purification device as described in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> of the present invention.</p><heading id="h0010">ii. <u>Evaluation of microbial safety.</u></heading><p id="p0037" num="0037">To five liters of Test water described in Table 1, a culture of <i>E. coli</i> ATCC 10536 stock and MS2 bacteriophage stock was added to obtain a Log<sub>10</sub> (input count per 100 ml): 7.25 log of <i>E.coli</i> and 5.96 log of MS2.
