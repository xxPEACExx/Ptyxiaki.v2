Field of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a preparation method of a lubricating oil and a lubricating oil produced thereby. More particularly, the present invention relates to a preparation method of a lubricating oil and a lubricating oil produced thereby, which has excellent extreme pressure load resistance and wear resistance properties.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>2. Discussion of Related Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Typically, a lubricating oil should have an appropriate viscosity at its operating temperature, have a small change in the viscosity in response to a change in the operating temperature, form a stable oil film even in the boundary lubrication, and have a high stability to heat and oxidation.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, recently, due to high performance, high power, and large scale of various lubrication and lubrication devices, the operating load and temperature are increased, and thus the durability of the device and lubricating oil is reduced and the frequency of failures increases.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A nano-lubricating oil provided by the present invention is prepared by mixing an existing oil with a metal alloy oxide or non-metal nanoparticles and an<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> extremely small amount of dispersant, which allows the metal alloy oxide or non-metal nanoparticles to be well dispersed in a colloid state, and it was confirmed that the nano-lubricating oil has a significant effect on the reduction in the coefficient of friction and the oil temperature.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">This has been actually applied to vehicle engine oils and, recently, extensive research aimed at applying such lubricating oils to gear oil, cutting oil, and the like has continued to progress.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For example, in the case of the gear oil, in order to improve the extreme pressure properties, an attempt to improve the friction, wear, and lubricating properties by pulverizing tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>) or molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>), which is conventionally used as a solid lubricant, to nanoparticles as it is and dispersing the nanoparticles into the lubricating oil have been extensively made in the related industry. However, the specific gravity of the material is too high to improve the dispersibility, and an increase in the cost limits the commercialization. Recently, an attempt to reduce the specific gravity of the material by the formation of fullerene-like structure is made; however, satisfactory results are not obtained in terms of the size of the synthesized powder and the dispersibility. The reason is that when the nanopowder added to the lubricating oil is precipitated, the nanopowder does not act as an additive any longer, but acts as an impurity, thereby accelerating the deterioration of the material and its physical properties.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Moreover, a sufficient effect can be obtained even when an extremely small amount of nanopowder in a single composition is added for the purpose of reducing the coefficient of friction such as an engine oil additive. However, there are many difficulties in significantly improving both the load resistance and wear resistance properties of the lubricating oil under high load conditions. That is, the conditions<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> for improving the load resistance properties of the lubricating oil and the conditions for improving the wear resistance properties of the powder do not coincide with each other, and thus there are many materials which maximize one of the properties. However, it is difficult to find a material which can maximize more than two properties at the same time.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Choi C. et al: "Tribological behaviour of lubricating oil-based nano fluids containing Ag and carbon nano particles", Korean Journal of Materials Research, November 2008, Materials Research Society of Korea, Vol. 18, No. 11, pages 610-616</text></nplcit>, also discloses methods for preparing nano-lubricating oils.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention has been made in an effort to solve the above-described problems associated with prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a mixed nano-lubricating oil and a method for preparing the same, which can satisfy both the load resistance and wear resistance properties and is economical and has excellent dispersibility.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for preparing a mixed nano-lubricating oil, the method comprising the steps of (a) preparing a mixed solution by adding and mixing a nanopowder and a dispersant to a solvent and pulverizing the nanopowder to a primary particle level; (b) modifying the surface of the nanopowder; (c) substituting the solvent of the mixed solution to a lubricating oil; (d) mixing at least two nano-lubricating oils prepared using physically and chemically different nanopowders; and (f) uniformly redispersing the nanopowder in the mixture comprising at least two nano-lubricating oils using a high-energy disperser including a bead mill, an ultrasonic pulverizer, or a high-pressure homogenizer after (d) the mixing step; wherein the at least two nano-lubricating oils mixed in step (d) are prepared from a metal and non-metal nano-powder and by using different dispersants for the different nano-lubricating oils.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The method for preparing a mixed nano-lubricating oil may further include the step of (e) mixing a pure lubricating oil with the mixed nano-lubricating oil.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The nanopowder may have a diameter of 0.1 to 100 nm.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The nanopowder may have a concentration of 0.1 to 10 vol%.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The nanopowder may include a metal, an alloy, an oxide, or a non-metal.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a mixed nano-lubricating oil prepared by the method of the present invention.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The mixed nano-lubricating oil and the method for preparing the same of the present invention have the following effects.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Firstly, according to the method for preparing a mixed nano-lubricating oil of the present invention, it is possible to prepare a mixed nano-lubricating oil having excellent extreme pressure load resistance and wear resistance by performing the wet pulverization and the surface modification at the same time and mixing at least two nano-lubricating oils prepared using physically and chemically different nanopowders prepared by substituting a solvent to oil by vacuum concentration.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Secondly, since the method for preparing a mixed nano-lubricating oil of the present invention dilutes each nano-lubricating oil with a pure oil, it is possible to freely determine the mixing ratio and select the composition according to the application.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Thirdly, the method for preparing a mixed nano-lubricating oil of the present invention can be used in the preparation of a high efficiency cooling nanofluid using a metal, an alloy, an oxide, or a non-metal nanopowder.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Fourthly, according to the method for preparing a mixed nano-lubricating oil of the present invention, it is possible to obtain the lubricating properties of an equivalent level even the use of a lubricating oil having a viscosity lower than that of the lubricating oil used at preset. Moreover, since the mixed nano-lubricating oil according to the present invention has low viscosity, it has relatively high cooling<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> properties, and thus it is possible to reduce the operating rate or the volume of a circulation pump and a cooling fan, thus reducing the amount of energy consumed.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Fifthly, according to the method for preparing a mixed nano-lubricating oil of the present invention, it is possible to effectively reduce the friction heat, and thus it is possible to extend the durability of the lubricating oil by preventing the temperature of the lubricating oil from rising.

Moreover, the average particle size of the powder is less than 100 nm so as to prevent the precipitation and improve the heat transfer properties, and the concentration of the nanopowder is in a range of 0.01 to 1.0 vol% so as to prevent an increase in the viscosity of the lubricating oil and ensure the fluidity.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> shows an overall process for preparing a mixed nano-lubricating oil in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, which will be schematically described below.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The nanopowder is very fine and thus is oxidized or agglomerated into large lumps when it is exposed to the air even for a short time. Thus, the nanopowder is handled in a glove box under a gas atmosphere. The nanopowder and a dispersant are mixed with a predetermined amount of n-hexane in a fixed ratio, and the resulting mixture is mixed using a homogenizer for about 30 minutes and then placed in a bead mill containing beads to be subjected to bead-milling (S100) for more than two hours.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The dispersant added in the mixture acts on the surface of the nanopowder, which is newly exposed when the agglomerated nanopowders are separated, thus forming a surface modifying layer on the surface of the powder (S200 &amp; S210). That is, the wet dispersion and the surface modification are simultaneously performed. The dispersant may vary according to the nanopowder and dispersion medium so as to provide optimum properties.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The solution prepared by the above-described process is mixed with a lubricating oil in a ratio of 1:1 and vacuum-concentrated to completely remove nonvolatile n-hexane, thus preparing a lubricating oil (S300).<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">After preparing the nano-lubricating oils made of different components to have different properties, the nano-lubricating oils are mixed with each other to prepare a mixed nano-lubricating oil (S400). In detail, after mixing the respective nano-lubricating oils, the resulting mixture is dispersed using a strong ultrasonic disperser for about 30 minutes to complete the mixed nano-lubricating oil (S500).</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The above-described process will be described in detail below step by step.</p><heading id="h0007"><b><u>Selection of powder</u></b></heading><p id="p0032" num="0032">The nano-lubricating oil may be made of nanopowder prepared by either a dry or wet process. Especially, in the case of the oxide and metal powder, the wet process is typically used in which a solution containing metal ions is mixed with a solution containing a reducing agent or a surfactant serving as a reducing agent to produce fine metal powder.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">To obtain the fine metal powder and improve the dispersibility, the surfactant coating layer formed on the surface of the powder in the powder synthesis process should have lipophilic properties to facilitate the dispersion of lubricating oil.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">A powder having a smaller or larger particle size should not be used to improve the extreme pressure load resistance properties of the lubricating oil.

In the case of the bead mill, the dispersion effect is excellent, but it is disadvantageous in terms of maintenance management. On the contrary, the high-pressure homogenizer and the ultrasonic pulverizer are simple and easy to use and maintain.

In the case of the typical spherical shape, when the volume of the reaction chamber is 150 ml and an n-hexane having a viscosity of 0.32 cP at 25 C° is used as the dispersion medium, it is preferable that about 20 g of the powder is fed into the bead mill.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">As such, after the n-hexane as the dispersion medium, the nanopowder, and the zirconia beads are mixed in a certain ratio (e.g., 1,000 ml, 20 g, and 400 g based on the 150 ml reaction chamber) and placed in the bead mill to be milled above 3,000 rpm for 1 to 4 hours. The milling time is suitably adjusted according to the amount of nanopowder and, when the amount of nanopowder is increased, the milling time is extended. However, when an excessive amount of nanopowder is fed, the dispersion effect is reduced regardless of the milling time, and thus it is necessary to pay attention to the determination of the amount of nanopowder fed into the bead mill.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Moreover, the excessive pulverization and dispersion process for more than a predetermined period of time causes an over-dispersion of the mixed fluid, which increases the particle size of the powder.
