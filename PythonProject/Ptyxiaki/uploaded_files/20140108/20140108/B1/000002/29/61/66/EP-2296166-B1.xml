In particular, the present invention relates to cooling of plasma vessels.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Plasma discharges can be used to dissociate gases to produce activated gases containing ions, free radicals, atoms and molecules. Activated gases are used for numerous industrial and scientific applications including processing materials such as semiconductor wafers, powders, and other gases. The parameters of the plasma and the conditions of the exposure of the plasma to the material being processed vary widely depending on the application.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, some applications require the use of ions with low kinetic energy (i.e. a few electron volts) because the material being processed is sensitive to damage, or because there is a requirement for selective etching of one material relative to another. Other applications, such as anisotropic etching or planarized dielectric deposition, require the use of ions with high kinetic energy.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Some applications require direct exposure of the material being processed to a high density plasma. Such applications include ion-activated chemical reactions and etching of and depositing of material into high aspect-ratio structures. Other applications require shielding the material being processed from the plasma because the material is sensitive to damage caused by ions or because the process has high selectivity requirements.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Plasmas can be generated in various ways including direct current (DC) discharge, radio frequency (RF) discharge, and microwave discharge. DC discharges are achieved by applying a potential between two electrodes in a gas. RF discharges are achieved either by capacitively or inductively coupling energy from a power supply into a plasma.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Parallel plates can be used to capacitively couple energy into a plasma. Induction coils can be used to induce current in the plasma. Microwave discharges can be produced by coupling a microwave energy source to a discharge chamber containing a gas.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Plasma discharges may be generated in a manner such that both the charged species constituting the plasma and the neutral species, which may be activated by the plasma, are in intimate contact with the material being processed. Alternatively, the plasma discharge may be generated remotely from the material being processed, so that relatively few of the charged species come into contact with the material being processed, while the neutral species may still contact it.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Such a plasma discharge is commonly termed a remote or downstream plasma discharge. Depending on its construction, positioning relative to the material being processed, and operating conditions (gas species, pressure, flow rate, and power into the plasma), a plasma source can have characteristics of either or both of these two general types.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Existing remote plasma sources generally utilize RF or microwave power to generate the plasma. Although present sources support many applications successfully, several technical limitations remain in the practical use of those sources.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Microwave-based remote plasma sources are generally more expensive than RF sources because microwave power is generally more expensive to produce, deliver, and match to a load. Microwave sources and a power delivery system are also generally more bulky than RF sources and require periodic replacement of a tube which generates the microwave power.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">RF remote plasma sources that have some degree of capacitive as well as inductive coupling may be less expensive and smaller than the corresponding microwave sources. The capacitive coupling, however, which assists in the plasma ignition process, also may lead to degradation of the exposed walls of the plasma vessel due to bombardment of those walls by energetic ions produced in the plasma. RF remote plasma sources that utilize inductive RF coupling, but which minimize associated capacitive coupling, may show less ion-induced degradation of the plasma vessel surfaces. The reduction or elimination of the capacitive coupling, however, can make plasma ignition more difficult to obtain, especially over a wide range of process conditions.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A second difficulty with existing remote plasma sources is removal of the heat generated in the plasma and deposited onto the walls of the plasma vessel. This is especially the case when the plasma vessel has a complex shape and when it is composed of a dielectric material for which direct cooling with large quantities of fluid in contact with the dielectric vessel is either undesirable or impractical. This has the effect of limiting the power that can be reliably coupled into the plasma.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Existing toroidal plasma systems, for example, can be highly inductive in the manner in which the RF energy is coupled into the plasma. The plasma may be ignited, for example, via a capacitively coupled RF ignition discharge or via ultraviolet radiation. The plasma system can require separate plasma ignition steps with specific gas species, pressure and flow rate requirements. The specific requirements can be different from operating condition requirements. These constraints can both add additional complexity to the elements of the vacuum and gas handling systems used in conjunction with the plasma system and can also increase the overall time need for processing.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5869931A"><text>US 5 869 931 A</text></patcit> (see <figref idrefs="f0001">figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>) discloses a fluorescent discharge lamp operated with a rare gas plasma contained in a dielectric (glass) vessel 2, and comprising a heat sink 6 made e.g. of phosphor bronze, adjacent to the vessel 2, a thermal interface 7 of e.g. silicone rubber disposed between the vessel and the heat sink which accommodates (due to the elasticity of the silicone rubber) movements of the thermal interface, the heat sink, and the vessel in response to thermally induced dimensional changes, and an ultraviolet blocking layer (reflector 5) disposed between the vessel 2 and the thermal interface.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Similarly, document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5049777A"><text>US 5 049 777 A</text></patcit> (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>) discloses a discharge lamp with a tubular quartz or glass vessel 1, an UV-blocking aluminium layer 3,4, a water-cooled heat sink 7 adjacent to the vessel 1, and a thermal interface 2 of silicone rubber between the vessel 1 and the heat sink 7.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Document <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6222647B"><text>US 6 222 647 B</text></patcit> (<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3, 4</figref>) discloses a discharge lamp with a tubular glass vessel 1, an UV-blocking aluminium layer 2a,2b, a heat sink 18,20 adjacent to the vessel 1, and a thermal interface (space S filled with silicone oil, and silicone rubber 17) between the vessel 1 and the heat sink 18.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Document <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2003036723A"><text>JP 2003 036723 A</text></patcit> (<figref idrefs="f0004 f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0006">6</figref>) discloses a discharge lamp with a tubular vessel 2, an UV-blocking layer 4 of e.g. copper, aluminum, or silver, surrounding the ends of vessel 2, a holder 19 of metal which acts also also as a heat sink adjacent to the vessel 2, and a thermal interface 14 of conductive rubber between and in mechanical communication with the vessel 2.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">The invention features a plasma apparatus as defined in claim 1 that can provide effective and reliable cooling of the vessel. To this end, the invention features heat removal structures disposed between a heat sink and a vessel. Features of the invention enable a range of applications unavailable in prior plasma systems.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The invention includes a vessel comprising a dielectric material. A dielectric vessel can have surfaces exposed to the plasma which are of a higher purity and which offer a lower recombination rate than obtainable from a metal or coated-metal vessel for reactive neutral species such as O, N, H, F, Cl, and Br.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The invention can provide cooling of a dielectric vessel at power levels up to 100 kW and greater without a need for air blowers or direct fluid cooling of the dielectric vessel. A heat sink, e.g. in the form of a cooled shell, is positioned adjacent to the vessel, with a gap containing a thermally conductive and elastomeric layer.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The gap-filling material provides a thermal-conduction path between the cooled shell and dielectric vessel. The cooled shell can hold the gap-filling material in intimate contact both with the outside of the dielectric vessel and the surface of the cooled shell. This may help to assure good thermal contact between the dielectric vessel, the gap-filling material, and the cooled shell.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Cooling of the vessel provides reliable operation over a broad range of operating powers. Applications of the source include semiconductor processing and process chamber cleaning. Other applications include, for example, supplying of activated gaseous species in chemical processes, and converting or removing of hazardous or undesirable gaseous species from effluent gas streams.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In some preferred embodiments, the invention features a toroidal-shaped vessel. The cooled shell is spaced from the vessel by a thermal interface, i.e. the gap-filling material described above, that provides mechanical accommodation of thermally induced dimensional changes.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The thermal interface absorbs dimensional changes arising from thermal-mechanical mismatch between the cooled shell and the dielectric vessel. The thermal interface can define a very thin spacing between the vessel and the shell.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In some of these embodiments, the cooled shell is actively compressed against the outside surface of the dielectric vessel via a spring-loaded mechanism to keep the thermal interface in intimate thermal contact with both the outside of the dielectric vessel and the cooled shell. A cooled shell having multiple segments joined to each other with spring-loaded mechanisms can support use of a vessel having a complex shape, such as a toroidal shape, and can provide a self-supporting cooling structure that can accommodate thermal-mismatch stresses between the vessel and the shell.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In some embodiments of the invention, the external surface of a dielectric vacuum vessel is coated with a layer that blocks ultraviolet radiation generated by the plasma from passing through the dielectric vessel into the gap, where it could cause degradation of a thermal interface material and/or production of ozone. The coating can be light opaque and/or have reflective and/or absorptive properties. The external coating layer may act as a heat spreading layer and thereby assist cooling of the dielectric vacuum vessel.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Plasma sources and systems, according to principles of the invention, are useful, for example, for processing numerous materials such as solid surfaces, powders, and gases. The systems are also useful for cleaning process chambers in semiconductor processing equipment such as thin film deposition and etching systems. A plasma source can also be used to provide ions for ion implantation and ion milling systems.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In addition, a plasma source can support an etching system used to fabricate semiconductor devices (to etch, for example, silicon, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, aluminum, molybdenum, tungsten and organic materials such as photoresists, polyimides and other polymeric materials.) A plasma source can also support plasma-enhanced deposition of thin-film materials formed from, for example, diamond, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, and aluminum nitride. Both high and low dielectric constant materials as well as conducting and semiconducting materials may be deposited by plasma-enhanced deposition.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The systems are also useful for generating reactive gases such as atomic fluorine, atomic chlorine, atomic bromine, atomic hydrogen, atomic nitrogen, and atomic oxygen. Such reactive gases are useful for reducing, converting, stabilizing or passivating various semiconducting materials such as silicon, germanium and GaAs, and oxides such as silicon dioxide, tantalum oxide, hafnium oxide, tin oxide, zinc oxide, ruthenium oxide and indium-tin oxide. Applications include fluxless soldering, removal of silicon dioxide from silicon surfaces, passivation of silicon surfaces prior to wafer processing and deposition or etching of various materials.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Other applications include modification of surface properties of polymers, metals, ceramics and papers. A system can also support abatement of hazardous or environmentally undesirable gases including fluorine-containing compounds such as CF<sub>4</sub>, NF<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, CHF<sub>3</sub>, SF<sub>6</sub>, and organic compounds such as dioxins and furans and other volatile organic compounds. A system can generate high fluxes of atomic oxygen, atomic chlorine, or atomic fluorine for sterilization.

A plasma system can include one or more vessels, power supply components, metrology components, control components, and other components. Processing can occur in one or more vessels and/or in one or more processing chambers in communication with the one or more vessels. A plasma system can be a source of plasma or reactive gas species generated in a plasma or can be a complete processing tool.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">A "vessel" is a container or portion of a container that contains a gas and/or a plasma, and within which a plasma can be ignited and or/maintained. A toroidal vessel includes at least one dielectric portion, or is formed entirely of dielectric material. A vessel can also be referred to as a plasma body. A vessel is combined with other components, such as power generation and cooling components to form a plasma processing system. A vessel can define channels having a variety of shapes. For example, a channel can have a linear shape, or can have a loop shape (e.g., to support a toroidal plasma).</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">A "channel" is the volume defined and enclosed by a vessel. A channel can contain a gas and/or a plasma, and can be in communication with one or more input ports and one or more output ports of the vessel, for receiving and delivering gas and plasma species. A plasma system can include means to apply a DC or oscillating electric field within the channel. The electric field can maintain a plasma in the channel, and can, alone or in cooperation with other means, ignite a plasma in the channel.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The "length of a channel" is the total path length along which a plasma can reside. For a toroidal channel, the length can be defined as the distance of one circuit around the channel. Thus, a circular-shaped channel has a length equal to the circumference of a circle associated with the middle of the channel.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">A "plasma" is a state of matter that includes a collection of charged particles that are related to a gas. As used herein, a plasma can include neutral atoms and/or molecules associated with the ionized species. The matter in a vessel, after ignition, is herein broadly<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> referred to as a plasma without intending to limit such matter to that consisting solely of species in a plasma state.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">A "toroidal plasma" is a plasma in the form of a closed path and with plasma current circulating in the closed path. A toroidal plasma can reside in a "toroidal channel" enclosed by a "toroidal vessel".</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">"Ignition" is the process of causing an initial breakdown in a gas, to form a plasma. An "ignition electrode" is an electrode that is capacitively coupled to a vessel, and to which a voltage can be applied for ignition of a gas in the vessel. An ignition voltage can be applied, for example, between an ignition electrode and a reference electrode or between an ignition electrode and a conductive portion of a vessel. One or more ignition electrodes can be adjacent to an inner or outer surface of a vessel (the illustrative examples described herein include ignition electrodes adjacent to an outer surface.)</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The term "reference electrode" depending on context herein should be construed broadly to refer to one or more electrodes and/or one or more conductive portions of a vessel that act in cooperation with one or more ignition electrodes.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">"Inert gases" are gases that in many circumstances are non-reactive or have low reaction rates, including argon and the other noble gases.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">"Noble gases" are a group of rare gases that include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and sometimes radon, and that exhibit chemical stability and low reaction rates.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">A "reactive gas" is a gas containing some species that are prone to engage in one or more chemical reactions. Reactive gases include gases that are not inert gases.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">An "activated gas" includes any of ions, free radicals, neutral reactive atoms and molecules.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">A "heat sink" is a structure including one or more portions and/or components for absorption, dissipation and/or removal of heat. A heat sink can also be an electrode, for example, an ignition electrode and a reference electrode.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The above-mentioned features of the invention and others will be described in more detail after first describing some structural and operational aspects of toroidal plasma systems, with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIGS. 1</b></figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>2</b></figref><b>.</b></p><p id="p0046" num="0046"><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIG. 1</b></figref> is a cross-sectional schematic view of a portion of a toroidal plasma system <b>100.</b> The portion includes a vessel <b>110</b> that defines a channel <b>114,</b> magnetic cores <b>102, 104, 106, 108,</b> a gas inlet <b>118,</b> an outlet <b>119,</b> and a mating surface <b>116.</b></p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The vessel <b>110</b> is formed entirely from one or more dielectric materials, or from both conductive and dielectric materials. Appropriate conductive materials include metals such as aluminum, copper, nickel and steel. The vessel <b>100</b> may also be formed from a coated metal such as anodized aluminum or nickel plated aluminum. According to the invention, described in more detail below, the vessel <b>110</b> comprises a dielectric material, and is surrounded by heat sink materials to assist cooling of the dielectric material.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The vessel <b>110</b> includes at least one dielectric region, for example, at the mating surface <b>116,</b> which electrically isolates a portion of the vessel <b>110</b> so that electrical continuity around the vessel <b>110</b> is broken. If the vessel is formed entirely of dielectric material, the vessel <b>110</b> can be formed of a single piece of material, having no joined surfaces, and thus not including the mating surface <b>116.</b></p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Joined surfaces of the vessel <b>110</b> can provide a high vacuum seal. The seal can include an elastomer seal or can be a permanent seal such as a brazed joint.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">As shown, magnetic cores <b>102, 104, 106, 108</b> surround portions of the vessel <b>110,</b> i.e., portions of the channel <b>114.</b> The magnetic cores <b>102, 104, 106, 108,</b> together with primaries (not shown) of a transformer, induce an electric field and a current aligned with the channel <b>114,</b> as described, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US6150628A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,150,628 to Smith et al.</text></patcit> A plasma in the channel <b>114</b> completes a secondary circuit of the transformer.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The transformer can include additional magnetic cores and conductor primary coils that form additional secondary circuits. The primary coils can be powered, for example, by an AC power supply having a frequency, for example, in a range of less than 10kHz to greater<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> than 20 MHz. The choice of frequency will depend on the desired power and voltage to be applied to the plasma.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The selection of optimal operating frequency can depend on the application, the AC power supply, and the magnetic core materials. Gases such as oxygen and nitrogen, for example, having a pressure in a range of 1 Torr to 10 Torr (1 Torr = 133 Pa) can be utilized with particular advantage at a frequency from 50 KHz to 14MHz.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The magnetic cores <b>102, 104, 106, 108</b> can have primary windings that are adjustable. This can permit, for example, the voltage and current applied to the plasma to be optimized for ignition and for a particular process operating condition (for example, for particular pressure, flow rate and gas species conditions.)</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Electrical components can be in a circuit path between an output of the AC power supply and an input of the primary of the magnetic cores <b>102, 104, 106, 108.</b> These components can include resistors, capacitors, and/or inductors. For example, a series inductor can be used to smooth a voltage waveform applied to the plasma, and thus improve plasma stability.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The components can be fixed or variable, with variability controlled, for example, via electrical or mechanical means. The components can form an impedance altering circuit or an impedance matching network.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">A resonant circuit at the output of or built into the AC power supply can be used to raise an ignition voltage and the loop voltage (i.e., the voltage drop along the channel) for ignition purposes. A resonant circuit can also reduce plasma instability arising from AC line fluctuations.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">A DC power source connected to an input of the AC power supply can be obtained via rectification and filtering of an AC line voltage. The DC power source voltage can be regulated via additional circuitry to stabilize the voltage applied to the plasma and to provide regulation relative to variability in AC line voltage. The DC source voltage and current can also be used to control the power delivered to the plasma.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">It can be desirable to monitor various parameters, such as power, current and voltage. Power delivered to the plasma can be estimated, for example, by measuring the power<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> output by the DC power source. Power measurement can be refined by measuring or estimating electrical losses in the electrical elements disposed between the output of the DC power source and the plasma. Power can also be measured, for example, at the output of the AC power supply.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Power delivered to the plasma can be controlled via several means, for example, by varying: the magnitude of the DC power source voltage; the peak current applied to the plasma; the duty cycle of the AC power applied to the plasma; the magnitude of the AC voltage applied to the plasma; and the frequency of the AC power applied to the plasma. The efficiency of the power transfer between the output of the AC power supply and the plasma can be varied to vary the power applied to the plasma.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">To reduce cost and complexity of a plasma source and its AC power supply and control system, these components can be integrated into a single enclosure. Alternatively, to increase flexibility, the plasma source can be separated from any of the following: the AC power supply, the DC power source, and the control system. A dielectric plasma vessel and related cooling and mounting components can be separated from other components to assist component replacement in the field.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The shape of the vessel <b>110</b> can be modified. For example, the vessel <b>110</b> can be a square donut shape (as shown), a rectangular donut shape, a round donut shape, etc.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In operation, a feed gas flows into the gas inlet <b>118.</b> A gas can be fed into the channel <b>114</b> until a pressure between, for example, 0.001 Torr and 1000 Torr is reached. The gas can include an inert gas, a reactive gas or a mixture of at least one inert gas and at least one reactive gas. The gas composition can be varied, for example, by providing one composition for ignition and a second composition for process operating conditions. Portions of the plasma can be delivered from the channel <b>114</b> via the outlet <b>119.</b></p><p id="p0063" num="0063">A plasma system may be configured so that little or none of the ionized species leaves a plasma vessel. Alternatively, some ionized species are delivered from a vessel, for example, to assist processing in a chamber in communication with the vessel. The vessel may also be integrated with a process chamber, so that plasma is generated within the chamber.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Once the gas is ionized, a plasma forms and completes a secondary circuit of the transformer. The electric field in the plasma can be in a range of less than 1 to greater than 100 volt/cm. If only noble gases are present in the vessel <b>110</b>, the electric fields in the plasma can be as low as 1 volt/cm or less. If, however, electronegative gases are present in the chamber, the electric fields in the plasma can be considerably greater than 1 volt/cm.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Operating the vessel <b>110</b> with low electric fields in the channel <b>114</b> can be beneficial because a low potential difference between the plasma and the chamber can reduce erosion of the chamber by energetic ions and related contamination of a material being processed.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The vessel <b>110</b> can include means for generating free charges that provides an initial ionization event that ignites a plasma in the vessel <b>110.</b> The initial ionization event can be a short, high voltage pulse that is applied to the plasma chamber. The pulse can have a voltage of approximately 500-20,000 volts, and can be approximately 0.1 to 10 microseconds long. The initial ionization event may also be generated by use of a high voltage pulse of longer duration, approximately 10 microseconds to 3 seconds, which may be an RF pulse. An inert gas, such as argon, can be inserted into the channel to reduce the voltage required to ignite a plasma. Ultraviolet radiation can also be used to generate the free charges in the vessel <b>110</b> that provide the initial ionization event that ignites the plasma in the vessel <b>110.</b></p><p id="p0067" num="0067">In one implementation, the short, high voltage electric pulse is applied to the primary of the magnetic cores to provide the initial ionization event. In another implementation, the short, high voltage electric pulse is applied to an electrode or electrodes positioned in or on the vessel <b>110.</b> Ignition is described in more detail below, with respect to other illustrative embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Now referring to <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIGS. 2A</b> and <b>2B</b></figref><b>,</b> most examples described herein are directed at symmetrical, loop-shaped dielectric vessels, though plasma systems may have a variety of vessel configurations and materials components.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. <b>2A</b> and <b>2B</b></figref><b>,</b> respectively, are schematic top-view and side-view cross sections of a portion of a plasma system <b>200.</b> The system <b>200</b> includes a vessel <b>210</b><!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> and a magnetic core <b>220d</b> (three optional magnetic cores <b>220a, 220b, 220c</b> are shown in dashed lines.) <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>FIG. 2</b></figref><b>B.</b> illustrates a section through the magnetic core <b>220d</b> and the vessel <b>210.</b> Alternative implementations of the system <b>200</b> include two, three, or more than four magnetic cores.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">The vessel <b>210</b> encloses a channel <b>215,</b> which has a square cross-section shape and within which a plasma can be maintained.

Thus, in this example, the length of the dimension <b>D</b> of the electrode <b>330</b> is the same as the long dimension of the rectangle. When more than one electrode <b>330</b> is included, the total length of the dimension aligned with the channel is herein understood to be the combined length of the dimensions of each of the electrodes <b>330.</b></p><p id="p0076" num="0076">More complex distributions of ignition electrodes can be envisioned, in comparison to that shown in <figref idrefs="f0003"><b>FIG. 3</b></figref><b>.</b> For example, ignition electrodes can be positioned side-to-side or staggered, in addition to the linear distribution of <figref idrefs="f0003"><b>FIG. 3</b></figref><b>.</b> Thus, the total length of the dimension of the ignition electrodes corresponds to a length along the channel that is covered by one or more ignition electrodes.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">A voltage is applied to the electrode 330 to ignite or support ignition of a gas in the channel. The system <b>300</b> can include a reference electrode that is used in cooperation with the ignition electrode <b>330</b> to apply an electric field to the gas in the channel. The reference electrode can be a ground electrode. Alternatively, the ignition electrode <b>330</b> can be a ground electrode while a voltage is applied to the reference electrode. The reference electrode can include one or more portions.

Ignition performance can be improved by increasing the total length. For example, a total length greater than 10% can provide improved ignition.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Some implementations include a total length of the dimension of ignition electrodes in a range of 10% to 80%, or greater. The total length can be 100% of the vessel length (in the case of a toroidal vessel, the total length can be 100% of the length of the vessel, i.e., the circumference of the mid-channel of the vessel, as long as the ignition electrodes have at least one electrical discontinuity.) It will be apparent to one having ordinary skill that the ratio of the electrode length to the channel length is dependent on the chosen definition of channel length. For convenience, the channel length is herein chosen to correspond to the maximum electrode length. It will be apparent the channel length need not be chosen to correspond to the mid-channel and that electrodes can be placed elsewhere than over the mid-channel. Alternatively, ignition electrodes can be defined in terms of area (the area of an ignition electrode is herein understood to be the area of a surface of the electrode that faces the vessel).</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Accordingly, the one or more ignition electrodes <b>330</b> can have a large total area relative to the size of the vessel <b>310.</b> The relationship of the area of the ignition electrode <b>330</b> to the size of the vessel can be expressed, for example, as a total electrode <b>330</b> area to a total external or internal surface area of the vessel <b>310.</b></p><p id="p0082" num="0082">In most implementations, the total ignition electrode <b>330</b> area can be at most 100% of the total external surface area of the vessel <b>310.</b> It will be apparent, however, that ignition electrode portions may reside other than adjacent to an external surface of a vessel, thus enabling the area ratio to be greater than 100%. Further, for example, an ignition electrode having an irregular surface can provide an area ratio of greater than 100%.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">Complete coverage of the vessel <b>310</b> with ignition electrodes is generally not desirable, as there will be an optimum ratio of ignition electrode area to reference electrode area. Hence, the total area of the ignition electrode <b>330</b> can be less than 50% of the external surface area of the vessel <b>310</b> while still covering most of the vessel <b>310</b> with electrodes.
