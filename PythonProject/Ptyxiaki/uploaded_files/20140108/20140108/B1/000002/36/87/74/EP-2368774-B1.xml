The key device includes a key cylinder 101, a key rotor 104, a slider 106, a lever 107, a pin 108 and a spring 109, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref>. The key rotor 104 is rotatably provided in the key cylinder 101. An insertion hole 102 and a guide slit 103 are formed on the key rotor 104. The slider 106 is movably provided in the guide slit 103, and moves in the guide slit 103 along with insertion/removal of a key 105. The lever 107 is swingably provided on the key cylinder 101. An end 107a of the lever 107 engages with a steering lock device 110. Another end 107b of the lever 107 on a key side contacts with the slider 106. The pin 108 is provided on a casing (not shown), and supports the lever 107 swingably. The spring 109 is provided in the key cylinder 101, and urges the other end 107b toward an outer circumferential surface of the key rotor 104.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Upon inserting the key 105 into the insertion hole 102 of the key rotor 104, the slider 106 slides outward of the key rotor 104. The other end 107a is pushed by the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> slider 106, so that the lever 107 swings clockwise in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref>. Next, when the key 105 is turned in its unlock direction, a lock member (not shown) of the steering lock device 100 is unlocked and engages with the end 107a, so that an unlocked state of the steering lock device 100 is kept. At this time, an engagement between the lock member and a steering shaft is released due to a displacement of the lock member from its lock position to its unlock position. As a result, rotation of the steering shaft is made free and it becomes able to drive an automobile.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">On the hand, when the key 105 is rotated to its lock direction from the above unlocked state and the key 105 is removed from the insertion hole 102, the slider 106 slides inward of the key rotor 104. The lever 107 is swung counterclockwise in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref> by the spring 109 along with sliding of the slider 106, so that the steering lock device is locked. At this time, the lock member and the steering shaft are engaged due to a displacement of the lock member from its unlock position to its lock position. As a result, the rotation of the steering shaft is blocked and it becomes unable to drive the automobile.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, in the conventional key device 100, it is required to attach the pin 108 to the lever 107 and its press-fitting process is also required, so that there is a problem of increasing costs.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Therefore, an object of the present invention is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> to provide a steering lock device that doesn't need a pin as a swing pivot point, can control locked/unlocked states of a lock member via a lever along with insertion/removal of a key, and can brings cost reduction.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP59000357U"><text>JP 59-357 U</text></patcit> discloses a steering lock device according to the preamble of claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the invention, one of the pivot-point receive portion and the pivot-point portion is formed as a depressed portion and another thereof is formed as a protruded portion toward the depressed portion, and the protruded portion is supported with urged toward the depressed portion. Since the protruded portion is supported with urged toward the depressed portion, a pin as a swing center is not required, and locking/unlocking the lock member can be controlled via the lever 7 along with insertion/removal of the key. Therefore, assembling workability can be improved, and the number of parts and its costs can be reduced.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The pivot-point receive portion is provided at an open edge of a support hole that is formed on a cylinder case that constitutes an outer shell of the key cylinder, and the pivot-point portion is protruded on the lever and supported by the pivot-point receive portion with inserted into the support hole.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to this, the pivot-point portion is inserted into the support hole and then supported by the pivot-point receive portion provided at the open edge of the support hole. Therefore, a swing range of the lever can be made small by arranging the lever nearer to a center axis of the key cylinder. As a result, a whole size of the device along the radial direction can be made small.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Here, it is preferable that the pivot-point portion is formed as a curved convex portion whose radius is larger than a moving displacement of the pivot-point portion in the radial direction of the key cylinder, and the pivot-point receive portion is formed as the depressed portion that is larger than the pivot-point portion.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to this, since the curved swing pivot-point portion is supported with urged toward the pivot-point receive portion when the lever swings, the lever can smoothly swing about the pivot-point portion as its swing center. In addition, since the pivot-point portion of the lever is supported by the pivot-point receive portion, chattering of the lever can be restricted. Further, since the radius of the pivot-point portion is made larger than the moving displacement of the pivot-point portion, a portion of the pivot-point portion still stays within a coverage of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the pivot-point receive portion even when the pivot-point portion moves. As a result, the pivot-point portion and the pivot-point receive portion can be smoothly coupled with each other when the pivot-point portion approaches to the pivot-point receive portion.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Further, it is preferable that the pivot-point receive portion is formed as a curved concave portion whose curvature radius is larger than the radius of the pivot-point portion.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to this, the pivot-point portion can be received reliably by an inner circumferential surface of the pivot-point receive portion. In addition, since the curvature radius of the inner circumferential surface is set larger than the radius of the pivot-point portion, the pivot-point portion can be smoothly separated away from the pivot-point receive portion during transition from a state where the pivot-point portion is supported with urged toward the pivot-point receive portion to a swinging (displacing) state of the lever about its end portion as its swing center. Similarly, the pivot-point portion can be urged-toward and received-by the pivot-point receive portion smoothly, and then supported thereby.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><heading id="h0004"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015"><ul><li><b>[</b><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 1</b></figref><b>]</b> is a cross-sectional view showing a locked state of a steering lock device according to an embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><b>[</b><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 2</b></figref><b>]</b> is a cross-sectional view showing a key-inserted state of the steering lock device according to the embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><b>[</b><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Fig. 3</b></figref><b>]</b> is a cross-sectional view showing an unlocked state of the steering lock device according to the embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><b>[</b><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Fig. 4</b></figref><b>]</b> is a front view of the steering lock device according to the embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><b>[</b><figref idrefs="f0003"><b>Fig. 5</b></figref><b>]</b> is a cross-sectional view taken along a line V-V shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</li><li><b>[</b><figref idrefs="f0003"><b>Fig. 6</b></figref><b>]</b> is an enlarged view showing a swing pivot-point portion of a lever in the steering lock device according to the embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><b>[</b><figref idrefs="f0004"><b>Fig. 7</b></figref><b>]</b> is a cross-sectional view showing a<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> conventional key device.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT(S)</b></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">Hereinafter, an embodiment according to the present invention will be explained with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Fig. 1 to Fig. 6</figref>.

The lock member 6 is urged toward the steering shaft (downward in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>) by a restoring force of a lock spring 10 that is disposed between the lock member 6 and the housing 2 with compressed. In addition, when the lock member 6 is projected from the housing 2, the lock-side stepped portions 62 contact with housing-side stepped portions 21 to regulate a projected displacement of the lock member 6. When the cam member 5 that is inserted in the interlock hole 61 is rotated clockwise in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig . 5</figref>, the cam member 5 and the cam follower 63 interlocks with each other to displace the lock member 6 upward in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig .5</figref>.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The lever 7 has a long plate shape and is dispose along the axial direction of the key cylinder 3, i.e. along the key cylinder 3, the rotator 40 and the cam member 5.

The other end 72 is formed with<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> a hooked shape at another end of the lever 7 and enabled to contact with the lock member 6. The pivot-point portion 73 is protruded near a center of the lever 7 toward the key rotor 4 and functions as a swing pivot point of the lever 7. The pivot-point portion 73 has a semicircular whose radius is larger than its moving displacement in the radial direction of the key rotor 4. In addition, The one end portion 71 is urged toward the key rotor 4 by a restoring force of a lever spring 9 that is disposed between the lever 7 and the housing with compressed, the lever 7 is supported by after-mentioned pivot-point receive portions 31 in a state where the pivot-point portion 73 is inserted in an after-mentioned support hole 32a.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The key cylinder 3 has the pivot-point receive portions 31 that receive the pivot-point portion 73 of the lever 7. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 6</figref>, the support hole 32a is formed on a cylinder case 32 that constitutes an outer shell of the key cylinder 3. The support hole 32a is a slit along the axial direction of the key cylinder 3, and penetrates from an outer surface to an inner surface of the cylinder case 32. The pivot-point receive portions 31 are provided on both sides along a longitudinal direction at an open edge of the support hole 32a. The pivot-point receive portions 31 are formed as curved surfaces whose curvature radius is slightly larger than a radius of the pivot-point portion 73. Note that, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">Fig. 1 to Fig. 3</figref>, gullet portions 74 are formed on the lever 7 on both sides of the pivot-point portion 73.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> Contacts between the lever 7 and the pivot-point receive portions 31 are prevented by the gullet portions 74, so that sufficient swing range of the lever 7 can be ensured.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to the steering lock device 1 with the above-described configuration, in a locked state of the lock member 6 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>, the pivot-point portion 73 is contacted with the pivot-point receive portions 31 by the lever spring 9 to function as a swing center, the one end portion 71 pushes the slider 43 into an inside of the key rotor 4, and the other end portion 72 is separated away from the lock member 6.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Subsequently, the key 8 is inserted into the key rotor 4 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, so that the slider 43 is pushed outward and the one end 71 is pushed outward from the key rotor 4 via the slider 43. The lever 7 swings counterclockwise in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> about the pivot-point portion 73 as its swing center in a state where the pivot-point portion 73 and the pivot-point receive portions 31 contact with each other, so that the other end portion 72 contacts with the lock member 6. After the other end portion 72 contacts with the lock member 6, the lever 7 swings about the other end portion 72 as its swing center, so that the pivot-point portion 73 is separated away from the pivot-point receive portions 31.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Subsequently, the key 8 is rotated to an unlock direction (clockwise in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref>) as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, so that the cam member 5 is rotated in the unlock direction along<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> with the key rotor 4 and the lock member 6 is retracted in the housing 2 due to interlocking between the cam member 5 and the interlock hole 61. When the lock member 6 is retracted in the housing 2, gaps are formed between the housing-side stepped portions 21 and the lock-side stepped portions 62. At this time, the lever 7 swings about the one end portion 71 as its swing center due to an urging force of the lever spring 9. As a result, the pivot-point portion 73 contacts with the pivot-point receive portions 31, and the other end portion 72 is inserted into the gap between housing-side stepped portion 21 and the lock-side stepped portion 62. Since the other end portion 72 is inserted into the gap between housing-side stepped portion 21 and the lock-side stepped portion 62, the other end portion 72 and the lock-side stepped portion 62 are engaged with each other to keep an unlocked state of the lock member 6.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">And, the key 8 is removed after rotated in an unlock direction (counterclockwise in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref>) in the unlocked state, so that the one end portion 71 is released from being pressed by the slider 43. As a result, the lever 7 swings about the pivot-point portion 73 as its swing center due to the urging force of the lever spring 9, and the engagement between the other end portion 72 and the lock member 6 is released. In addition, since the cam member 5 is rotated in the lock direction along with the key rotor 4, the lock member 6 is set in the locked state due to an urging force of the lock spring 10. As a result, the lock member 6 engages with<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the steering shaft to prevent the steering shaft from rotating.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">According to the present embodiment, a pin as a swing pivot point is not required, and locking/unlocking the lock member 6 can be controlled via the lever 7 along with insertion/removal of the key 8. Therefore, assembling workability can be improved, and the number of parts and its costs can be reduced.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In the above embodiment, since a curved outer circumference surface 73a of the pivot-point portion 73 contacts with the pivot-point receive portions 31 when the lever 7 swings, the lever 7 can smoothly swing about the pivot-point portion 73 as its swing center. In addition, since the pivot-point portion 73 of the lever 7 is supported by the pivot-point receive portions 31, chattering of the lever 7 can be restricted. Further, since the radius of the outer circumference surface 73a of the pivot-point portion 73 is made larger than the moving displacement of the pivot-point portion 73 in the radial direction of the key cylinder 3 (the key rotor 4), a portion of the pivot-point portion 73 still stays within a coverage of the pivot-point receive portions 31 even when the pivot-point portion 73 moves. As a result, the pivot-point portion 73 and the pivot-point receive portions 31 can be smoothly coupled with each other when the pivot-point portion 73 approaches to the pivot-point receive portions 31.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the above embodiment, the pivot-point portion<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> 73 of the lever 7 can be received reliably by inner circumferential surfaces 31a that are formed to be curved. In addition, since the curvature radius of the inner circumferential surfaces 31a is set larger than the radius of the outer circumference surface 73a, the pivot-point portion 73 can be smoothly separated away from the pivot-point receive portions 31 during transition from an engagement state between the pivot-point portion 73 and the pivot-point receive portions 31 to a swinging (displacing) state of the lever 7 about the other end portion 72 as its swing center. Similarly, the pivot-point portion 73 can be smoothly received by the pivot-point receive portions 31.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In the above embodiment, the pivot-point portion 73 is inserted into the support hole 32a and then supported by the pivot-point receive portions 31 provided at the open edge of the support hole 32a. Therefore, the swing range of the lever 7 can be made small by arranging the lever 7 nearer to a center axis of the key cylinder 3. As a result, a whole size of the device along the radial direction can be made small.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56985572" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Lenkschlossvorrichtung (1), die umfasst:
