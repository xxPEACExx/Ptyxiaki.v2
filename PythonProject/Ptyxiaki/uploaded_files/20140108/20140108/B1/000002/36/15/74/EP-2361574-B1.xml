In particular, the invention relates to a bone screw which can be used as an anchor screw and a fusion screw which fuses with the surrounding bone material.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">A bone screw which can be used as a fusion screw is known from <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20040015172A1"><text>US 2004/0015172 A1</text></patcit>. This bone screw has a tubular thread section with a bone thread and with a plurality of recesses in its wall, a head and a tip which can be connected to the tubular thread section. In use the tubular portion can be filled with bone material or other growth promoting material and then the tip and/or the head are connected to the tubular portion. Usually the screw is inserted into a core hole in the bone which is prepared in advance. After insertion of the screw into the bone, fusion of the screw with the surrounding bone material takes place. The screw can act as a traction element to connect shattered or split off parts of bones together by means of the screw.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20040225292A1"><text>US 2004/0225292 A1</text></patcit> discloses a bone screw according to the preamble of claim 1.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is the object of the invention to provide an improved bone screw of the afore mentioned type the position of which in the bone can be corrected after insertion and which can be easily removed later, if required.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The object is solved by a bone screw according to claim 1. Further developments are given in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The bone screw according to the invention is fillable with a substance to support fusion and precisely positionable. When the bone screw is inserted into a core hole which has been prepared in advance, the bone thread at the exterior wall surface engages the bone and the screw is advanced by screwing it deeper into the bone by means of a screw driver. To adjust the position of the bone screw, it might be necessary to screw it back to reposition the screw. This is facilitated,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> since the head and the tubular body of the bone screw are firmly connected without a risk of loosening or disconnection.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The bone screw can act as a bone anchor or can be used to connect broken elements of bones or as a support beam to strengthen weak bones.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In certain situations, it might be clinically necessary to remove an implanted bone screw at a later stage which may have already fused with the surrounding bone material. Since the head and the tubular body are integrally formed, it is possible to remove a bone screw, which already has fused with the surrounding bone material.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the description of embodiments of the invention by means of the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the drawings:

The tubular body is substantially<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> cylindrical. It has a tubular wall defining a cavity. On the exterior surface of the tubular wall, a so-called bone thread 4 is provided. In the embodiment as shown, the bone thread 4 is provided along the whole length of the tubular body 1. The bone thread 4 is configured to cut into the bone when the bone screw is screwed-in to the bone. Further, a plurality of openings 5 are located in the tubular wall, which extend entirely through the tubular wall into the cavity. The openings 5 are shown as diamond-shaped and are located between the crests of the bone thread 4. However, any other variation of the shapes and locations of the openings 5 are conceivable.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The cavity provided by the tubular body 1 has a volume which is suitable for accommodating bone material, for example bone chips. The wall thickness of the tubular body 1 is smaller than an inner radius r of the cavity formed by the tubular body. More preferably, the wall thickness of the tubular body is smaller than about 15 % of the outer diameter of the tubular body.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Adjacent the first end 2 a head 8 is formed in one piece with the tubular body 1. Adjacent the second end 3 a tip 9 is formed in one piece with the tubular body 1. As a result thereof, the bone screw is a one-piece screw. The head 8 has a largest outer diameter which is larger than the outer diameter of the bone thread of the tubular body 1. As seen in particular in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, the head 8 has an upper side 81 facing away from the tubular body 1 and a lower side 82 facing the tubular body 1. A surface of the upper side 81 can be lens-shaped, dome-shaped, flat or otherwise shaped. The surface of the lower side 82 comprises a flat portion for abutment against the bone surface. In the embodiment shown the whole lower side 82 is flat.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A coaxial bore 83 extends from the upper side 81 to the lower side 82 and is continuous with the cavity formed by the tubular body 1. Further, a recess 84 is provided at the upper side 81 for engagement with a screw-driver. In the embodiment shown, the recess is star-shaped. However, it can have any other suitable shape, such as a hexagon or other polygon shape which allows a form-fit engagement with a screw-driver. The inner diameter of the recess 84 is larger than the inner diameter of the coaxial bore 83. It is possible to fill the bone screw with bone chips or other bone materials through the recess 84 and the coaxial bore 83 since the size of coaxial bore 83 is large enough to allow the introduction of small bone parts.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The tip 9 is formed as a solid tip without a channel extending therethrough.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The bone screw is made of a body-compatible material, such as a body-compatible metal, for example stainless steel or titanium, a body-compatible metal alloy, for example a Ni-Ti-alloy, such as Nitinol, or made of a body-compatible plastic material, for example PEEK.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The tubular body or other parts of the bone screw can be coated with an in-growth promoting material or can be roughened to enhance in-growth of bone or vessels.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In use, first, bone chips are filled into the cavity provided by the tubular body 1. The thus prepared bone screw can then be inserted into a core hole in the bone which has been prepared in advance. Slight corrections of the position of the bone screw in the core hole can be made by rotating the screw-driver in the reverse direction, so that the screw is screwed back. In some clinical applications the bone screw is used as compression screw which connects broken bone fragments by compressing them. The flat surface provided at the lower side acts as an abutment against the bone surface. After a certain time, fusion of the surrounding bone with the bone screw takes place. It is possible to remove an implanted bone screw at a later stage which may have already fused with its surrounding bone material.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A kit of several bone screws with different volumes of the cavity, a different diameter and different lengths can be provided. The surgeon selects the appropriate bone screw and fills it with bone material and inserts it into the bone. Since the bone screw is a single piece it is simple to handle.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A modification of the bone thread is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 4</figref>. The crests 4' of the bone thread are interrupted at regular distances, i.e. crest portions 4a' are arranged on a helical line around the exterior wall surface of the tubular body 1. The crest portions may have inclined surfaces 4b extending in the direction of the helix and in a reverse direction. The openings 5' are oval-shaped.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Furthermore, a modified embodiment is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 5</figref>. The modified embodiment of the bone screw differs from the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1 to 3</figref> in that additionally a plug member 10 is provided for closing the cavity at the side of the head 8. The plug member 10 has a contour<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> and a size which fits into the recess 84 so that the bore 83 and therefore the cavity is closed. The plug member 10 can have an engagement portion 11 for engagement with a screw-driver or a holding instrument.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In use, the plug member 10 can be inserted after filling the cavity with bone material and before inserting the bone screw into the core hole. Alternatively, the plug member can be inserted after the bone screw has been inserted into the core hole and brought to its final position.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">A further modified embodiment is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 6</figref>. The bone screw according to the modified embodiment has a cannulated tip 9' with a channel 91 which has a size such that a guide wire 100 can be guided therethrough. Further, a guide member 20 can be provided which is insertable into the tubular body. The guide member 20 can be a plug-like member which is sized such that the plug member 20 is held mainly by friction within the tubular body 1. The guide member 20 has a coaxial bore 21 which is sized such that the guide wire 100 can be passed therethrough and is guided by the guide member 20.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The modified embodiment which can be used with a guide wire is particularly applied in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). In this case the guide wire is introduced the skin of the patient and advanced through the tissue until it reaches the position where the bone screw has to be placed. The guide wire is inserted into the bone to the appropriate direction and depth. The bone screw is then guided along the guide wire extending therethrough until it reaches the surface of the bone and then screwed into the bone guided by the guide wire.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Further modifications of the bone screw are possible. For example, the tip can be formed as a self-cutting tip which is configured to cut the bone.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The head 8 can have a largest outer diameter which is equal to or smaller than the largest outer diameter of the tubular body 1 so that the bone screw can be immersed into the bone to a certain depth without any portion of the bone screw projecting above the surface of the bone.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56985623" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Knochenschraube umfassend<br/>
