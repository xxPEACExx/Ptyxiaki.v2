load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA), and its use in mediating RNA interference to inhibit the expression of the Factor V Leiden mutant gene and the use of the dsRNA to treat thrombophilia.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Factor V Leiden thrombophilia is characterized by a poor anticoagulant response to activated protein C (APC) and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. The term "factor V Leiden" refers to the specific G-to-A substitution at nucleotide 1691 in the gene for factor V that predicts a single amino acid replacement (Arg506Gln) at one of three APC cleavage sites in the factor Va molecule. Factor V Leiden is inactivated at a rate approximately ten times slower than normal factor V and persists longer in the circulation, resulting in increased thrombin generation and a mild hypercoagulable state reflected by elevated levels of prothrombin fragment F1+2 and other activated coagulation markers. Individuals heterozygous for the factor V Leiden mutation have a slightly increased risk for venous thrombosis; homozygous individuals have a much greater thrombotic risk.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Factor V Leiden is the most common hereditary blood coagulation disorder in the United States. It is present 5% of the in the Caucasian population and 1.2% of the African American population.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Factor V Leiden increases the risk of venous thrombosis 3-8 fold for heterozygous (one damaged gene inherited) and substantially more, 30-140 fold, for homozygous (two damaged genes inherited) individuals.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with the attendant risk of pulmonary embolism and post phlebitic syndrome is a frequent complication in older patients who have undergone surgery, suffered trauma or who have serious illness such as malignancy or sepsis. In any category patients who are 40 years of age or older are considered to be at greatest risk. Also the longer the period of immobilization the greater the risk of DVT. Other factors that have been reported to contribute to development of DVT are obesity, prior history of DVT and smoking. While none of these factors alone or in combination will identify individual patients who will develop DVT, the incidence of DVT during the postoperative or post-traumatic period does correlate with the condition.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">DVT has three major risks for the patient, two acute and one delayed. The acute problems are leg swelling, pain and tenderness and the risk of pulmonary embolism. In pulmonary embolism part of the thrombus breaks away and is carried to the lung where it can block a pulmonary artery causing respiratory distress in proportion to the amount of blockage, i.e., to the size of the embolus. Large emboli that block both pulmonary arteries cause immediate death. The delayed problem is the post phlebitic syndrome in which there is lower extremity pain or cramps at rest, leg edema, skin changes and skin breakdown causing chronic ulcers of the lower extremity. Clinicians have long known that the post phlebitic syndrome develops in a large percentage of patients who have DVT, especially those having extensive thrombus formation. Objective studies have shown that 1-10 years following the occurrence of DVT as much as 80% of patients will have both symptoms and abnormal venous hemodynamics (Lindner et al, 1986; Markel et al, 1992). While the post phlebitic syndrome is less dramatic than a major pulmonary embolus, it is a serious condition for the patients, resulting in much discomfort and expense.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In some patient groups DVT and pulmonary embolism are major causes of morbidity and mortality. Thromboembolism is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with spinal cord injury. The prevalence of DVT has been reported<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> to range from 47% (Merli et al, 1988) to 78% (Green et al, 1982). Of these 1 to 2% will die of pulmonary embolism (Green, 1991). Thrombosis usually occurs 1 to 3 weeks after injury, with a peak between days 7 and 9. The incidence of thromboembolic complications in patients undergoing surgery for fractured hip is high, ranging from about 40-60% (Powers et al, 1989; Fordyce and Ling, 1992; Turpie, 1991; Levine et al, 1991; Hull et al, 1990). In patients undergoing knee arthroplasty the incidence of DVT ranges from about 50% to 85% (Stulberg et al, 1984; Leclerc et al, 1992; Wilson et al, 1992). In gynecologic malignancy the incidence of DVT was 35% (Clarke-Person et al, 1984). The incidence of DVT in patients undergoing elective general abdominal surgery was about 9% in those without malignancy and about 11 % in those with malignancies (Bergqvist et al, Seminars in Thromb &amp; Hemost 16 Suppl 19-24, 1990).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">For about 50 years efforts to prevent development of DVT and to treat those that do develop have focused on the judicious use of anticoagulants, first through full doses of oral anticoagulants and more recently through low dose heparin prophylaxis (Gallus, 1990). The aim has been to achieve a helpful degree of anticoagulation (prolongation of the clotting process) without causing hemorrhage. Low dose heparin has become the standard of comparison for other preventive methods since it is relatively safe and simple and prevents approximately 65% of subclinical thrombi found by leg scanning after elective general surgery. Postoperative death from pulmonary emboli may be reduced by 65% also.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, there are clinical situations in which low dose heparin is less effective, most notable after orthopedic surgery where the use of more complex regimens, including adjusted dose heparin and various schedules of warfarin prophylaxis are appropriate. Several studies have shown that higher levels of anticoagulation are more effective than lower ones. However, if anticoagulation is too high, bleeding complications result.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Recently, double-stranded RNA molecules (dsRNA) have been shown to block gene expression in a highly conserved regulatory mechanism known as RNA interference (RNAi). <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO9932619A"><text>WO 99/32619 (Fire et al.</text></patcit>) discloses the use of a dsRNA of at least 25 nucleotides in length to inhibit the expression of the Factor V Leiden mutant gene in C. <i>elegans.</i> dsRNA has also been shown to degrade target RNA in other organisms, including plants (see, e.g., <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO9953050A"><text>WO 99/53050, Waterhouse et al.</text></patcit>; and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO9961631A"><text>WO 99/61631, Heifetz et al.</text></patcit>), <i>Drosophila</i> (see, e.g., <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Yang, D., et al., Curr.

The skilled person is well aware that guanine, cytosine, adenine, and uracil may be replaced by other moieties without substantially altering the base pairing properties of an oligonucleotide comprising a nucleotide bearing such replacement moiety. For example, without limitation, a nucleotide comprising inosine as its base may base pair with nucleotides containing adenine, cytosine, or uracil. Hence, nucleotides containing uracil, guanine, or adenine may be replaced in the nucleotide sequences of the invention by a nucleotide containing, for example, inosine.

Where the two strands are part of one larger molecule, and therefore are connected by an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides between the 3'-end of one strand and the 5'end of the respective other strand forming the duplex structure, the connecting RNA chain is referred to as a "hairpin loop". Where the two strands are connected covalently by means other than an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides between the 3'-end of one strand and the 5'end of the respective other strand forming the duplex structure, the connecting structure is referred to as a "linker". The RNA strands may have the same or a different number of nucleotides. The maximum number of base pairs is the number of nucleotides in the shortest strand of the dsRNA.

The dsRNA comprises two RNA strands that are sufficiently complementary to hybridize to form a duplex structure. One strand of the dsRNA (the antisense strand) comprises a region of complementarity that is substantially complementary, and preferably fully complementary, to a target sequence, derived from the sequence of an mRNA formed during the expression of the Factor V Leiden mutant gene, the other strand (the sense<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> strand) comprises a region which is complementary to the antisense strand, such that the two strands hybridize and form a duplex structure when combined under suitable conditions. Preferably, the duplex structure is between 15 and 30, more preferably between 18 and 25, yet more preferably between 19 and 24, and most preferably between 21 and 23 base pairs in length. Similarly, the region of complementarity to the target sequence is between 15 and 30, more preferably between 18 and 25, yet more preferably between 19 and 24, and most preferably between 21 and 23 nucleotides in length. The dsRNA may further comprise one or more single-stranded nucleotide overhang(s). The dsRNA can be synthesized by standard methods known in the art as further discussed below, e.g., by use of an automated DNA synthesizer, such as are commercially available from, for example, Biosearch, Applied Biosystems, Inc. The Factor V Leiden mutant gene may be the human Factor V Leiden mutant gene. The antisense strand of the dsRNA may comprise the sense sequences of Table 1 and the second sequence may be selected from the group consisting of the antisense sequences of Table 1.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The skilled person is well aware that dsRNAs comprising a duplex structure of between 20 and 23, but specifically 21, base pairs have been hailed as particularly effective in inducing RNA interference (<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Elbashir et al., EMBO 2001, 20:6877-6888</text></nplcit>). However, others have found that shorter or longer dsRNAs can be effective as well. In the embodiments described above, by virtue of the nature of the oligonucleotide sequences provided in Table 1, the dsRNAs of the invention can comprise at least one strand of a length of minimally 21 nt. It can be reasonably expected that shorter dsRNAs comprising one of the sequences of Table 1 minus only a few nucleotides on one or both ends may be similarly effective as compared to the dsRNAs described above. Hence, dsRNAs comprising a partial sequence of at least 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or more contiguous nucleotides from one of the sequences of Table 1, and differing in their ability to inhibit the expression of the Factor V Leiden mutant gene in a FACS assay as described herein below by not more than 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 %<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> inhibition from a dsRNA comprising the full sequence, are contemplated by the invention.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The dsRNA of the invention can contain one, two, three or four mismatches to the target sequence. If the antisense strand of the dsRNA contains mismatches to a target sequence, it is preferable that the area of mismatch not be located in the center of the region of complementarity. If the antisense strand of the dsRNA contains mismatches to the target sequence, it is preferable that the mismatch be restricted to 5 nucleotides from either end, for example 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 nucleotide from either the 5' or 3' end of the region of complementarity. For example, for a 23 nucleotide dsRNA strand which is complementary to a region of the Factor V Leiden mutant gene, the dsRNA preferably does not contain any mismatch within the central 13 nucleotides. The methods described herein can be used to determine whether a dsRNA containing a mismatch to a target sequence is effective in inhibiting the expression of the Factor V Leiden mutant gene. Consideration of the efficacy of dsRNAs with mismatches in inhibiting expression of the Factor V Leiden mutant gene is important, especially if the particular region of complementarity in the Factor V Leiden mutant gene is known to have polymorphic sequence variation within the population.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">At least one end of the dsRNA may have a single-stranded nucleotide overhang of 1 to 4, preferably 1 or 2 nucleotides. dsRNAs having at least one nucleotide overhang have unexpectedly superior inhibitory properties than their bluntended counterparts. Moreover, the present inventors have discovered that the presence of only one nucleotide overhang strengthens the interference activity of the dsRNA, without affecting its overall stability. dsRNA having only one overhang has proven particularly stable and effective in vivo, as well as in a variety of cells, cell culture mediums, blood, and serum. Preferably, the single-stranded overhang is located at the 3'-terminal end of the antisense strand or, alternatively, at the 3'-terminal end of the sense strand. The dsRNA may also have a blunt end, preferably located at the 5'-end of the antisense strand. Such dsRNAs have improved stability<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> and inhibitory activity, thus allowing administration at low dosages, i.e., less than 5 mg/kg body weight of the recipient per day. Preferably, the antisense strand of the dsRNA has a nucleotide overhang at the 3'-end, and the 5'-end is blunt.

Chemical modifications may include, but are not limited to 2' modifications, introduction of non-natural bases, covalent attachment to a ligand, and replacement of phosphate linkages with thiophosphate linkages. The integrity of the duplex structure may be strengthened by at least one, and preferably two, chemical linkages. Chemical linking may be achieved by any of a variety of well-known techniques, for example by introducing covalent, ionic or hydrogen bonds; hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals or stacking interactions; by means of metal-ion coordination, or through use of purine analogues. Preferably, the chemical groups that can be used to modify the dsRNA include, without limitation, methylene blue; bifunctional groups, preferably bis-(2-chloroethyl)amine; N-acetyl-N'-(p-glyoxylbenzoyl)cystamine; 4-thiouracil; and psoralen. The linker may be a hexa-ethylene glycol linker. In this case, the dsRNA are produced by solid phase synthesis and the hexa-ethylene glycol linker is incorporated according to standard methods (e.g., <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Williams, D.J., and K.B. Hall, Biochem. (1996) 35:14665-14670</text></nplcit>). The 5'-end of the antisense strand and the 3'-end of the sense strand may be chemically linked via a hexaethylene glycol linker. At least one nucleotide of the dsRNA may comprise a phosphorothioate or phosphorodithioate groups. The chemical bond at the ends of the dsRNA is<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> preferably formed by triple-helix bonds. Table 1 provides examples of modieifed RNAi agents.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">A chemical bond may be formed by means of one or several bonding groups, wherein such bonding groups are preferably poly-(oxyphosphinicooxy-1,3-propandiol)- and/or polyethylene glycol chains. A chemical bond may also be formed by means of purine analogs introduced into the double-stranded structure instead of purines. A chemical bond may be formed by azabenzene units introduced into the double-stranded structure. A chemical bond may be formed by branched nucleotide analogs instead of nucleotides introduced into the double-stranded structure. A chemical bond may be induced by ultraviolet light.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The nucleotides at one or both of the two single strands may be modified to prevent or inhibit the activation of cellular enzymes, such as, for example, without limitation, certain nucleases. Techniques for inhibiting the activation of cellular enzymes are known in the art including, but not limited to, 2'-amino modifications, 2'-amino sugar modifications, 2'-F sugar modifications, 2'-F modifications, 2'-alkyl sugar modifications, uncharged backbone modifications, morpholino modifications, 2'-O-methyl modifications, and phosphoramidate (see, e.g., <nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>Wagner, Nat. Med. (1995) 1:1116-8</text></nplcit>). Thus, at least one 2'-hydroxyl group of the nucleotides on a dsRNA is replaced by a chemical group, preferably by a 2'-amino or a 2'-methyl group. Also, at least one nucleotide may be modified to form a locked nucleotide. Such locked nucleotide contains a methylene bridge that connects the 2'-oxygen of ribose with the 4'-carbon of ribose. Oligonucleotides containing the locked nucleotide are described in<nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text> Koshkin, A.A., et al., Tetrahedron (1998), 54: 3607-3630</text></nplcit>) and <nplcit id="ncit0007" npl-type="s"><text>Obika, S. et al., Tetrahedron Lett.

In certain instances, a hydrophobic ligand is conjugated to the dsRNA to facilitate direct permeation of the cellular membrane. Alternatively, the ligand conjugated to the dsRNA is a substrate for receptor-mediated endocytosis. These approaches have been used to facilitate cell permeation of antisense oligonucleotides. For example, cholesterol has been conjugated to various antisense oligonucleotides resulting in compounds that are substantially more active compared to their non-conjugated analogs. See <nplcit id="ncit0009" npl-type="s"><text>M. Manoharan Antisense &amp; Nucleic Acid Drug Development 2002, 12, 103</text></nplcit>. Other lipophilic compounds that have been conjugated to oligonucleotides include 1-pyrene butyric acid, 1,3-bis-O-(hexadecyl)glycerol, and menthol. One example of a ligand for receptor-mediated endocytosis is folic acid. Folic acid enters the cell by folate-receptor-mediated endocytosis. dsRNA compounds bearing folic acid would be efficiently transported into the cell via the folate-receptor-mediated endocytosis. Li and coworkers report that attachment of folic acid to the 3'-terminus of an oligonucleotide resulted in an 8-fold increase in cellular uptake of the oligonucleotide.<nplcit id="ncit0010" npl-type="s"><text> Li, S.; Deshmukh, H.

The methods of the invention facilitate the synthesis of ligand-conjugated dsRNA by the use of, in some preferred embodiments, nucleoside monomers that have been appropriately conjugated with ligands and that may further be attached to a solid-support material. Such ligand-nucleoside conjugates, optionally attached to a solid-support material, are prepared according to some preferred embodiments of the methods of the invention via reaction of a selected serum-binding ligand with a linking moiety located on the 5' position of a nucleoside or oligonucleotide.

Ther., 1996, 277:923</text></nplcit>). Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of such oligonucleotide conjugates have been listed above. Typical conjugation protocols involve the synthesis of oligonucleotides bearing an aminolinker at one or more positions of the sequence. The amino group is then reacted with the molecule being conjugated using appropriate coupling or activating reagents. The conjugation reaction may be performed either with the oligonucleotide still bound to the solid support or following cleavage of the oligonucleotide in solution phase. Purification of the oligonucleotide conjugate by HPLC typically affords the pure conjugate. The use of a cholesterol conjugate is particularly preferred since such a moiety can increase targeting to tissues in the liver, a site of Factor V protein production.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">Alternatively, the molecule being conjugated may be converted into a building block, such as a phosphoramidite, via an alcohol group present in the molecule or by attachment of a linker bearing an alcohol group that may be phosphitylated.<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --></p><p id="p0099" num="0099">Importantly, each of these approaches may be used for the synthesis of ligand conjugated oligonucleotides. Aminolinked oligonucleotides may be coupled directly with ligand via the use of coupling reagents or following activation of the ligand as an NHS or pentfluorophenolate ester. Ligand phosphoramidites may be synthesized via the attachment of an aminohexanol linker to one of the carboxyl groups followed by phosphitylation of the terminal alcohol functionality. Other linkers, such as cysteamine, may also be utilized for conjugation to a chloroacetyl linker present on a synthesized oligonucleotide.</p><heading id="h0003">III. <u>Pharmaceutical compositions comprising dsRNA</u></heading><p id="p0100" num="0100">In one embodiment, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a dsRNA, as defined in the claims, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition comprising the dsRNA is useful for treating a disease or disorder associated with the expression or activity of the Factor V Leiden mutant gene, such as thrombophilia.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are administered in dosages sufficient to inhibit expression of the Factor V Leiden mutant gene. The present inventors have found that, because of their improved efficiency, compositions comprising the dsRNA of the invention can be administered at surprisingly low dosages. A maximum dosage of 5 mg dsRNA per kilogram body weight of recipient per day is sufficient to inhibit or completely suppress expression of the Factor V Leiden mutant gene.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">In general, a suitable dose of dsRNA will be in the range of 0.01 to 5.0 milligrams per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, preferably in the range of 0.1 to 200 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day, more preferably in the range of 0.1 to 100 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day, even more preferably in the range of 1.0 to 50 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day, and most preferably in the range of 1.0 to 25 micrograms per kilogram body weight per<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> day. The pharmaceutical composition may be administered once daily, or the dsRNA may be administered as two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day or even using continuous infusion. In that case, the dsRNA contained in each sub-dose must be correspondingly smaller in order to achieve the total daily dosage. The dosage unit can also be compounded for delivery over several days, e.g., using a conventional sustained release formulation which provides sustained release of the dsRNA over a several day period. Sustained release formulations are well known in the art. The dosage unit may contain a corresponding multiple of the daily dose.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage and timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a composition can include a single treatment or a series of treatments. Estimates of effective dosages and in vivo half-lives for the individual dsRNAs encompassed by the invention can be made using conventional methodologies or on the basis of in vivo testing using an appropriate animal model, as described elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">Advances in mouse genetics have generated a number of mouse models for the study of various human diseases, such as thrombophilia. Such models are used for in vivo testing of dsRNA, as well as for determining a therapeutically effective dose.</p><p id="p0105" num="0105">The pharmaceutical compositions encompassed by the invention may be administered by any means known in the art including, but not limited to oral or parenteral routes, including intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, transdermal, airway (aerosol), rectal, vaginal and topical (including buccal and<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> sublingual) administration. The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered intraveneously.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">For intramuscular, subcutaneous and intravenous use, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will generally be provided in sterile aqueous solutions or suspensions, buffered to an appropriate pH and isotonicity. Suitable aqueous vehicles include Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride. In a preferred embodiment, the carrier consists exclusively of an aqueous buffer. In this context, "exclusively" means no auxiliary agents or encapsulating substances are present which might affect or mediate uptake of dsRNA in the cells that express the Factor V Leiden mutant gene. Such substances include, for example, micellar structures, such as liposomes or capsids, as described below. Surprisingly, the present inventors have discovered that compositions containing only naked dsRNA and a physiologically acceptable solvent are taken up by cells, where the dsRNA effectively inhibits expression of the Factor V Leiden mutant gene. Although microinjection, lipofection, viruses, viroids, capsids, capsoids, or other auxiliary agents are required to introduce dsRNA into cell cultures, surprisingly these methods and agents are not necessary for uptake of dsRNA in vivo. Aqueous suspensions according to the invention may include suspending agents such as cellulose derivatives, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone and gum tragacanth, and a wetting agent such as lecithin. Suitable preservatives for aqueous suspensions include ethyl and n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate.</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">The pharmaceutical compositions also include encapsulated formulations to protect the dsRNA against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in <patcit id="pcit0198" dnum="US4522811A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,522,811</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0199" dnum="WO9106309A"><text>PCT publication WO 91/06309</text></patcit>; and European patent publication <patcit id="pcit0200" dnum="EP43075A"><text>EP-A-43075</text></patcit>, which are incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">Described are furthermore devices containing the RNAi agents of the present invention, such as devices that come into contact with the blood. Examples of devices that come into contact with blood include vascular grafts, stents, orthopedic prosthesis, cardiac prosthesis, and extracorporeal circulation systems.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulation a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of compositions of the invention lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays.

Recombinant retroviral vectors capable of transducing and expressing genes inserted into the genome of a cell can be produced by transfecting the recombinant retroviral genome into suitable packaging cell lines such as PA317 and Psi-CRIP (<nplcit id="ncit0080" npl-type="s"><text>Comette et al., 1991, Human Gene Therapy 2:5-10</text></nplcit>;<nplcit id="ncit0081" npl-type="s"><text> Cone et al., 1984, Proc.

Recombinant adenoviral vectors can be used to infect a wide variety of cells and tissues in susceptible hosts (e.g., rat, hamster, dog, and<!-- EPO <DP n="57"> --> chimpanzee) (<nplcit id="ncit0082" npl-type="s"><text>Hsu et al., 1992, J. Infectious Disease, 166:769</text></nplcit>), and also have the advantage of not requiring mitotically active cells for infection.</p><p id="p0154" num="0154">The promoter driving dsRNA expression in either a DNA plasmid or viral vector of the invention may be a eukaryotic RNA polymerase I (e.g. ribosomal RNA promoter), RNA polymerase II (e.g. CMV early promoter or actin promoter or U1 snRNA promoter) or preferably RNA polymerase III promoter (e.g. U6 snRNA or 7SK RNA promoter) or a prokaryotic promoter, for example the T7 promoter, provided the expression plasmid also encodes T7 RNA polymerase required for transcription from a T7 promoter. The promoter can also direct transgene expression to the pancreas (see, e.g. the insulin regulatory sequence for pancreas (<nplcit id="ncit0083" npl-type="s"><text>Bucchini et al., 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:2511-2515</text></nplcit>)).</p><p id="p0155" num="0155">In addition, expression of the transgene can be precisely regulated, for example, by using an inducible regulatory sequence and expression systems such as a regulatory sequence that is sensitive to certain physiological regulators, e.g., circulating glucose levels, or hormones (<nplcit id="ncit0084" npl-type="s"><text>Docherty et al., 1994, FASEB J. 8:20-24</text></nplcit>). Such inducible expression systems, suitable for the control of transgene expression in cells or in mammals include regulation by ecdysone, by estrogen, progesterone, tetracycline, chemical inducers of dimerization, and isopropyl-beta-D1-thiogalactopyranoside (EPTG). A person skilled in the art would be able to choose the appropriate regulatory/promoter sequence based on the intended use of the dsRNA transgene.</p><p id="p0156" num="0156">Preferably, recombinant vectors capable of expressing dsRNA molecules are delivered as described below, and persist in target cells. Alternatively, viral vectors can be used that provide for transient expression of dsRNA molecules. Such vectors can be repeatedly administered as necessary. Once expressed, the dsRNAs bind to target RNA and modulate its function or expression. Delivery of dsRNA expressing vectors can be systemic, such as by intravenous or intramuscular administration, by<!-- EPO <DP n="58"> --> administration to target cells ex-planted from the patient followed by reintroduction into the patient, or by any other means that allows for introduction into a desired target cell.</p><p id="p0157" num="0157">dsRNA expression DNA plasmids are typically transfected into target cells as a complex with cationic lipid carriers (e.g. Oligofectamine) or non-cationic lipid-based carriers (e.g. Transit-TKO<sup>™</sup>). Multiple lipid transfections for dsRNA-mediated knockdowns targeting different regions of a single Factor V Leiden mutant gene or multiple Factor V Leiden mutant genes over a period of a week or more are also contemplated by the invention. Successful introduction of the vectors of the invention into host cells can be monitored using various known methods. For example, transient transfection. can be signaled with a reporter, such as a fluorescent marker, such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Stable transfection. of ex vivo cells can be ensured using markers that provide the transfected cell with resistance to specific environmental factors (e.g., antibiotics and drugs), such as hygromycin B resistance.</p><p id="p0158" num="0158">The Factor V Leiden mutant specific dsRNA molecules can also be inserted into vectors and used as gene therapy vectors for human patients. Gene therapy vectors can be delivered to a subject by, for example, intravenous injection, local administration (see <patcit id="pcit0211" dnum="US5328470A"><text>U.S. Patent 5,328,470</text></patcit>) or by stereotactic injection (see e.g., <nplcit id="ncit0085" npl-type="s"><text>Chen et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3054-3057</text></nplcit>). The pharmaceutical preparation of the gene therapy vector can include the gene therapy vector in an acceptable diluent, or can comprise a slow release matrix in which the gene delivery vehicle is imbedded. Alternatively, where the complete gene delivery vector can be produced intact from recombinant cells, e.g., retroviral vectors, the pharmaceutical preparation can include one or more cells which produce the gene delivery system.<!-- EPO <DP n="59"> --></p><p id="p0159" num="0159">Described are furthermore the following items:
