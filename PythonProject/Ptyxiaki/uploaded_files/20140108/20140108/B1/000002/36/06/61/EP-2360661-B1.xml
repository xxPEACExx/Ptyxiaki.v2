This is associated with the progress of information technologies in recent years.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Electronic portable devices, such as mobile phones, PDAs and the like, to which such flat panel displays are fitted, are required to be ever smaller and lighter, which translates into a trend towards a smaller periphery (frame region) of the display region, i.e. into narrower frames.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In one configuration of conventional display devices, peripheral circuits required for driving circuits (driver circuits) and the like have been mounted at the frame region of a substrate that makes up the display panel. By<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> contrast, display devices in which a full monolithic-type circuit substrate, where peripheral circuits are assembled into the frame region of the substrate, are set, have been developed in recent years with a view to, for instance, cutting costs and achieving thinner profiles.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Examples of conventional display devices include a display device provided with: common wirings that feed scanning line driving circuits that drive scanning lines, and common wirings that feed signal line driving circuits that drive signal lines; interlayer dielectrics that isolate respective common wirings; and a plurality of external connection terminals positioned on a plurality of respective contact holes that are provided in the interlayer dielectrics, in such a manner that part of each common wiring is exposed (for instance, Patent document 1). In such a display device, an anisotropic conductive film is disposed on the external connection terminals, such that connection to the exterior is elicited by way of the anisotropic conductive film.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Patent Document 1: Japanese Kokai Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPH10282522B"><text>H10-282522</text></patcit></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the configuration of conventional display devices, the external connection terminals and the common wirings are connected by way of contact holes, and an external member such as a flexible printed circuit (FPC) board is bonded to the external connection terminals by way of the anisotropic conductive film that comprises conductive particles.

This has been found to give rise to connection faults. As described above,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> configurations where common wirings and external connection terminals overlap make for a smaller frame area, as compared with configurations where the external connection terminals and the common wirings are disposed without overlapping each other.

The inventors found that the conductive particles in the anisotropic conductive film may give rise to disconnection of the external connection terminal and to connection faults, among other problems, upon connection of an external member or the like to the external connection terminal. Further, the inventors found that connection faults between wiring and an external connection terminal can be prevented, without overlapping of the conductive particles with the entire region of the contact holes, by setting the length from one end to the other end, in a plan view, of a region, at which one or more contact holes connected to a specific external connection terminal is formed, to be greater than the diameter of each of the conductive particles. The inventors arrived at the present invention upon envisaging that the above finding could allow curbing drops in manufacturing yield due to connection faults or the like.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The above objects are solved by the claimed matter according to the independent claims 1 and 2.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The present invention is explained in detail next.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The circuit substrate of the present invention is a circuit substrate in which wiring, an insulating film and an external connection terminal are sequentially disposed on a substrate. Specifically, the circuit substrate of the present invention is a circuit substrate wherein wiring and an external connection terminal are disposed on a substrate, and an insulating film is disposed therebetween.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The wiring is ordinarily a member that affords current paths in the circuit substrate. Such wiring is not particularly limited, and in the case of wiring provided in a display device may include, for instance, power supply wiring for supply of power from outside, or signal wiring<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> for transmitting a signal from outside or for transmitting a signal from the circuit substrate towards the exterior. In the case of a circuit substrate used in full-monolithic display devices, signal wiring is connected to, for instance, a driver circuit in the circuit substrate. If the driver circuit or the like is provided externally, the signal wiring may be provided in the form of, for instance, source wiring, gate wiring and storage capacitance wiring that transmit signals to pixels in order for the latter to carry out display.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The external connection terminal is a terminal used for transmitting external power and/or signals from the exterior (for instance, from an external member such as an FPC) to the wiring, or a terminal used for transmitting signals from the circuit substrate to the exterior. That is, the external connection terminal has electrical conductivity. The configuration of the external connection terminal is not particularly limited, and the external connection terminal may be, for instance, a single-layer film consisting of a single-layer conductive film, or a multilayer film comprising a stack of a plurality of conductive films.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The insulating film is a film formed of an insulating material for electrically isolating (insulating) between the wiring and the external connection terminal, at portions other than the portions at which the foregoing are connected by way of contact holes or the like. Examples of the material that can be used to form the insulating film include, but not limited thereto, for instance organic insulating materials, or inorganic insulating materials such as inorganic oxides, inorganic nitrides or the like. The insulating film may be one layer or a plurality of layers. In case that the insulating film comprises a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> plurality of layers, conductive layers may be interposed between respective insulating films, provided that the conductive layers are arranged in such a way so as not to connect electrically between the plurality of external connection terminals.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The circuit substrate is provided with an anisotropic conductive film comprising conductive particles, on the external connection terminals. The anisotropic conductive film is a film that has conductivity in an out-plane direction (normal direction with respect to the plane of the substrate) but lacks conductivity in an in-plane direction (direction within the plane of the substrate). As a result, the terminals of the external member and the external connection terminals of the circuit substrate can be electrically connected to each other in a one-to-one basis. Preferably, the anisotropic conductive film has adhesiveness, to elicit physical adhesion between the external connection terminals and the external member. Preferred examples of such an anisotropic conductive film include anisotropic conductive films that electrically connect the external connection terminals to the external member by way of conductive particles contained in an insulating material. The shape of the conductive particles is not particularly limited. The particles may be cubic, octahedral or the like, but preferably spherical.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The external connection terminal is connected to the wiring by way of at least one contact hole formed in the insulating film, such that the length from one end to the other end, in a plan view, of a region formed with one or more contact holes that connect to a specific external connection terminal is greater than the diameter of each of the conductive particles. In the circuit substrate of the present invention, thus, the external member and the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> external connection terminals are connected by way of an anisotropic conductive film, and the external connection terminals and wiring disposed directly below (at an region of overlap, in a plan view) the external connection terminals are connected by way of contact holes formed in the insulating film.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Two modes can be roughly distinguished herein, namely an mode (first mode) wherein one contact hole is provided for one external connection terminal, and an mode (second mode) wherein a plurality of contact holes is provided for one external connection terminal, as modes wherein the length, from one end to the other end, of a region at which there are formed one or more contact holes that connect to a specific external connection terminal is greater than the diameter of each of the conductive particles.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As in the circuit substrate illustrated in the cross-sectional schematic diagram of <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 11</figref>, in a case where one contact hole is formed in one external connection terminal, and the diameter of the contact hole is smaller than the diameter of each of the conductive particles, then a conductive particle 817b may end up breaking a conductive portion of a contact hole 818 that connects a wiring 815 and an external connection terminal 816 on a insulating film 814 formed at a region in which the contact hole 818 is not formed. This may give rise to a connection fault. One factor underlying the above occurrence is that the conductive layer on the contact hole wall surface is thinner than the conductive layer on the surface of the terminal. For instance, in case that a conductive particle in the anisotropic conductive film overlaps the contact hole upon thermocompression bonding of the external connection terminal and the external member by way of the anisotropic conductive film, then a connection fault may<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> occur due to breakage of the contact hole wall surface and/or of the conductive layer (external connection terminal) in the vicinity of the contact hole.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the first mode of the present invention, by contrast, the external connection terminal is connected to the wiring via only one contact hole. In a plan view, at least part of the contact hole has a greater diameter than the diameter of each of the conductive particles. Thus, in a case where one contact hole is provided in a specific external connection terminal, there need only be a portion such that the length, from one end to the other end, of the region at which the contact hole is formed, being herein the length of the diameter of the contact hole itself, is longer than the diameter of each of the conductive particles, at least in one direction. Specifically, the largest diameter of the contact hole need only be longer than the diameter of each of the conductive particles. For instance, the major-axis length of the contact hole (in square or perfectly circular contact holes, it can be considered that major axis is equal to minor axis) may be greater than the diameter of each of the conductive particles. Mode 1 (first mode) allows effectively suppressing disconnection between wiring and external connection terminals caused by contact hole breakage on account of pushing by conductive particles. The mode is effective for preventing connection faults.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the present description, the diameter of conductive particles denotes the diameter of the conductive particles in case of spherical conductive particles, and denotes the largest diameter of the conductive particles when the latter are non-spherical, for instance ellipsoidal or the like. The diameter of the conductive particles can be measured, for instance, by optical microscopy. The<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> conductive particle used for measurements may be, for instance, one arbitrarily selected particle from among a plurality of conductive particles that overlap the specific external connection terminal.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the second mode of the present invention, the external connection terminal is connected to wiring by way of a plurality of contact holes, such that the length, from one end to the other end in a plan view, of a region at which the plurality of contact holes is formed is greater than a diameter of each of the conductive particles. Thus, in a case where a plurality of contact holes (one group of contact holes) is provided at one external connection terminal, the distance between one site at the outer edge of one contact hole up to a site at the outer edge of another contact hole (distance between outer edges of a group of contact holes) is greater than the diameter of each of conductive particles. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 15</figref>, for instance, it is sufficient for the distance L from one end to the other end of a plurality of contact holes 8 to be greater than the diameter of a conductive particle 17b. In a mode wherein the wiring is connected to one external connection terminal by way of two or more contact holes, thus, connection between the external connection terminal and one of the contact holes is secured, even in case of a connection fault due to the other contact hole. Disconnection between the wiring and the external connection terminal can be prevented as a result.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the second mode, the length from end to end of two or more contact holes connected to one external connection terminal, i.e. the greatest length from one arbitrary site at the outer edge of a contact hole provided in one external connection terminal, up to the other site (may be one site at the outer edge of the same contact hole, or one<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> site at the outer edge of another contact hole), need only be greater than the diameter of each of the conductive particles. Especially, connection between wiring and external connection terminals can be secured in a particularly reliable manner in a mode wherein each contact hole has a diameter greater than the diameter of each of the conductive particles.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In the present invention, the greatest length, from one end to the other end, of the region at which there are formed one or more contact holes that connect to a specific external connection terminal is preferably 1.5 or more times as long as the diameter of each of the conductive particles, in terms of securing a margin for deformation that arises from pushing pressure, with a view to preventing connection faults more reliably.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the present invention, the sizes of the contact holes provided in the substrate are dissimilar. For instance, the diameter of the contact holes may be different for each external connection terminal to which the contact hole is connected. In such a case, the anisotropic conductive film need only contain conductive particles having a diameter smaller than the length, from one end to the other end, of one contact hole or one group of contact holes formed to the smallest size from among a plurality of contact holes in the substrate (instance where one contact hole is formed in one external connection terminal) and a plurality of groups of contact holes (instance where a plurality of contact holes is formed in one external connection terminal).</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The contact holes formed in the insulating film are ordinarily formed by dry etching, wet etching or the like. In a cross-sectional view of the contact hole, the length<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> of the contact hole, from one end to the other end, may be dissimilar between the top face (face on the side of the external connection terminal) and the bottom face (face on the side of the substrate) of the insulating film, if the hole is formed to a tapered or reverse-tapered shape. In such a case, the length, from one end to the other end, of the region at which there are formed one or more contact holes that connect to a specific external connection terminal need only be greater than the diameter each of of the conductive particles at least at the top face of the insulating film. Breakage of the external connection terminal on account of the conductive particles can be fully prevented if the length, from one end to the other end, of the contact hole, at least at the top face of the insulating film, is greater than the diameter of each of the conductive particles.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The shape of the contact hole is not particularly limited, and may be polygonal, for instance, square, rectangular or triangular; or rounded, for instance perfectly circular, elliptical or the like. In a case where, for instance, the shape of the contact hole, in a plan view, is an elliptical shape, the reliability of the connections can be increased by preventing complete breakage of the conductive portion between the wiring and the external connection terminal, if the major axis of the ellipse is greater than the diameter of each of the conductive particles, even if the minor axis of the ellipse is smaller than the diameter of each of the conductive particles. That is, the contact hole may be an elongated hole, in a plan view, such that the largest diameter of the elongated hole is greater than the diameter of each of the conductive particles. To prevent connection faults more reliably, the largest diameter of the elongated hole is preferably 1.5 or more times as long as the diameter of<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> each of the conductive particles. In a plan view, the shape of the elongated hole has a minor axis and a major axis, the shape being for instance an ellipse, a rectangular shape, an isosceles triangular shape or the like. As used herein, the term minor axis denotes the shortest diameter of the hole in a plan view, and the term major axis denotes the longest diameter of the hole in a plan view.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The area of the contact hole is not particularly limited, but is preferably greater than the area of conductive particles, in a plan view. A contact hole having a large area entails a greater contact area between the wiring and the external connection terminal. The resistance at the connection portion can be reduced as a result.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The external member connected to the anisotropic conductive film is not particularly limited, and may be, for instance, an electronic component such as a resistor, a capacitor, a coil, a connector, a diode, a transistor or the like; or a flexible printed circuit (FPC) board, a chip (COG: Chip on Glass) or resin film (COF: Chip on film) having formed thereon an integrated circuit (IC) that comprises circuit elements and wiring. Other examples include, for instance, a printed wiring board (PWB), a printed circuit board (PCB), a tape carrier package (TCP) or the like. Such external members are electrically connected to the external connection terminal by way of the anisotropic conductive film. Thus, the circuit substrate of the present invention comprises preferably an external member on an anisotropic conductive film. Preferably, the external member comprises a conductive protrusion at a region overlapping the external connection terminal. Such conductive protrusions are also referred to as "external<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> connection wiring" or "bumps". The conductive protrusion is connected to the external connection terminal by way of the conductive particles in the anisotropic conductive film.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The configuration of the circuit substrate of the present invention is not particularly limited as regards the presence or absence of constituent elements other than the above-described essential constituent elements, namely the wirings, the insulating film, the external connection terminal, the anisotropic conductive film and the contact holes. For instance, the circuit substrate of the present invention may be appropriately used as a display device substrate employed in liquid crystal display devices or the like. When used as a display device substrate, the circuit substrate may be provided with, for instance, switching elements, such as thin film transistors (TFTs) for driving the pixels, as the smallest units that make up the display image, wiring such as source wiring and gate wiring that transmit signals to the pixels, as well as pixel electrodes for eliciting display.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In the case of a full monolithic-type circuit substrate provided with peripheral circuits required for driving, such as a driver circuit, the circuit substrate may be provided with circuits such as driver circuits, power supply circuits, electrostatic discharge (ESD) protective circuits or the like. Examples of driver circuits include, for instance, source driver circuits and gate driver circuits. Examples of circuits that make up a driver circuit include, for instance, transmission gates, latch circuits, timing generators, inverter circuits by a power source circuit or the like.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Preferred modes of the circuit substrate of the present invention are explained in detail below.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> In a preferred mode of the circuit substrate of the present invention, the wiring has a wide portion that projects laterally with respect to the extension direction of the wiring, in a plan view, such that the contact hole is provided in the wide portion. Preferably, thus, the wiring has a wide portion that widens laterally with respect to the extension direction of the wiring, in a plan view; a contact hole is formed in the insulating film, on the wide portion; and the wiring and the external connection terminal are connected by way of the contact hole. The area of the contact hole formed in the insulating film can be increased thanks to the wide portion that projects with respect to the extension direction. This allows effectively preventing connection faults. The extension direction is the direction in which wiring extends linearly. In a state where a continuous stretch of wiring bends at a plurality of sites, the extension direction denotes the direction in which the wiring extends at the site where the wiring is connected to the external connection terminal; in other words, the direction pointing from the bent portion towards the external connection terminal. In a case where, for instance, wirings 115 and external connection terminals 116 are disposed as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the extension direction is the direction denoted by the blanked arrow in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. The lateral direction with respect to the extension direction is the width direction of the wiring, for instance the direction denoted by the double-headed arrow in the circuit substrate illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In a preferred mode of the wide portion, the latter projects laterally towards only one side with respect to the wiring extension direction, in a plan view. The feature of projecting towards only one side with respect to the extension direction means that the width of the wiring<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> increases (widens) towards either side in the width direction of the wiring. According to the preferred mode of the wide portion, the wiring width can be expanded only in a direction in which other wiring or the like is not disposed, and hence the length from one end to the other end of the contact hole increases, without widening of the distance between wirings. Connection faults between the wiring and the external connection terminal can be prevented thereby. In a case where, for instance, two or more wirings extend parallelly, the distance between the wirings can be reduced, while preventing contact between wirings, to a greater extent than in the case where the wide portion projects towards both sides in the width direction. This allows reducing, as a result, the wiring area. In current microfabrication techniques, the line width in the pads of contact holes is ordinarily greater than the wiring width. In a mode where the wide portion projects laterally towards both sides in the width direction, therefore, the distance between wirings is larger, and it becomes difficult to increase the number of wirings that are disposed under the external connection terminal.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The shape of the wide portion is not particularly limited, so long as it expands laterally with respect to the extension direction. The shape may be, for instance, that of a wide portion 19a in which wiring 19 widens in the form of a semicircle, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 14(a)</figref>, or the shape of a wide portion 20a in which wiring 20 widens in the form of a square, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 14(b)</figref>, or the shape of a wide portion 21a in which wiring 21 widens in the form of a triangle, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 14(c)</figref>. In the mode of <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 14(a)</figref>, the mode of <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 14(b)</figref> and the mode of <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 14(c)</figref>, the wide portion is referred to as a wiring portion within the area indicated by the double-headed<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> arrow in the figure. A shape widened in the form of a square shape is suitable in terms of increasing the area of the wide portion. Upon actual formation of the wide portion, the corners thereof become ordinarily rounded, for reasons of patterning precision. Even with rounded corners, a square shape and a triangular shape may be regarded as such if the shape is substantially square or triangular. In a mode where wiring has the wide portion, the wide portion 15a may be formed at the leading end of the wiring 15, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 12(a)</figref>. Alternatively, the wide portion 16a may be formed halfway the wiring 16, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 12(b)</figref>.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In preferred modes where the wide portion projects laterally towards only one side with respect to the wiring extension direction, the circuit substrate has, in a plan view, two or more wirings extending parallelly, and two or more external connection terminals arrayed in the extension direction of the wirings; the two or more wirings have each a wide portion projecting towards an end portion side or an inward side of the circuit substrate, and a wiring disposed on the side toward which the wide portion projects is shorter, in the extension direction, than an adjacent wiring. Specifically: (1) the circuit substrate has, in a plan view, two or more wirings extending parallelly, and two or more external connection terminals arrayed in the extension direction of the wirings; the two or more wirings have each a wide portion projecting towards an end portion side of the circuit substrate, and a wiring disposed at the end portion side is shorter, in the extension direction, than an adjacent wiring (adjacent wiring disposed on an inward side); and (2) the circuit substrate has, in a plan view, two or more wirings extending parallelly, and two or more external connection terminals arrayed in the extension direction of the wirings; the two or more wirings have each<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> a wide portion projecting towards the inward side of the circuit substrate, and a wiring disposed on an inward side is shorter, in the extension direction, than an adjacent wiring (adjacent wiring disposed on an end portion side).</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In the above modes, the direction in which the wide portion projects is a direction towards either side, with respect to the wiring extension direction, and there is shortened the length, in the extension direction, of the wiring disposed on the side towards which the wide portion projects. Hence, the wide portion projects towards a side on which no wiring is disposed. Even if a wide portion is provided, therefore, the spacing between wirings that extend parallelly does not become shorter at the wide portion of one wiring and the another wiring adjacent to the wiring, and thus the wide portion can be provided while securing sufficient distance between wirings. This affords more integrated wiring. The area of the region at which the wiring is disposed can be reduced as a result. This affords a narrower frame in cases where the circuit substrate of the present invention is used as a display device substrate.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The length in the extension direction denotes herein the length in the direction of the external connection terminal, from a portion at which wiring bends, for instance as indicated by B1, B2 and so forth in the circuit substrate illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. In the description of the present application, the term "parallel" applies not only to perfect parallelism, but also to instances of substantial parallelism, such as instances where the angle formed between wirings is no greater than 5°, in a case of two or more wirings that extend parallelly to each other. The end portion side of the circuit substrate denotes herein a side close to the end portion of the circuit<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> substrate, from among both sides with respect to the wiring extension direction. The inward side of the circuit substrate denotes herein a side opposite to the side close to the end portion of the circuit substrate, from among both sides with respect to the wiring extension direction.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The arrangement mode of the two or more external connection terminals is not limited, so long as the two or more external connection terminals are arrayed in the direction in which the wirings extend. In a case where, for instance, a plurality of external connection terminals has an identical rectangular shape, then an external connection terminal whose short side is parallel to the wiring extension direction may be arranged alternately with an external connection terminal whose long side is parallel to the wiring extension direction. In a preferred mode, the external connection terminals whose short side is parallel to the wiring extension direction are arrayed along a row, with spacings in between, in terms of reducing the area of the region at which wiring is disposed and afford thus a narrower frame.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The above-described mode (1) is suitable for equalizing wiring resistance between wirings on the end portion side and wirings on the inward side, and is advantageous for increasing the operational stability of the circuit substrate. That is because, as in the circuit substrate illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, when two or more parallel wirings bend at a corner of the substrate, a wiring on the end portion side is longer than a wiring on the inward side, and hence the length of the wiring on the end portion side, along the extension direction from the bent leading ends, is shorter than that of the wiring on the inwards side. The lengths of the wirings on the end portion side and on the inward side can be made similar to each other<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> thereby.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The above-described mode (2) is suitable for reducing the area of the region at which the wiring is disposed. This is advantageous for achieving a narrower frame, in cases where the circuit substrate of the present invention is used as a display device substrate. That is because making inward-side wirings shorter in the extension direction than wirings on the end portion side allows forming a region in which no wiring is disposed, and allows arranging elements such as circuit-forming wiring, a thin-film transistor or the like, at a region close to the inward side below the external connection terminal. In the circuit substrate illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, for instance, wiring disposed on the end portion side of the circuit substrate is longer than wiring disposed on the inward side. Therefore, circuits such as transistors, as well as wiring connected thereto, are disposed below the external connection terminal, and there is reduced the area for forming the circuits or the like.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In the circuit substrate of the present invention, the two or more wirings are connected to the external connection terminal by way of contact holes having dissimilar area. The arrangement relationship between the wiring and the external connection terminal may be, for instance, the one illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, wherein a wiring points towards the wiring extension direction, an adjacent wiring thereto is already connected to another external connection terminal, and no wiring is disposed at one of the wide portions of the wiring (on one side with respect to the extension direction). The area of the wide portion can be increased in such a case, and hence the area of the contact hole can be made accordingly greater. This allows adjusting the contact resistance between the<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> external connection terminal and the wirings, which in turns allows compensating differences in wiring resistance due to differences in wiring length. Also, the occurrence of connection faults can be suppressed by increasing the area of the contact holes.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In the circuit substrate of the present invention, the two or more wirings are connected to contact holes such that the longer the wiring length, the greater the area of the contact hole is. For a given wiring width, the resistance of wiring increases as the wiring length increases. As a result, wiring resistance is smaller in shorter wiring, positioned inward of the circuit substrate, than in longer wiring, positioned on the end portion side of the circuit substrate, for instance in the case illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>. Therefore, wiring resistance can be made uniform, and the resistance of the contact hole portions can be adjusted, by increasing the area of the contact holes for wiring having a long wiring length, and decreasing the area of contact holes having a short wiring length. More uniform wiring resistance translates into enhanced operation stability of the circuit substrate. Herein, wiring length denotes the length of a continuous stretch of wiring that is joined to an element in a circuit. The continuous stretch of wiring may be made up of wirings formed in different layers but connected to each other.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The present invention is also a display panel provided with the above-described circuit substrate, and a display device provided with such a display panel. The present invention can be used in various types of display device, for instance in liquid crystal displays, plasma displays, inorganic electroluminescent displays, organic electroluminescent displays and the like.<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --></p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In the display panel and display device of the present invention, the occurrence of connection faults between wiring and external connection terminals can be suppressed by setting the length, from one end to the other end, of a region at which there are formed one or more contact holes that connect to one external connection terminal, to be greater than the diameter of conductive particles, as described above. Manufacturing yields can be improved and productivity can be likewise enhanced as a result.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In addition suppression of connection faults, forming a wide portion in wiring allows also shortening the distance between wirings.
