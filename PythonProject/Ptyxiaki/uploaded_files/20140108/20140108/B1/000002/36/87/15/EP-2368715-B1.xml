num="0002">In an electrophotographic image forming apparatus such as a printer, a copy machine or a facsimile machine, an image is formed on a recording sheet as follows. Firstly, an electrostatic latent image is formed on a uniformly charged photoconductor by causing an optical recording unit to emit light so as to transfer image information onto the photoconductor. Then, the electrostatic latent image is made visible by being developed with toner. Lastly, the toner image is transferred on and fixed to the recording sheet. In addition to an optical-scanning recording unit that performs exposure by laser scanning in the first scanning direction using a laser beam, a recording device using the following LED print head (LPH) has been employed as such an optical recording unit in recent years in response to demand for downsizing the apparatus. This LPH includes a large number of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), serving as light-emitting elements, arrayed in the first scanning direction.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2001219596A"><text>2001-219596</text></patcit> describes a self-scanning light-emitting device array in which each light-emitting element chip is provided with a terminal for controlling whether or not the light-emitting element chip emits light upon receipt of a lighting<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> signal. Additionally, in the self-scanning light-emitting device array, data streams are multiplexed through a single data line respectively for causing multiple chips to emit light, by using a general-purpose shift register IC.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In a recording device configured with a LPH that uses multiple self-scanning light-emitting device array (SLED) chips, a wiring to send a light-up signal to a SLED chip is required to have a low resistance since it is a wiring to supply a current for lighting up. Therefore, provision of a wiring for lighting up for each of the multiple SLED chips leads to provision of a large number of broad and low-resistive wirings to send light-up signals on a circuit board with multiple SLED chips mounted thereon. This makes the width of the circuit board broader, which prevents downsizing. Additionally, if the wirings are configured to have multiple layers in order to make the width of the circuit board narrower, this configuration prevents cost reduction.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to provide a light-emitting device and the like that are capable of reducing the number of wirings.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP2184172A1"><text>EP-A1-2184172</text></patcit> (citable under Article 54(3) EPC only) discloses a light-emitting head, image forming apparatus and signal supply method.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2006088465A"><text>JP-A-2006-88465</text></patcit> discloses a self-scanning light emiting element array substrate.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention is defined by the independent claims, to which reference should now be made.

embodiment of the present invention in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings (the eighth to nineteenth arrangements embody the present invention).</p><heading id="h0007">(First Exemplary Arrangement)</heading><p id="p0056" num="0056"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram showing an example of an overall configuration of an image forming apparatus 1 to which the first exemplary arrangement is applied. The image forming apparatus 1 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is what is generally termed as a tandem image forming apparatus. The image forming apparatus<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> 1 includes an image forming process unit 10, an image output controller 30 and an image processor 40. The image forming process unit 10 forms an image in accordance with different color image data. The image output controller 30 controls the image forming process unit 10. The image processor 40, which is connected to devices such as a personal computer (PC) 2 and an image reading apparatus 3, performs predefined image processing on image data received from the above devices.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The image forming process unit 10 includes image forming units 11 formed of plural engines arranged in parallel at intervals set in advance. The image forming units 11 are formed of four image forming units 11Y, 11 M, 11C and 11K. Each of the image forming units 11Y, 11M, 11C and 11K includes a photoconductive drum 12, a charging device 13, a print head 14 and a developing device 15. On the photoconductive drum 12, which is an example of an image carrier, an electrostatic latent image is formed, and the photoconductive drum 12 retains a toner image. The charging device 13, as an example of a charging unit, charges the surface of the photoconductive drum 12 at a predetermined potential. The print head 14 exposes the photoconductive drum 12 charged by the charging device 13. The developing device 15, as an example of a developing unit, develops an electrostatic latent image formed by the print head 14. Here, the image forming units 11Y, 11M, 11C and 11K have approximately the same configuration excluding colors of toner put in the developing devices 15. The image forming units 11Y, 11M, 11C and 11K form yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C) and black (K) toner images, respectively.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">In addition, the image forming process unit 10 further includes a sheet transport belt 21, a drive roll 22, transfer rolls 23 and a fixing device 24. The sheet transport belt 21 transports a recording sheet as a transferred body so<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> that different color toner images respectively formed on the photoconductive drums 12 of the image forming units 11Y, 11M, 11C and 11K are transferred on the recording sheet by multilayer transfer. The drive roll 22 is a roll that drives the sheet transport belt 21. Each transfer roll 23, as an example of a transfer unit, transfers a toner image formed on the corresponding photoconductive drum 12 onto the recording sheet. The fixing device 24 fixes the toner images on the recording sheet.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In this image forming apparatus 1, the image forming process unit 10 performs an image forming operation on the basis of various kinds of control signals supplied from the image output controller 30. Under the control by the image output controller 30, the image data received from the personal computer (PC) 2 or the image reading apparatus 3 is subjected to image processing by the image processor 40, and then the resultant data is supplied to the corresponding image forming unit 11. Then, for example in the black (K) color image forming unit 11K, the photoconductive drum 12 is charged at a predetermined potential by the charging device 13 while rotating in an arrow A direction, and then is exposed by the print head 14 emitting light on the basis of the image data supplied from the image processor 40. By this operation, the electrostatic latent image for the black (K) color image is formed on the photoconductive drum 12. Thereafter, the electrostatic latent image formed on the photoconductive drum 12 is developed by the developing device 15, and accordingly the black (K) color toner image is formed on the photoconductive drum 12. Similarly, yellow (Y), magenta (M) and cyan (C) color toner images are formed in the image forming units 11Y, 11M and 11C, respectively.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The respective color toner images on the photoconductive drums 12, which are formed in the respective image forming units 11, are electrostatically transferred to the recording sheet supplied with the<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> movement of the sheet transport belt 21 by a transfer electric field applied to the transfer rolls 23, in sequence. Here, the sheet transport belt 21 moves in an arrow B direction. By this operation, a synthetic toner image, which is superimposed color-toner images, is formed on the recording sheet.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Thereafter, the recording sheet on which the synthetic toner image is electrostatically transferred is transported to the fixing device 24. The synthetic toner image on the recording sheet transported to the fixing device 24 is fixed on the recording sheet through fixing processing using heat and pressure by the fixing device 24, and then is outputted from the image forming apparatus 1.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional diagram showing a structure of the print head 14. The print head 14 includes a housing 61, a light-emitting device 65 and a rod lens array 64. The light-emitting device 65, as an example of an exposure unit, includes a light-emitting portion 63 formed of plural light-emitting elements (light-emitting thyristors in the first exemplary arrangement) that exposes the photoconductive drum 12. The rod lens array 64, as an example of an optical unit, focuses light emitted by the light-emitting portion 63 onto the surface of the photoconductive drum 12.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The light-emitting device 65 also includes a circuit board 62 on which the light-emitting portion 63, a signal generating circuit 110 (see <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> to be described later) driving the light-emitting portion 63, and the like are mounted.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The housing 61 is made of metal, for example, and supports the circuit board 62 and the rod lens array 64. The housing 61 is set so that the light-emitting points of the light-emitting elements in the light-emitting portions 63 are located on the focal plane of the rod lens array 64.

The diffusion potential (forward direction potential) Vd of pn junction is assumed to be 1.5 V, and the forward direction potential Vs of Schottky junction (barrier) is assumed to be 0.5 V. These values are used for the following description.</p><p id="p0195" num="0195">The thyristor in an OFF state where no current flows between the anode and cathode terminals, shifts to an ON state (turns on) when a potential lower than threshold voltage V (greater potential to the negative side) is applied to the cathode terminal. The thyristor, when turned on, shifts to a state (ON state) where a current flows between the anode and cathode terminals. Here, the threshold voltage of the thyristor is the potential of the gate terminal minus the diffusion potential Vd. Thus, if the potential of the gate terminal of the thyristor is -1.5 V, the threshold voltage is -3.0 V. That is, when a voltage lower than -3.0 V is applied to the cathode terminal, the thyristor is turned on.</p><p id="p0196" num="0196">When the thyristor is in an ON state, the gate terminal has a potential close to that of the anode terminal of the thyristor. Since the anode terminal is assumed to be 0 V ("H") herein, the following description is given under the assumption that the potential of the gate terminal is O V ("H").

For example, when the cathode terminal becomes "H" (0 V), the cathode terminal has the same potential as that of the anode terminal, thus the thyristor is turned off.</p><p id="p0198" num="0198">On the other hand, as long as a potential lower than -1.5 V is continuously applied to the cathode terminal to supply a current allowing an ON state of the thyristor to be maintained, the thyristor maintains the ON state.</p><p id="p0199" num="0199">From the above description, the thyristor, once in an ON state, maintains the state where the current flows, and does not shift to an OFF state by the potential of the gate terminal.
