Some voltage regulators require an external decoupling capacitor that requires an external connection on an integrated circuit package of the device. But there are a few on chip voltage regulator designs that are self contained without requiring any externally connected components for transient stability.

Like elements in the drawings will be represented by like numbers, and similar elements will be represented by like numbers with a different lower case letter suffix.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, depicted is a schematic diagram of a prior technology low dropout (LDO) voltage regulator. The purpose of the LDO voltage regulator is to maintain a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> desired voltage at node V<sub>OUT</sub> when it's in a regulation mode of operation. The error amplifier 106 compares a sample of the V<sub>OUT</sub> voltage, fed into the positive input of the error amplifier 106, with a reference voltage (Vbg), fed into the negative input of the error amplifier 106.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">When the voltage at V<sub>OUT</sub> is lowered, the corresponding sampled voltage going into the positive input of the error amplifier 106 will also decrease. Now, the positive input voltage becomes lower than the negative input voltage of the error amplifier 106. In effect, this will lower the output of the error amplifier 106 to the buffer amplifier 104 and the same signal will be buffered to the P-channel metal oxide semiconductor (PMOS) transistor power transistor 102. The output of the error amplifier 106 will lower faster if the difference between its inputs is greater. This lower voltage shown at the gate of the PMOS power transistor 102 turns on the PMOS power transistor more, thus allowing the voltage in V<sub>IN</sub> to charge up the voltage in V<sub>OUT</sub>.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">When the V<sub>OUT</sub> voltage approaches the desired level, the difference between the sampled V<sub>OUT</sub> voltage and the bandgap voltage becomes less, thereby making the PMOS power transistor 102 shut off. On the other hand, when the voltage at V<sub>OUT</sub> is increasing, the corresponding sampled voltage fed into the positive input of the error amplifier 106 increases and becomes greater than the reference voltage (Vbg) fed into the negative input of the error amplifier 106. This will increase the output of the error amplifier 106 to the buffer 104 and will be buffered to the PMOS power transistor 102. The output of the error amplifier 106 will increase faster if the difference between its inputs is greater. This higher voltage shown at the gate of the PMOS power transistor 102 turns off the PMOS power transistor 102 more, thus preventing a further increase in voltage at the V<sub>OUT</sub> node. This whole operation maintains the voltage at V<sub>OUT</sub> to a desired steady state voltage value.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">V<sub>IN</sub> is the voltage fed to the LDO voltage regulator and it may range from about 0 to 5.5 volts. On the other hand, V<sub>OUT</sub> is the voltage at the output of the LDO voltage regulator and is used to power logic circuits of an integrated circuit device (not shown). The LDO voltage regulator of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> has a preferred output voltage range of from about 3.0 to about 3.6 volts. When the input voltage, V<sub>IN</sub>, is above about 3.7 volts, the majority of the current consumption is due to the integrated device's normal operation (e.g., logic circuit transistor switching load). The voltage regulator current is kept to a minimum relative to the integrated<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> circuit device logic circuits operating current at this point. However, a problem occurs when the V<sub>IN</sub> node is at about 3.6 volts or less. The circuit shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> has to work harder to make the voltages of V<sub>IN</sub> and V<sub>OUT</sub> the same. Due to the dynamic requirements for this LDO voltage regulator, an output driver with a diode-connected buffer configuration preferably is most stable for the application as part of an on-chip voltage regulator, instead of a conventional push-pull output stage. However, an undesirable effect of this circuit is high quiescent current from the diode connected buffer amplifier 104 when it drives the gate of the PMOS power transistor 102 towards power common (e.g., ground). This happens when V<sub>IN</sub> gets close to V<sub>OUT</sub> and the PMOS power transistor 102, goes into its triode region from saturation. This effect is shown as the dashed line in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref>. This effect is very undesirable.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref> illustrates a more detailed schematic diagram for the buffer 104 of the LDO voltage regulator shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. The potential high current problem, illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref> as line segment 654, occurs in this part of the LDO voltage regulator. When this circuit switches from a regulating mode to a track mode, the voltage V<sub>OUT</sub> tracks with V<sub>IN</sub>. So when at lower input voltages, e.g., V<sub>IN</sub> less than about 3.6 volts, the output voltage, V<sub>OUT</sub>, lowers as well, e.g., tracks V<sub>IN</sub>. Since the voltage V<sub>OUT</sub> is sampled and fed into the positive input of the error amplifier 106, this forces the positive input voltage to be lower than the negative input voltage of the error amplifier 106. This will force a low level signal into the buffer 104. The input node, N1, of the buffer 104 is driven to ground and at the same time, the output node, N2, of the buffer 104 is also driven to ground. When these nodes are low, the PMOS transistors M21, M24 and M25 will turn on harder. Turning on M25 will put a high voltage into the diode connected NMOS transistor M23 and activate the current mirror. When all of these transistors activate, the current consumption of the buffer 104 will greatly increase because the transistors are designed to be able to draw a lot of current so that the buffer 104 is capable of having fast response time.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Forcing a logical 0 on the buffer 104 during this scenario is necessary to drive the gate of the PMOS power transistor 102 to ground and thereby activate it (turn it on hard). This will enable the LDO voltage regulator to go into a track mode, e.g., V<sub>OUT</sub> will follow V<sub>IN</sub>.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>, depicted is a schematic block diagram of a low drop out (LDO) bypass voltage regulator in an integrated circuit device, according to a specific example<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> embodiment of this disclosure. The LDO bypass voltage regulator, generally represented by the numeral 500, comprises a voltage reference 508, an error amplifier 506, a buffer 504, a voltage monitor and control circuit 512 and a power pass element 502, all fabricated onto an integrated circuit die 522. The voltage monitor and control circuit 512 may also include voltage hysteresis. The output of the power pass element 502, V<sub>OUT</sub>, is coupled to power consuming logic circuits 510 of the integrated circuit die 522. The voltage reference 508 may be for example but not limited to a bandgap voltage reference.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">When the input voltage, V<sub>IN</sub>, is at, for example but not limited to, about 3.6 volts, the voltage monitor and control circuit 512 will force the control node (e.g., gate) of the power pass element 502 (similar to the PMOS power transistor 102 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>) to ground through control signal 518. This will cause the power pass element 502 to turn on hard (go into saturation) and effectively short together the V<sub>IN</sub> and V<sub>OUT</sub> nodes. Also the buffer 504 will be put into a high impedance state with minimal current consumption with control signal 516 from the voltage monitor and control circuit 512, whereby the current drawn (power consumption) by the integrated circuit device will be mainly from the logic circuits 510 (load). As the input voltage, V<sub>IN</sub>, goes lower, so does the current consumption. This is represented by the dashed line 656 shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref>. When the voltage, V<sub>IN</sub>, goes from a lower voltage to about 3.65 volts, the voltage monitor and control 512 re-engages the buffer 504. Thereby enabling the regulation circuit so as to keep V<sub>OUT</sub> at about 3.3 volts even if V<sub>IN</sub> goes higher than 3.6 volts. The voltage monitor and control 512 may further have hysteresis so that the power pass element 502 and the buffer 504 will go into the tracking mode at a slightly lower voltage then when going back to the regulate mode of operation.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In order to solve this high current consumption problem, the buffer 504 is shut off when the LDO voltage regulator is in the track mode. The voltage monitor and control circuit 512 determines whether the LDO voltage regulator 500 is in track mode or regulate mode by monitoring the input voltage V<sub>IN</sub>. When the LDO voltage regulator 500 is in the track mode, along with other conditions, it enables (turns on) the power pass element 502, e.g., the PMOS power transistor 102 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. In effect, this shorts the V<sub>IN</sub> and V<sub>OUT</sub> nets of the LDO voltage regulator 500, enabling the track mode, e.g., pass through of V<sub>IN</sub> to V<sub>OUT</sub>. When this happens, the power pass element 502 is no longer dependent on the output 514 of the buffer 504 to drive the power pass element 502. Because of this action, the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> current mirror in the buffer 504 is disabled (signal 516) so as to avoid the aforementioned problem of unnecessarily high current consumption.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">5</figref>, depicted are more detailed schematic diagrams of the error amplifier and buffer of the LDO voltage regulator shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>. When the LDO bypass voltage regulator 500 detects that the supply voltage is low, it will switch over to the track mode, this also sends a signal to disable the current buffer. When the current buffer is turned off, transistor 144 is switched off to avoid biasing the common gate transistors 157 and I58. At the same time, transistor I52 switches on in order to fully shut down the common gate transistors I57 and I58. This in effect shuts down the cascade circuitry and eliminates the current being supplied by it.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Without the implementation of the teachings of this disclosure, current consumption becomes extremely high when the input voltage is less than the reference voltage and the regulator switches to track mode. <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref> shows this rapid current increase, when the input voltage is less than the reference voltage, as the solid line 654 in the left half portion of the graph. When the above mentioned techniques are implemented, the current consumption becomes a linear function (current mainly drawn by logic circuits of the integrated circuit) of V<sub>IN</sub>, which is depicted as the dashed line 656 shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref>.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">When V<sub>IN</sub> goes higher than 3.6 volts, the voltage monitor and control 512 causes the LDO bypass voltage regulator 500 to go back into the regulate mode where the buffer 504, the error amplifier 506 and the power pass element 502 function as a closed loop voltage regulator, as described hereinabove, thereby keeping V<sub>OUT</sub> at about 3.3 volts (e.g., approximately the voltage value of the voltage reference 508). It is contemplated and within the scope of this disclosure that any voltage value at V<sub>OUT</sub> may be maintained so long as the voltage at the V<sub>IN</sub> node is high enough for the regulation circuit to operate properly.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 7</figref>, depicted is a schematic graph of input and output voltage relationships with the LDO in the regulation or bypass mode and having voltage hysteresis therebetween, according to the teachings of this disclosure. When in the regulation mode, the output voltage remains substantially at the regulation voltage, e.g., 3.3 volts, generally represented by the numeral 766. In the graph shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 7</figref> the LDO remains in the regulation mode for input voltages down to about 3.4 volts (762). Once the input voltage goes below about 3.4 volts the LDO goes into the bypass mode and the output voltage tracks<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the input voltage, generally represented by the numeral 764, wherein the LDO is shutdown and draws an insignificant amount of current. The LDO remains in the shutdown mode until the input voltage goes back to about 3.6 volts (760) and then the LDO will switch back to the regulation mode. Therefore, hysteresis may be used for switching between the regulation and bypass modes of the LDO. The voltages depicted in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 7</figref> are used as an example, but many other combinations of upper and lower voltages for a hysteresis function may be used and are contemplated herein.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">While embodiments of this disclosure have been depicted, described, and are defined by reference to example embodiments of the disclosure, such references do not imply a limitation on the disclosure, and no such limitation is to be inferred.
