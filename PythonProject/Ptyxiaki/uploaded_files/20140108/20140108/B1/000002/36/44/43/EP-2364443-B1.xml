mxw-id="PDES63960949" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to a method and a system for evaluating a subject, for example for the diagnosis and management of attentional disorders.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Alterations in locomotor-activity levels and disturbances in rest-activity rhythms have long been recognized as an integral sign of many psychiatric disorders. For example, the hyperactivity of children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is most readily discernible as a failure to inhibit motor activity to low-levels.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Using precisely quantified movements, ADHD children have been shown to move their head 2.3 times more often than normal children, moved 3.4 times as far, cover a 3.8-fold greater area, and have a more linear and less complex movement pattern. <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Teicher et al., J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry 35:334 (1996</text></nplcit>). ADHD children also have disturbances in their ability to perform on cognitive control tasks. These disturbances can be reflected in conventional measures of performance such as accuracy, omission and commission errors and response latency, along with measures of fluctuation in attention states. <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Teicher et al., J. Child Adolesc.Psychiatry 14:219 (2004</text></nplcit>).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The problem is that dozens of measures have been described that quantify aspects of attention and activity. From this array of potential measures it is unclear which measures should be used for clinical purposes. There is a need for reliable, inexpensive, and easy to use methods to derive a small number of omnibus composite measures that are most suitable for diagnosing attentional disorders and for assessing how subjects change over time and with therapy.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Previous attempts have been made to provide a reduced number of composite scores. The Conners' CPT-II test provides a single composite called the Confidence Index that suggests closeness of the match to a clinical or non-clinical profile. This composite index uses only attention variables, and has been reported in independent samples to fail to distinguish between children with and without ADHD (<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Edwards et al., J. Abnorm. Child Psychol. 35:393 (2007</text></nplcit>)). Similarly, it has been reported to fail to distinguish between adults with and without ADHD (<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Solanto et al., CNS Spectr. 9:649 (2004</text></nplcit>)).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The McLean Motion and Attention Test (M-MAT) used principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of activity and attention measures. From all 6 activity measures two composites were derived ("hyperactivity", "movement area"), and 4 composites were derived from all 6 attention measures ("inattention", "impulsivity", "latency", "variability"). While this approach reduced the number of measures, it did not do so to a sufficient degree. Further, applying PCA separately to a moderate number of activity and attention performance measures does not yield composites that are optimal as treatment-responsive measures of attention disturbance and motor activity disturbance. This is because the distribution of scores for the populations normal and abnormal subjects obtained using these M-MAT composites do not provide enough differential between typical ADHD subjects and typical non-ADHD subjects and too much of the dynamic range of the M-MAT composite curve is dictated by extreme scores, rather than the range between normal and abnormal (e.g., the range in which partially treated subjects would be found). As a result, the M-MAT composite score is insensitive to change in a subject (i.e., such as a modest improvement resulting from therapy, or a change in the subject over time). Moreover, the M-MAT composites are not bounded between set limits and are not scaled in a way that is readily interpretable clinically.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2003233032A1"><text>US 2003/233032 A1</text></patcit> discloses methods that involve using a computer-based system to assess impairment of certain cognitive and motor functions that are indicative of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of demention.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The invention features methods and systems to monitor changes in the magnitude of attentional disturbance and the magnitude of motor activity disturbance in a subject.

The methods and systems of the invention can be useful for diagnosing and/or evaluating change in, such as response to treatment, attentional disorders, such as, without limitation, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Attention Deficit Disorder, and Hyperkinetic Disorder. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, which is also referred to in the literature as Attention Deficit Disorder/Hyperactivity Syndrome (ADD/HS), is a condition (or group of conditions) characterized by impulsiveness, distractibility, inappropriate behavior in social situations and hyperactivity. ADD/HS is reported to have a prevalence of 3-9% in children (<nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>Anderson et al., Archives<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> of General Psychiatry 44:69 (1987</text></nplcit>); <nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>Bird et al., Archives of General Psychiatry 45:1120 (1988</text></nplcit>); and <nplcit id="ncit0007" npl-type="s"><text>Szatmari et al., J.

Disabil. Res. Rev. 8:162 (2002</text></nplcit>)). Symptoms of ADHD often diminish with age, but about 65% of individuals with ADHD continue to experience significant symptoms in adulthood (<nplcit id="ncit0009" npl-type="s"><text>Faraone et al., Psychol. Med. 36:159 (2006</text></nplcit>)). This disorder can impair social function, learning and/or development and is therefore now recognized as a serious problem. It is further recognized that many children with ADHD go on to develop other comorbid conditions or social problems in adulthood. In clinical terms ADHD is diagnosed if any one of the three main clinical features of inattention, over-activity and impulsiveness, persists in two or more situations, e.g., in both a home and school environment (<nplcit id="ncit0010" npl-type="b"><text>American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) Washington D.C.; American Psychiatric Association, 1994</text></nplcit>). A particularly severe form of ADHD is termed Hyperkinetic Disorder. In Britain, this diagnosis is made only if all three of the main clinical features (inattention, over-activity and impulsiveness) have been present from an early age, persist in more than one situation (e.g., home and school) and impair function (see <nplcit id="ncit0011" npl-type="b"><text>The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: Diagnostic Criteria for Research, Geneva: World Health Organisation, 1993: 155-7</text></nplcit>).

Psychiatry 35:334 (1996</text></nplcit>). Changes in motor activity can be a measure of the efficacy of a particular drug for the treatment of an attentional disorder (see, for example, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO07114901A"><text>PCT Publication No. WO07/114901</text></patcit>).

In certain embodiments, the attentional test is a continuous performance test (i.e., a CPT test, such as a visual or audio test, see <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2006023964A"><text>PCT Publication No. WO 2006/023964</text></patcit>), given either simultaneously or concurrently with the motor activity monitoring. In some instances, the protocol of the invention includes assessing the fluctuation in attentional states of the subject from the CPT test data. Other attentional measures (i.e., attentional data), such as changes in response latency, response variability, adjusted latency, or adjusted accuracy (see, e.g., <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US20030233032A"><text>U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030233032</text></patcit>) are known in the art and may also be used.

The methodology for making such a measurement is described in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US6685652B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,685,652</text></patcit>. Briefly, during an attentional test, such as a CPT test or another cognitive control task, the subject's responses are scored. Rather than measure the average attentional state of the subject, the data for a single test is divided into segments and each segment is separately scored to determine how the attentional state of the subject fluctuates during the single test (i.e., the amount of time spent in a particular attentional state (attentive, impulsive, distracted) can be calculated along with the number of shifts in the attentional state of the subject during the test period.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">As used herein, "responsive attention metrics" refers to attention metrics that are responsive to therapeutic treatment in a graded manner and which vary in value by at least 15% in fully treated abnormal subjects in comparison to their scores while unmedicated. Responsive attention metrics can be identified by comparing, for any given attention metric, the values obtained for abnormal subjects when medicated and when unmedicated. For<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> example, responsive attention metrics include, without limitation, errors of omission, percent time spent in distracted state, percent time spent in minimal response state, accuracy-adjusted latency, and variability in response latency. The responsive attention metrics are useful for measuring the magnitude of attention disturbance in a subject, and for monitoring changes in the magnitude of attention disturbance in a subject over time and in response to therapy.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">As used herein, "responsive motor activity metrics" refers to motor activity metrics that are responsive to therapeutic treatment in a graded manner and which vary in value by at least 25% in fully treated abnormal subjects in comparison to their scores while unmedicated. Responsive motor activity metrics can be identified by comparing, for any given motor activity metric, the values obtained for abnormal subjects when medicated and when unmedicated. For example, responsive motor activity metrics include, without limitation, microevents, displacement, and head area. The responsive motor activity metrics are useful for measuring the magnitude of motor activity disturbance in a subject, and for monitoring changes in the magnitude of motor activity disturbance of a subject over time and in response to therapy.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">As used herein, "magnitude of attention disturbance" refers to a score calculated from a composite formula that scores a subject according to attention performance and (i) utilizes responsive attention metrics (e.g., errors of omission, percent time spent in distracted state, percent time spent in minimal response state, accuracy-adjusted latency, and variability in response latency); (ii) is scaled to two bounds (e.g., 0 to 1, 0 to 10, 0 to 100); (iii) includes age and gender as covariates to produce a score appropriate for the subject's age and gender; (iv) is responsive to medication in an abnormal subject in a graded manner; and (v) has a large dynamic range between normal and abnormal subjects, such that the difference in the mean of the distributions of magnitude of attention disturbance scores for normal and untreated abnormal subjects divided by the theoretical range of the bounded scale (i.e., ([mean abnormal - mean normal]/range) ratio is at least 0.20, 0.23, or 0.25 (see <figref idrefs="f0013">Figure 9</figref>), or [mean abnormal - mean normal] is at least 20%, 23%, or 25% (or in the range of 20 to 50%, 20 to 40%, 20 to 30%, 23 to 40%, 25 to 40%, or 25 to 35%) of the theoretical range for a bounded scale, or 25% (or in the range of 25 to 50%, 25 to 40%, or 25 to 35%) of the observed range (± 6 standard deviations derived from a sample with at least 40 normal subjects and 40 abnormal subjects) for a non-bounded scale. While the magnitude of attention disturbance score provides a poorer differential diagnosis of an attentional disorder (see <figref idrefs="f0010">Figure 6</figref>), the magnitude of attention disturbance score is very sensitive to degree of change in the subject. Thus, the magnitude of attention disturbance score is useful for treatment planning, and for monitoring and guiding therapeutic decisions. In the composite of formula (2), the parameters (multipliers) were used to adjust the contribution of the responsive attention metrics, and the covariate effects of age and gender derived from non-linear least-squares regression, in which sum squared error was minimized between the magnitude of attention disturbance score and the averaged age and gender based percentiles for the responsive attention metrics used. The average percentile score provided an initial score target for curve fitting, with the logistic regression affording a superior solution having a greater ability to quantify the effects of medication (i.e., methylphenidate) in a subject. The composite of formula (2) has, by design, a sigmoidal dose-response curve relationship relating the responsive attention metrics to the composite outcome in a manner that recognizes clinically meaningful changes in a subject (see <figref idrefs="f0011">Figure 7</figref>).

The test consists of an infrared motion analysis system, which tracks head movement in children (and head plus lower extremity movement in adolescents and adults), while they perform a monotonous but demanding novel Go/No-Go continuous performance attention task.

Any change in a subject's magnitude of motor activity disturbance is easily observable as movement up and down the resulting curve.

The distribution shows little overlap between the normal and abnormal populations, as the normal subjects typically score near the lower limit and the abnormal subjects typically score near the upper limit. Such a distribution is desirable for the purpose of differential diagnosis, but not for monitoring change in a subject over time.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0013">Figure 9</figref> is a graph depicting the difference between mean ADHD subjects and mean normal (Non-ADHD) subjects versus the range (highest score - lowest score) of observed scores for the following composites: (i) the magnitude of attention disturbance composite, (ii) the magnitude of motor activity disturbance composite, (iii) the M-MAT motor activity composite (derived using PCA, prior art), and (iv) the M-MAT attention composite (derived using PCA, prior art). These values were calculated from a sample of ADHD (n=144) and Non-ADHD (n=707) subjects. For the magnitude of disturbance composites of the invention the dynamic range between normal and abnormal subjects is large (i.e., ([mean abnormal - mean normal]/range) x 100 = 25.5% for the magnitude of attention disturbance composite and 29.0% the magnitude of motor activity disturbance composite). In contrast, the M-MAT composites have a small dynamic range between normal and abnormal subjects (i.e., ([mean abnormal - mean normal]/range) x 100 = 10.1% for the M-MAT attention composite and 13.9% the M-MAT motor activity composite). A larger dynamic range between normal and abnormal subjects is desirable to produce composite scores that are sensitive to changes in a subject (i.e., such as a modest improvement resulting from therapy, or a change in the subject over time) and readily interpretable clinically.</li></ul></p><p id="p0074" num="0074">The invention features methods and systems to monitor changes in the magnitude of attentional disturbance and the magnitude of motor activity disturbance in a subject. The disclosure also features methods and systems for determining a subject's degree of concordance with individuals having an attentional disorder versus individuals not having an attentional disorder. The methods and systems of the invention can enable clinicians and consumers to ascertain both the severity of an attentional disorder as well as how much an individual changes over time, or with therapy.</p><heading id="h0001">Systems</heading><p id="p0075" num="0075">The invention consists of a number of parts, including a client software program that runs the protocol and a software program for providing an evaluation according to the methods of the invention. For example, the test itself can consist of a computerized Go/No-Go attention task designed to determine shifts in attentional state (see <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US6685652B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,685,652</text></patcit>) that is coupled to an infrared motion analysis system to record head movements as an index of hyperactivity.</p><heading id="h0002">Motion Detection System</heading><p id="p0076" num="0076">A motion detection system can be used to track the movement of the head an/or lower extremities of the individual receiving a motor activity test. Movement patterns are analyzed using procedures described by <nplcit id="ncit0017" npl-type="s"><text>Teicher et al., J. Am. Acad. Child Adolsec. Psychiatry 35:334 (1996</text></nplcit>), which are based on the concept of microevents. A new microevent begins whenever the marker moves more than a predetermined distance (e.g., 1.0 mm or more) from the location of the previous microevent, and is defined by its position and duration. From the sequence of microevents, the mean locomotor path length can be calculated, along with two scaling exponents.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">The first exponent, the spatial scaling exponent, is a measure of the complexity of the movement and is calculated by ascertaining the logarithmic rate of information decay at progressively lower levels of resolution. Conceptually, if a marker is still or moving in a straight line, no information is lost if the marker's position is sampled less frequently. The total distance traversed can still be calculated. On the other hand, if a marker is moving in a convoluted path, then less frequent sampling smooths out the route and underestimates the distance traveled. Spatial complexity corresponds to the concept of fractal dimensions and ranges from 1.0 (straight line movement) to 2.0 (complex, convoluted movement patterns).</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">The other exponent, known as the temporal scaling exponent, is calculated from the log-log relationship between the frequency of the microevents and their duration. For a two-process model in which a marker is either in motion or immobile, stochastic theory dictates that there will be a greater number of brief periods of immobility than long periods of immobility (though not necessarily a greater amount of time). The log-log relationship provides a<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> robust measure of relative activity versus inactivity and indicates the degree to which a subject is moving in the environment.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Any video camera or other motion-sensing device capable of detecting the movements of the test subject can be used. For example, the motion analysis device can be an infrared motion analysis system (e.g., Qualisys, Glastonbury, CT) that includes a high-resolution CCD infrared video camera, an infrared strobe, and a video processor that provides hardware analysis of the video signal and outputs data to a computer. Such infrared motion analysis systems are known in the art, and are specifically designed to detect and record the precise vertical and horizontal position of small, light-weight infrared reflective markers. These markers are attached to the subject at various points, such as the head, shoulders, arms, legs, and feet. As the subject moves these portions of his or her body, the IR motion analysis system detects changes in the positions of the markers and relays this information to a computer. Successive marker coordinates can be stored in the computer and analyzed using commercially available software (e.g., M-MAT™ software). Desirably, the camera is positioned in front of the subject, who is preferably in a seated position. The camera is also desirably positioned in such a manner that it can capture movements of the reflective markers in three dimensions, including movements towards and away from the display device. The motion analysis device can also include a second camera that can be used in combination with the first camera to better differentiate three dimensional movement. Adults with ADHD can manifest hyperactivity solely through excess movement of their lower extremities while seated. Therefore, the first camera can be used to track the movement of the subject's legs and/or feet or a second camera can be used to track the movement of the subject's lower extremities while the first camera tracks upper body movements.</p><heading id="h0003">Attentional Testing</heading><p id="p0080" num="0080">The attentional testing includes a cognitive control task, such as a continuous performance test (CPT), the results of which are diagnostic of physiological response to medication. For example, a subject's visual attention can be tested by displaying a series of visual stimuli, to which the subject is instructed to respond. Typically, the stimuli are of two types, and the subject is instructed to respond to only one of them. Data are collected for each stimulus presented including the type of stimulus, whether or not the subject responded, and if so, how long the subject took to respond. The continuous performance attention test has been in use since the mid 50's (<nplcit id="ncit0018" npl-type="s"><text>Rosvold et al., J. Consulting and Clinical Psychology 20:343 (1956</text></nplcit>)), with computerized versions available in the 1970's (<nplcit id="ncit0019" npl-type="s"><text>Greenberg, Psychopharmacol. Bull. 23:279 (1987</text></nplcit>)).</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">The CPT results can include measuring errors of commission, errors of omission, and mean correct reaction time with standard deviation. More sophisticated CPT measures, derived from signal detection theory can include a calculation of stimulus sensitivity (d') (see, for example, <nplcit id="ncit0020" npl-type="s"><text>Nuechterlein, J. Abnorm. Psychol. 92:4 (1983</text></nplcit>)).</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">Analysis of the CPT results can also include assessing the pattern or fluctuation in attentional states by a subject during a test period. This approach is described in <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US6685652B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,685,652</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">The methods of the invention may be used alone, together, or in conjunction with other well-known psychological tests for determining attention or reaction time. Testing of the subject's performance may be conducted with or without providing corrective feedback to the subject during performance of the CPT.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">At the end of the testing, the recorded data (e.g., attentional test data and/or motion data) can be processed by a local computer or transmitted over a computer network to a central station for processing. A report can be generated at the testing site, or at the site of remote processing. Such a report may be in a paper form, electronic form, or stored in a database as part of the subject's medical records. The report can include one or more of the following: (i) the unmedicated and medicated results for two or more tests belonging to a test subject; (ii) the results obtained for a test subject and the range of results observed for normal subjects given the subject's gender, age, and/or grade; (iii) the identification of a test subject as normal or having an attentional disorder; (iv) the identity of the drug used to produce medicated test results; (v) the magnitude of attention disturbance for the test subject; (vi) the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> magnitude of motor activity disturbance for the test subject; (vii) the global composite score for the test subject; and/or (viii) the concordance composite score for the test subject.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">The following example is put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how the methods and compounds claimed herein are performed, made, and evaluated, and are intended to be purely exemplary of the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention.</p><heading id="h0004">Example 1: Degree of Concordance.</heading><p id="p0086" num="0086">The degree of concordance is calculated using formula 1.
