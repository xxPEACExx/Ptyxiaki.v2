mxw-id="PDES63960948" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an electronic system for video door entry communication and/or for home automation, such as for example a door entry communication or video door entry communication system or a home automation system, which allows an optimum sizing of the same.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In particular, the present invention relates to an electronic system for the transmission of digital controls and data and of analogue audio and video signals.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Nowadays, in various types of electronic systems, and in particular in electronic systems for video door entry communication and/or for home automation, it is known to use a set of different cables according to the function to be carried out.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In particular, it is known the use of a digital communication BUS for allowing the exchange of control data and signals between the devices belonging to such systems, of a special cable (for example of the coaxial type) for transmitting the video signal, of cables of suitable sections for managing the remote power supply of the devices, and of cables suitable for transmitting the audio signal.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Electronic systems of this type, carrying out functions of a different type, such as for example control and automation of loads such as lights or motors, monitoring and control of rooms such as anti-intrusion systems, communication by telephony and videotelephony, sound broadcasting, heat regulation and so on, are<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> widespread as they are used both in the household and in the service field.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For example, door entry and/or video door entry systems currently known allow the communication of a certain number of intercom stations, positioned inside household units, with one or more external call stations. Likewise, new-generation home automation systems are capable of communicating with the outside world, so as to interact with the building from land and mobile network telephones and/or from any PC, via local network or via the Internet, in order to setup the house to the desired reception, for example for turning the heating on or starting the washing machine, restoring electrical energy, turning some spot lights on, opening a given number of motor-driven shutters, adjusting the room temperature in the rooms and so on. The need of having an increasing number of ancillary functions to use in such electronic systems and inside each household unit, which add up to the usual telephone functions, besides those of communication between telephone and external video door entry station, actuation of electric locks, stairs lights, or any other electrical and/or electronic actuator, has led to the making of a multiwire communication BUS through which both the exchange of digital controls and data, the remote power supply of the single devices belonging to the system, and the exchange of the analogue audio and video signals required for the video door entry function are carried out.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The installation of such systems using connections of a different type causes increasingly higher costs as it requires the use of both specialised personnel for<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> making the required connections, and long installation times usually due to the finding or the make of proprietary cables especially designed for the single system.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In fact, special cables are recommended by the system manufacturers, especially designed for allowing the system operation and comprising cables of different construction technologies and sections.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">By way of an example, the set of recommended cables may comprise a coaxial cable for transmitting video signals, cables of suitable section for managing the remote power supply of the devices, cables for transmitting control signals and audio signals.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the absence of the appropriate cable, an installer usually proceeds by adapting cables he has, to create <i>ad hoc</i> cables so as not to delay the laying of the electronic system for video door entry communication and/or for home automation for when cables especially designed for the same will be available to him.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In addition, this leads to the need of sizing such systems so that they may operate in a reliable manner also when they are not installed by the especially designed cables, but only with substantially any type of cable.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Such sizing involves giving up a part of the performances the system would be capable of offering, for example limiting the maximum number of devices connectable to the system compared to the maximum theoretical number of devices manageable by the same. Likewise, there is also a reduction of the maximum admissible distance of connection between the devices and the multiwire communication BUS compared to the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> theoretically achievable limit, in order to ensure the quality of the signal transmitted, and in particular of the video signal.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The object of the present invention is to obviate the drawbacks mentioned above and in particular to devise an electronic system for video door entry communication and/or for home automation which may be sized so as to use the system resources in an optimum manner.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A further object of the present invention is to provide an electronic system for video door entry communication and/or for home automation which should allow connecting an optimised number of devices at long distances using the features of the multiwire communication BUS.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Another object of the present invention is to provide an electronic system for video door entry communication and/or for home automation which should ensure a quick and simplified installation of the same.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Last but not least, another object of the present invention is to devise an electronic system for video door entry communication and/or for home automation which should be highly reliable and installable at relatively low costs, compared to known techniques, the functions that may be carried out being the same.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">These and other objects according to the present invention are achieved by providing an electronic system for video door entry communication and/or for home automation as illustrated in claim 1.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Further features of the electronic system for video door entry communication and/or for home automation are defined in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The features and the advantages of an electronic system<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> for video door entry communication and/or for home automation according to the present invention will appear more clearly from the following description, made by way of an indicative non-limiting example with reference to the annexed schematic drawings, wherein:

indicated with<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> reference numeral 10, 10'.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The electronic system for video door entry communication and/or for home automation comprises a plurality of electronic devices 11-16, 11'-16' connected to a multiwire communication BUS 19.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the case of an electronic system for door entry communication 10, either of the video type or not, shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, devices 11-14,15-16 connected to the electronic system 10 are both internal stations 11-14, and external stations 15-16.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">By internal station 11-14 it is meant a user appliance, such as for example a door entry system or a video door entry system, installable in household units, which exchanges an audio signal with an external station 15-16 and receives a video signal from the same 15-16.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The internal stations 11-14 therefore comprise an audio interface consisting of at least one microphone 22 and a loudspeaker 21, and in the case of video door entry system, also an interface 23 for displaying video signals, such as a screen, an LCD or an OLED, for displaying images detected by the external stations 15-16 or a warning signal.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Such interfaces 21-23 are managed by first signal processing means 30 that further manage the exchange of data, control signals as well as analogue audio and/or video signals between the internal stations 11-14 and the rest of the system 10.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Likewise, by external stations 15-16 it is meant generic user appliances applied to one of the external walls of a building or an apartment, which exchange an audio signal with the internal stations 11-14 and transmit a video signal to the same 11-14.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> The external stations 15-16 therefore comprise an audio interface consisting of at least one microphone 22 and a loudspeaker 21, and in the case of video door entry system, also an interface for acquiring video signals, such as a telecamera 24.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Interfaces 21, 22 and 24 of the external stations 15/16 are managed by second signal processing means 40 that further manage the exchange of data, control signal as well as analogue audio and/or video signals between the external stations 15-16 and the rest of system 10.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">It is clear that the number of internal 10-14 and external 15-16 devices may be different from system 10 shown by way of an example, and in particular considerably higher.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Each external station 15-16 may further be connected to respective electric locks 17, suitable for opening respective main entrances.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Both the internal stations 11-14, and the external stations 15-16 are connected, all in parallel to one another, to the multiwire communication BUS 19, through which they are supplied through power supply means 20 connected to BUS 19, and exchange data, digital control signals and analogue audio and video signals.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">To this end, the multiwire communication BUS 19 is such as to allow both the remote power supply and the transmission of signals relating to data and information required for carrying out the door entry or video door entry system functions, such as turning the stairs lights on, actuating the electric lock, calling the apartments obtained by assigning a number code to each user name, as well as the ancillary functions, such as transmitting analogue audio and/or video<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> signals between intercommunicating internal stations 11-14, the optional use of the internal stations 11-14 as a telephone, the actuation of alarm devices and the integration of any other electronic automatism.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The deployment of the digital bus 19 in the entire installation may envisage the use of a variable number of accessories (not shown) that allow BUS 19 itself to reach the electronic devices 11-16 adapting to the topology of system 10, 10'.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In the case of an electronic system for home automation 10', shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>, the electronic devices 11, 13, 15, 11', 12', 15', 16' connected to the electronic system 10' comprise both internal 11, 13 and external stations 15, 16, and a plurality of control interfaces 11', 12', 15', 16'. Such internal 11, 13 and external stations 15, 16, as well as the control interfaces 11', 12', 15', 16' are capable of both driving and displaying the status of an electric or electronic actuator (not shown) connected to the same, for example, for monitoring and/or actuating the heating or starting the washing machine, checking the status and optionally restoring electrical energy, turning some spot lights on, opening a given number of motor-driven shutters, adjusting the room temperature in the rooms and so on.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In addition, the internal 11, 13 and external stations 15, 16 may be provided with special connectors 18 suitable for connecting sensors or actuators (not shown) for home automation functions, such as for example gas sensors for detecting abnormal situations, smoke sensors for fire prevention alarm, magnetic contact sensors and/or movement sensors suitable for<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> detecting the opening of doors and windows or the presence of ill intentioned people in the apartment.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">A preferential embodiment further envisages that the signals detected in the case of abnormal situations are transmitted through BUS 19 to a guarded place in a remote position or not, for example through a local or global Ethernet network 28, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Also in this case, the electronic devices 11, 13, 15, 11', 12', 15', 16' are connected, all in parallel to one another, to the multiwire communication BUS 19, through which they are supplied through power supply means 20 and exchange data, signals and controls.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The electronic devices 11, 13, 15, 11', 12', 15', 16' are partially provided with an interface, such as for example a screen 23, for displaying a video signal transmitted through BUS 19, or with audio interfaces 21, 22 or with an image acquisition interface 24.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Also in this case, such interfaces 21-24 and the control interfaces 11', 12', 15', 16' are managed by signal processing and data exchange means 30, 40 that further manage the exchange of data, control signals as well as analogue audio and/or video signals between the electronic devices 11, 13, 15, 11', 12', 15', 16' and the rest of system 10', in particular between the electronic devices 11, 13, 15, 11', 12', 15', 16' and BUS 19.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">According to the present invention, the multiwire communication BUS 19 is made with cable with eight conductors, twisted in pairs, so called twisted pairs, either of the screened type or not.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Twisted conductors usually provide good insulation from external electromagnetic noise and prevent<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> electromagnetic interference or <i>crosstalk</i> between adjacent conductors.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Cables with four pairs of twisted conductors of category 5, also called CAT5, defined through the US standard EIA/TIA-568 or the European one EN50173, are preferably used, terminated by electrical connectors of the type RJ-45 or 8P8C, that is, made according to standard EN60603-7.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Likewise, cables of a similar type are used, such as for example of category 5E (CAT5E), category 6 (CAT6) or category 6E (CAT6E) and so on.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">On the one hand, such cables are particularly widespread among the installers, and therefore very easy to find at electrical material dealers, and on the other hand they are difficult to replace with cables adapted <i>ad hoc</i> since the connection of the single conductors to a connector RJ-45 cannot be carried out manually, the connectors to this purpose having to be connected to the terminations of such connector by a special tool called cable crimper capable of mechanically squeezing the conductors until they remain blocked on the connector.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Moreover, cables CAT5 or the like have well defined features, such as for example impedance, that allow an optimisation in sizing system 10, 10' in particular in defining the number of devices that may be managed by the multiwire communication BUS 19 and the maximum distance of fastening of the same.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In fact, thanks to the higher electromagnetic immunity provided by the pairs of twisted conductors and to the fact that the audio and video signals are transmitted in differential mode, it is possible to maintain the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> signal quality required even on greater distances than those currently achievable in systems using another type of multiwire cables.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The Applicant has encountered considerable technical difficulties for carrying out the replacement of the cables currently used with the cables with four pairs of twisted conductors.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In particular, the replacement of the cables currently used with cables CAT5 or the like has required particular technical modifications to the power supply means 20 used in the electronic system 10, 10' for video door entry communication and/or for home automation as well as to the signal processing and data exchange means 30, 40 of the electronic devices 11-16, 11'-16' themselves.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In fact, since cables CAT5 or the like have conductors with a fixed and particularly small section, they exhibit a higher ohmic drop than the cables used to date that could be designed choosing the most suitable section.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">It is therefore necessary to supply at particularly high voltages - for this type of applications, but below 48V, so that the electronic devices 11-16, 11'-16'

of the internal 11-14 and external devices 15-16 remotely connected as well as concurrently supplying a large number of control stages 42 (for example 400).</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">The

preferably consisting of resistors, located one towards the positive pole and the other towards the negative pole, such as to allow the audio transmitting stages 32 to behave as current generators controlled by microphone 22 and to have at the output a purely differential signal receivable from the corresponding differential audio receiving stages 33 of the receiving device 11-16.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">The power supply means 20 therefore, through a suitable<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> design of the second output impedances Za, also allow suitably supplying the audio circuits of the

as for example the Internet.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">In fact, such network interface 27 is generally already provided with special ports for connectors RJ-45 which envisage the use of cables CAT 5 as this is the standard used for wiring 26 Ethernet networks 28.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">It is therefore easy for the installer to wire the multiwire BUS 19 since the wiring rules and the tools to perform them, such as for example the cable crimper, are the same used for wiring 26 of the Ethernet network 28.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">In this way it is therefore possible to easily perform the

description.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The use of cables with four pairs of twisted conductors allows reaching great distances with the signal, in particular with the video signal, optimising the transmission on the basis of the cable features. Moreover, it is possible to achieve a high immunity of the signal transmission to the environmental electromagnetic noise, in particular adopting methods of transmission of the various signals that use the features of the cable used, such as for example the differential transmission of the various signals and in particular of the video signal.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">In addition, the use of the particular cable allows managing the remote supply of the devices in an optimised and distributed manner.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Last but not least, the use of a widespread type of cables with four pairs of twisted conductors, such as category 5 or the like, greatly simplifies the installer's task and the installation time. Moreover, since such cables have very thin conductors, they also introduce a saving on raw material.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56985584" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Elektronisches System (10; 10') für die Videotürsprechanlagenkommunikation und/oder für die Hausautomation, das eine Vielzahl von elektronischen Geräten (11-16; 11'-16') umfasst, die in Parallelschaltung mit einem Mehrdraht-Kommunikationsbus (19) verbunden sind, wobei dieser Mehrdraht-Kommunikationsbus (19) ferner mit einer Stromversorgungseinrichtung (20) für die Fernstromversorgung dieser elektronischen Geräte (11-16; 11'-16') verbunden ist, wobei dieser Mehrdraht-Kommunikationsbus (19) mittels eines Kabels mit acht paarweise verdrillten Adern hergestellt ist, <b>dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass</b> die vielen elektronischen Geräte (11-16; 11'-16') über diesen Mehrdraht-Kommunikationsbus (19) digitale Daten, digitale Steuersignale, analoge Audiosignale und analoge Videosignale austauschen, wobei diese analogen Signale jeweils im Differentialmodus auf einem verdrillten Adernpaar übertragen werden.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0002" num="0002"><claim-text>Elektronisches System (10; 10') für die Videotürsprechanlagenkommunikation und/oder für die Hausautomation nach Anspruch 1, <b>dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass</b> die elektronischen Geräte (11-16; 11'-16') Mittel (30, 40) für die Signalverarbeitung und den Datenaustausch für den Austausch von Daten, Steuersignalen, Audiosignalen und Videosignalen mit dem Mehrdraht-Kommunikationsbus (19) umfassen, wobei diese Mittel (30, 40) für die Signalverarbeitung und den Datenaustausch eine Vielzahl von Stufen (31, 32, 33, 41) umfassen, die sich zum Verarbeiten von differenziellen Signalen eignen, wobei diese differenziellen Signale von den genannten Paaren verdrillter Adern übertragen werden.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-de-01-0003" num="0003"><claim-text>Elektronisches System (10; 10') für die Videotürsprechanlagenkommunikation und/oder für die Hausautomation nach Anspruch 1 oder 2, <b>dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass</b> das Kabel mit acht paarweise verdrillten Adern des Typs ist, der in der Gruppe enthalten ist, die aus den folgenden Typen besteht:
