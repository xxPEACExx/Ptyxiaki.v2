Heart failure can have many different reasons and pathophysiologies. The complexity and difficulties associated with heart failure has captured the attention of the cardiology community substantially for the last decade. In clinical practice today, many patients can be managed effectively through pharmacological therapy such as beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and diuretics. However, since the introduction of CRT devices they have served as a compliment to drug therapy for heart failure patients. In screening for HF patients the echocardiography measure ejection-fraction (EF) has long since been used to evaluate the systolic function of the patient. If a patient shows up with the traditional heart failure symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, excessive fluid retention etc and has an EF below 30 or 35 %, they are in most cases considered to suffer from heart failure.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">HF patients usually have rather long periods during which they are at a more or less stable level of their disease, during which no apparent change of their condition is present. However, sooner or later some kind of precipitating event occurs that will trigger a worsening of the disease and they can exacerbate very rapidly and may have to be hospitalized for treatment, quite often with pulmonary edema. These precipitating events may be an ischemic event, another disease, non-compliance to drug therapy, etc. Another triggering event may be physical exertion. The tolerance to physical exertion varies greatly between heart failure patients depending on, inter alia, disease status and on the patient's etiology. Although many heart failure patients are eligible for a CRT device it is not obvious that all of them would benefit from the same therapy. Certainly this is where the electrophysiologist's<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> or heart failure specialist's expertise comes into play. Currently, medical history and physical examination are the most important tools that a physician uses to determine and mark the progress of a heart failure patient.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It would be useful if methods and devices were available that help a physician or other medical personnel or to objectively evaluate and tailor therapy for the patient as well as evaluate and monitor heart failure progression (or regression). Further, it would also be useful if methods and devices were available that automatically could adapt the therapy to, for example, cope with changes over time in the level of disease to thereby tailor the therapy for a heart failure patient to allow them to live a more normal life in comparison with a "one size fits all" therapy offered today be many prior art device.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6980851B"><text>US patent 6,980,851</text></patcit> methods and devices for continuously monitoring a heart failure status of a patient are shown. By combining parameters related to heart failure status, for example, parameters derived from sensing signals such as QRS duration, heart rate variability, PR interval, frequency of atrial fibrillation, or frequency of ectopic beats with other parameters such as body temperature during exercise, and changes in activity levels, a clinical state vector that represents an estimate of the patient's current heart failure status can be created. A difference between a presently computed state vector and a previously computed state vector represents a clinical trajectory that indicates if and to what degree a patient's heart failure status has changed. Hence, this approach may provide an indication over disease changes that may assist a physician when evaluating the therapy.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP0503839A"><text>EP 0 503 839</text></patcit> relates to regulating blood flow within the cardiovascular system in a closed-loop control system using ultrasound measurement techniques to determine a hemodynamic status of the patient and to derive a control parameter for modulating the hemodynamics of the system using electrical or pharmaceutical therapy.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP1486232A"><text>EP 1 486 232</text></patcit> discloses a device for decreasing workload, maintaining or increasing cardiac output and/or achieving a desirable autonomic balance by stimulating one or more parasympathetic nerves.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US20060100668A"><text>US 2006/0100668</text></patcit> discloses a control unit that drives an electrode device to apply a stimulating current to an autonomic nerve of a patient.

The method comprises determining a cardiac response of the heart of the patient to changed activity using hemodynamical signal measured at each of at least two different levels of physical activity, wherein at least one level of physical activity corresponds to an increased activity level compared to an activity level at rest. Further, a current cardiac status indicator for the patient is created using the cardiac response, wherein the cardiac status indicator indicates a response of the patient to an increased physical activity as a primarily heart rate response or as a primarily a stroke volume response. The pacing parameters of the cardiac stimulator can thereafter be adapted depending on the current cardiac status indicator, wherein the adapted pacing parameters include a first pacing setting if the current cardiac status indicator indicates a primarily heart rate response or a second pacing setting if the current cardiac status indicator indicates a primarily stroke volume response. When the adaptation process is finished, the new pacing parameters are used by the cardiac stimulator for pacing the heart of the patient until the next adaptation process has been executed, possible resulting in an updated set of pacing parameters, which then replaces the current pacing parameters.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system for adapting a pacing therapy of a cardiac stimulator implanted in a patient. The system comprises an activity detector configured to detect at least one activity parameter reflecting physical activity of the patient and a hemodynamical measuring module configured to<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> measure hemodynamical signals at each of at least two different levels of physical activity the signals reflecting a cardiac response of the heart of the patient to changed activity, wherein at least one level of physical activity corresponds to an increased activity level compared to an activity level at rest. Further, a cardiac status indicator module is configured to create a current cardiac status indicator for the patient using the cardiac response, wherein the cardiac status indicator indicates a response of the patient to an increased physical activity as a primarily heart rate response or as a primarily a stroke volume response. A pacing parameter determining module is configured to determine a pacing parameter setting based on the current cardiac status indicator. The adapted pacing parameters include a first pacing setting if the current cardiac status indicator indicates a primarily heart rate<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> response or a second pacing setting if the current cardiac status indicator indicates a primarily stroke volume response and to instruct a timing circuitry and/or a pacing module of the cardiac stimulator to adapt pacing parameters depending on the current cardiac status indicator. The adapted pacing parameters include a first pacing setting if the current cardiac status indicator indicates a primarily heart rate response or a second pacing setting if the current cardiac status indicator indicates a primarily stroke volume response.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The present invention is based on findings with regard to cardiac response, and especially with regard to cardiac output, of patients, and particularly heart failure patients, to increased metabolic demands, for example, in connection with physical effort. The inventors have inter alia discovered two patient groups displaying significant differences in heart behavior (or cardiac response) at different activity levels. Moreover, the inventors have also found that each of these groups is characterized by clinically distinct changes in hemodynamical parameters. In particular, it was found that within a first group of patients, the increase in cardiac output resulting from the physical effort mainly was achieved by an increased heart rate. That is, within this first patient group, the response to the physical effort was an increased heart rate and a more or less stable (or un-changed) stroke volume or only a very low increase of the stroke volume. Further, in the second group, the increased cardiac output was mainly achieved by an increased stroke volume while the heart rate was substantially un-changed, or showed a very low increase. Accordingly, the inventors have found two hemodynamical parameters that provide valuable information regarding the heart behavior of heart failure patients at different activity levels. Further, the inventors have found two groups of patients in which the heart behaves in distinctly different ways at an increased activity level. The responses identified within these patient groups are in sharp contrast to the expected response which is an increased heart rate and stroke volume.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">These findings can, for example, be used to predict patient response, or heart response, to physical exertion or exercise. For a patient classified as belonging to the first group, a predicted cardiac response to cope with the increased cardiac output resulting from exercise is a heart rate increase and a more or less un-changed stroke volume. Similarly, for a patient classified as belonging to the second group, a predicted cardiac response to exercise is instead an increased stroke volume and a more or less stable heart rate. Furthermore, patient response to physical exertion or exercise can be monitored over time in order to identify, for example, disease progression. Over time a specific patient can move within a group<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> and even from one group to the other. Of course, many patients have a combination of the two extreme responses but where one of the responses, i.e. primarily heart rate response or primarily stroke volume response, is more pronounced.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">These findings can also be used to tailor-make or customize exercise-modes for heart failure patients to obtain a better adaptation of the therapy to the behavior of their heart.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The inventors have further discovered that the patients in the first group all were diagnosed with ischemic cardiomyopathy and all patients in the second group were diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy. Thus, the present findings can be used to classify patient etiology and to monitor a progression of the disease in question.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The present invention can thus be used to inform the physician and/or the patient in which direction the patient characteristics is moving and provide valuable information on which aspects of the patient characteristics that is more important to monitor for a particular patient.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Furthermore, the present invention provides an on-demand tool for the physician enabling a monitoring whether if a certain pacemaker setting, drug or other means of therapy can influence the parameter to move in a desired way and it also possible to check the status of the patient in a qualitative way.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The customized exercise mode or mode for increased physical activity can be tailored for the two identified groups. If a person is unable to respond to an increased metabolical need by increasing stroke volume, the patient is classified as likely to respond by an exaggerated response in the heart rate and an exercise mode is thus adapted to handle this. If instead a patient is capable of increasing stroke volume but show signs of chronotropic incompetence, it may be appropriate to instead increase the slope of the rate response. The slope is the sensitivity of the change of stimulation frequency as a response to a certain change of the physical activity. Patients with a primarily heart rate response to an increased workload may have settings with a lower maximum track rate, as these patients may have a tendency to rush the heart and thereby worsen their (often) ischemic condition. The maximum track rate is the highest ventricular stimulation rate that will follow detected intrinsic atrial rate. The settings of the exercise mode can be set automatically by the cardiac stimulator in an adaptation procedure or session or may be decided exactly by the managing physician.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">It also conceivable to implement an exercise alert informing the patient, for example, by means of a vibrator device, which helps or assists the patient to even dare to try to exercise or increased the level of physical extortion. It also possible to<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> apply optimized Bi-ventricular pacing for ischemia as the patient is classified in this group.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">For patients with a primarily stroke volume response, a possible setting is a setting that promotes an increased heart rate in connection with activity by increasing the slope of the rate response setting such that a higher rate is employed during physical exertion. Patients in this group often has a dilated cardiomyopathy and are likely to be very sensitive to myocardial wall stress, a condition caused by overload of blood volume or pressure. By using blood volume controlled pacing as described in <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US5417715A"><text>US patents 5,417,715</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="US6078835A"><text>6,078,835</text></patcit> by the same applicant, this can be managed.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the cardiac response is determined by the cardiac stimulator based on recorded hemodynamical signals at each of at least two different levels of physical activity. The hemodynamical signals are according to one embodiment, cardiac impedance signals measured by different impedance vectors. One vector configuration includes two impedance vectors. In the first impedance vector, current is injected between a right atrium ring electrode and a right ventricle ring electrode and the resulting voltage is measured between a right atrium tip electrode and a right ventricle tip electrode. In the second vector, the current is injected between a right ventricle ring electrode and a right ventricle tip electrode and the resulting voltage is measured over the same electrodes. The cardiac impedance signals obtained by these vectors divulge information about the local (first vector) and global (second vector) global cardiac contraction characteristics. Based on these cardiac impedance signals different impedance parameters can be extracted, for example, slope of the waveform in a certain portion of the signal, peak-to-peak value of the waveform or area of a certain portion of the waveform.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Alternative hemodynamical signals include blood pressure, for example, measured by means of a pressure sensor attached to septum, which enables measurements of blood pressure in left ventricle.

For these patients filling pressures are imperative for the little diastolic function they have left. With a rapidly increasing heart rate the result may be that filling pressures decline resulting in an abnormally small end diastolic volume, which may yield an extremely high ejection fraction but virtually zero stroke volume.

The present invention is based on the findings that in particular two patient groups displaying significant differences in heart behaviour (or cardiac response) at different activity levels. A first group of patients respond to an increase in physical exertion by primarily an increased heart rate. That is, within this first patient group, the response to the physical effort was an increased heart rate and a more or less stable (or un-changed) stroke volume or only a very low increase of the stroke volume. In a second group, the increased cardiac output is mainly achieved by an increased stroke volume while the heart rate is substantially un-changed. Thus, this can be used to predict patient response to physical exertion, to monitor disease progression or to tailor exercise modes for heart failure patients. An adaptation process to implement an exercise mode can be initiated or triggered automatically at detection of at least one event related to an activity parameter detected at the patient, by receipt of an instruction to adapt the pacing parameters received from an external unit 6 such as a programmer unit, or at regular intervals of time. For example, the physician may manually via the programmer unit 6 initiate an adaptation session at a follow-up visit by a patient 5 carrying an implanted cardiac stimulator 10 at a clinic.

In the latter case, an activity level detection step can be included between steps S100 and S110. If the activity of the patient is monitored and detected on continuous basis, an adaptation session may be initiated at, for example, at detection of an activity level above a predetermined level. In embodiments of the present invention, a cardiac response is determined using at least one hemodynamical parameter or signal recorded at each of at least two different levels of physical activity.

In an alternative embodiment, the cardiac response is determined by means of observations of a cardiac response at each of at least two different levels of physical activity, which includes observing a heart rate response and/or stroke volume response to changed activity. This can be performed by a physician using external monitoring/recording/detecting equipment 7, as has been discussed above.
