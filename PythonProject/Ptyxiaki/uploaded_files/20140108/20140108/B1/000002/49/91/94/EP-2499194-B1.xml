Applications in which a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) may be advantageous include coatings which are sometimes used, for example, in conjunction with protective coverings for electronic screens such as mobile phone screens or LCD monitor screens.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Many current adhesive formulations for use in such applications are silicone based or, if acrylic based, include an isocyanate cross-linking agent that effectively limits the acrylic base to hydroxyl functional acrylics. The use of isocyanates as cross-linking agents has numerous other drawbacks. In addition to restricting the types of acrylic base that can be used, isocyanates have a level of toxicity and can be expensive. Some isocyanates also have some level of coloration that makes them undesirable for use in screen coverings.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Isocyanates, when used as crosslinking agents, also suffer from the drawback that they lack stability at ambient conditions. As a result, current adhesive formulations employing these compounds as cross-linkers are not mixed together until shortly before use, typically leading to an extra processing step onsite at the manufacturing facility where the adhesive is to be applied.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">These and other drawbacks are present in current adhesive formulations.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to one embodiment, an adhesive formulation is disclosed. The formulation comprises a pre-polymerized cross-linkable non-water soluble acrylic based pressure sensitive adhesive, a cross-linking agent selected from the group consisting of metal chelates, silanes, epoxy-functional compounds, aziridine compounds, multifunctional amines, alkyl halide compounds, multifunctional acids, multifunctional mercaptans, multifunctional epoxy compounds, and combinations thereof, and a polyol having a weight average molecular weight in the range from 1,000 g/mol to 10,000 g/mol. The adhesive formulation, when cured, is selfwetting and has a peel strength less than 223 g/cm (20 oz/in).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to another embodiment, an adhesive formulation is provided having less than an effective amount of isocyanate and the polyol is a polyether polyol.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">An advantage of exemplary embodiments is that the presence of isocyanates can be minimized or eliminated, thereby providing formulations that can result in a longer work life, lower toxicity, and better environmental qualities.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Another advantage is that exemplary embodiments can in some cases be manufactured at a lower cost and can also be made as a shelf-stable ready-to-use formulation that does not depend on on-site mixing, all while still exhibiting good removability and self wetting characteristics for use with protective coverings for display screens and other devices.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Formulations in accordance with exemplary embodiments also expand the types of acrylic polymers that can be used as the base, including the use of functional acrylics in addition to hydroxyl functional acrylics.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">These and other advantages will be apparent from the following more detailed description of exemplary embodiments.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to exemplary embodiments, an adhesive formulation is provided that does not require the presence of isocyanate and which is not limited to hydroxyl functional acrylics as the acrylic PSA base component. Thus, adhesive formulations are provided that can reduce or preferably eliminate the use of isocyanates as cross-linking agents. Exemplary embodiments thus provide formulations that can result in a longer work life, lower toxicity, better environmental qualities, a lower cost and/or a ready-to-use formulation, while exhibiting good removability and a self wetting-ability on display screens and other devices and also expanding the types of acrylic polymers that can be used as the base. Pot life may be up to 1 year, including up to 3 months when an epoxy and/or a silane crosslinker is used.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Formulations in accordance with exemplary embodiments are such that, when cured, they exhibit low peel strength as well as characteristics of being what is sometimes referred to as self-wetting. By "self-wetting" is meant that the cured adhesive formulation exhibits spontaneous wetting out on a smooth surface to which it is applied with little or no external pressure. An additional characteristic of a self-wetting adhesive formulation is that the cured adhesive is removable with little or no residue remaining on the surface to which it had been applied. The peel strength of the cured formulation is less than 223 g/cm (20 oz/in). and in some cases less than 112 g/cm (10 oz/in).</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Thus, exemplary formulations can also easily be removed, so that when used for screen protection for example, a film covering can be removed, should a consumer desire to do so or if other circumstances warrant, without damaging the screen or leaving behind a residue. Exemplary formulations also exhibit a low peel strength upon curing resulting an adhesive that is easily removable.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">All of the foregoing can be achieved using exemplary embodiments and without the use of isocyanate compounds which may be in less than an effective amount and in some embodiments are excluded entirely.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Exemplary formulations comprise a pre-polymerized crosslinkable acrylic based PSA component, a crosslinking agent, and a polyol.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The cross-linkable PSA component is a non-water soluble acrylic based PSA and may contain carboxyl, hydroxyl or epoxy functional groups or any combination of such functional groups. The PSA may also contain amine and/or acid functionality.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to one embodiment, the cross-linkable PSA component is a co-polymer containing at least one monomer from a first group consisting of hydroxyl ethyl acrylate, hydroxyl ethyl methacrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, acrylic acid and methacrylic acid and containing at least one monomer from a second group consisting of 2-ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, methyl (meth)acrylate, isooctyl (meth)acrylate, vinyl acetate, and vinyl pyrrolidone, in which "(meth)acrylate" is meant that either or both the acrylate and methacrylate versions of the monomer may be used. It will be appreciated that more than one type of monomer from each group may be incorporated into the polymer.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The monomers of the PSA component are typically polymerized by free-radical polymerization in the presence of a solvent, the PSA component being pre-polymerized prior to being combined with the cross-linking agent and polyol. Any suitable free radical initiator may be used; exemplary initiators include, but are not limited to, peroxy and/or azo compounds. In a similar fashion, any suitable non-aqueous solvent for use with acrylic polymers may be used and can include ethyl acetate; toluene; hydrocarbons such as heptane or hexane; alcohols; and combinations thereof, all by way of example only. In one embodiment, the solid content of the PSA component is 33% by weight to 38% by weight and the solution has a viscosity in the range of 15,000 to 40,000 cps. The molecular weight (weight average) of the resulting polymer may range from 200,000 g/mol to 800,000 g/mol.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Suitable crosslinking agents for use with exemplary embodiments include metal chelates, silanes, epoxy-functional compounds, aziridine compounds, multifunctional amines, alkyl halide compounds, multifunctional acids, multifunctional mercaptans, multifunctional epoxy compounds, and combinations thereof. Exemplary metal chelates include organic titanates<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">(e.g. TYZOR available from DuPont), as well as metal salts, such as metal acetylacetonate in which the metal is Al, Fe, Zr, or Ti.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In embodiments in which the acrylic PSA is formulated with an acid functionality, cross-linking agents preferably include metal chelates, silanes, epoxy-functional compounds, aziridine compounds, multifunctional amines, and/or alkyl halide compounds. In embodiments in which the acrylic PSA does not contain an acid functionality, the cross-linking agents preferably include multifunctional amines, multifunctional acids, multifunctional mercaptans, and multifunctional epoxy compounds. A polyol may also be used as a crosslinking agent in the presence of a catalyst.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Cross-linking agents such as metal chelates and epoxy compounds result in crosslinking reactions that occur quickly and which can be completed during the coating process or soon thereafter, in contrast to current isocyanate crosslinked formulations that may take up to a week or more to fully cure. The cross-linking agent is typically added as a separate component, although the PSA may be self-crosslinking, with cross-linkable moieties incorporated into the acrylic polymer.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The amount of crosslinking agent may be between 0.1% by weight to 10% by weight of the solids content of the total adhesive formulation, and in one embodiment may be between 0.1% by weight and 5% by weight of the solids content of the total adhesive formulation.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The formulation further comprises one or more polyol compounds. Any polyol may be used. In one embodiment, the polyol compound is a polyether polyol and in particular include polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, for example. The polyol may have a weight average molecular weight between 1,000 and 10,000 g/mol. In another embodiment, the weight average molecular weight of the polyol is between 2,000 to 5,000 g/mol.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The polyol component is present as about 10% by weight to about 60% by weight of the total acrylic PSA component (i.e. that of both the monomer constituents and the solvent), and in some cases is 20% by weight to 50% by weight of the acrylic PSA component.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">That is, adhesive formulations in accordance with exemplary embodiments, on a solids basis, are typically 25% to 90% by weight acrylic PSA component, 0.1 to 10% by weight cross-linking agent, and 15% to 75% by weight polyol component. In some embodiments, the acrylic PSA component is present as less than 50% by weight solids of the total adhesive formulation.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The pre-polymerized acrylic PSA component, the crosslinking agent and the polyol component are mixed together thoroughly in a solvent to form the adhesive formulation. The solvent may be, and usually is, a common solvent, such that the same solvent is used both to carry out the polymerization of the acrylic PSA component and for adding the additional constituents to form the adhesive formulation in accordance with the exemplary embodiments.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">If desired for processing purposes, the viscosity of the formulation can be adjusted by adding or removing solvent. In some embodiments, it may also be desirable to provide an effective amount (typically up to 10% by weight (solids)) of an anti-gelling additive to the composition, such as 2,4-pentanedione, particularly in embodiments which employ a metal chelate as a cross-linking agent. Other conventional additives used with other known acrylic PSA formulations for various purposes may also be employed.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The adhesive mixture can be coated on any suitable substrates including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film, polyurethane film, and polyethylene film, by way of example only. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to surface-treat the film prior to application to enhance the anchorage between the adhesive and its substrate following crosslinking. Surface treatment may be accomplished by any suitable method, including corona discharge or priming, by way of example only. Where corona discharge is used as a surface treatment method, the adhesive formulation should be laminated to the treated film within about five minutes of the surface treatment to achieve better anchorage between the adhesive and the film.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The films to which the formulation is applied can then be subjected to a curing process, typically a thermal curing or drying process, to remove the solvent and to cross-link the formulation, thereby creating the adhesive in situ on the film (and/or the release liner). Although<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> not wishing to be bound by theory, in embodiments in which metal chelates such as metal salts or organic titanates are used as crosslinking agents, the resulting cross-linked adhesive is believed to be a matrix in which the PSA component is cross-linked by metal chelation and in which the polyol floats within the matrix but is not chemically linked with the polymer chains of the PSA component. In any event, cured adhesive formulations in accordance with exemplary embodiments are characterized by being self-wetting and having a low peel strength.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">A release liner, such as a silicone release liner, may then be laminated over the cured adhesive until the film is ready to be applied, at which point the release liner can be removed to expose the adhesive. Alternatively, the adhesive may be applied to the release liner first, and then be laminated to the film.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The film can then be adhered to display screens, for example, to assist in protecting the screens during and after the manufacture of the electronic devices in which the screens are employed. In embodiments in which the adhesive is used to adhere a protective film to display screens, the adhesive formulation is typically formulated to be transparent and preferably is optically clear. However, adhesive formulations in accordance with exemplary embodiments are not limited to being clear regardless of whether the formulations are used in conjunction with protective coverings for display screens or for any other purposes.</p><heading id="h0006">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p0034" num="0034">The invention is further described in the context of the following examples, which are presented by way of illustration, not of limitation.</p><heading id="h0007"><u>PSA component formation (Examples 1-9)</u></heading><p id="p0035" num="0035">Various acrylic PSA components were polymerized using each of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate (ranging between 40 to 70% by weight of total monomer weight), butyl acrylate (15 to 25% by weight of total monomer weight), methyl acrylate (15 to 30% by weight), vinyl pyrrolidone (about 1 to 10% by weight of total monomer weight), and glycidyl methacrylate (0.1 to 5% by weight of total monomer weight) in combination with acrylic acid (3 to 10% by weight of total monomer weight) in<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> ethyl acetate as a solvent.
