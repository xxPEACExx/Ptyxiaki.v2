mxw-id="PDES63960275" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to a control algorithm capable of generating instantaneous torque of desired sign in electric machines exchanging energy with a mains source.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Three-by-three matrix converters using pairs of anti-parallel thyristors, preferably silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) on one diagonal of the matrix are often called softstarters because of their widespread use in improving the starting, accelerating as well as decelerating and stopping of three-phase squirrel-cage induction motors, which would otherwise be subject to deleterious transients during their starting and stopping phases if they were connected directly to the mains.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Because of the nature of the thyristors, as reflected by their constitutive equations, and the topological structure of this conversion circuit, the evolution of its electrical quantities can evolve in time in highly complex ways, also because the use of SCRs and possibly diodes considerably limits the possibilities of controlling such a circuit.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Despite their intrinsic limitations, the thyristors-based softstarters are widely used to accelerate and decelerate induction motors when no sophisticated quality of motion is required. Their widespread use, still today, is facilitated by their ruggedness and low cost which are still largely unmatched even by the simplest and heaviest-duty motor drives based on voltage-source, two-level, three-phase AC/DC/AC converters.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Additionally, the present availability of low cost, but significantly performing, digital control architectures allows<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> nowadays for employing more sophisticated control techniques for the softstarters which were not economically possible decades ago since the complexity of the required analog/digital circuits rendered them unacceptable in industrial mass production at that time. Document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US7023166B"><text>US 7023166</text></patcit> describes a power converter for controlling an induction machine drive in the four quadrants of the torque-speed plane. The controller detects the direction of the stator current, the rotor electromotive force, the supply voltage and the angular speed.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">A main problem in the use of the thyristor-based softstarters for accelerating or decelerating an electrical machine is constituted by the undesired reversals of the sign of the instantaneous electromagnetic torque generated by the machine, as well as a difficult regulation of such a torque.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">This reality leads to deleterious mechanical stresses both for the machine and mainly for the load attached to it.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further, the decelerations are less efficient thereby leading to longer braking times.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Yet further, the control of the thyristor-based softstarters is limited during acceleration and deceleration due to the nature of the thyristors.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">At least some of these problems and shortcomings can, in principle, be solved by adding components both inside and outside the softstarter including the use of external contactors. However, this renders the overall machine control apparatus comprising the softstarter more complex, larger, and more expensive.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a thyristor-based apparatus and a method, respectively, for generating electromagnetic torque in an electric machine in order to start, to accelerate, as well as to decelerate and even to brake the electric machine, which address the above issues.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">It is a further object of the invention to provide such apparatus and method, which are simple, robust, reliable, and of low cost.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">These objects among others are, according to the present invention, attained by apparatuses and methods as claimed in the appended patent claims.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to one aspect of the invention, an apparatus for generating electromagnetic torque in an N-phase electric machine, N being a positive integer, is provided. The apparatus comprises N lines, each of the N lines including an input terminal, an output terminal, and at least a pair of thyristors, or of one thyristor and one diode, connected, preferably in parallel, between the input terminal and the output terminal such that the cathode of a first one of the components in the thyristor or diode-thyristor pair is connected to the anode of the second one of the components in the thyristor or diode-thyristor pair and the cathode of the second one of the components in the thyristor or diode-thyristor pair is connected to the anode of the first one of the components in the thyristor or diode-thyristor pair. Such connection is referred to as an anti-parallel connection. The N lines are connected between a mains and the electric machine. An apparatus is provided for repeatedly or continuously determining at least the sign of a voltage over the thyristor or diode-thyristor pair in at least one of the N lines, means are provided for repeatedly or continuously determining at least one parameter related to the electromagnetic field in the electric machine, and a control device is provided for controlling the operation of the thyristor or diode-thyristor pair of the at least one of the N lines in response to at least the determined sign of the voltage and the determined parameter related to the electromagnetic field in the electric machine.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Preferably, the at least one parameter related to the electromagnetic field is a function of the magnetic fluxes and/or currents in the electric machine. Such function can be estimated from line currents as measured by apparatuses suitable to measure currents and/or voltages across each of the thyristor or diode-thyristor pairs and line-to-line voltages of the electric machine and/or of the mains, preferably at the input terminals of the N lines, as measured by apparatuses suitable to measure voltages.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Advantageously, the control arrangement is arranged to fire repeatedly at least one thyristor of the thyristor or diode-thyristor pair in the at least one of the N lines, each time only when the following conditions are met: the last voltage over the thyristor or diode-thyristor pairs gives for the thyristor a forward voltage drop of a specified size and the thyristor is directed such that a current through the thyristor, taken into account at least the sign of the function of the magnetic fluxes and/or currents in the electric machine, will generate a desired electromagnetic torque.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Still preferably, means for determining a time derivative, e.g. a total or partial time derivative, of the function of the magnetic fluxes and/or currents in the electric machine is provided, wherein the control arrangement is arranged to repeatedly or continuously fire at least one thyristor of the thyristor or diode-thyristor pair in the at least one of the lines only if at least the sign of the function of the magnetic fluxes and/or currents in the electric machine and at least the sign of the time derivative of the function of the magnetic fluxes and/or currents in the electric machine are in specified correlations.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">An additional problem with the thyristor-based softstarter of prior art is that sometimes when braking the machine, it may<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> occur that the machine begins to spin in the opposite direction. In some applications such speed reversal is not accepted.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">It is therefore a particular object of the invention to provide such apparatus and method, which can be designed to prevent speed reversal of the electric machine, while no additional components in the softstarter or external contactors are necessary. Additionally, the same thyristors used for decelerating and, if desired, even stopping the electric machine should be capable of being used also for starting and accelerating the electric machine.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The use of the present invention for the purpose of decelerating a machine until it is brought to stop (braking) is based on a design that generates zero electromagnetic torque when the rotor of the electric machine is at rest, thereby significantly reducing the risks of undesired speed reversals.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to a particular aspect of the invention the apparatus of the first aspect of the invention is provided wherein N is three and the input terminals of the three lines are connected to output terminals of a three-phase mains. When it is desired to brake the electric machine by decelerating it until it stops, the control device connects the electric machine such that electric current can flow in no more than two phases of the three-phase mains via at least the thyristor or diode-thyristor pair in the at least one of the three lines, and controls the operation of the thyristor or diode-thyristor pair in a first one of the three lines in response to the measured voltage and the determined parameter related to the electromagnetic field in the electric machine.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">By having the electric machine connected to only two phases of the mains, an electromagnetic field of constant direction is created in the stator of the machine. The torque created by such a field is zero when the rotor of the machine is at rest;<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> therefore such a connection with the mains reduces the likelihood of undesired rotation of the rotor at zero speed.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In practice each of the thyristor or diode-thyristor pairs has a parallelly connected by-pass switch which is closed during normal operation (in order to prevent the current from going through the thyristor or diode-thyristor pair during operation, thereby reducing energy losses). During the braking of the machine, the switch of the first one of the lines is open, the switch of a second line is closed, and the switch of a third line is open. Each thyristor of the thyristor or diode-thyristor pair of the first one of the lines is fired repeatedly, each time only when the following conditions are met: the measured voltage over the thyristor or diode-thyristor pairs gives for the thyristor a forward voltage above a specified values and the thyristor is directed such that a current through the thyristor, taken into account at least the sign of the function of the magnetic fluxes and/or currents in the electric machine, will generate an electromagnetic torque braking the electric machine. Alternatively, the switch of the second line is left open and the thyristor or diode-thyristor pair thereof is fired systematically to emulate a continuous connection. When each thyristor of the thyristor or diode-thyristor pair of the first one of the lines is fired, current is flowing in two phases of the mains, in two of the lines, and in one, two, or three phases of the electric machine depending on how the electric machine is configured and connected to the lines.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">It shall be appreciated that one of the thyristors in each thyristor pair may be exchanged for a diode, or one of the thyristors in each thyristor pair is fired systematically to emulate the operation of a diode. In such instance, only the other thyristor of the thyristor pair or the thyristor of the diode-thyristor pair is fired repeatedly when the above-described conditions are met.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">By means of the present invention softstarters with improved starting, acceleration, deceleration and braking capabilities of the mechanical load coupled to the electric machines can be provided. Additionally, speed reversal risks in machine braking after that zero speed has been reached, are minimized. The need of additional components or switches beyond the strictly minimum necessary ones is avoided.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The operation can be realized with minimum knowledge about the electric machine, e.g. limited to some nameplate data only.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Further characteristics of the invention, and advantages thereof, will be evident from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments of the present invention given hereinafter and the accompanying <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">Figs. 1-6</figref>, which are given by way of illustration only, and are thus not limitative of the present invention.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0028" num="0028"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> displays in a schematic circuit diagram a thyristors-based softstarter connected between an electric motor and three-phase mains for generating electromagnetic torque in the electric motor according to one embodiment of the invention.
