More specifically, the present disclosure relates to a shape detection method and a shape detection device for a shape measuring apparatus that is suitable to be used for a circularity measuring apparatus and is capable of effortlessly detecting, with one calculation operation, the shape of a measured object having a complicated shape that makes it difficult to perform a continued measurement, and had been calculated only by divisional measurements.</p><heading id="h0003">2. <u>Description of Related Art</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In order to measure an object having a rotating columnar or cylindrical shape, a shape measuring apparatus, such as a circularity measuring apparatus, is known that collects from such a measured object, various data related to circularity including circularity, concentricity, and coaxiality. When using such a circularity measuring apparatus, a measured object is placed on a turn table. The surface shape of the measured object is detected by a detecting head and the like while the turn table is rotated. Accordingly, the surface shape data of the measured object is accumulated and a value such as circularity is measured and calculated (Related Art 1).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In particular, a stylus having a spherical gauge head at its extremity is biased in a radius direction of the turn table (referred to as R axis direction) and is contacted on a surface of the measured object. A displacement amount of the stylus is detected by a linear encoder while the rotation angle of the turn table is detected by the rotary encoder. By pairing both of the detected values as detection data, the detection data is collected while the measured object is rotated with one revolution, which makes it possible to measure the shape of the entire periphery. Further, the collected detection data is used to perform a minimum square method, minimum domain method, or the like in order to obtain further strict average circular data, which will be used to calculate a circularity value and the like.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, however, when measuring an object such as a measured object 24, whose shape makes it difficult to perform a continued measurement, due to its protrusions 24a or cut-out portions for key holes or serrations, a circularity measurement apparatus that does not have a profiling measurement function would need to divide the measurement into four partial<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> circumferences as shown in measurements (1) - (4) of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, in order to minimize physical damages on the detector. Therefore, a geometrical tolerance can only be obtained to each of the partially divided circumferences. In other words, while the detector that detects displacement is provided with the stylus at its extremity, the stylus only moves in the R axis direction. Therefore, only the displacement in the R axis direction is detected. Accordingly, when there is a projection, the stylus may not be able to move over the projection and break the detector. In addition, when there is a groove, the stylus may become trapped therein and may not be able to emerge therefrom, which may also cause the breakage of the detector.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Accordingly, in order to obtain the geometric tolerance of the entire shape, one must first obtain individual geometric tolerance values of each of the partially divided circumferences, and estimate the geometric tolerance of the entire shape using the maximum and minimum values of the individual partial data.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Related Art 2 describes another method of calculating circularity of a cross section shape having cut-out portions, by removing concave bottom portion data and convex apex portion data that are not subject to the measurement, and calculating the circularity based on the remaining measurement data.

In this regard, no attempt is made to show structural details of the present invention in more detail than is necessary for the fundamental understanding of the present invention, the description is taken with the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how the forms of the present invention may be embodied in practice.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">An embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in detail with reference to the drawings.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a schematic view of a circularity measuring apparatus according to the embodiment of the present invention. <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a configuration of the circularity measuring apparatus. In the present embodiment, a measured object 24 is placed on a turn table 12 provided on a base 11. A drive command from a CPU is input in a motor drive circuit 33A so that a motor 22 is rotated. The driving force is transmitted to a rotating shaft of the turn table 12 via a belt 21 A and a pulley, and the turn table 12 is turned at a constant speed. The rotating angle θ is sequentially detected by a rotary encoder 21 and input to the CPU 31 as a digital signal. A displacement detection signal from a detection head 20 in a radius direction (R axis direction) of the turn table 12 (measured object 24) is converted to a digital signal by an A/D converter 35 and sequentially input to the CPU 31. A stylus 26 is attached to the detection head 20. The stylus 26 is continuously displaced and biased by a spring or the like, to a predetermined constant direction with respect to the detection head 20. When measuring the object, a tip of the stylus contacts the measured object 24. The stylus 26 is displaced over the biasing force of the spring, and the displacement amount of the stylus 26 is detected by a displacement detector configured with a differential transformer or the like within the detection head 20. Normally, although the resolving power of the displacement detector is high, the measurable range is quite small, which is ± 300 µm. Therefore, in order to adjust the location of the detection head 20, the CPU 31 automatically controls each axial direction drive of Z axis (vertical direction) and R axis (radius direction). Specifically, a drive command of the Z axis direction is input to the motor drive circuit 33B by the CPU 31 and a Z axis direction driver 29 moves the detection head 20 in the Z axis direction. Similarly, a drive command of the R axis direction is input to the motor drive circuit 33C by the CPU 31 and an R axis direction driver 28 moves the detection head 20 in the R axis direction. A linear encoder that detects the location in the R axis direction is provided in the R axis direction driver 28.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The displacement detection signal from the linear encoder is first input to the A/D converter 35 for conversion into a digital signal. Then, the signal is input to the CPU 31. Since the detection signal of the rotation angle θ from the rotary encoder 21 is already a digital signal, it is directly input to the CPU 31. These digital signals are paired and treated as measurement data and stored in the memory circuit 39. As needed, the data is retrieved from the CPU 31 for circularity calculation, coaxiality calculation and the like, through a minimum square method, a minimum domain method and the like. The result of such calculation is displayed on a display<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> 40 or print-recorded by a printer 43. An operator can instruct from a keyboard 41 through which path the display head 20 is moved, what kind of geometrical calculation is performed on the measured data, and the like. As needed, it is possible to output the measured data or the result of the geometrical calculation through communication with outside.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> illustrates in detail a combining process according to the embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">At step 100, a plurality of partial measurement data that are set is retrieved.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">At step 110, for combining cross sectional data, a measurement reference position of the detector is set from the first partial measurement data.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">At step 120, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>, the operator views a set up screen displayed on the display 40 and copies data from a sequence of partial measurement data to an index corresponding to a measurement location of the cross sectional data sequence to be combined with. Specifically, the list on the left side of <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> contains partial circumferential data as candidates for combining into the cross sectional data. For example, by pressing a "→" button in the center of the screen, it is possible to store the data as circumferential data that configures the cross section in the list on the right side.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">At this time, the difference given to the measurement data by the measurement reference position is added. Particularly, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>, discrepancy of each cross sectional data is corrected and one cross section is configured as shown on the right side of <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>. In <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>, Rn is the n<sup>th</sup> measured radius value of the cross section. Δr<sub>n-1</sub> is a difference between the i<sup>th</sup> measured radial value of the cross section and the first measured radial value of the cross section.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">For example, when the first measurement data of the cross section is x(i)<sub>1</sub>, the second measurement data of the cross section is x(i)<sub>2</sub> + Δr<sub>2-1</sub>, the third measurement data of the cross section is x(i)<sub>3</sub> + Δr<sub>3-1</sub>, and the fourth measurement data of the cross section is x(i)<sub>4</sub> + Δr<sub>4-1</sub>.
