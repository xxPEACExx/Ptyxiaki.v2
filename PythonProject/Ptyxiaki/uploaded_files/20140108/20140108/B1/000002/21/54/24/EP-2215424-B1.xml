Such functional blocks may be realized by any number of hardware or software components configured to perform the specified functions and achieve the various results. For example, the present invention may employ various sensors, restraints. biasers, control surfaces, and the like, which may carry out a variety of functions. In addition, the present invention may be practiced in conjunction with any number of craft or deployable systems, and the system described is merely one exemplary application for the invention. Further, the present invention may employ any number of conventional techniques for sensing movement, restraining elements, deploying elements, and the like<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Various representative implementations of the present invention may be applied to any system for deploying movable elements. Certain representative implementations may include, for example control surfaces, biasers, restraints, sensors, and release machanisms. Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, methods and apparatus for deploying control surfaces according to various aspects of the present invention may operate in conjunction with a projectile 100 having deployable element, such as a missile or rocket having deployable fins 110. The projectile 100 includes a deployment system 120 to move the deployable fins 110 between deployed and nondeployed positions.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The projectile 100 comprises a moving system, for example to deliver a payload. The projectile 100 may comprises any system having deployable elements, such as a missile, rocket, guided bomb, aircraft, or torpedo. In the present embodiment, the projectile comprises a guided rocket. The projectile 100 includes deplorable fins 110, which are deployed by the deployment system 120. For example, the deployment system 120 may deploy the deployable fins 110 at a selected time or event following launch of the guided rocket. The deployment system 120 may, however, be configured to deploy the deployable fins 110 or other deployable elements in any appropriate manner.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The deployable fins 110 move between physical positions. The deployable fins 110 may comprise any deployable elements associated with the projectile 100 such as control surfaces, sensor varies, or propulsion systems. In the present embodiment, the deployable elements comprise fins, such as tail fins, canards, wings, stabilators, and the like. In particular, the present rocket deploys a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> set of tail fins. The tail fins are deployable between a nondeployed position and a deployed position in response to the deployment system 120. For example, referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2A</figref>, in a nondeployed position, the deployable fins 110 may be folded to be substantially flat against a main body of the projectile 100. Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2B</figref>, in a deployed position, the deployable fins 110 may move to extend to a position subsantially perpendicular to the main body of the projectile 100. The deployed and nondeployed positions may, however, comprise any appropriate positions for the deployable fins 110 or other deployable elements.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The deployment system 120 controls the movement of the deployable elements between the deployed and nondeployed positions. The demployment system 120 may comprise any system for controlling deployment, such as actuators, springs, retainers, and sensors. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, in the present embodiment, the deployment system 120 comprises a plurality of biasers 310 and a plurality of retainers 320 affixed to each deployble fin 110. Each biaser 310 biases a deployable fin 110 to move the deployable fin 110 from the nondeployed position to the deployed position. Each retainer 320 retains a deployable fin 110 in position until a selected time or event, at which point a first retainer 320A releases a first deployable fin 110A.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">For example the biaser 310 may apply a force to the deployable fins 110 to move the deployable fins 110 from the nondeployed position to the deployed position. The biaser 310 may comprise any system for moving the deployable fins 110 such as a spring, motor actuator, and the like In the present embodiment, the biaser 310 comprises a spring disposed to apply a force between the body and<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the deployable fins 110 And configured to bias the deployable fins 110 towards the perpendicular position. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>, the present biaser 310 comprises a conventional coil spring having a first leg engaging one of the deployable fins 110 and a second leg engaging the body of the projectile 100. The biaser 310 may, however, be configured in any manner to apply a force to the deployable fins 110 for deployment.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The retainer 320 selectively retains the deployable fins 110 in position against the force of the biaser 310. The retainer 320 may comprise any system for selectively retaining and releasing the deployable fins 110, such as an actuator, motor, movable restraint, and the like. For example, the present retainer 320 may release the deployable fin 110 in response to one or more predetermined events, such as achieving a predetermined roll rate and/or release of an adjacent fin. The retainer 320 may be configured, however to deploy the deployable fins 110 in response to any appropriate criterion, time, or event Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>, in the present embodiment, the retainer 320 engages a first deployable fin 110 to be retained and responds to mouvement of an adjacent deployable fin 110. The retainer 320 may also release the deployable fin 110 in response to a predetermined force applied by the deployable fin 110, such as a predetermined centrifugal force generated by a certain roll rate added to the force applied by the biaser 310.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In one embodiment, the retainer 320 comprises a restraint 330 and a sensor 340. The sensor 340 senses a time, condition, or event for deploying the deployable element. The restraint 330 restrains the deployable fin 110 against the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> body or otherwise hold a deployable fin 110 in portion until the sensor 340 indicates that the deployable fin 110 should be deployed.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The restraint 330 may comprise any system or component for restraining the deployable fin 110 in position, such as a pin, clip, cable, sliding bolt, electromagnet, or the like. In the present embodiment, the restraint 330 is configured to restrain the deployable fin 110 against the body. For example, referring to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>, the restraint 330 may comprise a clip 410A configured to engage the deployable fin 110B to the body. In particular, the clip 410A may include a surface that engages an outer surface of deployable fin. 110B to inhibit movement to the deployde position while also engaging a second deployable fin 110A. The clip 410A comprises a resilient material, such as a metal or plastic which may bend in response to a selected force. Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>, the present clip 410A is configured to initially react the biasing force of deployable fin 110B to a second deployable fin 110A in order to maintain a nondeployed state.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The clip 410A is further configured to substantially bend away from the body when the deployable fin. 110B applies a selected force to the clip. When the clip 410A bends enough in response to a preselected force, the deployable fins 110B escapes the clip 410A and moves into a deployed position. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>, additionally, once a first deployable fin 110A is moved to a deployed position it no longer provides the necessary reaction force to the clip 410A and a second deployablefin 110B moves to a deployed position. This chain reaction continues sequentially until each deployable fin. 110 is deployed.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The sensor may comprise any system or component capable of sensing a desired condition such as rotational speed, time, or force. In the present embodiment, the sensor 340 is configured to sense to a force applied by a deployable fin 110. In addition, the present sensor 340 is coupled to the clip 410 The clip 410 senses the force applied by one of the deployable fins 110 and maintains the deployable fin 110 in a nondeployed state until the total force applied to the clip by the deployable fin 110 exceeds the amount of force the clip 410 is deigned to maintain.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The deployable fins 110 are maintained in a nondeployed position by the plurality of retainers 320. In the present embodiment, the deployment system 120 is configured to first sense and release a first deployable fin 110A in response to a condition or event and secondly, to sense the movement of the first deployable fin 110 and then release a second deployable fin 110B which is coupled to the first deployable fin 110A through a clip 410A Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref>, the first deployable fin 110 moves to a deployed position when the total force of the biaser 310 and the centrifugal force imparted from the spinning motion of the projectile 100 overcome the retaining force of the restraint 330.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As the first deployable fin 110 begins to move to a deployed position, the sensor 340 which is coupled to the restraint 330 senses the movement of the deployable fin 110 and responds by allowing the second deployable fin to begin moving to a deployed position. This process is repeated and each deployable fin 110 is allowed to move in succession to a deployed position until all of the deployable fins 110 are deployed.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In operation, a projectile 100 is fired at a target and a guidance system activates in order to increase the probability of a successful strike. The projectile may comprise any suitable manner of guidance including the use of control surfaces, propulsion systems, or other navigations systems to increase accuracy. In the present embodiment, the guidance system comprises a set of deployable fins 110 which are released after firring. The deployment of the deployable fins 110 is delayed for a period of time such that the projectile 100 is allowed to clear any obstructions, such as other projectiles which have not been fired, before the deployable fins 110 move to the deployde position.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">When the projectile 100 is fired or launched, a rotation is imparted on the projectile 100 by the barrel, launch tube, or projectile propulsion system. The deployable fins 110 are kept in a nondeployed position during firing due to a plurality of restraints 330 that resist a force applied by a plurality of biasers 310 on the deployable fins 110 by reacting that force to an adjacent deployable fin 110 As the projectile 100 accelerates forward the rotational velocity of the projectile also accelerates. This acceleration results in a centrifugal force which acts on the deployable fins 110 increasing the total force acting on the restraints 330.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">When the total force acting on a restraint 330A is great enough, a first deployable fin. 110A moves past the restraint 330A to a deployed position that is substantoally perpendicular to the body of the projectile 100. After the first deployable fin. 110A has overcome the restraint 330A, an adjacent deployable fin 110B begins to move to a deployed state because a second restraint 330B can no<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> longer react the force applied by the second deployable fin 110B against the first deployable fin 110A. This series of event continues until all of the deployable fins 110 have moved to a deployed position.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">in the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments.
