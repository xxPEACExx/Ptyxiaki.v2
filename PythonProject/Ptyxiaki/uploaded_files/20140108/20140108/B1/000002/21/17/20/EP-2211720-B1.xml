It also amenable to other medical imaging applications and to non-medical imaging applications.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Generally, computed tomography (CT) scanners used for medical imaging applications include a stationary gantry/frame assembly and a rotating gantry/frame assembly, which rotates with respect to the stationary gantry about an examination region along a longitudinal or z-axis. The rotating gantry is supported on the stationary gantry via a bearing.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A radiation source and other components, such as a heat exchanger, a collimator, a power module and/or other components, are affixed to the rotating gantry and rotate about the examination region when the rotating gantry rotates about the examination region. In a third generation system, an array of radiation sensitive detectors is also affixed to the rotating gantry and is located opposite the radiation source with respect to the examination region. With a fourth generation system, the array of the radiation sensitive detectors is affixed to the stationary gantry.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In one configuration, the rotating gantry is based on a single plate rotor topology in which the radiation source and the detector array (third generation system) are affixed to a plate-shaped rotor such that the radiation source and the detector array cantilever from the plate-shaped rotor. An example of such a configuration is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURES 1A, 1B, and 1C</figref>. In these figures, a radiation source 102 and a detector array 104 cantilever from a side of a plate-shaped rotor 106, and the radiation source 102 produces a radiation beam 108 that traverse an examination region 110 and illuminates the detector array 104.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Unfortunately, the single plate-shaped rotor 106 may physically distort in a direction along the z-axis, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1C</figref>, due to radial g-forces associated with the components supported on the plate-shaped rotor 106 when the single plate-shaped rotor 106 rotates. Generally, the physical distortion increases with rotor rotation speed such that the distortion is relatively greater, for example, at a rotor rotation speed of 180 revolutions<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> per minute (RPM) as compared to a rotor rotation speed of 60 RPM. A consequence of such a distortion is that the radiation beam 108 drifts along the detector array 104. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1C</figref> shows an exaggerated drift.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">With some lower rotor rotation speed (e.g., 60 RPM scanners) single and dual slice scanners, a width of the detectors in the detector array 104 along the z-axis is increased so that the radiation beam 108 illuminates the detector array 104 over a range of radiation beam drift. However, such an increase in detector width may lead to increased detector cost. Alternatively, a width of the radiation beam 108 along the z-axis may be increased so that the radiation beam 108 illuminates the detector array 104 over a range of radiation beam drift. However, widening the radiation beam may lead to decreased radiation efficiency, or increased patient/object dose. With some scanners, increasing the detector width and/or increasing the beam width may not be desirable.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In another configuration, the rotating gantry is based on a cylinder rotor topology in which the radiation source and the detector array (third generation system) are affixed to a cylindrically-shaped rotor. An example of such a configuration is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURES 2A, 2B, and 2C</figref>. In these figures, a radiation source 202 and a detector array 204 are affixed to opposing sides of a cylindrically-shaped rotor 206, and the radiation source 202 produces a radiation beam 208 that traverse an examination region 210 and illuminates the detector array 204.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Unfortunately, the cylindrically-shaped rotor 206 may physically distort along a radial direction, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 2C</figref>, due to radial g-forces associated with the components supported on the plate-shaped rotor 206 when the cylindrically-shaped rotor 202 rotates. As with the plate-shaped rotor topology, the corresponding distortion generally increases with rotor rotation speed such that the distortion is greater at higher rotor rotation speeds. Since reconstruction is dependant upon a substantially constant physical relationship between the radiation source 202 and the detector array 204, such physical distortion or other geometrical distortion may introduce artifact that is propagated to the volumetric image data and images generated therefrom.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The single plate and the cylinder rotor topologies have been combined to provide incremental improvements over each of the single rotor plate and the rotor cylinder topologies with respect to the above-noted physical rotor distortions.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However, continuing advances in scanner related technology are leading to scanners that are capable of rotating at much higher speeds, for example, over 200 RPM. As the rotor rotation speed increases, the rotor is exposed to a greater g-force, for example, a g-force of 30 g or greater in the radial direction. As a consequence, the above-noted physical rotor distortions are exaggerated and more prominent.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5703921A"><text>US 5,703,921</text></patcit> discloses a CT apparatus with a plate-shaped rotor (rotating base) onto which the components, such as the x-ray tube and the detector array, are mounted.

As described in greater detail below, in one instance the flanges 320 and 322 include a dimension such as shape and a size configured to provide radial stiffness and the elongate structural elements 402 include a dimension and location configured to provide axial stiffness. As a result, in one instance the rotating gantry 304 may be less prone to physical distortions due to radial g-forces when the rotating gantry 304 rotates at relatively high rotation speeds, such as rotation speeds greater then 200 RPM, relative to an embodiment in which the flanges 320 and 322 and the elongate structural elements 402 are otherwise configured.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A patient support 324, such as a couch, supports a patient in the examination region 308.

Initially referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURE 4</figref>, a perspective view of the rotating gantry 304, without the components supported thereby, is illustrated. As briefly discussed above, the rotating gantry 304 includes the first and second flanges 320 and 322 coupled together by the elongate structural elements 402.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The first flange 320 includes first and second major surface 404 and 406, both extending generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 306 (<figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 3</figref>). The first major surface 404 is operatively coupled to the bearing (not visible). The second major surface 406 is operatively coupled to the elongated structural elements 402. The second flange 322 includes first and second major surface 408 and 410, both extending generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 306. The first major surface 408 faces away from the elongate structural elements 402, and the second major surface 410 is operatively coupled to the elongate structural elements 402. As shown, in this example the first and second flanges 320 and 322 are positioned generally parallel to each other, with their respective second surfaces 406 and 410 facing each other.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The dimensions of the second flange 322, in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 306, is application dependent. In the illustrated example, the second flange 402 includes a shape and size that is determined based on the operable rotor rotation speeds, the mass of the components supported on the rotating gantry 304, a level of acceptable radial distortion, and component accessibility. By way of example, for a particular level of distortion and known mass, the shape and size may correspond to a shape and size that provides suitable radial stiffness at a maximum or other rotor rotation speed so that the radial distortion of the rotating gantry 304, if any, does not exceed the particular level of distortion. The particular level of distortion may be based on image quality, the ability to correct for distortion (via hardware and/or software techniques), and/or other considerations. In general, the larger the flange is in the plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 306, the greater the radial stiffness. However, the shape and size is<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> also determined in a manner to reduce or minimize the need to remove the second flange 322 or maximize access to the components when accessing the components supported on the rotating gantry 304. The illustrated shape and size is one non-limiting example of a suitable shape and size for the illustrated CT scanner 300. It is to be appreciated that the second flange 322 and the first flange 320 may be substantially equal in size.
