The door seal 12 is attached to the hole plate 4 in such a state.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the hold plate 4 and the hold member 5 before being inserted into the insertion portion formed at the door upper edge member 2. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 7</figref>, a plurality of projections 5a consecutive along the insertion direction (direction perpendicular to the sheet surface). The projections 5a are press fitted to the inner surfaces 2a to 2d of the insertion portion in a deformed state when the hold member 5 is inserted into the insertion portion formed at the door upper edge member 2. This eliminates the play of the door upper edge member 2 and the door rear edge member 3 at the joint part 10. Then, the door upper edge member 2 and the door rear edge member 3 are firmly connected together.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">It is difficult to shape the shape of the hold member 5 with such an accuracy that the hold member 5 is just fitted into the insertion portion formed at the door upper edge member 2. In a case where the cross section is too larger due to an increase in the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> thickness of the hold member 5, for example, the resistive force at the time of inserting the hold member 5 into the insertion portion of the door upper edge member 2 is increased more than necessary. In this case, it is difficult to assemble the door upper edge member 2 and the door rear edge member 3. Accordingly, the hold member 5 is formed so that a slight clearance can be formed between the top surface of the hold member 5 and the inner surface of the insertion portion formed at the door upper edge member 2. At the same time, the projections 5a which are deformed (or cut) according to the clearance are formed on the top surface of the hold member 5. This can achieve both easier assembly and accuracy at the same time.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">As for the projections 5a formed on the hold member 5, it is desirable that at least two projections 5a on the inner surface 2b among the inner surfaces of the insertion portion of the door upper edge member 2, at least one projection 5a abutting on the inner surface 2c and at least one projection 5a abutting on the inner surface 2d should be included in one place parallel to the surface of the sheet of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 7</figref>. At the time the hold member 5 is inserted into insertion portion of the door upper edge member 2, therefore, the posture of the hold member 5 with respect to the inner surfaces of the insertion portion of the door upper edge member 2 is stabilized.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">According to the joint structure of the door edge member 1 of the invention, as described above, the assembling accuracy of the joint part can be improved. In addition, because the hold plate 4 is extended along the door frame 6, the hold plate 4 can be fixed directly to the door frame 6. That is, the door edge member 1 can be fixed to the door frame 6 without requiring another member. Further, the projections 5a provided on the hold member 5 to be inserted into the insertion portion are deformed according to the clearance between the top surface of the hold member 5 and the inner surface of the insertion portion, the fitting force is improved and the inserted hold plate 4 and hold<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> member 5 do not move inside the insertion portion. Furthermore, the deformation of the projections 5a of the hold member 5 can permit the door edge member 1 to be assembled with high accuracy and easily even with an individual difference in hold members 5.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In addition, the shape of the door edge member 1 is illustrative, and can be changed and corrected without departing from the idea of the invention. Although the door edge member 1 of the backseat door upper portion has been described in the description of the embodiment by way of example, the embodiment can be applied to other door edge members too in a case where divided parts are connected in use.</p><heading id="h0010">Industrial Applicability</heading><p id="p0038" num="0038">The joint structure of a door edge member according to the invention is useful in improving the assembling accuracy of a door joint part.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56984543" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Verbindungsstruktur für ein Türrandglied (1), aufweisend:
