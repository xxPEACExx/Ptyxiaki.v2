The upper member provides a covering for the foot that securely receives and positions the foot with respect to the sole structure. In addition, the upper member may have a configuration that protects the foot and provides ventilation, thereby cooling the foot and removing perspiration. The sole structure generally is secured to a lower portion of the upper member and generally is positioned between the foot and the ground. In addition to attenuating ground or other contact surface reaction forces, the sole structure may provide traction and control foot motions, such as pronation. Accordingly, the upper member and sole structure operate cooperatively to provide a comfortable structure that is suited for a variety of ambulatory activities, such as walking and running.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The sole structure of athletic footwear generally exhibits a layered configuration that includes a comfort-enhancing insole, a resilient midsole, and a ground-contacting outsole that provides both abrasion-resistance and traction. The midsole is typically the primary sole structure element that attenuates ground reaction forces and controls foot motions. Conventionally, the midsole was formed from an open- or closed-cell polymer foam material, such as ethylvinylacetate or<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> polyurethane, that resiliently compresses under an applied load to attenuate ground reaction forces.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Impact-attenuating elements for footwear have been developed for various specific applications. For example, for athletic footwear, which may be subjected to relatively high impact forces, <i>e.g</i>., from running, jumping, twisting, changing directions, and the like, it may be desirable to provide increased impact-attenuation capabilities and/or increased spring-back or recovery capabilities. Thus, in addition to polymer foam materials, midsoles may also include, for example, one or more fluid-filled bladders and moderators. Other examples of such impact-attenuating elements have been described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20060065499A"><text>U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0065499</text></patcit>, titled "Impact Attenuating and Spring Elements and Products Containing Such Elements," filed September, 27, 2004; <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20060064900A"><text>U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0064900</text></patcit>, titled "Impact Attenuating Devices and Products Containing Such Devices," filed September 27, 2004; and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US20070119074A"><text>U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0119074</text></patcit> titled "Impact-Attenuation Members and Products Containing Such Members," filed June 5, 2006, each of which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">These known impact-attenuating elements are symmetric from front-to-back and side-to-side, and thus, they provide symmetric impact-attenuation capabilities from one end to the other and from one side to the other. In other words, the stiffness and deflection characteristics of any of these known individual impact-attenuating elements are the same at opposite ends or opposite sides. Due to their symmetric nature, when subjected to an external, centrally-applied impact load or an evenly distributed load, they deflect or react evenly to the loading.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Ideally, the stiffnesses of different portions of an article of footwear will be tailored to the footwear application. For example, a certain midsole stiffness may be desired in the heel zone for heel strike during running, while another midsole stiffness may be more appropriate for walking impacts. Thus, a stiffer impact-attenuating element may be ideal for medial heel posting, while a softer stiffness may be desired for the lateral heel area. Generally, the perimeter sidewall impact-attenuation and stability desired in a midsole is different from the interior impact-attenuation requirements.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> -->

General Description of Differential-Stiffness Impact-Attenuation Members and Products Containing Them</b></heading><p id="p0053" num="0053">In general, aspects of this invention relate to impact-attenuation members and products in which they are used (such as footwear, other foot-receiving devices, heel cage elements, and the like), and methods of using them in such products. These and other aspects and features of the invention are described in more detail below.</p><heading id="h0008"><b>1. Differential-Stiffness Impact-Attenuation Members</b></heading><p id="p0054" num="0054">Impact-attenuation members in accordance with at least some example aspects of this invention include: a spring element formed as a unitary body defining a cavity, the spring element having dimensions in height, length and width directions, the height dimension extending from a top surface to a bottom surface, and having at least one of the top surface and the bottom adapted for mounting, the length dimension extending from a front end to a back end; and wherein the impact-attenuation member has a first stiffness characteristic in the height direction at the front end of the spring element and a second different stiffness characteristic in the height direction at the back end of the spring element, and further comprising a tension element extending at least partially across the width dimension of the impact-attenuation member between a first engagement portion engaging the spring element and a second engagement portion engaging the spring element, wherein the tension element is formed separately from the spring element and subsequently engaged with the spring element. In the context of this aspect of the invention, a stiffness characteristic is associated with a spring constant of the impact-attenuation member. The stiffness characteristic is a measure of how stiff the spring is. A spring that is very hard to extend (or compress) has a large spring constant. A spring that is easy to extend (or compress) has a small spring constant. The stiffness characteristic is related to the force developed in the member for any given deflection (i.e. compression or extension) of the member. Conversely, the stiffness characteristic is related to the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> deflection of the member for any given force applied to the member. The stiffness characteristic may also be related to the amount of energy stored in the impact-attenuation member when the member is subjected to an impact load, and the amount of energy released when the load is released from the member. A stiffness characteristic of the impact-attenuation member need not be a constant, but may vary with a deflection of the impact-attenuation member.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In such members, due to the different stiffness characteristics of the impact-attenuation member at the front and back ends of the spring element, when a force is applied in the height direction, the height dimension of the front end of the spring element may decrease more or less than the height dimension of the back end of the spring element. Additionally, due to the different stiffness characteristics of the impact-attenuation member at the front and back ends of the spring element, the spring element may exert a force at its front end, seeking to restore the impact-attenuation member back to its original configuration, which differs from a restoring force exerted at its back end.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Stiffness characteristics typically are functions of the physical dimensions of the elements and the material characteristics of the elements. Thus, a spring element formed of a single material but having different dimensions at the front end as compared with the back end, will have different stiffness characteristics at the front end than at the back end. Similarly, a spring element having the same dimensions at the front end as at the back end but having different materials at the front end as compared with the back end, may have different stiffness characteristics at the front end than at the back end. In both exemplary aspects, there is a first stiffness characteristic of the element at the front end and a second (and different) stiffness characteristic of the element at the back end.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The impact-attenuation member may come in a wide variety of different physical [64] The impact-attenuation member may come in a wide variety of different physical structures without departing from the invention. For example, the spring element may have a substantially conical shape, including variations thereof. A substantially conical shape includes a true conical shape. A characteristic of the conical shape is that a width dimension at one end is greater than the width<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> dimension at the other end. The cone may be narrow or wide, i.e. the angle of the sidewalls to one another (the interior two-dimensional angle of the conical apex) may range from acute to obtuse. Further, the spring element need not be a "true" truncated conical shape, but may be substantially truncated conical shape, i.e. the spring element may deviate in one or more characteristics from a perfectly conical shape. For example, the cross-section of a substantially "conically-shaped" spring element may be more elliptical (or "squashed") than circular.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">As another example, the substantially conically-shaped spring element may include flat portions or sides. Such flat portions may be in combination with curved portions. Thus, by way of non-limiting example, the substantially conical spring element may have multiple flat sides such that the substantially conical spring element is pyramidally shaped or quasi-pyramidally shaped. The pyramidally-shaped or quasi-pyramidally shaped spring element could have three, four, five or more sides. Further, the sides need not have identical shapes, curvatures, areas or interior angles. Further, the sides of the substantially conical spring element may include steps, such as right-angle steps in the manner of a Mayan pyramid, oblique steps, smoothed (i.e. rounded) steps, sloped steps, etc.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In one aspect of the invention, the spring element may have a truncated substantially conical shape. The truncation surfaces need not be planar, but may be convex or concave or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Certain impact-attenuation members may embody even other physical structures without departing from the invention. Thus, for example, in another aspect of the invention, the spring element need not be symmetrical side-to-side. As a non-limiting example, one side of a spring element may be configured as half of a truncated substantially conical shape, while the other side may be configured as half of a cylindrical shape.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Certain other impact-attenuation members may embody even other physical structures without departing from the invention. In one aspect, the spring element may have a rotationally symmetric shape having different stiffness characteristics at at least two opposite sides. A tri-lobed or tri-legged spring element is an example of such a spring element. According to this embodiment, the spring<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> element could have any odd number of evenly or unevenly spaced legs. For example, the spring element may be a hollow sphere, or substantially spherical shape, having three orange-slice shaped wedge openings (or other shaped openings) cut into the hollow sphere thereby defining three legs therebetween. The three openings and the three legs may be rotationally symmetric. Further a substantially spherical shape may include flattened, flying-saucer type shapes. A substantially spherical shape may also include a faceted spherical shape, including facets running longitudinally, facets running latitudinally, or both (much like a disco-ball). The substantially spherical shape may even further include steps at the intersections of the facets.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">According to another embodiment, the spring element need not be rotationally symmetric. Thus, by way of non-limiting example, the spring element could have an even number of unevenly spaced lobes or legs. Alternatively, the spring element could have any number of evenly or unevenly space lobes or legs, wherein the stiffness characteristics and/or other defining features of the individual lobes or legs differ from one another. For example, the spring element could have a basic shape that is substantially elliptical in nature with cut-outs or openings forming multiple noncontiguous lobes or legs.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The spring element includes a cavity. In one aspect, the spring element is essentially hollow. In another aspect, the cavity is configured as a throughbore having openings at opposite ends of the spring element. The cavity could be of any suitable shape. Further, it could be symmetrical or non-symmetrical and centrally or non-centrally located within the spring element The wall thicknesses of the spring element around the cavity need not be constant, but, for example, could vary around the circumference and/or from front-to-back along the length.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">At least one surface of the spring member is adapted for engaging an external structure, such as a portion of a foot-receiving device. The foot-receiving device may be an article of footwear including at least one of a foot-covering member, a foot-supporting member, a surface-contacting member (e.g., an upper, a sole structure (such as a midsole), an outsole member, etc.). For example, the spring<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> member may be provided with a surface that complements the surface of the external structure and is suitable for adhesive attachment. As another example, the spring member may optionally be adapted for engaging an external structure in a releasable or removable manner (<i>e.g</i>., so as to allow exchange of one impact-attenuation member or a portion thereof for another, to allow re-orientation of the impact-attenuation member or a portion thereof, etc.). As another example, the external structure may be a base plate, optionally forming a portion of the footwear structure, that serves as a base for holding or engaging multiple spring members.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">The spring element may be made from any suitable or desired material, such as polymeric materials, metallic materials and/or a combination thereof capable of changing shape, size, and/or orientation when a force is applied thereto and returning back to or toward their original shape, size, and/or orientation when the force is relieved or relaxed. As more specific examples, the spring element may be made from a polymeric material, such as PEBAX® (a polyether-block copolyamide polymer available from Atofina Corporation of Puteaux, France). As very specific, non-limiting, examples, the spring element may be made of PEBAX® 5533 or PEBAX® 6333. The size, construction, orientation, material, and/or other properties of the spring element may be freely selected and varied, e.g., to change the overall stiffness, rebound, and/or spring constant characteristics of the impact-attenuation member.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The impact-attenuation member includes one or more tension elements. The tension element engages the spring element, directly or indirectly, and stretches under the force applied to the spring element. The tension element operates to restore the impact-attenuation member to its original configuration.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The stiffness characteristic associated with the impact-attenuation member may be a function of both a stiffness characteristic of the spring element and a stiffness characteristic of the tension element. For example, the stiffness characteristic of the impact-attenuation member may be associated with a stiffness characteristic of the spring element in parallel with a stiffness characteristic of the tension element. Further, the initial stiffness of the impact-attenuation member (i.e. the stiffness characteristic when a load or force is first applied to the impact-attenuation member) may be only a function of the stiffness characteristic of the spring element. As more load is applied to the impact-attenuation member, the stiffness characteristic may become a function of both the stiffness characteristic of the spring element and the tension element. The stiffness characteristic of one or the other of the spring element and the tension element may dominate the stiffness characteristic of the impact-attenuation element at a given load. Thus, it is apparent that the stiffness characteristic of the impact-attenuation member need not actually be a constant, but may vary with the deflection of the impact-attenuation member.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">A wide variety of tension element shapes and constructions are possible without departing from this invention. In accordance with some examples of this invention, the tension element may include a planar element. The term "planar" includes elements that are substantially planar, i.e. elements that have a two-dimensional characteristic, but that may deviate from the perfect plane. Thus, a planar tension element may have an overall curvature. Further, the thickness of the planar tension element may vary as it extends across the cavity-going from thin to thick, or thin to thick to thin, or vice versa, for example. To maintain its two-dimensional characteristics, it is expected that the thickness of a planar element, generally and over most of its area, would not exceed one-tenth of the other two maximum dimensions: Optionally, a variation in thickness of the planar element<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> could be repeated such that the tension element may be wavy or crenellated, for example. The variation in thickness could be regular or irregular. Similarly, a planar tension element could be configured as an undulating plane, with the height of the undulations taken as a proxy for the thickness of the element. The undulations may be regular or irregular, smooth, triangulated, square, of constant or varying wavelength or amplitude, etc. As another option, a planar tension element may include ripples, indentations, waves, striations, or other textures on its surface. Further, the planar element may include holes, cutouts, etc.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">The tension element may be made from any suitable or desired material, such as polymeric materials, metallic materials and/or a combination thereof that are capable of changing shape, size, and/or orientation when a force is applied thereto and returning back to or toward their original shape, size, and/or orientation when the force is relieved or relaxed. An example of a suitable material is a synthetic or natural rubber or polymeric material (such as an elastomeric material) that is capable of stretching under tensile force and then returning (or substantially returning) to or toward its original size and shape when the force is relieved or relaxed. As more specific examples, the tension element may be made from a polymeric material, such as DESMOPAN® (a thermoplastic polyurethane material available from Bayer AG of Leverkusen, Germany) or PEBAX® (a polyether-block co-polyamide polymer available from Atofina Corporation of Puteaux, France). As very specific, non-limiting, examples, the tension element may be made of PEBAX® 2533, PEBAX® 3533, PEBAX® 4033, PEBAX® 5533, or PEBAX® MX 1205. The size, construction, orientation, material, and/or other properties of the tension element may be freely selected and varied, e.g., to change the overall stiffness, rebound, and/or spring constant characteristics of the impact-attenuation member.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">In accordance with other examples, the tension element may be formed of one or more members. The one or more members need not be manufactured of the same or similar materials. As an example, a tension element could include a central element coupled to tension element arms expending from the central element to a perimeter of the cavity. The central element could be polymeric and the arms could be metallic, or vice versa, or any combination of materials. Any desired<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> number of arms and any arrangement of the arms are possible without departing from this invention. For example, in some tension element configurations, a central planar element may extend essentially or substantially all the way to the cavity walls and the arms could be relatively short. In another example, two or more relatively long arms may extend from opposite sides of a relatively compact central element. The arms may be planar or non-planar and having the same or differing lengths and/or thicknesses from each other. In one aspect, the arms may be co-formed with the central element or may be formed separately from the central element and then subsequently joined to the central element. As another example, one or more tension element arms may extend from the central element in parallel with one another, or radiating from a central axis, or at any of various angles. The tension element arms may be evenly or unevenly spaced from one another.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">The tension element may be located, wholly or at least partially, within the cavity of the spring element (<i>e.g</i>., within the interior space defined by the spring element). Engagement portions on the tension element allow the tension element to be coupled to or engaged with the spring element. Complementary engagement portions are provided on the spring element. Thus, for example, the tension element may have enlarged engagement portions formed at opposite ends configured for slidably engaging a channel formed in the spring element. In one aspect, the spring element may define one or more engagement portions within the cavity to enable mounting of and engagement with the tension element. A wide variety of tension element and complementary spring element engagement portion configurations are considered possible without departing from the invention. For example, an engagement portion for one of the tension element or spring element may define a chamber, receptacle, notch, passage, etc. into which a portion of the other of the tension element or spring element fits.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Also, if desired, the tension element may be removably or releasably engaged with the tension element engagement portions, <i>e.g</i>., to allow re-orientation of the tension element, interchange of tension elements, etc. For example, the tension element may slidably engage the spring element. In other examples, the tension element may snap into, be clamped to, or be otherwise removably fastened to the<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> spring element. Engagement of the tension element could be accomplished by hand, by use of a hand tool or by machine. Further, engagement of the tension element with the spring element could be accomplished at a factory or at a point of sale (i.e. a retail store). Engagement of the tension element with the spring element at the point of sale allows for customization of the differential-stiffness characteristics of the impact-attenuation members at the point of sale.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">The spring element and the tension element are initially formed as two or more separate elements, which are subsequently releasably or non-releasably joined together to form a one-piece impact-attenuation member. Non-releasable joining methods may include, for example, over-molding, adhesive bonding, locking snap fits, etc.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><heading id="h0009"><b>2.

Also, the impact-attenuation member(s) may be incorporated into a foot-receiving device product in any desired manner without departing from this invention. For example, if desired, the impact-attenuation member(s) may be included at locations and orientations so as to be at least partially visible from an exterior of the article of footwear. Alternatively, if desired, the impact-attenuation member(s) may be hidden or at least partially hidden in the overall footwear or foot-receiving device product structure, such as within the foam material of a midsole element, within gas-filled bladder member, etc. Also, any number of individual impact-attenuation member stuctures may be included in an article of footwear or other foot-receiving device product without departing from this invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --></p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Specific examples of structures according to the invention are described in more detail below.

Member 100 includes a spring element 102. In the example embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs. 1A-1E</figref>, spring element 102 has three dimensions: length (1), width (w) and height (h), associated with three mutually perpendicular directions: length (L), width (W) and height (H) directions.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Spring element 102 is shown as having a hollow, substantially truncated cone shape. Cavity 104 is provided within spring element 102. In the example of <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs. 1A-1E</figref>, spring element 102 is not exactly conical, but rather has a "squashed," somewhat elliptical cross-section. Further, the wall thickness (t) of spring element 102 varies around the quasi-elliptical circumference.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">The length dimension (1) of spring element 102 extends from a front end or surface 110 to a back surface 112. Front surface 110 is shown as being substantially convexly curved. Back surface 112 is shown as being substantially concavely curved. The height dimension (h) of spring element 102 extends from a top surface 120 to a bottom surface 122. Both top surface 120 and bottom surface 122 are shown with flat portions adapted for mounting. Specifically, a first flat portion<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> 124 is provided on top surface 120; a second flat portion 126 is provided on bottom surface 122. The width dimension (w) of spring element 102 extends from a first side surface 130 to a second side surface 132. Side surfaces 130, 132 extend from front surface 110 to back end or surface 112. In <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs. 1A-1E</figref>, and as best shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 1E</figref>, the width dimension (w<sub>f</sub>) of spring element 102 at the front surface 110 differs from the width dimension (w<sub>b</sub>) of spring element 102 at the back surface 112. Furthermore, in this example embodiment, the width dimension (w) varies linearly along at least a portion of the length of spring element 102.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Due to the different dimensions of spring element 102 at front surface 110 and back surface 112, the stiffness characteristic in the height direction of the front surface differs from the stiffness characteristic of the back surface. In other words, the front surface and the back surface will compress different amounts under the same and/or an evenly applied force or load.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">As an example, referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1A and 1B</figref>, when a force or load (F) is centrally applied to top surface 120 and reacted by bottom surface 122, spring element 102 is compressed in the height direction, i.e. the height dimension (h1) of spring element 102 at the front surface 110 is reduced a certain amount (Δh1) and the height dimension (h2) at the back surface 112 is reduced a certain amount (Δh2). Due to the differential stiffness characteristics of the spring element at its front and back surfaces, the amount of reduction Δh1 differs from the amount of reduction Δh2. At the same time the width dimension (w) of spring element 102 is increased. Upon removal of the force, spring element 102 returns to its non-deformed configuration and energy that was stored in spring element 102 due to its elastic deformation is released.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">When viewed from the top, as best illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 1E</figref>, the cross-sectional shape of spring element 102 may substantially be a truncated sector of a circle having a sector angle (θ). As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 1E</figref> in this example structure 100, front surface 110 closely follows a circular arc, whereas back surface 112 deviates from a true circular arc.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 1E</figref> also illustrates another characteristic of the spring element 102. A first plane P1 extending in the height direction and the length direction can be<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> positioned so as to symmetrically bisect spring element 102. However, a second plane P2 extending in the height direction and the width direction, thereby being mutually perpendicular to the first plane, cannot be positioned anywhere so as to symmetrically bisect spring element 102. Indeed, of any two mutually perpendicular planes, each extending in the height direction, there is no placement that would result in the spring element being symmetrically bisected by both planes. In other words, at most, one of two mutually perpendicular planes, each extending in the height direction, defines a plane of symmetry of spring element 102. In <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 1E</figref>, one plane (P1) defines a plane of symmetry of the spring element.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">Cavity 104 is formed within spring element 102.

Tension element 150 is located within cavity 104 and extends across the width dimension of cavity 104. Specifically, tension element 150 extends across cavity 104 and engages spring element 102 at receptacles 106.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">In <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005">Figs. 2A-2D</figref>, tension element 150 is substantially planar.

Cut-outs 362 are configured to receive projections 359, i.e. projections 359 of tension member 350 engage with cut-outs 362 of spring element 302. Projections 359 provide further attachment of tension member 350 to spring element 302, such that the tension member may not be so easily slidably removed. Thus, during repeated loading and unloading of the impact-attenuation member, tension member 350 would be less likely to be worked out of engagement with spring element 302. Projections 359 may be provided on one, some, or all of the arms of tension element 350. By way of non-limiting examples, cut-outs 362 need not be notches that extend toward the center of the spring element, but could be relatively small openings or even just indentations on the interior, i.e. cavity, surface of the lobes. In one aspect, projections on tension element 350 may extend through the openings of spring element 302 which define the lobes 360. According to this aspect, as best shown in <figref idrefs="f0019">Fig. 18C</figref>, the projections would interact with surfaces 312, 313 and/or 315 to assist in retaining the tension element to the spring element.

When both the enlarged portions 352-354 of tension element 350 and the receptacles 306 of spring element 302 extend along complementary circular arcs, tension element 350 can be engaged (or disengaged) with spring element 302 by rotating tension element 350 with respect to spring member 302. This relative rotation allows the enlarged portion of the tension element to slide within the receptacles of the spring element. As an example, a tension element 350 (<figref idrefs="f0021">Fig. 20A</figref>) can be inserted into a spring element 302 (<figref idrefs="f0021">Fig. 20B</figref>) as shown in <figref idrefs="f0021">Fig. 20C</figref>. In <figref idrefs="f0021">Fig. 20C</figref>, the distal ends of the arms of tension element 350 do not yet engage the receptacles of spring element 302. In <figref idrefs="f0021">Fig. 20D</figref>, tension element 350 is rotated relative to spring element 302, and in the process of rotation, the distal ends of the arms of tension element 350 slidingly engage the receptacles of spring element 302 (schematically represented as portions of circular arcs, for clarity). In <figref idrefs="f0021">Fig. 20E</figref>, tension element 350 has been rotated to fully engage spring element 302.<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --></p><p id="p0118" num="0118"><figref idrefs="f0022">Fig. 21A</figref> illustrates four impact-attenuation members 300 positioned in the heel area 202 of foot-receiving device 200. In this particular embodiment, it was desired to make the medial portion of the heel area firmer than the lateral portion of the heel area. Thus, impact-attenuation member 300a in the lateral heel strike zone (shown in gray) was configured to be less stiff than the other three impact-attenuation members. By way of non-limiting examples, impact-attenuation member 300a could be made less stiff by eliminating or not using any tension element that may be used by the other three impact-attenuation members, by using a tension element that is more compliant than the tension elements used by the other three impact-attenuation members or by using a spring element that is more compliant. Further, impact-attenuation member 300a could be made less stiff by changing its materials, its dimensions, or its geometric profile.</p><p id="p0119" num="0119"><figref idrefs="f0022">Figs. 21B and 21C</figref> also illustrates four identical or substantially identical impact-attenuation members 300 positioned in the heel area 202 of foot-receiving device 200. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0022">Fig. 21B</figref>, the four impact-attenuation members are arranged so as to provide a relatively soft or compliant impact-attenuation beneath the calcaneous area (marked with an 'X'). In particular, the stiffness characteristics of the portions of the impact-attenuation members nearest the calcaneous area is designed to be less than the stiffness characteristics of the portions of the impact-attenuation members more removed from the calcaneous area. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0022">Fig. 21C</figref>, the four impact-attenuation members are arranged so as to provide a relatively stiff or less compliant impact-attenuation beneath the calcaneous area (marked with an 'X'). Thus, it can be seen that individual impact-attenuation members may be configured so as to provide distinct impact-attenuation properties in given zones of the foot. Furthermore, the impact-attenuation members can be arranged relative to one another to form a system.</p><p id="p0120" num="0120">As best illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0023">Figs. 22a through 22c</figref>, when a force or load is applied to top surface 320 and reacted by bottom surface 322, spring element 302 is compressed in the height direction. <figref idrefs="f0023">Fig. 22a</figref> shows impact-attenuation member 300 when load is first applied; <figref idrefs="f0023">Fig. 22b</figref> shows impact-attenuation member 300 when the applied load has compressed member 300 to approximately 3/4 of its undeformed height; <figref idrefs="f0023">Fig. 22c</figref> shows impact-attenuation member 300 when the applied load has<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> compressed member 300 to approximately 2/3 of its undeformed height. During the compression of member 300, receptacles 306 close down and increase their grip on enlarged portions 352, 353, 354 of tension element 350. At the same time, as the height dimension of impact-attenuation member 300 decreases, the width dimension (w) of spring element 302 is increased and the width dimension of tension element 350 is increased. Upon removal of the force, spring element 302 and tension element 350 return to their non-deformed configurations and energy that was stored in spring element 302 and in tension element 350 due to their elastic deformations is released.</p><p id="p0121" num="0121">As disclosed above, pairing any given configuration of spring element 302 with differing configurations and/or materials of tension element 350 would result in different stiffness characteristics for the impact-attenuation members. Thus, the stiffness characteristic of the impact-attenuation member can be tailored by providing specific stiffness characteristics of the individual spring elements 302 and/or tension elements 350 that make up the impact-attenuation member. As the spring elements 302 and the tension elements 350 can be manufactured separately, with the tension elements subsequently being engaged with the spring elements to form impact-attenuation members, many different impact-attenuation members may be readily formed (from the multitude of different spring/tension element combinations) while at the same time providing low inventory risk.</p><p id="p0122" num="0122">Of interest is that a rotationally symmetric impact-attenuation member, such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0016">Fig. 9</figref>, would be expected to deflect evenly under the application of a centrally applied load, even though a stiffness characteristic at a front surface differs from a stiffness characteristic at a back surface. Thus, a centrally applied load could result in the impact-attenuation member compressing evenly in the height direction around the circumference. On the other hand, the rotationally symmetric impact-attenuation member of <figref idrefs="f0016">Fig. 9</figref> would not be expected to compress evenly under a non-centrally applied load. Thus, for example, under the application of a distributed line-load extending from front surface 110 to back surface 112, one would expect the impact-attenuation member to compress unevenly due to the difference in stiffness characteristics at the front surface and the back surface.<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --></p><p id="p0123" num="0123">In an exemplary embodiment, <figref idrefs="f0024">Figs. 23 and 24</figref> show four impact attenuation members 300 located under the heel portion 202 of a foot-receiving device 200. <figref idrefs="f0024">Fig. 23</figref> illustrates the foot-receiving device 200 with no external load applied.
