Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an optical shaping apparatus for forming a cured layer by irradiating light to a photo-curable resin and forming a three-dimensionally shaped object of a desired shape by laminating the cured layers, and a shaping base that is used in the optical shaping apparatus and supports a three-dimensionally shaped object.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Heretofore, an optical shaping apparatus for forming a shaped object of a desired shape by using three-dimensional CAD (Computer Aided Design) data has been widely known.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As optical shaping methods used for the optical shaping apparatus, a free liquid level method and a regulated liquid level method are known in general.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2007090619A"><text>2007-90619</text></patcit> (paragraphs [0004] to [0006], <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4 and 5</figref>; hereinafter, referred to as Patent Document 1) discloses an optical shaping apparatus using the free liquid level method. In the optical shaping apparatus, a photo-curable resin is injected in a resin container, and a table (shaping base) is placed nearly below a liquid level of the photo-curable resin. Light is irradiated from above the liquid level (free liquid level) of an uncured resin above the table, and thus a first cured layer is formed on the table. Next, the table is lowered, light is irradiated again from above the liquid level of the uncured resin, and a second cured layer is formed on the first cured layer. By repeating those operations, a three-dimensional model (three-dimensionally shaped object) is formed on the table.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the case where the free liquid level method is used, since the liquid level of the photo-curable resin is open to the atmosphere, the liquid level fluctuates when the table is lowered, for example. Therefore, there arises a problem that it may be difficult to form a three-dimensionally shaped object with high accuracy. For that reason, in the optical shaping apparatus disclosed in Patent Document 1, a squeegee is moved on the liquid level to uniform the liquid level of the photo-curable resin.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As described above, the fluctuation of the liquid level becomes a problem in the free liquid level method. In this regard, there may be a case where the regulated liquid level method of regulating the liquid level of the photo-curable resin is used.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2000043150A"><text>2000-043150</text></patcit> (paragraph [0007], ; hereinafter, referred to as Patent Document 2) discloses an optical shaping apparatus using the regulated liquid level method. In the optical shaping apparatus, a photo-curable resin is injected in a resin container including a transmissive member such as a glass plate at a bottom surface thereof, and a stage (shaping base) is placed in the vicinity of the transmissive member. Light used for curing the photo-curable resin is irradiated from below the transmissive member. By the light, an uncured resin between the transmissive member and the stage is cured and thus a first cured layer is formed. After the first cured layer is formed, the stage is elevated to form a second cured layer. By repeating those operations, a three-dimensional object (three-dimensionally shaped object) is formed.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further more, it is referred to <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="DE10256672A1"><text>DE 102 56 672 A1</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US20050248061A1"><text>US 2005/02 48 061 A1</text></patcit>, which both disclose an optical shaping apparatus having a moving mechamism to move a shaping base in a direction away from a light transmissive member so that a support surface is gradually moved away from a regulation surface from a first end portion to a second end portion.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0004"><u>Summary of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, in the case where the regulated liquid level method is used, there is a problem that the cured layer formed by curing the photo-curable resin by light adheres to the transmissive member such as a glass plate. As a result, there arises a problem that when the shaping base is elevated, the cured layer (three-dimensionally shaped object) is damaged on a boundary surface between the transmissive member and the cured layer, which hinders formation of a highly accurate three-dimensionally shaped object.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In view of the circumstances as described above, there is a need for an optical shaping apparatus capable of forming a highly accurate three-dimensionally shaped object, and a shaping base used in the optical shaping apparatus.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The above object is solved by the claimed matter according to the independent claim.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Accordingly, there is provided an optical shaping apparatus including a light transmissive member, a shaping base, and a movement mechanism.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The light transmissive member includes a regulation surface and causes light used for curing a photo-curable resin to pass therethrough.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The regulation surface regulates a liquid level of the photo-curable resin.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The shaping base includes a support surface, a first end portion, and a second end portion.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The support surface is opposed to the regulation surface and supports a three-dimensionally shaped object that is formed by laminating the photo-curable resins cured by the light in a stepwise manner.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The second end portion is an end portion on an opposite side of the first end portion.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The movement mechanism moves the shaping base in a direction away from the light transmissive member so that the support surface is gradually moved away from the regulation surface from the first end portion side to the second end portion side.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Therefore, when the shaping base is moved in the direction away from the light transmissive member, the support surface is gradually moved away from the regulation surface from the first end portion side to the second end portion side. In this case, on a boundary surface between the regulation surface and the cured layer (three-dimensionally shaped object), a force is applied to the cured layer in an oblique direction with respect to the regulation surface. Accordingly, the cured layer that adheres to the regulation surface can be separated from the regulation surface smoothly. As a result, the cured layer can be prevented from being damaged and a highly accurate three-dimensionally shaped object can be formed.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the optical shaping apparatus, the shaping base includes a first member, a second member, and an elastic member.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The first member is coupled to the movement mechanism.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The second member includes the support surface and is rotatably coupled to the first member on the first end portion side.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The elastic member couples the first member and the second member on the second end portion side.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Hence, the second member including the support surface is rotatably coupled to the first member coupled to the movement mechanism on the first end portion side, and on the second end portion side via the elastic<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> member. With this structure, when the shaping base is moved in the direction away from the light transmissive member, the support surface is gradually separated from the regulation surface from the first end portion side to the second end portion side. Accordingly, the cured layer that adheres to the regulation surface can be separated from the regulation surface smoothly.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Further, when the cured layer is separated from the regulation surface, the first member and the second member can be attracted to each other by contraction of the elastic member. Accordingly, when the photo-curable resin is cured, the support surface can be kept parallel to the regulation surface, for example.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the optical shaping apparatus, the elastic member may attract the first member and the second member by a force larger than a force by which the support surface is attracted to the regulation surface side due to contraction caused when the photo-curable resin is cured.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to prevent the support surface from being attracted to the regulation surface side due to the contraction caused when the photo-curable resin is cured.

Consequently, the optical shaping apparatus 100 according to this embodiment can also form a three-dimensionally shaped object 2 having a large cross section highly accurately.</p><heading id="h0013">(Second embodiment)</heading><p id="p0120" num="0120">Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described.</p><p id="p0121" num="0121">The second embodiment is different from the above first embodiment in that a lock mechanism is provided to the shaping base.

For example, an optical system 40 of a transmissive-type SLM (Spatial light Modulator) projection system or an optical system 40 of a beam scanning system in which a galvanometer mirror and the like are used may be used. As described above, even when a generally-used optical system 40 is employed, it is possible to prevent a cured layer (three-dimensionally shaped object) from being damaged by the shaping base 20, with the result that a three-dimensionally shaped object 2 with high accuracy can be formed.</p><p id="p0143" num="0143">Further, the above embodiments have described that the entire work area W<sub>all</sub> is sectioned into the small work areas W<sub>xy</sub>, and a cured layer is formed for each small work area W<sub>xy</sub>, thus<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> forming a single-layer cured layer.

The resin layer is made of, for example, a photo-curable resin such as a UV curable resin. The resin layer is formed by, after a liquid photo-curable resin is spin-coated onto the support surface 22a, irradiating light to the photo-curable resin to be cured. In this case, a first cured layer constituting a three-dimensionally shaped object 2 is formed on the resin layer on the support surface 22a.</p><p id="p0145" num="0145">The photo-curable resin used for the resin layer may be the same material as the photo-curable resin 1 used for forming the three-dimensionally shaped object 2.
