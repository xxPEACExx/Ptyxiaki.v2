More particularly, it relates to an electrode part for a wireless biopotential measurement unit, called measurement unit below, for attaching to the body of a living organism, the measurement unit including a signal processor and transmitter unit, the electrode part including at least one electrode for measuring a biopotential, the at least one electrode communicating with the signal processor and transmitter unit.

The wireless measurement unit may include an electrode part which is connected to a signal processor and transmitter unit, the electrode part being formed with at least one electrode.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Experience has shown that such movement and rubbing contact between the prior art ECG electrode part and clothing lead to, in part, major interference in the measuring values from said electrode components.

Alternatively, the earth electrode may, at least partially, surround at least one measuring electrode.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The screen material over the electrode part serves a double purpose in equalizing differences in potential relative to the skin of the body in the area in which the electrodes are placed, and in the form of an interference-limiter between the electrodes through a low-pass filter formed by the measurement points of the electrode part relative to the screen material.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">By connecting the screen plane to the skin of a living organism via a separate electrode, the difference in potential between the skin and screen plane is equalized, so-called "common mode rejection".</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Static equalization of differences in potential has as a result that external disturbances or influences are reduced so that the measurement signal has a better signal quality. An ideally conductive plane above the electrode part will mean a convergence plane in which the electrical (E) field viewed along this plane will approximately equal zero (<i><o>E</o></i> ≈ 0). This means that electrostatic influence makes to relatively no great extent an electrical field contribution between electrode points located on the underside of the screen material. This is under the condition that the distance d between the conductive screen plane and the electrodes is very small and approximately equal to zero (d ≈ 0). Besides, a low-pass filtering<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> of the measurement signal is achieved which may reduce unwanted influence within the desired frequency range for the measurement signal, which is assumed to be, for the measuring of ECG signals, between 0.05 Hz and 150 Hz. This is achieved through a capacitive influence between the measuring electrodes and the ideally conductive screen material, the capacitance being given by: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mi>C</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mi>A</mi><mi>d</mi></mfrac><mo>⁢</mo><mi>ε</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>o</mi><mo>•</mo><mi>ε</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>r</mi></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="31" he="14" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
in which εo and εr are, respectively, the absolute and the relative dielectric constants of the relevant material used in the connection between the ideally conductive plane, the screening material, and an electrode point on the underside of this plane, d being the distance between them and A being the area of the electrode area. Relatively speaking, between two measuring electrodes a and b located on the underside of the screen material there will be a serial connection of two such capacitances, either of them forming the capacitance between the electrode point and the screen material, and such a connection in series of capacitances being connected in parallel with a resistance between the measuring electrodes, the resistance between the measuring electrodes being the resistance in the skin between the measuring electrodes.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The connection in parallel of the resulting capacitance towards the screen plane and the resistance in the skin of the living organism between the electrodes Rh results in a low-pass filtering of the measurement signal, so that the bandwidth B is determined by: <maths id="math0002" num=""><math display="block"><mi>B</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>π</mi><mo>•</mo><mi mathvariant="italic">Rh</mi><mo>•</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mfrac></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="36" he="13" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
in which C1 is the capacitance between an electrode and the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> screen plane and Rb is the resistance in the skin between the electrodes. The overlapping area of the screen plane with the electrodes and the distance between the electrodes is adjusted in relation to the desired bandwidth for the relevant signals, such as ECG signals.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The contact path between the substantially covering screen material and earth electrode may extend through the electrode part or externally relative to it.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">With advantage, the electrode part is constituted by a multilayered flexible material, in which the different metal layers may be provided with, for example, screening, capacitive or inductive components. The intermediate insulating plates have dielectric properties. With respect to electrostatic screening, the operation of the electrode part is based on the establishing of an approximately potential-free area around the measuring electrodes, the measurement signal being constituted essentially by the biopotential of interest, which is desirably to be measured between the different points on the living organism.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">When an item of clothing is rubbing against screen material or a material covering the screen material, electrons may become torn away, whereby a build-up of potential may occur. However, this is equalized by means of the electrically conductive connection between the body and the screen material, so that the body and the screening material always have the same potential. It may still happen that a potential is built up between the screen material and the layers located within. To prevent the signal from being attenuated within the measuring range, for example between 0.05 and 150 Hz, it may be advantageous to reduce the capacitance between the measuring electrodes by removing a conductive material from an area near the measuring electrodes, see the particular part of the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> description. Across the actual electrode the distance to the nearest conductive layer should be at least 1/50 of the radius of the electrode.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The capacitance between the different layers must be adjusted so that the impedance in the transmission line from the electrodes is as low as possible for frequencies within the specified measuring range. In addition, the impedance in the actual electrode and the transition between the measuring electrode and the body in the outer layers of the skin must be adjusted to provide good electrical contact.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The contact path from the measuring electrodes to the signal processor and transmitter part is formed symmetrical to avoid electrical interference, so-called "common mode rejection".</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">These features make the measurement signal remain essentially unaffected even when there is rubbing between clothes and the electrode part.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The measuring electrodes are fixedly spaced in the electrode part and the distance between the measuring electrodes counted along the skin of the body is approximately constant even when the body is moving. This helps to make the measurements relatively stable also when the patient is moving.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The height of the electrode part is relatively small and normally substantially smaller than the width of the electrode part. Normally, the height is smaller than 0.3 times the width. Preferably, the height is smaller than 0.25 times the width, and most advantageously smaller than 0.05 times the width.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The height of the electrode part works together with the relatively flexible material to make the electrode part pliable with respect to bending and twisting. Thereby, the electrode part shapes itself to the body when it is adhered to<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the skin, which limits changes in electrical potential between the body and the electrode part during movement.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The signal processor and transmitter part, which typically includes, in addition to a battery, a signal amplifier and a radio transmitter according to the prior art known <i>per se</i>, may be formed with different filters and also other signalprocessing components.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">One of the inner conductive layers of the electrode part is typically connected to the battery to provide a reference potential for the signals that are picked up in the measuring electrodes. This earthing layer is independent of the outer earthing/interference-screening layer which is connected to the earth electrode to achieve an approximately potential-free area at the electrode part.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In one embodiment the signal processor and transmitter part may be provided with signal-analysing functions with associated alarm criteria so as to be able to output a signal if the measured signal values fall outside a limit or a signal pattern.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">When the measurement unit is adhered to the skin of the body at an appropriate place, bioelectrical measurement signals are transmitted from the measuring electrodes to the signal processor and transmitter part. Any induced electrical signals from rubbing and bending are picked up by the substantially covering, electrically conductive material and are carried to the patient via the earth electrode without disturbing the measurement signals to any extent worth mentioning.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In what follows is described a non-limiting example of a preferred embodiment which is visualized in the accompanying drawings, in which:<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> -->
