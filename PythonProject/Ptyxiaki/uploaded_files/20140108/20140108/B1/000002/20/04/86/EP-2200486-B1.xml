Such a phenomenon causes an undesired alteration of the characteristics of the food, in particular of its nutritional value.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In steamers, the food loses a lot of the mineral salts, the vitamins and the other water-soluble nourishing substances because of the prolonged and continuous direct contact with steam. Also in this case therefore the undesired alteration of the characteristics of the food takes place.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Lastly, in pressure cookers the high temperature reached inside the cooker, typically 108 - 120°C, damages or destroys the most delicate substances such as vitamins and enzymes, and moreover the risk still exists that small particles of food burn in the portion in contact with the metal bottom.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The invention concerns a fourth kind of vessel for cooking food, of the kind exploiting the cooking principle referred to as indirect steaming with automatic temperature control.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Said cooking system and a corresponding vessel are disclosed for instance in the Patent for Utility Model <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="IT247485"><text>IT-247485</text></patcit> in the name of the Applicant.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The term "indirect steaming with automatic temperature control" generally refers to cooking food in suitable vessels where a water-containing hollow space is interposed between the heat source, for instance a gas ring or an electric hot plate, and the food.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The pressure of steam generated inside the hollow space due to water heating is adjusted by a control valve, which is generally located on the vessel wall and is calibrated so as to prevent the burst of the walls of the hollow space and to keep the temperature inside the vessel constant, at a value of about 105°C.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Said cooking system improves the food quality in that it avoids burning and the consequent alterations. Vitamins, enzymes and nourishing substances do not suffer from detrimental alterations, mineral salts are not dispersed, oils and fats do not fry, do not burn and are not transformed into harmful substances, with clear advantages for health.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Since food, in accordance with such a cooking system, is isolated from direct contact with the heat source and is not in contact with steam, the wealth of the natural flavours is maintained and food is tastier, more natural and digestible and lighter.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">For the same reason, when using said cooking system, it is not necessary to frequently stir food, nor is necessary to add water, since food does not burn nor it sticks on the walls or the bottom of the vessel.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Moreover, the constant temperature, typically of about 105°C, inside the vessel can be maintained also by means of a small heat source, with consequent energy saving.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Of course, manufacturing a vessel for indirect steaming with automatic temperature control is more complex than manufacturing a traditional vessel.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Actually, in the first case, it is necessary to define a sufficiently robust hollow space for water and to equip it with a valve calibrated so as to keep the temperature inside the vessel constant, thereby avoiding its burst.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to the prior art, the hollow space is defined by joining along their edges two cylindrical bodies of sheet steel concentrically arranged into each other. Both cylindrical bodies are closed at their bottom and open at their top and they have slightly different sizes so that, once they are joined together, the inner body is spaced apart from the outer body in correspondence of the walls and the bottom, thereby defining the corresponding hollow space.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A valve for adjusting the steam pressure in the hollow space is provided on the side of the outer body and it can be removed in order to fill the hollow space with water.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Generally a steel plate is externally secured onto the bottom of the outer body in order to define a corresponding bearing surface for the vessel.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A drawback of the prior art vessels for indirect steaming with automatic temperature control is related with the difficulty of replacing the pressure adjusting device. Indeed, in such case often the vessel itself is damaged or the replacement is not convenient.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">It is therefore a first object of the invention to provide a method of manufacturing a vessel for cooking food, in particular for cooking food according to the system of indirect steaming with automatic temperature control, in which the pressure adjusting device can be easily replaced, without damaging the vessel.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">It is another object of the invention to provide a method of manufacturing a vessel of the above kind, which method is simple and cheap and enables obtaining a vessel with high structural and aesthetic quality.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Recently, so-called induction cooking plates, in which heat is generated by a magnetic field generated by induction coils, have become widely used. The cooking plate remains cold, thereby minimising consumptions and enabling attaining and maintaining the temperature in very short times. In this case however use of a pan with a suitable bottom (of iron or steel/iron) is necessary.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a vessel for cooking food, of the kind exploiting the system of indirect steaming with automatic temperature control, which vessel can be used also on induction cooking plates.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">It is yet a further object of the invention to provide a vessel of the above kind, which is simple and cheap to be manufactured.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The above and other objects are achieved by the vessel and the method as claimed in the appended claims.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Advantageously, according to the invention, the pressure adjusting device can be applied to the vessel easily and with the correct orientation; moreover, the valve can be easily mounted and removed during the usual operations of filling the hollow space.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Moreover, always according to the invention it is possible to obtain in simple and cheap manner a vessel for cooking food, in particular for cooking food according to the system of indirect steaming with automatic temperature control, which vessel has high structural and aesthetic quality.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Advantageously, the vessel according to the invention can be effectively employed on induction cooking plates.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">A detailed description of the invention will be provided hereinafter with reference to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the accompanying drawings, in which:
<ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of the vessel according to the invention,</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is an enlarged view of a detail of the vessel according to a first embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 3a and 3b</figref> are enlarged views of a detail of the vessel in respective manufacturing steps, according to a second embodiment.</li></ul></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the vessel according to the invention, generally denoted 11, comprises an outer first body 13 and an inner second body 15. Said bodies 13, 15 are cylindrical and have a closed bottom 13a, 15a, respectively, and an opening 13b, 15b, respectively, on the opposite base. A hollow space 17 is defined between said bodies 13, 15 and extends, preferably without interruptions, along the bottom and the walls of vessel 11.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In correspondence of their respective openings 13b, 15b, outer body 13 and inner body 15 have circumferential edges 13c, 15c extending radially outwards from vessel 11 and partially overlapping each other in order to close hollow space 17.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Outer body 13 laterally has a hole 19 for a pressure adjusting device 21 inside hollow space 17, said device being shown partially disassembled in the Figure.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Device 21 substantially comprises a bushing 23, an L-shaped connector 25 and a valve 27.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Bushing 23, preferably cylindrical and made of brass, has a threaded portion 29 for screwing and securing bushing 23 into hole 19 of outer body 13. In order to ensure the required tightness of bushing 23 in hole 19 and to firmly lock bushing 23 in hole 19, according to the invention a layer of adhesive material is applied between threaded portion 29 and the edge defining hole 19.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">L-shaped connector 25, which substantially acts as a support for valve 27, includes a cylindrical seat 31 where the body of bushing 23 is received, upon application of a layer of adhesive in order to ensure the required tightness.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Advantageously, thanks to the described arrangement, mounting of device 21 is quick and simple, and connector 25 can be firmly secured in the correct position so that valve 27 is correctly oriented upwards.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Actually, according to the invention, bushing 23 can be tightly screwed into hole 19, since the final orientation of the bushing is of no relevance in order to ensure the correct arrangement of valve 27. On the contrary, connector 25 is secured to bushing 23 by gluing thanks to the layer of adhesive material, thereby allowing the desired arrangement of connector 25 ensuring the correct orientation of valve 27.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Valve 27, which may be of a known type comprising a mass sliding in an axial chamber when raised by the steam pressure, is secured to connector 25 by screwing threaded portion 33 into the corresponding seat 35 provided in connector 25.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In this manner, valve 27 can be easily manually removed by the user when the water level inside hollow space 17 is to be restored, and can be as easily mounted again before vessel 11 is used for cooking food.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Similarly, should replacement of connector 25 be necessary, it will be possible to take off said connector 25 from bushing 23, preferably upon heating the glued area in order to make detachment of the adhesive easier.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Equally similarly, it will be also possible to replace bushing 23 of device 21 by unscrewing it from hole 19 of outer body 13, preferably upon heating in order to make detachment of the adhesive easier.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Still with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, according to the invention, bottom 13a of outer body 13 has associated therewith an aluminium disc 37.
