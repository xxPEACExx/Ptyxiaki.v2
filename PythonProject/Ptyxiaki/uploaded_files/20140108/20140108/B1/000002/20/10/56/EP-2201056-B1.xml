mxw-id="PDES63960628" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">Glass-fibre reinforced plastics (GRP) are well known as regards their suitability for use in a diverse range of sectors and applications. These include construction, automotive / transport, marine, chemical resistant plant and sanitary-ware. The products are valued for their versatility in formulation, processing and end-use. The resin matrix most commonly employed is unsaturated polyester resin (UPR). However, these materials are not without their drawbacks or limitations, which include the somewhat brittle nature of the resin matrix.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Polyester-polyurethane hybrid resins were developed to address this deficiency, and to also confer additional process and end-use benefits. The term hybrid describes a new type of polymer that is formed by the incorporation of the chemical groups and the properties of two different polymers, namely unsaturated polyester and polyurethane. Hybrid resins build molecular weight and toughness as they cure through the urethane chain-extension reaction, which occurs between the hydroxyl end groups on the unsaturated polyester and the isocyanate groups. Cross-linking occurs between the unsaturation in the polyester backbone and the styrene monomer, adding stiffness and thermal resistance. Thus, a unique blend of properties is obtained that cannot be achieved with either polymer alone.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Polyurethanes are well known for both their application as tough elastomers and processed foams, either flexible or rigid, the latter often for application in sandwich structures, imparting insulation characteristics. The closed-cell structure of these foams, in addition to the insulation properties, reduces density and enables rigidity to be achieved without excessive weight increase.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5344852A"><text>US 5,344,852</text></patcit> discloses water blown unsaturated polyester-polyurethane hybrid foam compositions with water equivalent content representing 25 to 150% of the total OH of the polyol component and NCO to total OH ratio from 0.5 to 2, preferably 0.8 to 1.2, the presence of a chain extender such as a diamine and/or a polyol being essential. The preferred densities of the disclosed foams vary from 16 to 160 g/l and may go up to 560 g/l for a fillers content of 50% by weight.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Although the polyurethane foams based on saturated polyols, polyesters or polyethers, are extensively used commercially, this is not the case for the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> formulations of polyester-based foams, for reasons including poor consistency and variable cell structure. Some of the essential technical problems to be solved with respect to the polyurethane foam technology based on saturated polyols, are related with the additional crosslinking reaction by free radical route involving the ethylenic unsaturation of the said unsaturated polyester. The question is to be able to monitor the right order and rate of the competitive and successive reactions occurring in the foaming unsaturated crosslinkable system. Such a system comprises a polyisocyanate component and an isocyanate-reactive component, including the polyol and water as the blowing agent. A first reaction is the exothermic reaction of water with the polyisocyanate, generating carbon dioxide gas and a polyamine further reacting with a polyisocyanate to lead to a polyurea, reaction competing with the urethane formation reaction of the polyol with the said polyisocyanate and finally the free radical crosslinking reaction involving the ethylenic unsaturation, induced by the heat generation of the previous reactions and by the decomposition of the free radical initiator. In fact, the technical problem to solve is to have a reproducible, mechanically high performant and lightweight moulded article in a specific density range. The solution of the present invention is by monitoring specific reacting and foaming conditions for the unsaturated composition when moulding. In fact, the water content and the isocyanate to the total hydroxyls ratio, are specifically limited, with a composition free of chain extension components, like low molecular weight polyols and/or diamines.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention further develops the concept of hybrid resins, without any chain extension polyol or diamine, to include an element of foaming, which reduces weight by at least 50%, with respect to the non foamed article and enhances the properties of toughness and rigidity in a density range of the final foamed article, particularly for sanitary moulded articles or for moulded building materials, varying from 0.4 to 1.2 g/ml and more particularly from 0.6 to 0.8 g/ml with a fillers content up to 50%.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The first subject of the invention relates to a specific crosslinkable foaming unsaturated polyester-polyurethane resin moulding composition.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A second and third subjects concern specific processes of preparing a moulded foamed article from at least one composition as defined according to the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">An additional subject concerns various uses of the said foaming composition.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Finally, the invention does also cover as last subject, finished products such as foam materials and foamed articles resulting from the composition or from the processes as defined according to the present invention.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">So, the first subject of the invention relates to a crosslinkable foaming unsaturated polyester-polyurethane resin moulding composition which is lightly foamed on cure to produce moulded articles.
