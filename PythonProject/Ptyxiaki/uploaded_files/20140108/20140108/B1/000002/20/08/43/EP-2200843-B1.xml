<ul><li>an envelope feeder configured to feed envelopes to a product receiving position;</li><li>a positioning structure configured to position the envelopes in said receiving position;</li><li>an inserter configured to insert products into envelopes, positioned in the receiving position, in a product inserting direction; and</li><li>an envelope conveyor to remove filled envelopes from the receiving position, in an envelope removal direction.</li></ul></p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Such an apparatus is known from practice and has been marketed by applicant. The known apparatus is of modular structure and is provided with a product assembly path which comprises a number of feeders which are arranged along or above a pusher conveyor. Each feeder feeds a product to be placed in an envelope to a position on the pusher conveyor, so that thus composite products can be obtained. Such a product can comprise, for instance, a main document with a number of annexes. Next, the product, which may or may not be composite, is supplied to an inserting module.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The international patent application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO03061988A"><text>W003061988</text></patcit>, of the applicant, describes an advantageous embodiment of the apparatus, an example of which is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">Figures 1-2</figref>. This apparatus comprises a product assembly path 1 having a pusher conveyor 2 and at least one feeder 4 for feeding a, possibly composite, product which is to be placed in an envelope. Herein, an inserting module is provided with an endless conveyor 12' with grippers 13' (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>), such as, for instance, a toothed belt or chain with grippers, the endless conveyor 12' following a path such that the grippers 13' thereof can engage an envelope contained in the magazine and, as a result of the travel of the conveyor, can pull the envelope from the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> magazine. The grippers 13' can position a respective envelope in another part of the path in the receiving position.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In this known apparatus, the conveying direction of the mentioned discharge path is perpendicular to the conveying direction of the inserting module. Three endless conveyor belts 22, 23, 24 are provided (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>), wherein one conveying part of a first conveyor belt 22 is disposed at least partly against a conveying part of a second conveyor belt 23. The envelope with product advanced by the intermediate conveyor is moved into the nip defined by the two conveyor belts, so that the envelope with product is clamped between the two conveying parts. Thereafter, the envelope can be conveyed further (in a inclined upward direction) and ejected onto the discharge path. The discharge path is provided with a stop 30' against which products supplied by the discharge conveyor belts come to abut, so that they are aligned. The known discharge path is provided with a vacuum conveyor belt and with sealing means not represented in the drawing, for sealing the envelope. These sealing means comprise, for instance, an apparatus for wetting the sealing flap of the envelope and a guideway for gradually folding over the sealing flap during advancement of the envelope along the discharge path. Instead of a wetting device, a hot-melt glue dispensing unit may be provided. During use, the known apparatus can move an envelope with product further between the conveying parts of the conveyor belts until it comes to lie against the stop to be subsequently discharged in the discharge path in transverse direction.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Until the present day, the known apparatus has been successfully used in filling landscape orientated (i.e. wallet type) envelopes, having a relatively wide mouth with respect to lateral envelope edges.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention aims to provide an improved apparatus. Particularly, the invention aims to provide an inserting apparatus that can handle a large range of products into envelopes of a large range of sizes, weights and thicknesses, reliably and rapidly. More particularly, the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> invention aims to provide an apparatus that can handle portrait orientated (i.e. pocket type) envelopes.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to an embodiment of the invention, the apparatus is characterized in that the positioning structure comprises envelope guides configured to abut two lateral envelope edges of each envelope that is in said receiving position to actively position, and a drive to laterally adjust a position of at least one of the envelope guides.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In this way, a very accurate, active positioning (alignment) of the envelope can be obtained, automatically, and directly after the envelope has been conveyed into the product receiving position, so that a reliable inserting of product into the envelope can be achieved. It has been found that this improved (drive induced) positioning of the envelope is particularly advantageous in the case the envelope is of a pocket type, wherein the product has to be slid into the envelope over a relatively long distance compared to the filling of a wallet type envelope. However, the present apparatus can also be used to fill wallet type envelopes. Besides, high throughput and even less envelope filling obstructions (due to a misalignment between envelope and product) can be achieved by the present invention, with respect to known apparatus.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">An embodiment of the invention provides a method for placing a product in an envelope using an apparatus according to any one of claims 1-9, wherein the envelope is fed to the product receiving position, by the envelope feeder, wherein the position of the envelope guides is adjusted laterally to align the envelope with respect to a product receiving path and the guides hold the envelope without any (zero) tolerance there-between to align the envelope, wherein the inserter inserts a product into the aligned envelope, in the product inserting direction.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Thus, above-mentioned advantages can be achieved. Preferably, wherein the envelope guides can hold the envelope between respective envelope guiding surfaces.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is noted that <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP1719724A"><text>EP 1.719.724</text></patcit> discloses an apparatus, such as paper handling equipment, having a materials feed tray for feeding materials such as envelopes. The material feed tray comprises adjustable side guides. The side guides can be controlled to move toward and away from each other by means of a knob. When rotating the knob, the side guides move in either direction dependent on the direction of rotation of the knob. The feed tray comprises a tensioner mechanism that causes the side guides to automatically back off a controlled amount when the knob is released from movement in the direction to close the side guides. The back off of the two side guides is a controlled movement of the side guides away from each other. The distance is such that the envelopes to be fed from the feed tray will not bind on the sides or be jammed resulting in a failure to feed.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Also, for example, after the filling of the envelope, the envelope guides can be repositioned to release the envelope, wherein an envelope conveyor removes the filled envelope from the receiving position, preferably in an envelope removal direction that is parallel to the product receiving direction.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to a further embodiment, during a first mode of operation, the position of the envelope guides is preferably adjusted to align envelopes having a first envelope width, wherein, during a second mode of operation, the position of the envelope guides is adjusted to align envelopes having a second envelope width that differs from said first envelope width. In this way, the apparatus and method can include different operating modes for different envelope formats and/or dimensions. As an example, positions of the guides may be manually adjustable, in view of the envelope format that is to be actively aligned by the guides.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Further elaborations of the inserting apparatus according to the invention are described in the dependent claims and will hereinafter, together with the method according to the invention, be further elucidated with reference to the drawing.

The product assembly path 1 can be configured to convey assembled products to the inserting apparatus, particularly utilizing a product conveyor 2.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 3</figref> shows part of a further embodiment of an inserting apparatus. The apparatus can be provided with:
<ul><li>an envelope feeder 12 configured to feed envelopes E to a product receiving position;<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></li><li>a positioning structure, comprising a stop device 14, configured to position the envelopes in said receiving position;</li><li>an inserter 7 configured to insert products into envelopes, positioned in the receiving position, in a product inserting direction; and</li><li>an envelope conveyor 29 to remove filled envelopes from the receiving position, in an envelope removal direction (indicted by arrow X).</li></ul></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">For example, the apparatus can include an afore-mentioned product assembly path 1 comprising a product conveyor 2 and at least one feeder 4 for feeding a, possibly composite, product P which is to be placed in the envelope E.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The inserter (or inserting module) 7 can be provided with a magazine 8 for envelopes. The inserter 7 can also include a transport device 12 for transporting the envelopes to the mentioned product receiving position (in which receiving position, in use, the product P coming from the product assembly path can be placed in the envelope E).</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Also, there can be provided a discharge path in which the envelope with the product placed therein is discharged from the inserting module 7 for further processing. According to a non-limiting embodiment, the discharge path has a discharge conveying direction which is substantially perpendicular (or transverse) to a conveying direction X of the inserting apparatus (such a transverse direction is indicated by arrows Y).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to an embodiment, the envelope conveyer 12' can include grippers 13', that can engage an envelope contained in the magazine and, as a result of the travel of the conveyor, can pull the envelope from the magazine, and the grippers can position a respective envelope in another part of the path in the receiving position (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>).</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Alternatively, means can be provided to push envelopes from the magazine into the grippers, when the grippers pass the magazine. This is depicted in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>. In this case, the envelope magazine 8 comprises conveyors that can take envelopes from a stack, and can push the envelopes<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> into passing grippers 13 of an endless conveyor 12. For example, the grippers 13 can automatically grip envelopes pushed therein, to transfer the envelopes to a mentioned product receiving position at a first stop 14. Also, the grippers 13 can automatically release a gripped envelope in case the envelope has been positioned in that receiving position.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The envelope feeder 12 can also be configured differently.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to a preferred embodiment, the inserting module (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2 and 3</figref>) can be provided with intermediate conveyor means which are arranged for taking over the conveyance of the product P from the pusher conveyor 2 of the product assembly path 1 (see also <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>). In the present exemplary embodiment, the intermediate conveyor means are designed as an endless conveyor 20 with pushers 21. The endless intermediate conveyor 20 is driven with a controllable drive, so that the speed with which the product can be slid into the envelope by the intermediate conveyor 20 can be varied. The intermediate conveyor 20 takes over the conveyance of the product, which is initially effected by the pusher 3 of the pusher conveyor 2 of the product assembly path 1, and slides the product into an envelope which is disposed in the receiving position. During or directly after sliding the product into the envelope, the stop 14 is brought into the release position, for example such that the product, together with the envelope, can be conveyed to a second, elongated, stop 30 (or discharge stop), located along the discharge path. For example, a first vacuum belt 29 can be provided to carry out the transfer of the envelopes from the inserting module, in a envelope removal direction X.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Further, in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> it is visible that the inserting module can be provided with a suction cup 25 for pulling up an opening edge (i.e. the product receiving mouth) of the envelope E disposed in the receiving position. Further, a movably arranged downholder 26 can be provided, for holding down the product to be inserted, under the pulled-up opening edge. The displacement of the movable downholder 26 involves a reciprocating<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> movement for sliding the downholder into the opening of the envelope after the suction cup has pulled up the opening edge.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, the discharge path preferably extends at the same vertical level as the receiving position in which, in use, the product coming from the product assembly path is placed in the envelope. Thus, the stop 30 of the discharge path extends substantially at the same height as the product receiving position. For example, a first vacuum conveyor 29, comprising a pair of suction belts in the present embodiment, can be provided to transfer an envelope E (for example filled with product) with high speed from the product receiving position towards the discharge path. For example, the first vacuum conveyor 29 can move envelopes at a speed higher than 1 m/s, for example 1.5 m/s or more, during use, in a conveying direction X of the inserting module. In the present embodiment, as an example, this conveying direction is equal to a conveying direction of the product assembly path 2. The suction belts of the first vacuum conveyor can be arranged symmetrically with respect to a centre line of a path to be taken by the envelopes.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Advantageously, the inserting module can be provided with the endless conveyor 12 with grippers 13, such as, for instance, a toothed belt or chain with grippers, the endless conveyor 12 following a path such that the grippers thereof can receive an envelope contained in the magazine 8, wherein the endless conveyor 12 is provided with a first upper part 12A for transferring the envelopes to the product receiving position, and a second part 12B extending below the level of the product receiving position (and reaching below a skewed roller conveyor 31, which is described in the following). This is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig 3</figref>, wherein the second upper part 12B of the endless (gripper) conveyor 12 extends at an angle downwards with respect to the first upper part 12A, which extends in a substantially horizontal plane. An intermediate conveyor guide 17, for example comprising suitable guiding wheels, is provided, from which the second conveyor part extends<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> towards a lower conveyor end part 12C, away from the level of the first vacuum conveyor 29. An opening or slit can be provided in the plane of the vacuum conveyor 29, where-through upwardly protruding parts of the grippers 13 of the endless conveyor 12 (at its upper section) can be led downwardly. During use, the conveying speed of the endless conveyor 12 and the first vacuum conveyor 29 can be set such, that envelopes (filled at the product receiving position) do not run into upwardly protruding gripper parts of the endless conveyor 12 when the envelopes are moved towards the discharge path by the vacuum conveyor 29.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">Figures 4-9</figref> show a further embodiment of the apparatus, which differs from the embodiments described above (regarding <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">figures 1-3</figref>) in that the positioning structure comprises envelope guides 33, 34 configured to abut the two lateral envelope edges t1, t2 of each envelope that is in said receiving position, and a drive (or drive mechanism) M, 63, 64 to laterally adjust a position of at least one of the envelope guides 33, 34. In the present embodiment, two opposite guides 33, 34 are provided, and lateral (i.e. transverse) positions of both the guides 33, 34 can be actively adjusted during operation of the (inserting) apparatus. Particularly, said lateral envelope edges are the edges t1, t2 that extend in transverse direction with respect to a product receiving mouth (opening edge) of the respective envelope E (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>). Also, for example, part of an envelope transport path runs through an area that is laterally enclosed by the guides 33, 34, the guides 33, 34 extending in parallel with that transport path part (as in the present embodiment, see the drawings).</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the present embodiment, each of the guides 33, 34 includes an elongated envelope guiding element (which can also be called a guide bar, or support member) 33, 34, preferably having a length that is at least half the length of a lateral envelope edge (said length being measured in the direction indicated by arrows X in the drawing). For example, the length of<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> each guiding element 33, 34 can be 75% or more, preferably 90% or more, of the length of the lateral envelope edge.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The guiding elements 33, 34 can be configured and shaped in different ways, as will be clear to the skilled person. For example, the guiding element 33, 34 can be a guiding blade, or have a knife blade shape (see <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 9</figref>), or a different shape. For example, the elements can be made of metal, for example aluminum, an alloy, steel, plastic (such as fiber reinforced plastic), or different material(s).</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Particularly, the guiding element 33, 34 have parallel vertical guiding surfaces S, which surfaces S are faced towards each other; in the present embodiment, the guiding surfaces S extend parallel with respect to a product inserting direction (particularly, the product inserting direction is a direction in which a product is inserted into the envelope, for example the direction X). These guiding surfaces S also extend parallel with respect to the envelope removing direction X. The drive can adjust the position of the envelope guiding elements 33, 34 directions that are normal (i.e directions Y) with respect to their guiding surfaces S.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In the present embodiment, the vertical guiding surfaces are flat, uninterrupted surfaces. Alternatively, the guiding surfaces can be perforated, or include apertures in a different way, if desired. Particularly, the guiding surface S of a guiding element 33, 34 is configured such that a major part of a respective lateral edge of an envelope E, to be aligned, can contact that surface S (the major part being for example at least 75% of the lateral envelope edge, and preferably at least 90% of the edge).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The guide drive M, 63, 64 is preferably configured to move the envelope guides 33, 34 to a first position (shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>) wherein the opposite guiding surfaces S of the guides 33, 34 are spaced-apart over a first distance, which first distance is larger than a width, measured perpendicularly to said inserting direction, of envelopes E to be positioned.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Also, the drive M, 63, 64 is preferably configured to move the envelope guides 33, 34 to a second position wherein opposite guiding surfaces of the guides are spaced-apart over a second distance, which second distance is the same as or slightly (for example about one millimeter) smaller than the width, measured perpendicularly to said inserting direction, of the envelopes E to be positioned.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Also, in the present embodiment, the two guide elements 33, 34 are preferably translated over the same lateral distance by the drive M, 63, 64, but in opposite lateral directions.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The guide drive (drive mechanism) can be configured in various ways. For example, the drive can include one or more actuators, motors, servos, configured to reposition the envelope side guides 33, 34. For example, the drive can be an electrical, pneumatic, or hydraulic drive, using electric, pneumatic or hydraulic energy for adjusting the position of the guides 33, 34. Preferably, the drive includes or a controller, or is controlled by a controller (not shown), such that the drive automatically adjust guide positions during operation of the apparatus.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In the present embodiment, both guides 33, 34 are actively adjustable by the drive. According to an embodiment, the apparatus can include two separate guide motors, one per guide 33, 34, to control guide positions. Preferably, as in this embodiment, only a single actuator (for example an electromotor) is included, and arranged to adjust the positions of both the envelope guides 33, 34.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In the present embodiment, for example, the drive M, 63, 64 includes a first and second laterally moveable arm 63, 64, i.e., being linearly movably in the lateral directions Y. Particularly, the arms 63, 64 extend in parallel, for example above an envelope transport path, and for example spaced-apart from each other in the X direction (see <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref>). A first 63 of the arms 63, 64 is coupled to a first envelope guide 33, and a second arm 34 is coupled to the second envelope guide 34, respectively, to laterally move the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> envelope guides. During envelope filling operation, the positions of the guides 33, 34 and their respective drive arms 63, 64 are fixed.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In the embodiment, the arms 63, 64 are movably (for example slidably) mounted onto suitable arm guides 80, 81. In the embodiment, these arms guides 80, 81 are arranged at opposite sides with respect to the envelope path.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In a preferred embodiment, the (lateral) position of each of the envelope guiding elements 33, 34 with respect to the respective arm 63, 64 can be, preferably manually, adjusted. For example, the guiding elements 33, 34 can be connected to the respective arms 63, 64 using releasable locking means 73, 74, for example clamps, bolting means, or other types of connectors or coupling means. In this embodiment, unlocking and locking of a envelope guiding element 33, 34 to and from the respective arm 63, 64 can be achieved manually. Preferably, the arms 63, 64 and guide elements 33, 34 (or at least the respective coupling means) are configured to provide a limited number of guide element locking positions, for example at predetermined arm locations.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In this way, an operator can set different modes of operation depending on the width of envelopes to be filled. For example, there can be provided a first mode of operation, wherein the positions of the envelope guides 33, 34 on the arms 63, 64 is adjusted, in view to a first envelope width, to align envelopes having a first envelope width during a subsequent envelope filling process. During another (second) mode of operation, the position of the envelope guides with respect to their arms 63, 64 can be adjusted in view of a second envelope width, which is different from said first envelope width, to align other envelopes having the second envelope width.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">According to a further embodiment, each guiding element 33, 34 can include a stabilizing member 33A, 34A, respectively, which cooperates with the driving arm 64, 63 of the other guiding element 33, 34, to improve<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the guiding element's 33, 34 stability during operation (see <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref>). In this embodiment, the stabilizing members 33A, 33B extend in lateral directions from guide element end sections, along the driving arms 64, 63 to be movably supported be the arms. For example, the stabilizing member 33A of the first guide 33 can be slidingly (i.e. slidably) supported by the driving arm 63 of the second guide 34; the stabilizing member 34A of the second guide 34 can be slidingly supported by the driving arm 63 of the first guide 33. Therein, the support provided by the driving arms 63, resp. 64 to the stabilizers 34A, resp. 33A is particularly such that pivoting of the guides 34, resp. 33 (particularly along both horizontal and vertical pivot lines) is counteracted.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The drive can also include a mechanism 70, 71 configured to move the arms 63, 64 in opposite directions Y during operation, in order to move the guide elements 33, 34 laterally away from each other (to an envelope holding position) and towards each other (to an envelope release position). The mechanism can be configured in different ways, for example including chain members, transmission belts, toothed rotatable and linearly movable parts interacting with each other, cam means, or in a different manner. The mechanism can be driven by a suitable actuator M, for example electromotor, a stepping motor, or a different actuator type.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In the present embodiment, the mechanism includes a transmission 70, 71 configured to convert a rotation, particularly a rotation over a certain predetermined rotation angle (for example a turn of 360 degrees or smaller), into a first linear movement having a first direction and into a second linear movement having a second direction, opposite to the first direction. This can be achieved in various ways. The present non-limiting embodiment comprises a cam guiding member, particularly a cam guiding wheel 70, that is rotatable about a respective rotation axis. The rotation axis, for example, extends in parallel with the guiding elements 33, 34. The motor M is connected to the cam guiding wheel 70, to turn the wheel<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> over a desired angle of rotation. End sections of the linearly movable (i.e. translating) arms 63, 64 are provided with cams 71 (preferably cam wheels) that cooperate with the cam guiding wheel 70, to convert a rotation of that wheel 70 into the linear movement of the arms 63, 64. Naturally, vice versa, a driven rotating member can also be provided with cams acting on suitable guiding slots of the arms.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">For example, the cam guiding wheel 70 can include two eccentrical cam guiding slots 70A (one slot 70A being provides in each side of the wheel 70) that receive the cams 71 of the arms 63, 64, as in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0005">8</figref>; particularly, the guiding slots 70A extend eccentrically with respect to the rotation axis of the wheel 70. The guiding slots 70A may, for example, be ring shaped. Preferably, these eccentrical cam guiding slots 70A are shaped identically (having the same dimensions, for example diameter in case of ring shaped slots), and are not concentric with respect to each other. Preferably, virtual centers of the guiding slots 70A are located on opposite sides with respect to a centre of rotation of the guiding wheel 70, at the same distance from that centre.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In a further embodiment, a turning (rotation) of the guiding wheel 70 over a predetermined angle (for example 180 degrees, or a smaller angle) in a first rotation direction leads (via interaction with the cam means 70A, 71) to the envelope guides 33, 34 moving away from each other, and a turning (rotation) of the guiding wheel 70 in a second rotation direction, which is opposite to the first rotation direction, leads to the envelope guides 33, 34 moving towards each other.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">According to an embodiment, the transmission 70, 71 can be configured such that each arm 63, 64 (and respective guide element 33, 34) can translate over a maximum distance of several centimeters, for example a maximum distance of 1 cm, more particularly 0.5 cm or less.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Thus, in the present embodiment, the drive M, 63, 64 is configured to laterally adjust the position of each of the envelope guides 33, 34<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> (preferably over the same distance, but in different direction), particularly such that the guides 33, 34 are always positioned at equal distances with respect to a, predetermined, central envelope positioning line (the central positioning line particularly depends on the longitudinal centre of the product feeding path; during operation, products P that are fed to the envelopes E, located at their product receiving positions, will generally be aligned with respect to their feeding paths).</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In the embodiment, of <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">figures 4-9</figref>, as follows from the above, the positioning structure comprises a stop device 14 to stop envelopes that are fed to the receiving position, at an envelope edge that is perpendicular to the lateral envelope edges. The overall positioning structure (including the guides 33, 34) is preferably configured such that the stop device 14 acts on an envelope E first, before the envelope guides 33, 34 are activated (i.e. driven by the drive mechanism M, 70, 71, 63, 64) to laterally align that envelope.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The present apparatus can provide swift filling of are pocket type ('portrait') envelopes E, having lateral edges that are longer than the width of a product receiving mouth of the envelopes E. As is mentioned above, the present invention can also be applied to the filling of wallet type ('landscape') envelopes.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Operation of the apparatus (see <figref idrefs="f0003">figures 4-5</figref>) can provide a method for placing products P in envelopes. Therein, wherein each envelope E is fed to the product receiving position, by the envelope feeder (for example conveyor) 12.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Preferably, the envelope E is stopped first, by the stop device 14 acting on an envelope edge that is perpendicular to the lateral envelope edges, before the envelope is being aligned by the envelope guides. To this aim, for example, the stop device 14 can move an envelope stop into the envelope conveying path, in a vertical direction Z (as in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>).<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0053" num="0053">After the envelope E has been stopped by the stop device 14, the position of the envelope guides 33, 34 is adjusted laterally to align the envelope E with respect to a product receiving path. Preferably, as a result, the guides 33, 34 enclose the envelope along its opposite lateral side with zero tolerance. Also, in a further embodiment, the guide elements 33, 34 can apply a small pressure (i.e. a pressing force larger than 0 N) to the envelope E held there-between, for example pressing the envelope E slightly inwardly, however, this is not essential.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Then, the inserter inserts a product P into the thus aligned envelope, in the product inserting direction that is substantially parallel to the lateral envelope edges t1, t2.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Preferably, the envelope guides 33, 34 hold the envelope E between respective envelope guiding surfaces S, without any (zero) tolerance there-between, to align the envelope E.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Also, after the filling of the envelope E, the envelope guides 33, 34 are repositioned, i.e. moved away from each other by the drive mechanism, to release the envelope E. Also, then, the stop device 14 can be controlled to release the envelope E, particularly by removing the respective stop from the envelope conveying path. The downstream envelope conveyor 29 can then remove the filled envelope E from the receiving position, preferably in an envelope removal direction X that is parallel to the product receiving direction, and a subsequent envelope can be transferred to the product receiving position to be aligned by the side guides 33, 34.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Particularly, during operation, the envelope guides 33, 34 are first spaced-apart from each other (in a first lateral direction Y), by the above-described drive mechanism, over a first distance to receive the envelope there-between. As is mentioned above, preferably the first distance is larger than a width, measured perpendicularly to said inserting direction, of the envelope E to be positioned. Subsequently, the envelope guides 33, 34 are moved towards each other (in a second lateral direction Y opposite to said<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> first lateral direction), to a second position, to push the envelope to a desired aligned envelope position. According to a non-limiting embodiment, said first distance can be larger than the envelope width by at most 5 cm, preferably at most 2 cm and more preferably at most 1 cm.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The present apparatus and method can provide a swift, reliable and accurate filling of envelopes E, particularly by using active lateral alignment of the envelopes E.
