The element is obtained by bending portions of a blank 46 vertically to form walls 50, as shown in perspective view in <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">Figure 2</figref>. A plurality of such elements can be assembled together to form a honeycomb structure.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is an object of the invention to provide improved connecting means between constructional elements of the aforementioned, as well as similar type, which allow greater control and adjustment of a subtending angle defined between adjacent constructional elements. Typically by varying the subtending angle defined between adjacent constructional elements, adjacent sidewalls flex thereby enabling a radius of curvature to be defined.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary of Invention</u></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a modular construction system comprising: a plurality of structural elements of V-shaped or chevron-shaped cross section, adapted to be assembled in a cellular configuration, and a connector, said connector which allows an amount of relative movement between said structural elements in two-rotational degrees of freedom., wherein said movement is provided by a pair of adjacent washers, one washer having a substantially concave surface and the other washer having a substantially convex surface.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Ideally reinforcement ties, bars or bracing units are provided for use in securing diametrically opposite points of a structure formed from said elements.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Connectors may be arranged to urge elements into a curved surface in two or three dimensions, the connectors including predominantly a plurality of identical blocks, said blocks comprising a prism having tapered sides.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Ideally the construction or portion thereof includes blocks that are substantially identical. Alternatively the construction, or a portion thereof, includes blocks whose bases are in the form of a frustum, whose base may be any of the following: triangular, square, rectangular or hexagonal.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of connecting one item to another using the connector, pair af adjacent washers, and structural elements adapted to be assembled in a cellular configuration.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> The connector allows an amount of relative movement between said structural elements in two-rotational degrees of freedom.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The second aspect is ideally used to connect V-shaped or chevron-shaped cross sectional modules, however, it will be appreciated that the method of connecting walls of two structural elements one to another, may be used to connect any shaped item or module.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Preferably the connector comprises a bolt-type member, adapted to be inserted into holes in the walls of the elements, having a thread for receiving a nut, and a pair of adjacent washers, one having a substantially concave surface the other having a substantially convex surface. When the convex and concave surfaces of contiguous washers are compressed, they cooperate to allow movement of the joint in two rotational degrees of movement. Spacers may be co-located within the joint. In an alternative arrangement both of the washers may be hemispherical. In a yet further embodiment at least a first and second flat portions adapted to be formed into a prism.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It will be appreciated that, in use, the bolt-type member may be threaded with said washers into appropriate holes in walls of a construction or structure. Similarly a construction may include a wedge between said walls co-located with, and by way of, said bolt-type member.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Ideally holes or apertures are provided in members, so that when members are placed in contact with one another, the holes align in contiguous walls of a structure for penetration by the threaded bolt-type members. Optionally washers are placed between nuts, bolt heads and co-operating convex and concave surfaces and spacers. The bolts may be fitted with corresponding threaded nuts. These may be tightened to clamp the washers, spacers, and contiguous walls of adjacent modules together.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The modular construction is ideally adapted to accommodate movement by way of at least two washers, spacers or other means, which in use are placed adjacent one another, whereby the overall construction is convex in one plane.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> Optionally an oversized aperture may be provided in the plates so that movement of the bolt is permitted therewithin. Alternatively there may be an undersized bolt and this too permits an additional degree of freedom of movement. The bolt type member is preferably a hollow threaded tube. In an enhanced embodiment a wedge is also co-located with the fixing.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">It will be appreciated that by providing holes or apertures in the walls of the elements the passage of fluid, liquid, paste, hardenable filler or any other liquid material is permitted. Any such fluid material may be used as reinforcement, as a thermal or acoustic insulation medium, as a heat transfer medium or for any other purpose.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Where a liquid or semi-solid medium is introduced into contact with a part or fully assembled structure, a vibration device may be arranged to vibrate or jiggle a structure so that energy is transmitted therethrough thereby promoting the passage of the liquid medium through the holes. An advantage is that a pre-stressed concrete structure can be readily fabricated using a lattice or framework of the construction elements and the vibration of the liquid can be used to promote even distribution of the concrete and reduce the risk of voids occurring within the structure.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In this embodiment the invention may be incorporated as a casting to form floors, levels, steps, walkways or similar such structures.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Ideally elements are formed from a single strip by way of bending or flexing along one or more lines of weakness. Alternatively the two flat portions may be hinged, so that modules may be stored or transported flat and assembled in situ. The base of the prism may be triangular, square, rectangular, hexagonal or any closed polygon.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">For the purposes of this description the term prism is intended to encompass both an object whose sides or faces are tapered or diminish in size, as well as one whose sides remain uniform and parallel. Thus, in the former sense the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> term prism includes a 'frustum' (or truncated pyramid); and in the latter the term prism applies to a solid of uniform cross sectional body. It is understood that the base of the frustum can be any appropriate closed polygon.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Means may be provided to permit the two flat portions to be angled and interconnected so as to build a structure from a plurality of modules, for example so as to enable the construction of larger items such as walls, floors, roofs, struts, beams and other such items.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Advantageously bracing and structural units are one and the same unit and comprise a bent sheet material of a generally V-shaped cross-section, ideally the included angle of which is approximately 60°, thereby permitting, in use, the formation of equilateral triangular networks, meshes, structures, shapes or forms.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The invention will now be described by way of examples and with reference to the following Figures in which:</p><heading id="h0004"><u>Brief Reference to the Figures</u></heading><p id="p0026" num="0026"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1a</figref> shows a plan view of six construction modules adjacent one another;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1b</figref> shows plan view of six construction modules connected one to another;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2a</figref> shows an overall view of a construction module of hexagonal form with integral diametrical bracing;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2b</figref> shows a diagrammatical plan view of construction module of hexagonal form with overlapped V-shaped elements, both with integral bracing;<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 2c</figref> is an overall diagrammatic view of a domed structure formed from a plurality of modules of hexagonal form;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 3a</figref> shows a cross-sectional side elevation of a variable angle compressive side connecting joint according to one embodiment of the invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 3b</figref> shows a cross-sectional side elevation of a variable angle compressive side connecting joint including a co-located wedge shaped spacer;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 3c</figref> is an overall diagrammatic view of an open structure, suitable to be assembled in to a modular array;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 3d</figref> is a plan view of a blank which when folded is suitable for use against a surface, as a wedge or prism; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 4</figref> is an overall, diagrammatical view of seven assembled modules, positioned adjacent one another in an array and capable of interconnection one to another, for example by way of rigid rods through aligned holes or apertures.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><u>Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">Referring to the Figures, <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1a</figref> shows a diagrammatical plan view of construction module 100 of a generally hexagonal form having no peripheral bracing. Module 100 comprises six identical steel plates 50a, 50b, 50c, 50d, 50e and 50f bent into chevron form units or components in chevron form. Outer modules 50b, 50c and 50e act as peripheral brace member for 50a, 50d and 50f. Because effectively joint components are the same as bracing components, this reduces the number of types of components required.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1b</figref> is an overall, diagrammatical view of six modules interconnected by way of three rigid or hollow rods 603. Holes or apertures are disposed<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> throughout the assembled structure. An enhanced embodiment of the invention may also include cylindrical steel tubes as well as pipe and nut fixtures (not shown) as described above.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2a and 2b</figref> show further embodiments of the invention wherein a hexagonal modular structural element is formed from components 50 with holes or apertures 54 and 55 formed therein. The structure is made up from 6 equilateral triangular forms. As can be seen from <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2b</figref> the triangular sub-modules and hexagonal module formed therefrom are defined either by interlocking V-shaped plates or equilateral triangular shaped forms. These plates or forms generally have an angle of 60° so as to define an equilateral triangle.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 2c</figref> is an overall diagrammatic view of a domed structure 80 formed from a plurality of modules of hexagonal form, for example of the type shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 4</figref>, but interconnected with angled joints. Adjacent modules are connected, for example by use of variable angle compressive side connecting joint, of the type shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 3b</figref>. This imparts an overall curvature to the assemblage. An advantage of the modular structure is that it is capable of flexing and adopting a shape that conforms to an applied force.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Plates 50 may be formed for example by cutting or punching a thin sheet of metal (not shown), such as sheet steel. The ideal shape of the element is either a: V-shaped form (produced by folding a strip so that two ends subtend an angle of 60°) or an equilateral triangle (produced by folding a strip twice to form a closed loop, so that three angles of 60° are subtended). Apertures or holes 54, 55 (shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 4</figref>) may be pre-formed into the metal sheet (prior to elements being cut) or cut or punched after elements 50 have been cut or formed. Elements 50 are then bent along a fold or suitable line of weakness. At any stage of the process a line of weakness, such as a crease, fold or a scoring line may be formed on the metal sheet.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2a and 2b</figref>, in which structural walls 50 and bracings 50 are of similar form. This is termed 'integral' bracing. The advantage is that<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> only one type of constructional element is needed. This saves time and money. An hexagonal module, of the type shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 4</figref> can be formed using as few as four such elements.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">It is to be understood that bent sheet material for the components does not have to be bent during their manufacture. Components may be moulded or formed as such. Thus the term 'bent' should be construed to include any such element having sheet like portions, which are at an angle to each other and have a common edge. They may even be hinged, sold and transported in this form. It is advantageous to build structures from modules and UK Patent Application <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="GB2335211A"><text>GB-A-2 335 211</text></patcit> describes example of hexagonal construction modules.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The invention described herein may be used as piling and when arranged in hexagonal, cellular form is suitable as part of sea or coastal defence barrier. Alternatively, when assembled as hereinafter described, modules may be used to form an internal strengthening framework for a walkway, building or other construction.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Referring now briefly to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 3a</figref>, there is shown a module with two side walls 402 and 403 such as sheet metal (or walls 50) of connected and compressed together in contiguous alignment by means of an externally threaded pipe 404 and two locking means, which are nuts 405A, 405B. Also included are co-operating dished and hemispherical washers 406A and 406B respectively.
