Many conventional fuel cell stacks utilize hydrogen gas as the proton source and oxygen gas, air, or oxygen-enriched air as the oxidant. Fuel cell stacks typically include many fuels cells that are fluidly and electrically coupled together between common end plates. Each fuel cell includes an anode region and a cathode region that are separated by an electrolytic barrier. In some fuel cells, the electrolytic barrier takes the form of an electrolytic membrane. Hydrogen gas is delivered to the anode region, and oxygen gas is delivered to the cathode region. Protons from the hydrogen gas are drawn through the electrolytic barrier to the cathode region, where water is formed. White protons may pass through the electrolytic barrier, electrons cannot. Instead, the electrons that are liberated from hydrogen gas travel through an external circuit to form an electric current.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Fuel cell systems may be designed to be the primary and/or backup power source for an energy-consuming assembly that includes one or more energy-consuming devices. When implemented as a backup, or auxiliary, power source for an energy-consuming assembly, the fuel cell system is utilized during times when the primary power source is unable or unavailable to satisfy some or all of the energy demand, or applied load, of the energy-consuming assembly.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The electrolytic membranes of some fuel cell systems, such as proton exchange membranes (PEM), or solid polymer fuel cell systems, generally need a proper level of hydration to allow the electrolytic membranes to function efficiently for generation of electrical output. During generation of power by a fuel cell system; water for membrane hydration is generated by electrochemical reaction. However, during periods of inactivity, which are common for fuel cell systems that are utilized as an auxiliary (i.e. backup) power supply, the electrolytic membranes have a tendency to dry out as their period of inactivity increases. As a result, the ability of the fuel cell system to reliably and efficiently provide power when needed may be reduced substantially. One approach to maintaining hydration is to connect the fuel cell system to an artificial, or "dummy," load, such as one or more resistors or light assemblies, and then to operate the fuel cell system periodically to supply power to the artificial load. This load-apptying structure is referred to as an artificial load because it is present primarily to enable the .fuel cell system to generate an electrical output by satisfying the applled load. However, the artificial load increases the size, weight and/or expense of the fuel cell system. Furthermore, other than providing maintenance, powering the artificial load wastes electrical output-and thus fuel-and may generate substantial heat in or near the fuel cell system. Accordingly, new approaches are needed for maintaining the readiness of fuel cell systems serving as backup power sources.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2005004269A"><text>WO 2005/004269</text></patcit> is directed to a method of performing maintenance hydration of fuel cell systems serving as primary power sources.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0004"><u>Summary of the Disclosure</u></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present disclosure is directed generally to fuel cell systems, and more particularly to fuel cell systems that perform maintenance hydration by supplying power to satisfy at least part of an applied load from an energy-consuming assembly while a primary power source is in electrical communication with and available to supply power to the energy-consuming assembly to satisfy the portion of the applied load being satisfied by the fuel cell system. In some embodiments, a fuel cell system may determine a start time, or start condition, for maintenance of the fuel cell system. The fuel cell system then may be activated from an inactive condition according to the start time, or start condition, by initiating delivery of at least fuel, and optionally oxidant, to a fuel cell stack of the system. Power then may be supplied from the activated fuel cell system at an output voltage that is higher than a voltage at which power from the primary power source is being supplied, such that the applied load is satisfied, at least in part, by the power from the fuel cell system instead of the power from the primary power source. Upon operation of the fuel cell system for a period sufficient to rehydrate the fuel cell stack, operation of the fuel cell system may be discontinued, with the primary power source resuming supplying power to satisfy the applied load from the energy-consuming assembly.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0005"><u>Brief Description of the Drawings</u></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a schematic view of selected portions of an illustrative power delivery network supplying power from a primary power source to satisfy an applied load of an energy-consuming assembly while a fuel cell system for backup power in the network is inactive, in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2A</figref> is a schematic view of the illustrative power delivery network of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> during maintenance hydration of the fuel cell system, with the fuel cell system supplying power at a voltage sufficient to satisfy at feast a portion of the applied load of the energy-consuming assembly while the primary power source is available to supply power to satisfy the portion of the applied load being supplied by the fuel cell system, in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2B</figref> is a schematic view of the illustrative power delivery network of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> during standard operation of the fuel cell system as a backup power source, with the fuel cell system supplying power to satisfy at least a portion of the applied load of the energy-consuming assembly while the primary power source is not available or is supplying insufficient power to satisfy the entire applied load, in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is another schematic view of the illustrative power delivery network of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> showing additional illustrative components, aspects, and features that may be present in the power delivery network, in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> is a schematic view of selected aspects of an illustrative fuel cell, as may be used in fuel cell stacks according to the present disclosure.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref> is a flowchart for an illustrative method of performing maintenance hydration of a fuel cell system in the power delivery network of <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">Figs. 1-3</figref>, in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref> is a fragmentary flowchart for selected portions of the illustrative method of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>, including an illustrative approach to regulating voltage in the method, in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref> is a fragmentary flowchart for selected portions of the illustrative method of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>, including an illustrative approach to monitoring stability of the power supplied from the fuel cell system, in accordance with aspects of present disclosure.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 8</figref> is a fragmentary flowchart for selected portions of the illustrative method of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>, including an illustrative approach for testing an applied load prior to initiating fuel delivery, in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 9</figref> is a fragmentary flowchart for selected portions of the illustrative method of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>, including an illustrative approach to regulating the voltage of the fuel cell system according to a measured :voltage of the primary power source, in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><heading id="h0006"><u>Detailed Description and Best Mode of the Disclosure</u></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present disclosure is directed to fuel cell systems that perform maintenance hydration by supplying power to satisfy at least part of an applied load of an energy-consuming assembly. The fuel cell system may supply power while a primary power source is in electrical communication with and available for satisfying some or all of the energy needs of the energy-consuming assembly. In particular, the fuel cell system may displace at least a portion of primary power supplied from a primary power source by supplying power to the energy-consuming assembly at a higher voltage than the voltage at which the primary power is being supplied to the energy-consuming assembly. Accordingly, the fuel cell system may be supplying power, which also may be referred to herein as an electrical output, to satisfy at least a portion of an applied load from an energy-consuming assembly while a primary power source, which is nominally configured to satisfy this applied load, is available to satisfy the portion of the applied load being satisfied by the fuel .cell system during the maintenance hydration period.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">During this maintenance hydration period, the fuel cell system may generate water for maintenance hydration for one or more fuel cell stacks in the fuel cell system as a byproduct of supplying power to the energy-consuming assembly. In some examples, the higher voltage of the fuel cell system may be selected (1) based on an expected or known (e.g., measured) voltage of the primary power source, and/or (2) by increasing the voltage of the fuel cell system until the fuel cell system is generating sufficient electrical output for maintenance hydration to be performed. Fuel cell systems with maintenance hydration according to the present disclosure may (but are not required to) offer substantial advantages over other approaches to maintenance hydration, such as more efficient use of fuel, less generation of heat locally, and/or a smaller increase, if any, in the size/weight of the fuel cell systems, among others.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1, 2A, and 2B</figref> show an illustrative power delivery network 20 in which a fuel cell system 22 is inactive (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>), performing maintenance hydration (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2A</figref>), or providing backup power (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2B</figref>). Power delivery network 20 may include a primary power source 24 in electrical communication, as indicated at 26, with an energy-consuming assembly 28, which applies a load 30 (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>). Primary power source 24 may supply primary power 32 to energy-consuming<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> assembly 28 at a voltage 34 (V) to satisfy the applied load, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 and 2A</figref>. Fuel cell system 22 also may be in (and/or switchable into) electrical communication with energy-consuming assembly 28, as indicated at 36.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Fuel cell system 22 may serve as an auxiliary power source 38, which also may be termed a backup power source, for the power delivery network. The fuel cell system thus may not be needed for power generation while the primary power source is operating normally. The fuel cell system thus may generate no power, as indicated at 40 and by a dashed line of electrical communication, if maintenance is not being performed and the primary power source is available and able to satisfy the entire applied load. Accordingly, due to inactivity of the fuel cell system over time, a fuel cell stack 42 of fuel cell system 22 may become dehydrated, schematically indicated at 44 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, as water is lost through evaporation from fuel cells 46 of the fuel cell stack without being replenished by water formed during power generation. Alternatively, or in addition, inactivity of the fuel cell system may reduce efficiency by one or more other mechanisms such as catalytic oxidation and/or poisoning of the fuel cell stack, in any case, over time, the health of the fuel cell system may decline and the system may suffer a loss of performance if the system is not operated periodically.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2A</figref> shows power delivery network 20 during maintenance operation of fuel cell system 22, particularly maintenance hydration of fuel cell stack 42 of the system. Fuel cell system 22 may supply fuel cell power, or electrical output, 48, by generating an electric current at a voltage 50 (V+) sufficient to satisfy at least a portion of load 30 of energy-consuming assembly 28. In particular, the fuel cell system may supply fuel cell, power 48 to the energy-consuming assembly at a higher voltage 50 (V+) then the voltage 34 (V) at which primary power 32. is being supplied to the energy-consuming assembly, such that the fuel cell power supersedes at least a portion of the primary power being supplied to the energy-consuming assembly. Stated differently, the higher voltage of the fuel cell power may cause the energy-consuming assembly to consume fuel cell power in place of or in preference to at least a portion, at least most, and/or at least substantially all of the primary power that was being consumed by the energy-consuming assembly before fuel cell maintenance was initiated and while the primary power source is otherwise available to satisfy this portion of the applied load.

As used herein, the fuel cell system may be referred to as being inactive, or deactivated when it is in any configuration that provides no delivery of fuel 112 and/or oxidant 116 to the fuel cell stack 42. Accordingly, with the fuel cell system in the inactive configuration, the control system 150 may be active but there may be no, or no substantial, generation of electrical output (and/or electrical potential) by the fuel cell stack and no, or no significant, formation of water from reaction of the fuel and the oxidant.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Controller 152 may be adapted to control operation of reactant delivery system 110, and/or the flow of fuel and/or oxidant through conduit assembly 128, based at least in part on one or more fuel cell system characteristics and/or ambient characteristics measured by sensor(s) 80. The characteristics may relate to a condition of the fuel cell system itself, as measured by one or more<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> illustrative sensors 96, 98 associated with fuel cell stack 42, and/or may relate to the environment outside, but generally near, the fuel cell system, as represented by illustrative ambient sensors 94, 100. Illustrative characteristics may correspond to a fuel cell system temperature, ambient temperature, a hydration level of the fuel cell stack, ambient humidity, and/or the like.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The controller's operations, such as the command signals generated thereby, may be provided by or otherwise correspond to an algorithm for determining when a fuel cell system should be operated for maintenance hydration, and/or for how long the fuel cell system should be operated for maintenance hydration. The algorithm may consider any suitable combination of ambient temperature, system temperature, sensed hydration level of a fuel cell or fuel cell stack, ambient humidity, length of time the fuel cell system has been inactive (since the most recent maintenance hydration and/or since generation of electrical output), and/or the like. In some embodiments, hydration of the fuel cell system may be performed according to a preset value, such as a preset time interval between maintenance hydration treatments and/or since a fuel cell (or fuel cell stack or fuel cell system) was last in a power-generating configuration. However, the preset time interval may (but is not required to) be adjusted based on other measured conditions and/or preset values, such as average ambient temperature, average ambient humidity, sensed hydration level of the fuel cell stack, a preset threshold temperature for performing a hydration treatment; a preset threshold hydration level for performing a hydration treatment, and/or the like.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Fuel cell system 22 may include any other suitable components. For example, fuel cell system 22 also may, but is not required to, include a thermal management system. The thermal management system may be adapted to regulate the temperature of any suitable portion of fuel cell system 22, for example, maintaining the fuel cell stack within a predetermined, or selected, operating temperature range, such as below a maximum threshold temperature, and/or above a minimum threshold temperature. The thermal management system thus may include a cooling mechanism and/or a heating mechanism. For example, the thermal management system may utilize a fluid that is propelled around a flow circuit by a pump. The fluid may flow through and/or around fuel cell stack 42, to provide cooling and/or heating of the fuel cell stack. The flow<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> circuit may (but is not required to) include a thermostatic valve that operates to direct the fluid into the proximity of the cooling/heating mechanism, for heat transfer, or to divert the fluid away from the cooling/heating mechanism via a detour, according to the temperature of the fuel cell stack and/or the fluid. Any suitable cooling mechanism and/or heating mechanism may be used in the fuel cell system. For example, the cooling mechanism may include a radiator and at least one fan. In other embodiments, the cooling mechanism may include a refrigerating compressor, a Peltier device, a fan or blower, etc. Illustrative heating mechanisms may include a resistive heater, a combustion heater (e.g., a gas heater), an infrared lamp, a Peltier device, or the like. The temperature of the thermal control system may be measured by a temperature sensor. An illustrative, non-exclusive example of suitable thermal management systems are disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US20070042247A"><text>U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0042247</text></patcit>, the complete disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Additional illustrative, non-exclusive examples of auxiliary fuel cell systems, and components and configurations therefor, are disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="US20040247961A"><text>U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0247961</text></patcit>, the complete disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Fuel cell system 22 may include fuel cell stack 42 that includes at least one fuel cell 46, and typically, a plurality of fuel cells 46. The fuel cells may be electrically connected to one another, such as in a series, and mechanically connected to provide fluid communication between the fuel cells. Although not required by all embodiments, the fuel cells may be arranged face-to-face with one another, and in one stack or two or more adjacent stacks, or, for example, in more complex geometrical arrangements.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The fuel cell stacks of the present disclosure may utilize any suitable type of fuel cell, including but not limited to fuel cells that receive hydrogen gas and oxygen gas as proton sources and oxidants. An illustrative, non-exclusive example of such a fuel cell is a proton exchange membrane (PEM), or solid polymer, fuel cell, although the maintenance hydration systems and methods of the present disclosure may be used with other types of fuel cells in which maintaining the hydration level of the fuel cell after periods of inactivity is desirable. For the purpose of illustration, an exemplary fuel cell 46 in the form of a proton exchange member (PEM) fuel cell is schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --></p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Each fuel cell 46 may be structured to generate an electrical potential using discrete regions separated by a divider, or electrolytic barrier, 180 (which also may be referred to as an electron barrier). For example, the fuel cell may include an anode region 182 (the anode regions are collectively indicated schematically by "-") and a cathode region 184 (the cathode regions are collectively indicated schematically by "+"), with respective negative and positive electrical biases or charges during fuel cell operation. Electrolytic barrier 180 may act to divide the fuel cell 46 such that the fuel and the oxidant do not freely mix with one another, while permitting selective movement of positive charge through the barrier (and thus acting as an electron barrier). The barrier restricts contact, particularly substantial contact of the fuel and oxidant, meaning that the fuel and the oxidant remain (mostly) separated from each other. However, while not necessarily desired or required by all embodiments, in some embodiments the electrolytic barrier may permit a minor amount of leakage of the fuel and/or oxidant across the barrier white still serving as a barrier. The electrolytic barrier may be structured as a sheet- or membrane-supported electrolyte, for example, a proton exchange membrane 180 that permits passage of protons while blocking passage or flow of electrons, and as such may also be described as an ion exchange membrane.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Proton exchange membrane fuel cells typically utilize a membrane-electrode assembly 186 consisting of an ion exchange, or electrolytic, membrane 180 located between an anode region 182 and a cathode region 184. Each region 182 and 184 includes an electrode 188, namely, an anode 190 and a cathode 192, respectively. Each region 182 and 184 also includes a support 194, such as a supporting plate 196. Support 194 may form a portion of a bipolar plate assembly. The supporting plates 196 of fuel cell 46 may carry, or conduct, the relative voltage potential produced by the fuel cell.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In operation, hydrogen gas 114 from supply 120 is delivered to the anode region, and air (and/or oxygen) 118 from supply 122 is delivered to the cathode region. Hydrogen gas and oxygen gas may be delivered to the respective regions of the fuel cell via any suitable mechanism from respective supplies 120 and 122.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Hydrogen gas and oxygen gas typically react with one another via an oxidation-reduction reaction. Although electrolytic membrane 180 restricts the passage of a hydrogen molecule (a fuel molecule), it will permit a hydrogen ion<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> (proton) to pass through it, largely due to the ionic conductivity of the membrane. The free energy of the oxidation-reduction reaction drives the proton from the hydrogen gas through the barrier. As membrane 180 also tends not to be electrically conductive, an external circuit 198 is the lowest energy path for the remaining electron. In cathode region 184, electrons from the external circuit and protons from the membrane combine with oxygen to produce water and heat.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Also shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> are an anode purge, or exhaust, stream 200, which may contain hydrogen gas, and a cathode air exhaust stream, or cathode purge stream, 202, which is typically at least partially, if not substantially, depleted of oxygen gas. Anode purge stream 200 may also include other components, such as nitrogen gas, water, and other gases that are present in the hydrogen gas or other fuel stream that is delivered to the anode region. Cathode purge stream 202 will typically also include water. Fuel cell stack 42 may include a common hydrogen (or other reactant/fuel) feed, air intake, and stack purge and exhaust streams; and accordingly may include suitable fluid conduits to deliver the associated streams to, and collect the streams from, the individual fuel cells. Simitarty, any suitable mechanism may be used for selectively purging the regions. It is also within the scope of the present disclosure that the hydrogen gas stream that is delivered to the anode region as a fuel stream may be (but is not required to be) recycled (via any suitable mechanism and/or via a suitable recycle conduit from the anode region) to reduce the amount of hydrogen gas that is wasted or otherwise exhausted in anode purge stream 200. As an illustrative, non-exclusive example, the hydrogen gas in the anode region may be recycled for redelivery to the anode region via a recycle pump and an associated recycle conduit. In such an embodiment, the recycle pump may draw hydrogen gas from the anode region of a fuel cell (or fuel cell stack) and redeliver the recycled hydrogen gas via the recycle conduit to the anode region of the:fuel cell (and/or a different fuel cell or fuel cell stack).</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In practice, fuel cell stack 42 may include a plurality of fuel cells 46 with bipolar plate assemblies or other suitable supports separating adjacent membrane-electrode assemblies. The supports may permit the free electrons to pass from the anode region of a first cell to the cathode region of the adjacent cell via the bipolar plate assembly, thereby establishing an electrical potential through the stack. This electrical potential may create a net flow of electrons that<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> produces an electric current, which may be used to satisfy an applied load, such as from an energy-consuming device(s) 64.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref> is a flowchart 220 representing an illustrative, non-exclusive example of a method 222 of performing maintenance hydration of a fuel cell system 22 serving as a backup (or auxiliary) power source in a power delivery network 20. Method 222 may include any suitable combination of the method steps presented here and in <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005">Figs. 6-9</figref> and the method steps may be performed in any suitable order. Each method step presented and/or described in the present disclosure may be included in or omitted from the method, as appropriate. If included, each method step may be performed once, twice, or more times. In addition, in some embodiments, one or more of the method steps may be performed conditionally, that is, only if one or more conditions are met by system 22, power delivery network 20, and/or the ambient environment. Furthermore, any suitable portion or all of each method 222 described herein may be performed automatically, for example, controlled by a control system 150 and/or controller(s) 152 of system 22 and/or power delivery network 20, may be controlled or performed mechanically, or may be controlled manually by a person.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The method may be performed under control of a program run by a controller. Accordingly, the method may be embodied in computer program code carrying instructions and stored on tangible computer-readable storage media (e.g., hard drives, CD-ROMs, floppy disks, etc.). In particular, when the computer program code is loaded and executed by the controller, the controller becomes an apparatus for practicing the method in conjunction with other portions of a power delivery network. In some embodiments, the computer program code may be received from another source via data transmission, such as fiber optics, electromagnetic radiation, electrical conductors (e.g., wires, cables, etc.), or the like.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Method 222 may include a step of determining a start time for performing maintenance hydration, as indicated at 224. Determining a start time, as used herein, may include selecting a start time, establishing a start time, identifying a start time, and/or starting maintenance hydration. The start time may be determined by any suitable criteria. For example, the start time may be determined based, at least in part, on when the fuel cell system was last activated by fuel delivery, last operated to provide backup power, and/or last<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> operated to perform maintenance hydration. Accordingly, the start time may be determined, for example, based, at least in part, on a time interval measured by timer 168 under the direction of controller 152. Alternatively, or in addition, the start time may be determined based, at least in part, on one or more signals received from at least one sensor 80. The start time thus may be based, at least in part, on a threshold level of dehydration measured by a hydration sensor of fuel cell stack 42, an electrical characteristic of the primary power source, an electrical characteristic of the applied load, an ambient temperature, an ambient humidity, and/or the like.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Method 222 also may include a step of initiating delivery of at least fuel to the fuel cell stack, as indicated at 226. The step of initiating delivery may involve initiating delivery of any suitable reactants to the fuel cell stack, for example, delivery of fuel and oxidant or delivery of fuel only, such as if an oxidant is already available to the fuel cell stack. In any case, the step of initiating delivery may be described as activating the fuel cell stack and/or fuel cell system for power generation. "Activating" or "activation," as used herein, means providing the fuel cell stack 42 with a complete set of reactants (fuel and oxidant) for electrochemical reaction in the fuel cell stack, whether or not a load is drawing power from the fuel cell stack. The step of initiating delivery thus may activate the fuel cell stack to place the fuel cell stack in an active configuration from an inactive configuration, in which the fuel cell stack was not being supplied with at least one reactant and thus was not generating power. Initiating delivery of fuel may result in a stream of fuel that is substantially constant over time or that varies (e.g., an increasing and/or decreasing volume of fuel being delivered per unit time). Furthermore, the step of initiating delivery may include operating the reactant delivery system, such as operating a flow-management device (e.g., opening a valve(s)) and/or processing fuel from a feedstock, among others.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">The step of initiating delivery of fuel and/or reactants may be performed according to the start time determined at 224 in method 222. The term "according to the start time," as used herein, generally includes "based on the start time" or "in correspondence with the start time." Accordingly, the step of initiating delivery may, for example, start exactly or nearly exactly at the start time or after passage of a relatively short delay after the start time (such as within about one second, one minute, or one hour of the start time). The delay may be caused by one or<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> more procedures conducted by method 222 and/or network 20 before fuel delivery is initiated. Illustrative procedures may include testing aspects of the network 20 (e.g., testing whether the load is sufficient, testing the stability of the load, measuring fuel cell stack hydration, measuring an electrical characteristic of the primary power source, etc.) and/or establishing generation of a fuel from a feedstock or release of fuel from a stored form, among others.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Determination of a start time may involve selecting a start time in the future. Accordingly, method 222 optionally may include a step of monitoring elapsed time, as indicated generally at 228, until the start time has been reached. For example, method 222 may include a conditional decision point that compares the elapsed time with the target start time, as indicated at 230, to determine whether or not the start time has been reached. If the start time has not been reached, the method may include waiting, as indicated at 232, for an additional time period and then performing the comparison again. The resulting "wait and compare" loop may be repeated until the start time is reached. If the start time has been reached, method 222 may exit the loop and proceed to the next step of performing maintenance hydration, such as initiation of fuel delivery 226. Although referred to in the context of initiating fuel delivery, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that this step may include initiating oxidant, such as air, delivery. In some embodiments, determination of a start time may include selecting the present time as the start time. For example, one or more sensors may be used, directly or indirectly (e.g., via a controller), to determine the start time and thus may trigger performance (or attempted performance) of maintenance hydration upon measurement of a threshold value. Accordingly, method 222 may proceed directly to the next step of the method, such as step 226, without waiting after determination of the start time.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Method 222 also may include regulating a voltage of the fuel cell system, as indicated at 234, which may be performed automatically and/or manually. Regulating the voltage generally includes any manipulation or adjustment of the output voltage of fuel cell system 22 to achieve an output voltage at which an applied load of the energy-consuming assembly is at least partially satisfied by fuel cell power in place of available primary power. Accordingly, regulating the voltage may include setting or adjusting the output voltage of the fuel cell system (1) to a predefined setpoint that is known or expected to be higher than the<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> voltage of the primary power source, (2) according to, or responsive to, a measured voltage (or other measured electrical characteristic) of the primary power source, and/or (3) to progressively higher levels until the fuel cell system is generating sufficient power (and/or until a threshold voltage is reached and/or exceeded).</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">The step of regulating voltage 234, if not performed successfully, may be followed, as indicated with a dashed line 236, by a step of stopping fuel delivery, as indicated at 238. Stated differently, the fuel cell stack may be deactivated by terminating fuel (and/or oxidant) delivery if a sufficient output voltage cannot be achieved at the present time. A new or next start time also may be determined, as indicated at 224, before, during, and/or after the step of stopping fuel delivery. The new or next start time may correspond to the next scheduled periodic maintenance (i.e., by canceling rather than postponing the current maintenance treatment) or may be much sooner than the next periodic maintenance, such as in one hour or less or one day or less.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Regulation of the voltage 234, if performed successfully, may lead to a step of supplying power, as indicated at 240, from fuel cell system 22 to the energy-consuming assembly 28 to satisfy at least a portion, if not all, of the applied load from the energy-consuming assembly while the primary power source 24 is generating an electrical output and available to satisfy the portion (or all) of the applied load being satisfied by the electrical output of the fuel cell stack of fuel cell system 22. The step of supplying power generally includes generating water to increase hydration of the fuel cell stack 42. In addition, the step of supplying power may include generating fuel cell power at any suitable percentage of the full capacity tor power generation by the fuel cell stack 42, such as at least 25%, at least 50%, at least 75%, or more of full capacity.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The step of supplying power may be performed for any suitable hydration interval to achieve a maintenance hydration treatment after a period of fuel cell inactivity. As used herein, the term "hydration interval" may refer to a period during which water is generated in the fuel cell stack. As discussed, the hydration interval may correspond to a period in which the fuel cell stack is generating power that displaces at least a portion of available primary power. The term "maintenance hydration treatment," as used herein, may refer to supplying power for a hydration interval sufficient to substantially increase hydration of the fuel cell<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> stack, such as increasing the amount of hydration by at least 10%, 25%, or 50%, among others. The maintenance hydration treatment may be performed in a predetermined fashion, such as for a predetermined period of time and/or for a predetermined amount of supplied power, hydration, and/or water generation, among others.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">As used herein, "period of inactivity" refers to a period in which the fuel cell stack has not been used to generate an electrical output for more than at least a threshold period of time, such as at least one day, one week, two weeks, one month, or more, and/or for a period sufficient to reduce hydration of the fuel cell stack substantially. "Period of inactivity" thus does not encompass a momentary interruption in the fuel cell stack being in a power-generating configuration, such as in which the hydration state of the fuel cell stack has not appreciably deteriorated from when the fuel cell stacks was in a power-generating configuration.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Method 222 may include a decision process 242 that determines whether or not the maintenance hydration treatment is complete. For example, decision process 242 may determine if fuel cell power has been supplied for a predetermined period of time and/or for a predetermined amount of supplied power, hydration, and/or water generation, among others. If the treatment is not complete, as indicated at 244, the step of supplying power may be continued. If the treatment is complete, as indicated at 246, at least fuel delivery may be stopped, as indicated at 238, and another start time may be determined, as indicated at 224.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref> is a fragmentary flowchart 260 presenting selected portions of method 222 and showing an illustrative approach to regulating voltage, as indicated at 234, in method 222. The approach presented here may be performed whether or not the voltage of the primary power source is known, but may be particularly suitable when this voltage is unknown. At a suitable timepoint after initiation of fuel delivery, as indicated at 226, a sensor 80 may measure an electrical characteristic of the fuel cell system corresponding to auxiliary power (fuel cell power), as indicated at 262. The auxiliary power may be measured using any suitable sensed electrical characteristic.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">A decision process 264 then may determine whether or not the measured fuel cell power is sufficient for maintenance hydration. If sufficient (e.g., if at<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> and/or above a threshold power value), as indicated at 266, the method may proceed to supplying power, as indicated at 240, to the energy-consuming assembly 28. If not sufficient (e.g., if below the threshold power value), as indicated at 268, method 222 may proceed to a second decision process 270 that determines whether or not the output voltage of the fuel cell stack has reached and/or exceeded a threshold voltage. If the threshold voltage has been reached and/or exceeded, as indicated at 272, method 222 may proceed to stopping fuel delivery, as indicated at 238, and also may proceed, as indicated at 274, to determining another start time (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>). If the threshold voltage has not been reached and/or exceeded, as indicated at 276, method 222 may proceed to a step of increasing the output voltage; as indicated at 278, from the fuel cell stack 42. The fuel cell power then may be measured (again), as indicated at 262. The step of increasing the voltage may be performed incrementally with each cycle through the voltage regulation loop. The voltage may be increased by the same increment in each cycle, such as 0.1-1.0 volt per cycle, or about 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 volt per cycle, among others. Alternatively, the size of the increase may vary within the scope of the present disclosure. This method, or process, may be referred to as incrementally increasing the voltage of the electrical output of the fuel cell stack until either a sufficient portion of the electrical output of the primary source is displaced (i.e., a sufficient portion of the applied load is now being satisfied by the fuel cell system instead of the primary power source despite the primary power source generating an electrical output) or until a threshold fuel cell voltage is reached or exceeded.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref> is a fragmentary flowchart 280 presenting selected portions of method 222 and showing an illustrative approach to monitoring stability of the power supplied from the fuel cell system. The stability of the fuel cell power may be monitored, as indicated at 282, as primary power is being supplied, as indicated at 240, to energy-consuming assembly 28. Monitoring the fuel cell power may include a step of measuring the supplied fuel cell power, as indicated at 284. The step of measuring may be performed multiple times to provide a measure of fuel cell power over time. Method 222 then may proceed to a decision process 286 that determines whether or not the fuel cell power is sufficiently stable for performance of maintenance hydration. For example, decision process 286 may determine whether or not fuel cell power varies by more than a<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> threshold amount. In any case, if decision process 286 determines that the fuel cell power is sufficiently stable, as indicated at 288, the step of supplying fuel cell power, as indicated at 240, may be continued. In contrast, if decision process 286 determines that the fuel cell power is not sufficiently stable, as indicated at 290, the step of supplying power may be stopped by performing the step of stopping fuel delivery, as indicated at 238. Method 222 optionally may proceed, as indicated at 274, to determining another start time (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>) to attempt maintenance hydration again. For example, maintenance hydration (e.g., regulating voltage and supplying power) may be attempted again after waiting a predetermined time period. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of such time periods include 1 week or less, 3 days or less, 1 day or less, 12 hours or less, 6 hours or less, 2 hours or less, 1 hour or less, or about 1, -5, 10, 30, or 60 minutes, among others.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 8</figref> is a fragmentary flowchart 300 presenting selected portions of illustrative method 222 and showing an illustrative approach for testing an applied load prior to initiating fuel delivery. The applied load may be tested, as indicated at 302, according to the start time. The step of testing the applied load may include a step of measuring the applied load, as indicated at 304. Method 222 then may proceed to a decision process 306 that determines whether or not the measured load is sufficient for performing maintenance hydration with the fuel cell system. If the load is not sufficient, as indicated at 308, method 222 may proceed to determination of another start time, as indicated at 224, such as another start time after passage of a predetermined time interval. If the load is sufficient, as indicated at 310, method 222 may proceed to the step of initiating fuel delivery, as indicated at 226. In some embodiments, the step of testing the applied load, as indicated at 302, may be performed after the step of initiating fuel delivery, as indicated at 226. Accordingly, if fuel delivery has been initiated before testing the applied load, fuel delivery may be stopped if the applied load is determined to be insufficient for maintenance hydration.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 9</figref> is a fragmentary flowchart 320 for selected portions of illustrative method 222 and shows an illustrative approach to regulating the voltage of the fuel cell system. Method 222 may include a step of measuring a primary voltage, as indicated at 312. The "primary voltage," as used herein, means the voltage at which the primary power source is supplying primary power to the energy-consuming<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> assembly. The step of measuring a primary voltage may be performed by measuring any suitable electrical characteristic of the primary power source related to its primary voltage. Measurement of primary voltage may be performed at any suitable time, such as before or after the step of initiating fuel delivery, as indicated at 226. The step of regulating voltage of the fuel cell system, as indicated at 234, then may be performed according to the measured primary voltage. For example, the output voltage of the fuel cell stack may be adjusted to a level that is above the measured primary voltage, such as a predetermined amount above the measured primary voltage (e.g., at least 0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2 volts, among others, above the primary voltage). In some embodiments, the primary voltage may be measured repeatedly during maintenance hydration to enable adjustment of the output voltage of the fuel cell stack, if needed, due to variation in the measured primary voltage.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">In some embodiments, the present disclosure may be described as being directed to a storage medium encoded with a machine readable computer program code, the code including instructions for causing a controller to implement a method of performing maintenance hydration of a fuel cell system serving as an auxiliary power source for an energy-consuming assembly that is disposed in electrical communication with a primary power source.
