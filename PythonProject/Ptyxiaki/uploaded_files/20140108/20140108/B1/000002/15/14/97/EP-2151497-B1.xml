In particular, the invention concerns chimeric molecules able to mask the splice junctions of mutated exons thus inducing their skipping from the mature mRNA. The resulting transcript will then produce a shorter but functional dystrophin protein. these molecules can be used in the gene therapy of many forms of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">DMD is an X-linked recessive disorder which affects 1 in every 3500 males. It is characterized by the absence of the cytoskeletal dystrophin (427 KDa protein) that in turn produces a severe and progressive muscle deterioration. Most DMD mutations consist of deletions and point mutations in the 2.5 Mb dystrophin gene which introduce stop codons and consequently premature translation termination. In a milder form of myopathy, Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD), deletions inside the gene produce in-frame mRNAs and consequently shorter but semi-functional dystrophin proteins (1). Since a third of DMD cases result from de novo mutation (2,3), the disease can never be eradicated through genetic screening and counseling. The need to develop treatment strategies for this disorder is evident. One involves the transplantation of normal myoblasts into the muscle tissues lacking this protein (4,5), while others try to restore the correct expression of dystrophin through a gene therapy approach that delivers full-length or mini cDNA copies of dystrophin into cells having the mutated gene (6-8). Although this approach is very promising, several problems still remain to be solved, such as size capacity and transducing activity of the vector and immune response to the "therapeutic" gene (9).<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Another approach of gene therapy is based on the fact that internal in-frame deletions in the protein produce only mild myopathic symptoms; therefore, it should be possible, by preventing the inclusion of specific mutated exon(s) in the mature dystrophin mRNA, to restore a partially corrected phenotype. In this respect, it is interesting to note that restoration of dystrophin levels as low as 30% are sufficient for substantial therapeutic benefit (10).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Exon-specific skipping has been accomplished by the extracellular delivery of synthetic 2'-O-methyl antisense oligonucleotides raised against specific splicing junctions (11-13) or exonic enhancers (10). The interaction of the antisense RNA with the corresponding target sequence should mask the utilization of specific splice sites or prevent the binding of enhancer factors during the splicing reaction and determine the skipping of the neighboring mutated exon(s) so as to produce an in-frame dystrophin mRNA, the ultimate effect being the production of a shorter but functional dystrophin protein. A significant drawback to the synthetic oligonucleotide approach is that it would require periodic administrations.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">To circumvent this problem, the authors of the invention have developed vectors able to express <i>in vivo</i>, in a stable and continuous fashion, large amounts of chimeric RNAs containing antisense sequences. This strategy was tested on the human deletion of exons 48-50, but experts could apply it also to other exons of the dystrophin gene. In this case, a premature termination codon is produced in exon 51; if skipping of this exon is obtained, the result would be an in-frame mRNA.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The antisense sequences cloned in snRNA vectors can be designed to pair with any region of a cellular transcript. In principle, if there are sequences that have to be recognized by specific cellular machineries their masking by antisense RNAs should interfere with specific processes. Since snRNAs are localized in the nucleus, they can affect only nuclear processes.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Antisense RNAs can affect splicing by interacting with two types of sequences:<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> -->
<ol><li>a) <i>splice sites</i>. Antisense RNAs against splice sites can induce, during splicing, the skipping of a specific exon.</li><li>b) <i>splicing enhancers</i>. Many human exons, of large size or with relatively weak flanking splice sites, contain sequences that promote their utilization, the so called exonic splicing enhancer (ESEs). Such sequences are recognized by serine/arginine (SR)-rich proteins that promote exon utilization in tissues where they are expressed. Antisense RNAs that obscure such splicing enhancers can be designed so that the exon is skipped and not included in the mature mRNA. With respect to the targeting of 3' and 5' splice site sequences that can cause less predictable skipping of additional adjacent exons, the knock out of exonic enhancers produces a very specific and more reproducible effect only on the flanking introns.</li></ol></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Targeting of splice sites or exonic enhancers can be applied in all those cases where the skipping of a specific mutated exon can restore the functionality of the mRNA (such as in the case of dystrophin mutations). Since more than half of human genes encode transcripts that undergo alternative splicing, general methods to control the expression of particular alternatively spliced isoforms from specific genes would be useful in a wide variety of applications. Antisense RNAs against specific splicing junctions can control the type of alternative spliced mRNA produced and of the corresponding protein.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Antisense RNAs can be also applied to interfere with the following processes:
<ol><li>1) 3'end formation of mRNAs. This process requires a complex protein apparatus that by recognizing specific conserved sequences present in the 3' UTR determines cleavage of the nascent transcript and addition of the polyA tail. Masking the sequences recognized by the cleavage/polyadenylation components or the cleavage site should prevent 3' end formation thus producing read-through to the downstream sequences. Read-through RNAs are rapidly driven to the degradative pathway since they lack the polyA tail. The antisense strategy in this case<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> should drastically decrease the abundance of a specific mRNA. This strategy is also useful in those cases where alternative cleavage/polyadenylation sites are present on the same gene. Skipping of one of the alternative sites can control the type of transcript produced.</li><li>2) Editing</li></ol></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">RNA editing is a post-transcriptional nuclear process consisting in the site-specific modification of the mRNA. Specific factors, which interact with the RNA, are responsible for such modifications. Also in this case masking of the substrate should prevent editing to occur thus altering the coding capacity of the mRNA.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In order to obtain effective "therapeutic" RNA molecules <i>in vivo</i>, several important parameters were considered. Not only must the genes for these RNAs be cloned under efficient promoters producing high levels of expression but, in addition, the RNA context in which the therapeutic RNA is embedded should provide stability and specific subcellular localization. The last point is a crucial one since in the cell RNAs are sorted to specific cellular locations (nucleus, nucleolus, cytoplasm, free and polysome-bound RNPs, etc.) and efficient activity of the therapeutic molecule can be obtained only if co-localization with the target is ensured (15,33,34). Small cellular RNAs have been advantageously used as vectors since they are normally transcribed from strong promoters (polII or polIII) and because they allow the delivery of the chimeric constructs into specific cellular compartments (15,26,30,32,33).</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The authors have utilized different small nuclear RNAs and their corresponding genes in order to express in the nucleus chimeric molecules carrying antisense sequences complementary to exon 51 splice junctions and they have tested their activity in myoblasts from DMD patients with a deletion of exons 48-50. Splice junction is a region across the splice site and comprises the sequences upstream and downstream from the site. The results obtained showed that the combination of antisense molecules against the 5' and 3' splice junctions induced efficient skipping of exon 51 and partial rescue of dystrophin synthesis. The choice<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> of the carrier RNAs was dictated by the possibility of co-localizing the antisense molecules with their target RNA. Two of the selected RNAs, U1 and U2, are known to participate in the splicing reaction, thus increasing the probability that the antisense molecule is delivered to the compartment where the dystrophin pre-mRNA is localized. In this technique the nucleoplasmic U7 snRNA was previously utilized to express antisense molecules <i>in vivo</i> and to direct exon skipping of a mutant beta-globin gene (32). However, the U7 snRNA gene promoter is known to be less active (17,35,36). The authors of the invention have selected U1 and U2 RNAs instead, because they direct antisense molecules specifically and selectively in the splicing compartment, thus improving co-localization with the target molecule. In addition, the vectors of the invention hit both the 5' and 3' splicing sites. Lastly, the globin gene represents a system of expression and synthesis that differs from that of dystrophin.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Analysis of cell lines derived from a dystrophic patient, immortalized with a SV40 large T, and stably transduced with retroviral vectors carrying the different constructs, indicates that efficient skipping is obtained when two antisense molecules specific for the 5' and 3' splice junctions of exon 51 are co-expressed in the same cell. A lower effect is observed when single antisense molecules are utilized. In those cells where exon 51 skipping is observed, rescue of dystrophin synthesis is obtained.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">It is therefore an object of the invention a composition comprising a gene encoding an antisense molecule specific for a dystrophin exon 5' splice junction and a gene encoding a second antisense molecule specific for the 3' splice junction of the dystrophin exon, wherein the antisense molecules are modified U1 and U2 snRNAs, and a composition comprising the antisense molecules encoded by said genes.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Another object of the invention is a vector for stable and efficient expression in target cells expressing a protein of interest able to co-express two antisense molecules, one specific for a dystrophin exon 5' splice junction and the other specific for the 3' splice junction of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> dystrophin exon, wherein the antisense molecules are modified U1 and U2 snRNAs.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In a preferred aspect, U1 is further modified such that the U1 gene fragment transcribing the RNA sequence interacting to the U1 associated 70K protein is deleted.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In an alternative preferred aspect, U2 is further modified such that it does not interact with U6 snRNA or with pre-mRNA, but maintains its secondary and tertiary structures.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Preferably in the composition or vector according to the invention, one snRNA molecule comprises an antisense sequence complementary to the 5' splice junction and the other comprises an antisense sequence complementary to the 3' splice junction of at least one exon of the dystrophin gene, so that the exon sequence is skipped during the splicing process that converts the pre-mRNA in the mature mRNA.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In a preferred aspect, at least exon 51 of the dystrophin pre-mRNA is skipped.Preferably in the vector according to the present invention, the gene or genes encoding for the modified snRNA(s) is/are able to produce the exclusion from mRNA mature for dystrophin of at least one exon mutated so as to contain or to determine the production of stop codons of premature translation. More preferably, in the composition or vector according to the invention, the exclusion of the mutated exon leads to the production of a functional dystrophin protein.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">More preferably the vector is suitable for transfer to stem cells or to satellite muscle cells.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The vector according to the invention is preferably a retroviral, adenoviral or adeno-associated viral vector.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The composition or the vector according to the invention are preferbaly for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy or for use in a method of treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Advantageously, compared with the previous technique that uses antisense oligonucleotides, the skipping of the mutated exon and the restoration of dystrophin synthesis are characteristics that the transduced cells acquire permanently, thus avoiding the need for continuous administration to achieve a therapeutic effect. The vectors of the invention therefore represent a tool for the development of strategies for the in vivo delivery of therapeutic RNAs, by engineering the antisense RNA within the vectors that efficiently transduce in muscle fiber cells, like, for example, the vectors derived from retroviruses, such as lentiviruses, adenoviruses or adeno-associates.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The invention is described below in relation to non-limiting experimental examples and in reference to the following figures:

In this case, skipping of exon 51 would produce an in frame mRNA coding for a protein 210 amino acids shorter than the wild type dystrophin (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1</figref> top).</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The U1 snRNA was engineered so as to substitute 8 nucleotides at its 5' terminus with a 24 nucleotide-long sequence complementary to the corresponding region across the splice junction of exon/intron 51 (construct U1-5'; <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref>). This choice was dictated by the fact that the 5' terminal region of U1 snRNA is normally in a single stranded conformation and is involved in the recognition of the 5' splice junction of pre-mRNAs (14). The expression of the chimeric RNA is directed by the polymerase II-dependent promoter of the U1 snRNA gene which was previously shown to drive high levels of transcripts (15). It is also easily possible to remove the region of the U1 snRNA that binds to protein 70 KDa which is involved in the activation of the 3' splice site of the upstream intron and/or insert in both U1 and U2 the double antisenses of the molecule.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The other type of RNA vector used is the U2 snRNA. This RNA is normally involved in the splicing reaction since it recognizes the intronic branch site sequence and directs the entry, in the spliceosome, of the catalytic U6 snRNA (21,22). Both the recognition of U2 snRNA for the branch site and its interaction with U6 snRNA are mediated by base pair interactions. In the authors' design, a U2 derivative (U2mod) was first produced with mutations in the region pairing to U6 snRNA. Nucleotide substitutions were made in such a way that the secondary structure of the U2 snRNA would not be affected (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1 B)</figref>. The lack of interaction with the U6 snRNA should ensure that the modified U2 snRNA would not interfere with the cellular splicing apparatus and would not recruit the spliceosome on the intron to which it is paired. U2 mod was subsequently modified so that the branch site pairing region was substituted with 28 nucleotides complementary to the branch site and 3' region of intron 50, giving rise to construct U2-BP (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1 B)</figref>.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">All the described constructs were cloned separately or in couples in the 3' LTR (U3 region) of the pBabe-puro retroviral vector and the viral particles were obtained by transfecting plasmid DNAs into the Phoenix packaging cell line (23).</p><heading id="h0013"><b><u>Transduction of antisense constructs into DMD-derived cells and analysis of their expression</u></b></heading><p id="p0044" num="0044">The cells from a muscle biopsy of the 491A DMD patient were put in culture and immortalized by retroviral-mediated integration of a wild-type SV40 large-T antigen (24).

To determine whether an excess of the modified form of U2 snRNA interfered with the efficiency of the splicing mechanism, splicing products from a control pre-mRNA were accumulated. <sup>32</sup>P-labelled AdML pre-mRNA (see Materials and Methods section) was injected into the nuclei of <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes previously injected with the U2h or U2-BP gene. The <sup>32</sup>P-labelled U6 snRNA was co-injected as an internal control. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3A</figref> shows that no reduction in the splicing efficiency is observed when the construct with the antisense U2 molecule is overexpressed in the nuclei compared with the overexpression of the wild-type U2h snRNA. Northern blot analysis was also performed on the oocytes to verify the expression of the injected DNAs. Panel B) shows the expression of U2-BP, and Panel C) the expression of control U2h snRNA. The U2h-specific expression is revealed by the presence of a pre-U2 snRNA that accumulates specifically in the oocytes (37).
