A considerable amount of energy may be lost due to friction between the aqueous treatment fluid in turbulent flow and the formation and/or tubular goods located within the well bore. As a result of these energy losses, additional horsepower may be necessary to achieve the desired treatment. To reduce these energy losses, friction reducing polymers have heretofore been included in aqueous treatment fluids. The use of friction reducing polymers should reduce the frictional losses due to friction between the aqueous treatment fluid in turbulent flow and the tubular goods and/or the formation.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">An example of a stimulation operation that may utilize friction reducing polymers is hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a process commonly used to increase the flow of desirable fluids, such as oil and gas, from a portion of a subterranean formation. In hydraulic fracturing, a fracturing fluid is introduced into a subterranean formation at or above a pressure sufficient to create or enhance one or more factures in the formation. Enhancing a fracture includes enlarging a pre-existing fracture in the formation. To reduce frictional energy losses between the fracturing fluid and/or the formation, friction reducing polymers may be included in the fracturing fluid. One type of hydraulic fracturing that may utilize friction reducing polymers is commonly referred to as "high-rate water fracturing." Unlike conventional fracturing fluids, fluids used in high-rate water fracturing generally do not contain a sufficient amount of a water-soluble polymer to form a gel. Gel formation is based on a number of factors including the particular polymer and concentration thereof, temperature, and a variety of other factors known to those of ordinary skill in the art. As a result, the fracturing fluids used in these high-rate water fracturing operations generally have a lower viscosity than traditional fracturing fluids. Additionally, while fluids used in high rate water fracturing may contain a friction reducing polymer, the friction reducing<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> polymer is generally included in the fracturing fluid in an amount sufficient to provide the desired friction reduction without forming a gel.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, the use of friction reducing polymers has proved challenging from an environment standpoint. For example, many of the friction reducing polymers that have been used previously are provided as oil-external emulsion polymers, wherein upon addition to the aqueous treatment fluid, the emulsion should invert releasing the friction reducing polymer into the fluid. The hydrocarbon carrier fluid present in the oil-external emulsion may pose environmental problems with the subsequent disposal of the treatment fluid. Among other reasons, disposal of hydrocarbons (<i>e.g</i>., such as the carrier fluid in the oil-external emulsion) may have undesirable environmental characteristics and/or may be limited by strict environmental regulations in certain areas of the world. Furthermore, the hydrocarbon carrier fluid present in the oil-external emulsion also may undesirably contaminate water in the formation.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US3542044A"><text>US 3,542,044</text></patcit> describes a composition for and a method of reducing energy loss flow of oil through a pipe, which comprises adding to said oil an aqueous polyacrylamide solution preferably containing a dispersing agent.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention relates to subterranean treatments, and more particularly, to water-based polymers as friction reducers in aqueous treatment fluids and associated methods.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention provides a method comprising: providing an aqueous polymer dispersion comprising water, an anionic salt selected from the group consisting of ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, aluminum sulfate, and combinations thereof, a water-based friction reducing polymer, a polyol, an anionic surfactant, and a nonionic surfactant wherein the water-based friction reducing polymer comprises acrylamide; mixing the aqueous polymer dispersion with<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> additional water to form an aqueous treatment fluid; and introducing the aqueous treatment fluid into a subterranean formation.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In an embodiment of the present invention the water is selected from the group consisting of freshwater, saltwater, brine, seawater, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The friction reducing polymer comprises acrylamide.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In another embodiment of the present invention the friction reducing polymer comprising the acrylamide is partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In another embodiment of the present invention the water-based friction reducing polymer is a copolymer comprising acrylamide and acrylic acid.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In another embodiment of the present invention the water-based friction reducing polymer comprises at least one monomer selected from the following group: acrylic acid, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, vinyl sulfonic acid, N-vinyl acetamide, N-vinyl formamide, itaconic acid, methacrylic acid, diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In another embodiment of the present invention the polyol is selected from the group consisting of glycerin, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In another embodiment of the present invention the nonionic surfactant is selected from the group consisting of a polyester polyol, an aliphatic alcohol ester, an aromatic alcohol ester, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In another embodiment of the present invention the anionic surfactant is selected from the group consisting of an ammonium salt of polyacrylic acid, an ammonium salt of a 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid/acrylic acid copolymer, and combinations thereof.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In another embodiment of the present invention the aqueous treatment fluid is introduced into the formation at rate in the range of from about 3576 L (30 barrels) per minute to about 29800 L (250 barrels) per minute.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

To the water, 290 g of ammonium sulfate, 20 g of poly(sodium acrylate), 3 g of an anionic surfactant, 1 g of an ionic surfactant, 112.65 g of dry acrylamide, 17.7 g of acrylic acid, and 19.7 g of 50% sodium hydroxide by weight were added. The anionic surfactant was polyester polyol. The ionic surfactant was an ammonium salt of polyacrylic acid. Next, 3 g of sodium bisulfite, 1 g of potassium persulfate, and 2 g of ammonium sulfate were added. The solution was sparged with 1,000 cubic centimeters per minute of nitrogen. Polymerization was initiated as indicated by the production of exothermic heat. The solution was held at a temperature of from about 40° C to about 45° C for a period of about 16 hours.

The commercial steel pipe had an inner diameter of 1.61 cm (0.632 inches) with a wall roughness of 0.0034 cm (0.00011 feet).
