The organic electroluminescent media supports recombination of holes and electrons that yields emission of light. These devices are also commonly referred to as organic light-emitting diodes, or OLEDs. A basic organic EL element is described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4356429A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,356,429</text></patcit>. In order to construct a pixelated OLED display device that is useful as a display such as, for example, a television, computer monitor, cell phone display, or digital camera display, individual organic EL elements can be arranged as pixels in a matrix pattern. These pixels can all be made to emit the same color, thereby producing a monochromatic display, or they can be made to produce multiple colors such as a three-pixel red, green, blue (RGB) display.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">OLED display devices have been fabricated with active matrix (AM) driving circuitry in order to produce high performance displays. An example of such an AM OLED display device is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5550066A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,550,066</text></patcit>. However, in this type of display device, when light is emitted downward through the substrate, the overall area that can emit light is limited by the presence of thin film transistors (TFT's) and other circuitry, which are opaque. The area of the display pixels that emits light relative to the total area of the pixels is known as the aperture ratio (AR) and is typically less than 50% in such displays. In order to compensate for lower AR, the device must be driven at a higher current density compared to a device with a high AR. The result is that the lower AR devices use more power and have a shorter useable life than a device with a higher AR.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Therefore, much work has been done to produce AM OLED display devices that are top-emitting (or surface-emitting), that is, where light is removed through the upper surface away from the substrate and active matrix circuitry. Such a display device is described in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6737800B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,737,800</text></patcit>. This top-emitting configuration allows for increased AR and therefore improved performance of the display.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">One approach to forming a multi-color display device involves the use of a broadband light-emitting EL structure, such as a white light-emitting EL structure coupled with a multi-colored array of color filter elements. In this configuration, a single organic EL layer structure can be applied to all pixels, and the color perceived by the viewer is dictated by that pixel's corresponding color filter element. Therefore, a multicolor or RGB device can be produced without requiring any patterning of the organic EL layers. Such white-light top-emitting AM display devices with CFA's can offer superior AR, manufacturing yield, and production throughput compared to top-emitting AM display devices with multicolor patterning. An example of a white CFA top-emitting display device is shown in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6392340B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,392,340</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Multi-color OLED display devices have also recently been described that are constructed with four differently colored pixels. One example of such a four pixel display includes pixels that are red, green, blue, and white in color. This configuration is known as an RGBW type display. Examples of such four pixel displays are shown in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US6771028B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,771,028</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US7012588B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 7,012,588</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US20040113875A1"><text>U.S. Patent Application Publications 2004/0113875 A1</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US20040201558A1"><text>2004/0201558 A1</text></patcit>. Such RGBW displays can be constructed using a white organic EL emitting layer with red, green, and blue color filters for the red, green, and blue pixels, respectively. The white pixel area is left unfiltered. Inclusion of the unfiltered white pixel allows for the display of colors that are less than fully saturated at reduced power consumption compared to similar RGB only, filtered broadband OLED displays.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">When manufacturing organic EL displays, problems such a particle contamination or scratches in the organic EL materials can result in defects in a display. One type of defect that is caused by particle contamination or scratches is a short circuit through the thin organic materials, connecting the anode and the cathode. A short between the anode and cathode results in a non-emitting pixel (dead pixel) or a pixel that emits at reduced brightness (dim pixel).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Similarly, defects due to particles, scratches, mask-errors, electrostatic discharge (ESD), and similar manufacturing problems can occur in the manufacturing of the active matrix circuitry of an active matrix OLED display device which results in non-functional pixels or pixels which emit at an incorrect luminance level (dim or bright). Alternately, defects in the active matrix circuitry can result in a condition where a pixel continuously emits during operation and can not be selectively turned off. This is type of defective pixel is referred to as a stuck-on pixel.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Document <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US20050023523A1"><text>US 2005/0023523 A1</text></patcit> describes a method and an apparatus for repairing short circuits between electrodes of a multi-color OLED device. The method of repairing includes a step of detecting a short-circuited part between electrodes in the device, and illuminating the short-circuited part by irradiating the short-circuited part with a laser.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Document <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="US20030214248A1"><text>US 2003/0214248 A1</text></patcit> shows a method for repairing defective pixels in an OLED device, wherein a laser beam is irradiated on a semiconductor layer of a defective pixel.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Document <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="JP6138485A"><text>JP 6138485 A</text></patcit> describes the manufacturing of a liquid crystal display device, which can eliminate a display defect wherein a colored organic light shield film is formed on a defective pixel electrode of the device.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Many of these manufacturing defects, typically occur with an area density that depends on the capability of the manufacturing process, equipment and the environment. However, the total yield with respect to non-emitting pixels depends on the area density of the defects and the area of the individual displays. Larger display devices, such as those useful for televisions, computer monitors, or laptops, will have lower yields than smaller substrates given the same defect density.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In a multicolored device, a dead, dim, bright, or stuck-on pixel in one color can cause color distortions in the image. That is, multiple different color pixels such as the red pixel and the green pixel, for example, can be simultaneously illuminated in a predetermined luminance ratio so that the viewer perceives a desired color, such as yellow. With this example, if one of the pixels, such as the green pixel, is dead or dim, the resulting image will not appear the desired yellow color in the area of the defective pixel but will instead appear to be more red in color.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method of making an OLED display device with an array of color filter elements that can display a high quality image even when one or more of the light producing elements are defective pixels.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">This object is achieved by a method according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The present invention provides an effect way to compensate for defective light producing elements in an OLED display device having color filter elements.

In particular, it is employed to describe a display panel that is capable of displaying images of<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> different colors. The term "full color" is commonly employed to describe multicolor display panels that are capable of emitting in at least the red, green, and blue regions of the visible spectrum and displaying images in any combination of hues. The red, green, and blue colors constitute the three primary colors from which all other colors can be generated by appropriate mixing. However, the use of additional colors to extend the color gamut of the device is possible. The term "pixel" is employed in its art-recognized usage to designate an area of a display panel that can be stimulated to emit light independently of other areas. It is recognized that in full-color systems, several pixels of different colors will be used together to generate a broad range of colors. For the purposes of this specification, such a group will be considered several different colored pixels.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In order to more fully appreciate the invention, aspects of a prior art OLED display device will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS. 4a</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">4b</figref>. A schematic layout diagram of an array of light producing elements 51 having active matrix circuitry of the prior art display device is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4a</figref>. This includes light producing elements 210a, 210b, 210c, and 210d. A total of eight light producing elements arranged in four columns and two rows is shown for illustrative purposes, however, a typical display will commonly have many more rows and columns. A corresponding array of color filter elements 61 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 4b</figref>. This includes color filter elements 220a, 220b, and 220c. The color filter elements are spaced to leave unfiltered spaces, such as unfiltered space 230d. This prior art display device is formed by aligning attaching the array of light producing elements 51 to the array of the color filter elements 61. In this case, color filter element 220a is aligned to light producing element 210a, color filter element 220b is aligned to light producing element 210b, and color filter element 220c is aligned to light producing element 210c which form colored pixels which are red (R), green (G), and blue (B) respectively. Similarly, unfiltered space 230d is aligned to light producing element 210d forming a white (W) pixel. The pixels are arranged in a two by two pattern known as a quad pattern. This pattern is repeated across the display area. A variety of other pixel patterns are known in the art. Some examples of such alternate patterns are shown in <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="US6919681B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,919,681</text></patcit>.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The example prior art display is electrically driven by active matrix circuitry, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4a</figref>. This active matrix circuitry includes several signal lines such as a select line 113, a power line 111, and a data line 112. Each light producing elements, such as light producing element 210a, includes several components such as an organic light emitting diode 150, and an active matrix components such as a select transistor 120, a storage capacitor 130, and a drive transistor 140. A common upper electrode 160 is applied to all the organic light emitting diodes to complete the circuit.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">This active matrix drive circuitry operates in a manner well known in the art. Each row of light producing elements is selected in turn by applying a voltage signal to the select line associated with the row, such as select line 113, which turns on the select transistor, such as select transistor 120, associated with each light producing element in that row. The brightness level, or gray scale information, for each light producing element is controlled by a voltage signal, which is set on the data lines, such as data line 112. The storage capacitor, such as storage capacitor 130, for each light producing element is then charged to the voltage level of the data line associated with that pixel and maintains the data voltage until the row is selected again during the next image frame. The storage capacitor 130 is connected to the gate terminal of the power transistor 140. Power transistor 140 regulates the current flow through its source and drain terminals from the power line 111 to the organic light-emitting diode 150 in response to the voltage level held on its gate terminal by storage capacitor 130, thereby controlling the pixel's brightness. Organic light-emitting diode is supplied power from power line 111 which is connected to a first voltage source through power transistor 140 and out the common upper electrode 160 connected to a second voltage source. Each row is then unselected by applying a voltage signal to the select line, which turns off the select transistors. The data line signal values are then set to the levels desired for the next row and the select line of the next row is turned on. This is repeated for every row of pixels. During this time, storage capacitor 130 maintains the data signal on the gate of power transistor 140 such that organic light emitting diode 150 continues to emit while the other rows are receiving data.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">This two transistor, one capacitor (2T1C) circuit arrangement is commonly used in the art and can be used in practicing the present invention.

In this case, a short-circuit defect 170 is present connecting the anode and cathode of organic light emitting diode 150x. Short circuit defect 170 is represented by a resistor having a resistance ranging from approximately 100 Kohms to nearly 0 ohms. This short circuit defect 170 could be caused, for example, by a particle defect of a scratch defect in the organic electroluminescent media in the organic light emitting diode 150x. Short circuit defect 170 is an example defect to which the present invention could be applied. The present invention can also be applied to other types of defects, including defective transistors and opens and shorts in the transistors and the wires connecting the transistors. Defective transistors include transistors with abnormal characteristics such as threshold voltage or mobility due to fabrication process problems or variability.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 5b</figref> illustrates an array of color filter elements 62 according to the first embodiment of the present invention, corresponding to the array of light producing elements shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 5a</figref>.

In this case, defective light emitting element 210x would have normally been intended to be a blue pixel according to the default pattern. In order to compensate for the presence of defective light producing element 210x, the position of color filter element 220m, which is Blue (B), has been adjusted to instead correspond to light producing element 210m. In this case, unfiltered space 230x has been also been adjusted to correspond to defective light producing element 210x. The resulting OLED display device is then programmed to utilize light producing elements 210e, 210f, and 210m to generate full color images with red, green, and blue light without using defective light producing element 210x as will be described in more detail below. Therefore, the effect of the defective light producing element 210x is reduced and the good image quality achieved.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a cross sectional view of a section of the assembled OLED display device according to the first embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 6</figref>, the construction of light producing element 210a can be seen. Light producing element is formed on a first substrate 100. First substrate 100 can be chosen from a variety of known substrate types commonly used in the art include glass, plastic, metal foils, silicon wafers, and the like. The construction of drive transistor 140 can be seen, including a semiconductor layer 141, a gate terminal 143, and a terminal 146. Terminal 146 functions as either the source or drain terminal of the drive transistor 140. Power line 111 serves as the third terminal of the transistor. The semiconductor layer 141 is shown as being constructed of amorphous silicon having an undoped sub-layer 141a and a doped<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> sub-layer 141b.

A preferred material for these insulator layers is silicon nitride. A lower electrode 151 is provided and is electrically connected to power transistor 140. Lower electrode 151 serves as the first electrode for organic light emitting diode 150. Common upper electrode 160 serves as the second electrode for organic light emitting diode 150. Lower electrode 151 can be reflective and can include materials such as Aluminum, Silver, Molybdenum, and the like with a thickness of approximately 100 to 400 nm. Lower electrode 151 can also be constructed of several sub-layers with one sub-layer including the above reflective materials as well as sub-layers of transparent materials such as Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), Indium Zinc Oxide (IZO) and the like. These materials can be deposited by several methods known in the art including sputtering and can be patterned by known lithography and etch techniques.

While organic electroluminescent media 152 is shown as a single layer, it will be understood by one skilled in the art that this layer is typically comprised of a plurality of sub-layers<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> including, for example, a hole injecting sub-layer, a hole transporting sub-layer, an emitting sub-layer, and an electron transporting sub-layer. There are numerous configurations of the organic electroluminescent media 152 wherein the present invention can be successfully practiced. For the organic electroluminescent media 152, a common broadband (or white) light source which emits light at all the various wavelengths used by all the differently colored pixels is preferably used to avoid the need for patterning the organic electroluminescent media between light producing units. Colored pixels are achieved by aligning color filter elements with light producing elements. Pixels that are to emit white or broadband emission are formed by coupling a light producing unit, such as light producing unit 210d, with an unfiltered space, such as unfiltered space 230d. Some examples of organic EL media layers that emit broadband or white light are described, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0021" dnum="US6696177B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,696,177</text></patcit>.

Alternate constructions of the organic electroluminescent media 152 having fewer or more sub-layers can also be used to successfully practice the present invention. The organic electroluminescent media 152 includes organic materials which are either small molecule materials or polymer materials as is known in the art. These organic electroluminescent media layers can be deposited by several methods known in the art such as, for example, thermal evaporation in a vacuum chamber, laser transfer from a donor substrate, or deposition from a solvent by use of a spin coating or ink jet print apparatus. The organic electroluminescent media 152 has a preferable thickness range of approximately 50 to 400 nm.

Second substrate 300 is preferably highly transparent and constructed of known materials such as glass or transparent plastics. A wide variety of colored materials are known in the art for use as color filter elements. One common method of forming color filter elements is to coat a dyed or pigmented solution onto the substrate and pattern the solution using photolithographic methods. While this photolithography approach can be utilized in practicing the present invention, more preferable approaches include transferring a color filter material from a donor sheet using a thermal element or laser element. Examples of techniques and materials for transferring color filter elements from a donor sheet can be found in <patcit id="pcit0022" dnum="US4965242A"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 4,965,242</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0023" dnum="US5521035A"><text>5,521,035</text></patcit>.

These approaches are particularly preferable as the locations of the color filter elements can be easily changed by adjusting the printing or imaging patterns electronically before writing (as described in more detail below). Photolithographic patterning, on the other hand, typically requires a photo-mask to be fabricated in order to form a new pattern and creating a plurality of masks results in higher manufacturing costs. Alternately, a photo-mask could be created imaging only a single pixel or a small number of pixels and then stepped (repeated) across the substrate, however, this would require considerable processing time resulting in low manufacturing throughput. Therefore, more preferable deposition processes are 'mask-less' processes such as the ink jet printing or thermal transfer processes described above where the pattern can be adjusted electronically before processing each device.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">A black matrix 310 is formed over substrate 200 between the color filter elements. Black matrix 310 is an opaque, absorbing film formed between the emitting area of the pixels to absorb any undesired reflective light, thereby improving image contrast.

For example, the black matrix can serve to<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> contain ink jetted droplets used in producing the color filter element. Alternately, additional wall layers known in the art could be utilized to perform this function.

Starting with <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a block diagram of a fabrication process 10 for fabricating a display device according to the present invention. Fabrication process 10 begins with fabricating a display unit (fabrication process 20). A display unit includes an array of light producing elements coupled with an array of color filter elements. The fabrication process (fabrication process 20) for fabricating a display unit is shown in greater detail as a block diagram in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the fabrication process for fabricating a display unit (fabrication process 20) begins by providing a first substrate 100 (step 500). First substrate 100 can be chosen from a variety of known substrate types commonly used in the art include glass, plastic, metal foils, silicon wafers, and the like. Active matrix circuitry and an array of light producing elements are then formed over substrate 100 in step 510. The details of step 510 are further described in greater detail in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">That is, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, first the active matrix circuitry is formed in step 511 over first substrate 100. Fabrication of active matrix circuitry is well known in the art. The active matrix circuitry can be selected from a variety of known types including amorphous silicon and polysilicon types and can have a wide variety of circuit configurations as previously described. Lower electrode 151 is then formed in step 512. As previously described, lower electrode 151 can be reflective and can include materials such as Aluminum, Silver, Molybdenum, and the like with a thickness of approximately 100 to 400 nm. Lower electrode 151 can also be constructed of several sub-layers, such as a reflective sub-layer formed of the above reflective materials as well as transparent sub-layers formed of materials such as Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), Indium Zinc Oxide (IZO) and the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> like. The lower electrode 151 is deposited as a layer over the substrate and active matrix circuitry by methods known in the art such as sputter deposition. The lower electrode 151 is then patterned using well known photo lithography and wet or plasma etching methods. After lower electrode 151 is formed, inter-pixel insulator layer 173 can be optionally provided as previously described. The first substrate 100 is then placed into a controlled environment in step 513. The controlled environment is an environment that contains an inert ambient gas such as nitrogen, argon, or like or an environment that is maintained at a reduced pressure (vacuum) such as less than 133 Pa and preferably less than 0.133 Pa and more preferably less than 0.133 mPa. The controlled environment can be a dry box, vacuum chamber, or a plurality of dry boxes and/or vacuum chambers either directly connected or linked by means of transfer vessel. The preferred controlled environment is a sealed vacuum vessel cluster system or and in-line vacuum vessel system. This controlled environment is beneficial to the subsequent deposition of the organic electroluminescent media materials, which are known to degrade in the presence of moisture and oxygen. While in the controlled environment, the organic electroluminescent media 152 is formed over the lower electrode 151 in step 514. As previously described, the electroluminescent media 152 is preferably constructed of a plurality of sub-layers have a plurality of different organic materials known in the art. One preferred method for depositing these organic electroluminescent media materials is by heating a plurality of sources, such as graphite boats, containing the materials such that the material evaporates or sublimates and condenses over the lower electrode 151 and first substrate 100. The organic electroluminescent media materials are preferably deposited through a shadow mask so as to be formed only over the light producing elements and not the peripheral areas of substrate 100 which can be used for making external electrical connections. Alternate methods of depositing the organic electroluminescent media materials include laser transfer from a donor substrate and deposition from a solvent by use of a spin coating or ink jet print apparatus. Next, upper electrode 160 is formed in step 515. The upper electrode 160 is preferably transparent or semi-transparent as previously described. A semi-transparent<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> upper electrode can be formed by depositing a thin (25 nm or less) layer of metal such as aluminum or silver by known methods such as evaporation or sputtering. A transparent upper electrode can be formed by depositing a layer of a highly transparent conductive material such as Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) by known methods such as sputtering with a preferable thickness of approximately 50 to 400 nm. The upper electrode materials are preferably deposited through a shadow mask so as to be formed only over the light producing elements and not the peripheral areas of substrate 100 since the peripheral areas are used for making external electrical connections.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Returning to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the next step for forming the display unit in fabrication process 20 after the forming the active matrix circuitry and array of light producing elements (step 510) is to test the array light producing elements (step 520). One preferred type of testing involves sensing the light emission of the array of light producing elements. This involves applying electrical power to the light producing elements, for example, by way of the active matrix circuitry. The light producing elements can be illuminated individually or all the light producing elements can be illuminated simultaneously. A photo-detector, photo-diode, radiometer, CCD camera array or the like can be used to sense the light output of the light producing elements. During the testing, the light producing elements can be illuminated to a single luminance intensity or to a range of luminance intensities corresponding to the desired range of intensities needed for the final OLED display device. Since the organic electroluminescent media materials are sensitive to moisture and oxygen, as previously described, step 520 is preferably conducted within the controlled environment such that the array of light producing elements is not substantially exposed to oxygen or moisture between the time when the organic electroluminescent media and the upper electrode are formed (steps 512 and 513) and the time the testing occurs (step 520). Alternately, a thin film encapsulation formation step can be performed (not shown) prior to testing (step 520) to seal the array of light producing elements from environmental oxygen or moisture. Such thin film encapsulation layers are known in the art and include layers of Aluminum Oxide deposited by an atomic layer deposition (ALD)<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> method followed by a Parylene layer as described in U.S. Patent Applications <patcit id="pcit0025" dnum="US20010052752A1"><text>US 2001/0052752 A1</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0026" dnum="US20020003403A1"><text>US 2002/0003403 A1</text></patcit>. In this case where a thin film encapsulation is present, the array of light producing elements can safely be removed from the vacuum environment for the test such that the equipment used for providing electrical power and for measuring light output no longer need to be at least partially contained or interfaced to the controlled environment and thereby said testing equipment can be simplified.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">During the testing process (step 520), the light producing elements are examined to determine if any light producing elements are defective. Defective light producing elements can include light producing elements that produce abnormal brightness, such as light producing elements that are dim or overly bright. If such defective light producing elements were utilized in pixels of the final OLED display device, these pixels would be defective dim pixels or defective bright pixels respectively. Defective light producing elements can also include light producing elements that are incapable of producing light when electrically stimulated. If such defective light producing elements were utilized in pixels of the final OLED display device, these pixels would be defective dead pixels. Defective light producing elements can also include light producing elements that produce light when electrically powered but not specifically addressed. If such defective light producing elements were utilized in pixels of the final OLED display device, these pixels would be defective stuck-on pixels. Defective light producing elements can also include light producing elements that have an emission spectrum that is different than the desired emission spectrum. If such defective light producing elements were utilized in pixels of the final OLED display device, these pixels would produce an incorrect color. Other defect types of light producing elements can also be inspected for during the testing process (step 520).</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Optionally, certain defective light producing units can be modified to change the nature of the defect. For example, stuck-on pixel defects might be found where a defective light producing unit produces light even though it is not specifically addressed. Such defective light producing elements can be converted<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> to non-emitting light producing elements by methods such as laser cutting of signal electrical connections. For example, a laser can be used to cut the electrical wiring connecting the drive transistor to the power supply line or the electrical wiring drive transistor to the lower electrode.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Following testing the array of light producing elements (step 520), it must be decided (decision block 530) whether any defective light producing elements are present or present in sufficient high quantity as to result in an unacceptable display quantity. If no defective light producing elements are found or are only present in an acceptably low quantity, then a default color filter array pattern can be used (step 540). A default color filter pattern can be one in which the differently colored color filter elements are arranged in a regular, repeating pattern such as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 4b</figref>. Alternately, the default color filter pattern can be a pre-determined, random arrangement of the differently colored color filter elements. For example, every group of four differently colored pixels (R, G, B, and W) can be randomly selected. A random pattern is beneficial to the present invention so that, as will be explained below, if a color filter element's position is adjusted, a viewer of the display device will not be able to visually detect a variation in a pixel pattern. In this embodiment, the color filter array pattern is then implemented by providing a second substrate (step 570) and fabricating the color filter elements on the second substrate according to the selected pattern (step 580), which in this case is the default filter pattern.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">If, per decision block 530, one or more defective light producing elements are present, then the locations of the defective light producing elements are recorded (step 550). The location consists of the placement of the light producing element within the array of light producing elements. For example, this location information can include the number of the light producing element's row and column. Alternately, the location information can consist of a single number uniquely identifying the light producing element, such as a number counting from the first light producing element in the first row and first column. Other location systems can also alternately be employed, such as a physical measurement of the position of the light producing element relative to the edge of the array of light<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> producing elements or the substrate. The location information is recorded, preferably electronically, by storing the information, for example on a computer or computer network. The location information is also coupled with information regarding the identification of the first substrate or array of light producing elements such as a 'plate number' or serial number. This substrate identification information facilitates fabrication of a large number of devices simultaneously allowing for the location information to be later associated with the substrate even if substrates are moved or placed in storage prior to completion of the full display device fabrication process.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Using the location information recorded in step 550, the default color filter pattern is adjusted in step 560. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIGS. 5A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">5B</figref>, defective light producing element 210x would be identified as defective while testing the array of light producing elements 52 during step 520. According the default color filter pattern (such as the prior art pattern of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 4B</figref>), defective light producing element 210x would have conventionally been coupled with a blue color filter had it not been defective. Since, however, defective light producing element 210x is defective, this coupling would have resulted in a display device which was unable to produce blue color emission in the near the location of defective light producing element 210x. So, according to the present invention, the location of color filter element 220m, which is blue, is changed to instead be located over light producing element 210m, which would have otherwise been used to form a white pixel. In this case, the location of unfiltered space 230x is similarly changed to be over defective light producing element 210x. By changing the locations of color filter element 220m and light producing element 210x, an adjusted color filter pattern is created. In this embodiment, the color filter array pattern is then implemented by providing a second substrate (step 570) and fabricating the color filter elements on the second substrate according to the selected pattern (step 580), which in this case is the adjusted pattern.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">It is preferred, according to the first embodiment of the present invention, to change the positions of the color filter elements and unfiltered spaces such that the defective light producing elements are coupled with unfiltered<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> spaces. As a result, the region of the display around defective light producing element will be lacking a functional white colored pixel. However, the resulting display device will still be able to reproduce full color images as the red, green, and blue pixels will be functional. White colors and shades of gray can still be produced by combinations of the functional red, green, and blue pixels. If a defective light producing element is located such that it would have been coupled to a unfiltered space to form a white pixel according to the default pattern, then it is preferred to not adjust its position so that it remains coupled to the unfiltered space. This simple logic algorithm is described in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 7</figref>. That is, a determination is first made as to what is the default color of the pixel associated with the defective light producing element according to the default pattern (decision block 700). If the default color pixel is white, then no adjustment to the pattern of the array of color filter elements is made (step 720). If the default color pixel is red, green, or blue, then the pattern of the array of color filter elements is changed by switching the positions of the white pixel and predetermined color pixel (step 710). More complicated logic algorithms can also be implemented wherein multiple defective light producing elements in close proximity are compensated for by adjusting the location of their default corresponding color filter elements to be over alternate, functional light producing elements. Other alternate logic algorithms where the defective pixel is chosen to be a color other than white can also be implemented and are within the scope of the present invention. For example, the present invention can be applied to display devices having only red, green, and blue (RGB) pixels and where the locations color filter elements are adjusted to so that a plurality of defective pixels are evenly distributed between the different colors. That is, a display is made using this alternate logic algorithm to have one defective red, one defective blue, and one defective green pixel instead of three defective blue pixels had adjustments to the locations of the color filter elements not been made.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Returning to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the array of color filter elements is fabricated over the second substrate (step 580), as described above, according to the pattern that is predetermined to be either the default filter pattern (in step 540) or an adjusted filter pattern (in step 560). Several methods can be used to fabricate the array of color filter elements. Preferable methods for fabricating the array of color filter elements are those wherein the pattern can be adjusted electronically. These include deposition from an ink jet nozzle or array of ink jet nozzles or transferring of color filter materials from a donor sheet such as by a thermal, including laser, head.

The second substrate is then attached to the first substrate (step 600). This is achieved, for example, by dispensing an adhesive which is preferably highly impermeable to moisture and air between the first and second substrates and curing the adhesive, such as by ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure. This forms a sealed region. Optionally, additional desiccating materials known in the art can be included (step not shown) within the sealed region to further absorb trapped or diffused moisture.

Next, the adjusted locations of the color filter elements is stored in the memory unit (step 820). Again, in order to reduce the size of the memory unit, a simple set of coordinates such as row number and column number for only the color filter elements whose position has been changed are stored.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">A driving unit is provided (step 830) to convert an incoming video image signal for display on the display unit. The driving unit includes a circuit, such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). The driving unit determines the brightness level of the different pixels of the display unit is required to reproduce the video image. According to the present invention, the driving unit is also responsive to the locations of the defective light producing units and the adjusted positions of the color filter elements stored in the memory unit. As previously described, in the area of a defective white pixel, the driving unit can utilize the red, green, and blue pixels, including such color pixels comprising a color filter element whose locations has been adjusted, to reproducing the desired image colors in the absence of a functional white pixel. In another alternate embodiment, the memory unit can be made small by storing only the position of the defective light producing elements in the memory unit and generating the pattern for the array of color filter elements as needed during operation by supplying the logic algorithm for selecting adjusting the locations of the color filter elements in driving unit.<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --></p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Finally, the driving unit, memory unit, and display unit are connected (step 840).

Alternately, the memory unit and driving unit can optionally be fabricated within a single integrated circuit such that they are connected by the integrated circuit wiring. Alternately, either the memory unit or the driving unit, or both can be fabricated directly on the first substrate using thin film transistors such that a direct connection to the display unit is achieved.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Turning now to <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 8</figref>, a manufacturing tool 400 useful for practicing the present invention is shown. Manufacturing tool 400 includes a several chambers for maintaining a controlled environment located around a central chamber 410. Central chamber 410 contains a transfer robot 420 for moving substrates between chambers. Load chamber 401 is used to load substrates into a controlled environment (step 513). For a reduced pressure controlled environment, load chamber 401 includes a vacuum pump. Load chamber 401 can optionally hold a plurality of substrates so that multiple devices can be fabricated in parallel. Next, a first substrate is moved by way of transfer robot 420 into organic deposition chambers 402, 403, 404, 405, and 406 for depositing a plurality of organic sub-layers of the organic electroluminescent media (step 514). The organic deposition chambers may each contain one or more evaporation sources (or boats) for evaporating organic materials onto the first substrate. The organic sub-layers can be deposited on selective areas of the substrate through shadow masks loaded in each organic deposition chamber. Next, the first substrate is moved by way of transfer robot 420 into electrode deposition chamber 407 for deposition of the upper electrode 515 (step 515). The electrode deposition chamber 407 may contain one or more evaporation sources or sputter targets for depositing the transparent upper electrode material. The first substrate is then moved into the test chamber 430 by way of transfer robot 420.<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --></p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Turning now to <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 9</figref>, an example configuration of test chamber 430 is shown in more detail. Test chamber 430 contains an electrical probe 431 for providing power to the first substrate 100 and lighting the light producing elements, such as light producing elements 210a and 210b. The test chamber also contains a photo-detector 432 for detecting light emission from the light producing elements. Photo-detector 432 is shown as being located outside the controlled environment 433 and detects the light through window 434. However, the photo-detector can also be placed inside the controlled environment. The photo-detector is connected to a computer 435 which determines if any of the light producing elements are defective and stores the location information for the light producing elements, for example on a computer network.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Returning to <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 8</figref>, a second substrate is loaded into load chamber 450. The second substrate is then moved into a color filter chamber 460 for formation of the array of color filter elements. The second substrate is also maintained in a controlled environment, such as dry nitrogen or argon. The controlled environment is preferably introduced in the load chamber 450, however it can also be first introduced in the color filter chamber 460. Alternately, another load lock chamber can be installed before the align and attach chamber 440 to change environments. As previously described, several methods for forming the array of color filter elements may be employed, such as ink jet deposition or thermal transfer using a laser. An example of color filter chamber 460 for an ink jet deposition system is shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 10</figref>.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 10</figref>, an inkjet apparatus including a red inkjet head 462R, a green inkjet head 462G, and a blue inkjet head 462B is positioned to form the array of color filter elements such as color filter elements 220a, 220b, and 220c on the second substrate 300. Alternately, a single inkjet head could be utilized where a plurality of different colored filter materials are provided to the same head or same nozzles. The ink jet apparatus is controlled, for example, by a computer 465, which is connected to the computer network. Computer 465 receives the location information for the defective light producing elements recorded by test chamber 430. The computer 465 can then change the pattern of<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> the array of color filter elements by adjusting the locations of the color filters such as color filter elements 220a, 220b, and 220c and also adjusting the locations of the unfiltered spaces such as unfiltered space 230d.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Returning now to <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 8</figref>, the first substrate is moved into the align and attach chamber 440. The align and attach chamber 440 is also maintained under a controlled environment. At this point, the controlled environment is changed to approximately atmospheric pressure with an inert gas such as dry nitrogen. The second substrate is then also moved into the align and attach chamber 440. The two substrates are then brought into alignment such that the array of light producing elements on the first substrate is aligned to the array of color filter elements on the second substrate. This can be achieved, for example, by use of a CCD alignment camera as is known in the art. The first substrate and second substrate are then attached way an adhesive dispensed between the substrates along their perimeters forming a seal. Optionally, a desiccating material can be dispensed between the two substrates within the adhesive seal as is known in the art. By attaching array of color filter elements on the second substrate to the array of light producing elements on the first substrate, a display unit is formed.

In this embodiment, the array of color filter elements, such as color filter element 220a, are formed directly over the light producing elements, such as light producing element 210a which is formed over first substrate 100. This approach of forming the color elements directly over the light producing elements eliminates the need for a second substrate, which can reduce material costs, provide a thinner final display unit, and simplify the manufacturing equipment. As in the prior embodiments, the color filter elements are still preferably deposited by a mask-less process such as ink jet printing. As in the prior embodiments, the locations of the<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> color filter elements are adjusted using the mask-less process in response to the recorded location of any defective light producing elements as determined by testing the array of light producing elements.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In this second embodiment, a protection layer 362 is preferably formed between the upper electrode 160 and the color filter elements, such as color filter element 220a. The protection layer 362 serves to prevent chemical degradation during the formation of the color filter elements, which may contain moisture or solvents, from degrading the underlying organic electroluminescent media 152 or the upper electrode 160. A thin film encapsulation layer 361 is also preferably provided to block moisture or air from degrading the underlying organic electroluminescent media 152 or the upper electrode 160. One preferred construction of the thin film encapsulation layer 361 is a layer of aluminum oxide deposited by a method such as Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) over the upper electrode 160 followed by a protection layer 362 of a parylene compound formed over the aluminum oxide layers. Examples of such aluminum oxide and parylene sub-layers and other useful materials are described in described in U.S. Patent Application Publications <patcit id="pcit0030" dnum="US20010052752A1"><text>US 2001/0052752 A1</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0031" dnum="US20020003403A1"><text>US 2002/0003403 A1</text></patcit>.

This third embodiment differs from the first and second embodiments in that light blocking elements (such as a light blocking element 240d and a light blocking element 240x) are provided instead of unfiltered spaces as part of the array of color filter elements. That is, as seen in <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 12</figref>, an array of color filter elements 63 having color filter elements such as color filter elements 220a, 220b, 220c, and 220m is provided. Light blocking elements 240d and 240x are also provided. This array of color filter elements 63 can be coupled with the array of light producing elements 52 of the first embodiment which has been previously described and is shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 5A</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --></p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The array of color filter elements 63 includes a pattern of color filter elements which are red (R), green (G), and blue (B) in color.

These light blocking elements are highly absorptive across the visible wavelengths and can be composed of carbon black or other dyes or pigments or mixtures of dyes or pigments which absorb across the visible wavelengths. When coupled to an array of light producing elements, this results in a display having red, green, and blue pixels or an RGB type display. In this case, 1 out of each 4 light producing elements is not used in producing an image. The unused light producing element appears to be black (or dark) due to the presence of the light blocking elements.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The default pattern of the array of color filter elements is changed in response to the detected presence of a defective light producing element. In this case, the position of a light blocking element, such as light blocking element 240x is changed to be over the defective light producing element. The position of a color filter element (such as color filter element 220m) that would have been associated with the defective light producing element is changed to be over a nondefective light producing element. As such, a display device having complete sets of function RGB pixels can be formed despite the presence of the defective light producing elements. This third embodiment of the present invention having light blocking elements can be practiced where the array of light producing elements is formed over a second substrate (as in the first embodiment) or directly over the light producing elements over the first substrate (as in the second embodiment).<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --></p><heading id="h0006"><b>PARTS LIST</b></heading><p id="p0058" num="0058"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>10</dt><dd>fabrication process</dd><dt>20</dt><dd>fabrication process</dd><dt>51</dt><dd>array of light producing elements</dd><dt>52</dt><dd>array of light producing elements</dd><dt>61</dt><dd>array of color filter elements</dd><dt>62</dt><dd>array of color filter elements</dd><dt>63</dt><dd>array of color filter elements</dd><dt>100</dt><dd>first substrate</dd><dt>111</dt><dd>power line</dd><dt>112</dt><dd>data line</dd><dt>113</dt><dd>select line</dd><dt>120</dt><dd>select transistor</dd><dt>130</dt><dd>storage capacitor</dd><dt>140</dt><dd>drive transistor</dd><dt>141</dt><dd>semiconductor</dd><dt>141a</dt><dd>undoped sub-layer</dd><dt>141b</dt><dd>doped sub-layer</dd><dt>143</dt><dd>gate terminal</dd><dt>146</dt><dd>terminal</dd><dt>150</dt><dd>organic light emitting diode</dd><dt>150x</dt><dd>organic light emitting diode</dd><dt>151</dt><dd>lower electrode</dd><dt>152</dt><dd>organic electroluminescent media</dd><dt>160</dt><dd>common upper electrode</dd><dt>170</dt><dd>short circuit defect</dd><dt>171</dt><dd>insulator layer</dd><dt>172</dt><dd>insulator layer</dd><dt>173</dt><dd>inter-pixel insulator layer</dd><dt>210a</dt><dd>light producing element<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --></dd><dt>210b</dt><dd>light producing element</dd><dt>210c</dt><dd>light producing element</dd><dt>210d</dt><dd>light producing element</dd><dt>210e</dt><dd>light producing element</dd><dt>210f</dt><dd>light producing element</dd><dt>210m</dt><dd>light producing element</dd><dt>210x</dt><dd>light producing element</dd><dt>220a</dt><dd>color filter element</dd><dt>220b</dt><dd>color filter element</dd><dt>220c</dt><dd>color filter element</dd><dt>220m</dt><dd>color filter element</dd><dt>230d</dt><dd>unfiltered space</dd><dt>230x</dt><dd>unfiltered space</dd><dt>240d</dt><dd>light blocking element</dd><dt>240x</dt><dd>light blocking element</dd><dt>300</dt><dd>second substrate</dd><dt>310</dt><dd>black matrix</dd><dt>350</dt><dd>light emission</dd><dt>361</dt><dd>thin film encapsulation layer</dd><dt>362</dt><dd>protection layer</dd><dt>400</dt><dd>manufacturing tool</dd><dt>401</dt><dd>load chamber</dd><dt>402</dt><dd>deposition chamber</dd><dt>403</dt><dd>deposition chamber</dd><dt>404</dt><dd>deposition chamber</dd><dt>405</dt><dd>deposition chamber</dd><dt>406</dt><dd>deposition chamber</dd><dt>407</dt><dd>electrode deposition chamber<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --></dd><dt>410</dt><dd>central chamber</dd><dt>420</dt><dd>transfer robot</dd><dt>430</dt><dd>test chamber</dd><dt>431</dt><dd>electrical probe</dd><dt>432</dt><dd>photo-detector</dd><dt>433</dt><dd>controlled environment</dd><dt>434</dt><dd>window</dd><dt>435</dt><dd>computer</dd><dt>440</dt><dd>align and attach chamber</dd><dt>450</dt><dd>load chamber</dd><dt>460</dt><dd>color filter chamber</dd><dt>462B</dt><dd>blue ink jet head</dd><dt>462G</dt><dd>green ink jet head</dd><dt>462R</dt><dd>red ink jet head</dd><dt>465</dt><dd>computer</dd><dt>470</dt><dd>unload chamber</dd><dt>500</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>510</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>511</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>512</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>513</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>514</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>515</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>520</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>530</dt><dd>decision block</dd><dt>540</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>550</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>560</dt><dd>step<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --></dd><dt>570</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>580</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>590</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>600</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>700</dt><dd>decision block</dd><dt>710</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>720</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>800</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>810</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>820</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>830</dt><dd>step</dd><dt>840</dt><dd>step</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56986823" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Verfahren zur Herstellung einer OLED-Anzeige-Vorrichtung mit einer Anordnung von Farbfilterelementen (62) zur Erzeugung eines Bildes, aufweisend:
