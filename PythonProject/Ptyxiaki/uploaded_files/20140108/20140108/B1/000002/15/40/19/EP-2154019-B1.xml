The seat bottom 3 is preferably slidably attached to a vehicle body 6 (floor panel) through slide mechanisms 5.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The slide mechanisms 5 have lower rails 7, 7 fixed to the vehicle body 6 and upper rails 8, 8 slidably engaged with the lower rails 7, 7. The respective upper rails 8 are provided with standing brackets 21 to which the seatback 2 is rotatably supported by pivots 70. The seatback 2 is held at an arbitrary angle by reclining mechanisms 71.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The vehicle seat 1 has a seatbelt mechanism S. The seatbelt mechanism S has a seatbelt 10, a belt retractor 11 coupled with a base portion of the seatbelt 10, a tongue plate 13 attached to an intermediate portion of the seatbelt 10, a tongue anchor 14 with which the tongue plate 13 is detachably engaged, and a chip anchor 12 coupled with an extreme end of the seatbelt 10. When strong inertia force acts on a seat occupant by collision (hereinafter, called vehicle collision) caused by a traffic accident and the like, the belt retractor 11 regulates the seatbelt 10 from being pulled out and restricts the seat occupant for protection. The tongue plate 13 is position-adjustably attached to the seatbelt 10.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, the chip<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> anchor 12 and the tongue anchor 14 are fixed to the standing brackets 21, 21, respectively.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The seatbelt 10 is partitioned to a shoulder belt 16 between the belt retractor 11 and the tongue plate 13 and a wrap belt 17 between the tongue plate 13 and the chip anchor 12.

The seat bottom 3 is movably attached in the front-and-rear direction to the brackets 21 by inserting the slide pins 31 into the slots 32. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">FIGS. 7 to 10</figref>, the pins 31 may be disposed to the brackets 21, and the slots 32 may be disposed to the side panels 30.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The seat bottom 3 is ordinarily held at an ordinarily position (refer to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>), at which the slide pins 31 are positioned on front sides in the slots 32, by a holding means (not shown) by predetermined holding force. When strong<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> external force (inertia force) equal to or larger than predetermined holding force acts on the seat bottom 3, the holding means allows the seat bottom 3 to move rearward. The holding means can be composed of a spring means for urging the seat bottom 3 forward and a projecting means disposed to the slots 32.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">When the vehicle seat 1 is not provided with the slide mechanisms 5, the standing brackets 21, 21 are fixed to the vehicle body 6.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The vehicle seat 1 has a first pretensioner 41 for reducing a forward movement of the seat occupant when vehicle collision occurs.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref> shows a basic concept of the first pretensioner 41. The first pretensioner 41 has a collision detector 42 for detecting vehicle collision, a gas generator 45 for generating gas in response to a signal from the collision detector 42, wire cables 40, 40 coupled with the standing brackets 21, 21, and a cable pull means 48 for pulling the wire cables 40, 40. The cable pull means 48 is preferably attached to the seat bottom 3.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">When the collision detector 42 detects vehicle collision, the gas generator 45 instantly supplies a great amount of gas to the cable pull means 48 which pulls the standing brackets 21, 21 through the wire cables 40, 40 by expansion energy of the gas. At the time, since the standing brackets 21, 21 do not move with respect to the vehicle body 6<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> due to a non-operation state of the slide mechanisms 5, the cable pull means 48 moves the seat bottom 3 relatively rearward with respect to the standing brackets 21, 21 against the holding force of the holding means. With this operation, even if forward inertia acts on the seat occupant by vehicle collision, an amount of movement of the seat occupant in an unpreferable forward direction is reduced so that the seat occupant is safely protected by the seatback 2 and the seatbelt 10.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, the seatback 2 and the seatbelt 10 (the chip anchor 12 and the tongue anchor 14) are attached to the standing brackets 21, 21. Accordingly, the seat bottom 3 can move rearward independently of the seatback 2 and the seatbelt 10.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Preferable embodiments of respective portions of the first pretensioner 41 will be described. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 5</figref>, the cable pull means 48 has a cylinder 43 and a piston 44 moving in the cylinder 43. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, the cylinder 43 extends in a width direction of the seat 1 and is disposed to a lower front portion of the seat bottom 3. An accommodation space can be relatively easily secured in the lower front portion of the seat bottom 3 without sacrificing comfort of the seat bottom 3. Since the cylinder 43 extends in a width direction, a large free space can be secured in a lower rear portion of the seat bottom 3. The free space provides a rear seat occupant with comfort by permitting him or her to insert legs thereinto. A cylinder extending in a front-and-rear direction narrows a lower space of a rear<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> portion of the seat bottom 3.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">When the gas generator 45 is directly or indirectly coupled with an expansion chamber 49 of the cylinder 43 partitioned by the piston 44 and gas is supplied into the expansion chamber 49 from the gas generator 45, the piston 44 moves to the left in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The wire cables 40 have a first cable 40A coupled with a first bracket 21A of the standing brackets 21 and a second cable 40B coupled with a second bracket 21B of the standing brackets 21. The other end of the first cable 40A is coupled with the piston 44, and the other end of the second cable 40B is coupled with a coupling cap 72 fixed to an open end of the cylinder 43. The coupling cap 72 does not have a hermetical seal performance and has a function for fixedly coupling the other end of the second cable 40B with the cylinder 43. A space 73 in the cylinder 43 between the coupling cap 72 and the piston 44 is a non-hermetically-sealed space opened externally and used as a moving space of the piston 44.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The wire cables 40, 40 extend externally along an axial direction (the width direction of the seat) of the cylinder 43 from the cable pull means 48, respectively, are guided rearward by rollers 47, 47 disposed to the side panels 30,30, and are coupled with the standing brackets 21, 21.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The cylinder 43 is attached to the seat bottom 3 by a guide member 46 so that it is free to move in its length direction. Note that since the cylinder 43 is substantially<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> supported by the cables 40A, 40B on both the sides thereof, the guide member 46 may be omitted.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">When the gas generator 45 supplies a great amount of gas to the expansion chamber 49 due to vehicle collision, the piston 44 is pushed out to the left with respect to the cylinder 43 in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 5</figref>. What is important here resides in that the cylinder 43 of the present invention can move in the width direction with respect to the seat bottom 3. Therefore, the great amount of gas supplied to the expansion chamber 49 pushes out the piston 44 to the left with respect to the cylinder 43 and, at the same time, moves the cylinder 43 to the right with respect to the piston 44. In other words, the piston 44 and the cylinder 43 are moved in an opposite direction by the reaction force thereof.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 6</figref> shows a state that gas causes the piston 44 and the cylinder 43 to move. When the great amount of gas is supplied to the expansion chamber 49, the piston 44 and the cylinder 43 change from a state before vehicle collision occurs as shown above in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 6</figref> to a state after vehicle collision occurs as shown below in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 6</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 6</figref>, gas energy moves the piston 44 to the left by a distance X to thereby draw the first bracket 21A through the first cable 40A.
