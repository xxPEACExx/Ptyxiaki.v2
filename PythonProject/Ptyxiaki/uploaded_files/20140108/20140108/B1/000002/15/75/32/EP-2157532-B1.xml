load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an image reader for reading character information and image information described or printed on a thin sheet medium, such as a check.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">As an image reading apparatus for character information and image information (hereinafter called character information and the like) described or printed on a sheet medium, such as paper and so on, an image reader mounted on a copying machine, etc. is well known. In general, such an image reader is equipped with a scanner, which reads image information, and a platen roller placed at a position facing to the scanner. The platen roller, being formed with soft resin or foamed resin, is usually so placed as to press a read manuscript against a reading surface of the scanner and to hold the read manuscript there.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPH0326172B"><text>JP H03-26172</text></patcit> mentioned below proposes an image reader, in which a bristle brush roller is used as a platen roller and the bristle brush roller presses a read manuscript against a reading surface of a scanner and holds the read manuscript there. It is said that the bristle brush roller enables a transfer of any read manuscript in the image reader, regardless of the type of read manuscript: and also improves the quality of reading operation. Furthermore the bristle brush roller can have an electrically-neutralization effect against static electricity when it is formed with a conductive material.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Conventionally well known is a card reader that carries out reproducing operation etc. of magnetic information recorded in a card-like medium while transferring the medium. In the card reader, a datum surface for transfer motion, which works as a datum position in a shorter width-wise direction of the medium being transferred, is formed in a card<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> path in order to correct any tilt of the medium in relation to a transfer direction and to take an appropriate action required for the medium being transferred. Such a card reader, in which a medium is smoothly moved toward the datum surface for transfer motion so as not to suffer damage even if the medium is a weak one, is proposed by <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2006282366A"><text>JP 2006-282366 A</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In a card reader described in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2006282366A"><text>JP 2006-282366A</text></patcit>, an endless belt is hung over a plurality of drive rollers, and a medium is transferred by the endless belt. Namely, a medium path is formed along the endless belt, and the medium path is composed of a flat surface section formed among the drive rollers and a curved surface section formed along outer circumferences of the drive rollers. Furthermore, in the proximity of a border between the flat surface section and the curved surface section, there are placed transfer rollers whose portions opposite from the datum surface for transfer motion are so supported as to be movable in a transfer direction.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the card reader, the medium keeps circulating along the medium path, until a scanner appropriately finishes reading character information and the like, on a surface of the medium as well as reproducing magnetic information recorded in the medium, Furthermore, when circulating along the medium path, the medium moves toward the datum surface for transfer motion by an action of the transfer rollers.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, in the case of an image reader in which platen rollers made of soft resin or foamed resin are used, it is needed to press the platen rollers against a reading surface of a scanner for accurately reading character information and the like described on a medium within a predefined depth of field. Therefore, if a medium having a staple or a clip attached to it is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> introduced and transferred, a reading surface of the scanner (usually a glass surface) is so bruised as to occasionally cause a problem to accurate reading operation.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Furthermore, even in the case of the image reader described in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JPH0326172B"><text>JP H03-26172</text></patcit>, in which the bristle brush roller is used as a platen roller, a similar problem of bruising the reading surface as explained above is still caused, depending on a bristle material. Moreover, there is a chance that a medium is introduced into a space between a guide surface for guiding the medium being transferred and the bristle brush roller (for example, a gap between a guide plate and the bristle brush roller) so that a jam may be caused (a problem of the medium being jammed and crushed). Especially when the medium is thin and sheet-like, such as a once-folded check or bill, a problem is that the medium has already become less elastic and a jam easily happens.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the case of the card reader described in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2006282366A"><text>JP 2006-282366 A</text></patcit>, a medium can be moved smoothly toward the datum surface for transfer motion by the action of the transfer rollers placed in the proximity of the border between the flat surface section and the curved surface section, and even a medium that is weak in strength can avoid a damage in course of transfer motion. However, unfortunately in the case of the card reader, the medium path is formed along the endless belt for the purpose of circulating the medium for transfer operation so that an installation space for the medium path is large and an apparatus of the card reader becomes large-sized.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US20050145689A1"><text>US 2005/0145689 A1</text></patcit>, defining the closest prior art from which the present invention proceeds, discloses a multifeed detection apparatus and method for use in a check processing terminal including a paper supply unit for individually feeding a plurality of checks, a check transportation path for conveying each check fed from the paper supply unit in a given direction along the path, a reading unit disposed on one side of the transportation path and having a rigid stationary surface, and an image scanning sensor such as an MICR head for reading magnetic ink characters printed on the check with the check multifeed detection apparatus. Further provided is a pressure member disposed on another side of the check transportation path opposite to and in alignment with the rigid stationary surface for pressing one or more transported checks passing between the pressure member and the rigid surface up against the rigid stationary surface, and a displacement detection sensor for detecting the displacement of the pressure member by the transported check(s), wherein the displacement detection sensor detects multifeeding based on the displacement of the pressure member according to the thickness of the check(s) passed between the pressure member and the rigid stationary surface.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">An object of the present invention is to provide the use of an image reader which reads character information and image information described or printed on a thin sheet medium such as a check, wherein the image reader is able to accurately read the character information and the like within a predefined depth of field without bruising a reading surface of a scanner. Moreover, it is a further object of the present invention to provide the use of an image reader in which a jam is less likely to happen.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In order to achieve the aforementioned and further objects, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an image reader in accordance with claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system comprising an image reader in accordance with the first aspect, said system further comprising a sheet medium.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method comprising the steps of providing an image reader in accordance with claim 1, transferring a sheet medium through said transfer path using said transfer means, regulating a surface opposite to a to-be-read surface of said sheet medium using said bristle brush roller in order to guide said sheet medium, and scanning said sheet medium in said first and second directions.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Further preferred embodiments and modifications of the present invention are defined in the dependent claims.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the present invention a gap exists between the bristle brush roller and the reading surface of the scanner for allowing the medium to pass through; and when the transfer means transfers the medium in the medium transfer direction, the bristle brush roller regulates a surface opposite to a to-be-read surface of the medium in order to guide the medium. Thus, character information and the like of the medium can be held within a depth of field of the scanner without bruising the reading surface of the scanner so that the first problem described above can be solved. Furthermore, the medium can be transferred, even if it is less-elastic, without causing a jam (a problem of the medium being jammed and crushed) so that the second problem described above can be solved. Still further, by using the bristle brush roller, it becomes possible to catch and hold a clip and a staple, attached to the medium, within the bristle brush roller so as to avoid causing damage on the reading surface of the scanner.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> According to the present invention; it is preferable that the transfer path includes a flat guide for regulating the transfer path at a side of the bristle brush roller; and the guide further includes, an aperture through which the bristle brush roller faces the transfer path, and a plurality of protrusions protruding out of an edge of the aperture toward the bristle brush roller in a direction parallel with the medium transfer direction so as to push through bristles of the bristle brush roller.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the structure described above, the bristle brush roller is so assembled as to face the transfer path through the aperture of the guide; and a plurality of protrusions are so placed as to push through bristles of the bristle brush roller. Therefore, between the guide and the bristle brush roller, there exists no gap into which the medium being transferred can enter, so that it is possible to prevent the medium being transferred from entering the gap to cause a jam. In particular, according to the structure, a jam is unlikely to happen even when the medium is thin and sheet-like, such as a once-folded check or bill.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to the present invention; it is preferable that each of the protrusions is shaped so as to have a triangle ship-prow form that gradually becomes thinner in section toward the bristle brush roller. According to the structure described above, since each of the protrusions is shaped so as to have a triangle ship-prow form, the bristle brush roller is not likely to have a trail (trace mark) of the protrusions, and the whole surface of the medium can have a brushing effect by the bristle brush.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to the present invention; it is preferable that a neighboring part of the guide adjacent to the aperture is formed with a slope that becomes gradually distant from the transfer path toward the bristle brush roller in the medium transfer direction. According to the structure described above, a point of the neighboring part at the edge of the aperture is most distant from the transfer path. Therefore, the medium does not get hooked at the edge so as to enable reducing a chance of jamming.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to the present invention; it is preferable that bristles of the bristle brush roller are made of an electrically-conductive material.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> According to the structure described above, static electricity that the medium may have can be removed.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to the present invention, for example, the image reader is used for handling a thin sheet medium such as a check. In this case, the image reader can be used for handling a thin sheet medium, such as a once-folded less-elastic check or bill.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> As described above, an image reader according to the present invention can hold character information and the like of a medium within a depth of field of a scanner without bruising a reading surface of the scanner, and furthermore the image reader can transfer a medium, even if it is less elastic, without causing a jam (a problem of the medium being jammed and crushed).

Therefore, the medium 2 to be reciprocated by the transfer means can be guided into the evacuation path 52 for sure.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">In the present embodiment, the second end side of each of the pad rollers 22A to 22D is displace-able in both the back-and-forth directions of the medium transfer direction 'X' from a condition where the axis direction of the corresponding one of the pad roller 22A to 22D is almost in line with the medium-width-wise direction 'Y'. Therefore, in both cases where the medium 2 is transferred toward the backside and also toward the front side, the medium 2 can be shifted toward the datum surface for transfer motion 15 by the action of the pad roller 22A to 22D. Accordingly, the medium 2 can be shifted to the datum surface for transfer motion 15 in a short time for correcting the tilt of the medium 2.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">In the present embodiment, when both the insertion detection sensors 13A and 13B detect the medium 2, the shutter 12 opens the medium passage 11 and the transfer means starts operation. In other words, when both the insertion detection sensors 13A and 13B detect the medium 2, the image reader 1 becomes prepared to take in the medium 2. Thus, the image reader 1 takes in the medium 2 under condition where an edge of the medium 2 is positioned in proximity to the datum surface for transfer motion 15 in the medium-width-wise direction 'Y', Therefore, according to the present embodiment, the medium 2 taken in can be shifted to the datum surface for transfer motion 15 in a short time.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">In the embodiment described above, the second end side of the<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> turning shaft 25 is displace-able for almost the same distance in both the back-and-forth directions of the medium transfer direction 'X' from a condition where the axis direction of the corresponding one of the pad rollers 22A to 22E is almost in line with the medium-width-wise direction 'Y'. However, otherwise for example, the second end side of the turning shaft 25 may be displace-able for inequable distances in directions toward the front side and the backside from a condition where the axis direction of the corresponding one of the pad rollers 22A to 22E is almost in line with the medium-width-wise direction 'Y',</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">Moreover, in the embodiment described above, the second end side of the turning shaft 25 is displace-able in both the back-and-forth directions of the medium transfer direction 'X' from a condition where the axis direction of the corresponding one of the pad rollers 22A to 22E is almost in line with the medium-width-wise direction 'Y'. However, the second end side of the turning shaft 25 may be displace-able only in one direction of the medium transfer direction 'X' (toward either the front side or the backside) from a condition where the axis direction of the corresponding one of the pad rollers 22A to 22E is almost in line with the medium-width-wise direction 'Y'.</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">In the embodiment described above, a space between the two shaft support parts 29 formed in the bearing unit 27 is constant and unchangeable. However, otherwise for example, the image reader 1 may include a displacement amount adjusting means for each of the pad rollers 22A to 22E, wherein the displacement amount adjusting means adjust the space between the two shaft support parts 29 of the pad roller in order to adjust the displacement amount of the pad roller at its side opposite from the datum surface for transfer motion 15. In this case, the displacement amount of the pad rollers 22A to 22E can be set according to the strength of the medium 2. In other words, the tilt of the pad rollers 22A to 22E can be set in accordance with the strength of the medium 2. Accordingly, it is possible to avoid an excessive load on the medium 2 moving toward the datum surface for transfer motion 15. Therefore, it becomes possible to protect the medium 2 with less strength from damage during transfer operation for sure. Furthermore, the medium 2 having a fairly high strength can be shifted to the datum surface for transfer motion 15 in a short time.<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --></p><p id="p0114" num="0114">In the embodiment described above, the evacuation path 52 is so formed as to be branched from the front side of the transfer path 10. However, otherwise for example, the evacuation path 52 may be as well so formed as to be branched from the backside of the transfer path 10. Furthermore, though the evacuation path 52 in the embodiment described above is so formed as to curve downward from the transfer path 10, it may be as well be so formed as to curve upward from the transfer path 10.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">In the descriptions above, the embodiment according to the present invention is explained by an example of the image reader 1. However, configuration of the invention with respect to claims 7 to 14 can be applied to various medium processors besides the image reader 1. For example, the configuration of the invention with respect to claims 7 to 14 can be used in a medium processor as well that includes the magnetizing head 71 and the magnetic head 70 but does not include the scanner 30.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">Incidentally, a printing unit (a printer), a stamping unit, and the like may be installed at a backside of the image reader 1. Such a printing unit and the like can be connected by using fastening members such as a connection flange, bolts, nuts, etc. that the image reader 1 has.<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --></p><heading id="h0001">List of reference numerals:</heading><p id="p0117" num="0117"><dl id="dl0002"><dt>1</dt><dd>image reader</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>medium</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>medium insertion section</dd><dt>10</dt><dd>transfer path</dd><dt>11</dt><dd>medium passage</dd><dt>12</dt><dd>shutter</dd><dt>13a</dt><dd>insertion detection sensor</dd><dt>15</dt><dd>datum surface for transfer motion</dd><dt>20, 20A to 20D</dt><dd>transfer roller</dd><dt>22A to 22D</dt><dd>pad roller</dd><dt>30</dt><dd>scanner</dd><dt>31</dt><dd>reading surface</dd><dt>40</dt><dd>bristle brush roller</dd><dt>41</dt><dd>bristle</dd><dt>51</dt><dd>change lever</dd><dt>52</dt><dd>evacuation path</dd><dt>80, 90</dt><dd>guide</dd><dt>81, 81A, 81B</dt><dd>protrusion</dd><dt>82</dt><dd>slope</dd><dt>88</dt><dd>aperture</dd><dt>89</dt><dd>aperture rim</dd><dt>G</dt><dd>gap</dd><dt>X</dt><dd>medium transfer direction</dd><dt>Y</dt><dd>medium-width-wise direction</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56984840" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Bildleser mit:
