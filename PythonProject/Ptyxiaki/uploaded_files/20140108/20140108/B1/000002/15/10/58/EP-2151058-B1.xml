An analog input sample-and-hold is provided, which may be switched capacitor DAC itself, with the overall SAR ADC being controlled by a controller, such as a state machine.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In operation, the capacitor DAC output is switched to ground and the capacitors are all simultaneously connected to and charged to the analog input voltage in the analog input sample-and-hold circuit. Then the grounding is removed and each capacitor is coupled to a reference voltage, one at a time, starting from the most significant bit (MSB). Typically, the capacitance representing the least significant bit (LSB) is replicated so that the capacitance of the MSB is equal to the sum of all the rest of the capacitances. Thus, when the switch drivers connect the capacitance associated with the MSB to the reference voltage, the comparator will reverse state if the analog input voltage is less than half the reference voltage Vref, but will not reverse state if it is more than half of the Vref. If the comparator does reverse state, than the non-overlapping<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> switch driver associated with the MSB is reset. In any event, the comparator output will remain or return to its original state.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Then the non-overlapping switch driver is set, and left set if the output of the converter does not change, or reset if the output of the comparator does change, again after which the comparator will remain or return to its original state again. This sequence is repeated until the LSB is tested, after which latches in the SAR controlling the non-overlapping switch drivers will contain the digital value of the analog input signal held in the analog input sample-and-hold. Each latch in SAR is set before the respective switch driver is initiated, and if the comparator output changes state, each latch must be reset before the switch drivers are themselves reset. In addition, the output of successive approximation register may go through a thermometric encoder to improve differential-non-linearity (DNL) in the outputted data before being applied to the switched capacitor DAC. For example, a typical 5 to 31 segmented thermometric encoder along with the SAR register in a 0.35 micron process can introduce a delay of about 3 nanoseconds.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It can be seen from the above operation that the digital path in SAR ADC is normally limited by the sum of the delays introduced through the switched capacitor DAC, comparator, the successive approximation register, and the thermometric encoder. Such delays can be substantial, especially, when the sequence is repeated in a non- overlapping fashion for each successive bit in each multiple bit conversion. Any such delays in the digital path of serial SAR ADCs can significantly affect data throughput rate.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US7199746B1"><text>US 7,199,746 B1</text></patcit> describes a method for searching and selecting the capacitors for the bits of a SAR ADC.

In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the various embodiments may be practiced without these specific details.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The terms ADC and SAR ADC are used interchangeably throughout the document. In a binary coded switched capacitor DAC, the capacitor values are in a binary sequence. However, the present invention is also applicable to reduced radix and mixed radix DACs. Accordingly, in the description to follow, the reference to a bit, unless the context indicates otherwise, refers to an internal bit of the ADC, which may or may not have a binary weighting, as in well known in the art.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>FIG. I</b></figref>schematically illustrates an example successive approximation analog to digital converter (SAR ADC) 100 that uses parallel processing technique of the present subject matter to significantly reduce delay in the digital data path. The new digital data path 180 is shown in dotted line in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the SAR ADC 100 includes a switched capacitor DAC 110, a comparator 120, a SAR 130, a pair of logic blocks 140, a pair of thermometric encoders 150, a pair of MUXs 160, and a controller 170. In some embodiments, the comparator 120 is a pre-amplifier. Even though for simplicity only a pair of logic blocks 140, a pair of thermometric encoders 150 and a pair of MUXs 160 are shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, one can envision that the SAR ADC 100 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> can work with a plurality of logic blocks 140, a plurality of thermometric encoders<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> 150 and a plurality of MUXs 160 that is based on the number of bits being processed by the SAR ADC 100.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Further as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the comparator 120 includes a pre-amplifier 122 and a regenerative latch 124. It can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> that the digital data outputted from the comparator 120 goes directly to MUXs 160 and then back to the switched capacitor DAC 170 and this technique has only the delay introduced by the MUXs.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In some embodiments, the switched capacitor DAC 110 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is any ordinary or non-differential DACs. In the example embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the digital data path, shown in dotted line 180 does not go through the SAR and the thermometric encoders and hence increasing the speed of operation of ADC 100. Thus, the output of the comparator is coupled to both the SAR and the MUXs to create a parallel path for processing the digital data outputted by the comparator to increase the speed of operation of ADC 100.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In operation, the analog input signal inputted into the switched capacitor DAC 110 during input acquisition and during conversion, DAC output is applied to the comparator 120. The comparator 120 along with the regenerative latch 124 outputs either a "0" or "1" upon receiving the DAC output along with a strobe signal generated from clock signal SCLK. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the digital data outputted by the comparator 120 then goes to the SAR 130 and gets applied to thermometric encoders 150 via logic blocks 140.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In these embodiments, analog input signal is inputted into the DAC 100 during sampling/acquisition. Both the outputs labeled A and B of the logic blocks 140 corresponding to MSB are set to logic state 1 and are set to logic state 0 for rest of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> bits before conversion starts. When the conversion starts, during a first bit trial (logic state 1 of the state machine, such as the Johnson counter 170 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) the inputted analog input signal is compared to Vref/2 and the comparator 120 outputs either a 0 or 1 based on the outcome of the comparison. The logic blocks 140 associated with the MSB bits are enabled and the outputs of A and B, i.e., 1 and 0 are applied to 5 to 31 segments of thermometric encoder 150 (i.e., for a 5 bit encoder) before the comparator 120 outputs the result. Also, the logic blocks 140 associated with the MSB-1 bit is also addressed to set and outputs of A and B, i.e., 1 and 1, respectively, is applied to the 5 to 31 segments thermometric encoder 150 before the comparator 120 outputs the result. This can ensure that only one of the outputs of A and B, i.e., 1 or 0 is inverted when the logic block 140 is enabled. Substantially simultaneously the output of the associated thermometric encoder 150 is ready.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to an embodiment, during a first/current bit trial the logic blocks are such that the outputs A and B of a plurality of logic blocks 140 forms two possible SAR register outputs for the second/next bit trial, which is subsequently multiplexed once the comparator 120 has made a decision. For example, when using a three bit parallel path logic block, its operation can be as follows:
<ul><li>In the following example, parallel path '0' indicates SAR out if current bit trial = 0 and parallel path '1' indicates SAR out if current bit trial = 1.</li><li>Parallel paths generated during first (MSB) bit trial (i.e., before a first bit is decided by the comparator 120)</li><li>Parallel path '0': MSB, MSB-1, LSB = 0 (possible regenerative latch output), 1(next bit set), 0(bit trial not yet started)<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></li><li>Parallel path '1': MSB, MSB-1, LSB = 1(possible regenerative latch output), 1(next bit set), 0 (bit trial not yet started)</li><li>Assuming first bit = 1, parallel paths generated during second (MSB -1) bit trial will be:
<ul><li>Parallel path '0': MSB, MSB-1, LSB = 1(data stored in SAR), 0(possible regenerative latch output), I (next bit set)</li><li>Parallel path '1': MSB, MSB-1, LSB = 1(data stored in SAR), 1(possible regenerative latch output), 1(next bit set)</li></ul></li><li>Assuming second bit = 0, Parallel paths generated during third (LSB) bit trial
<ul><li>Parallel path '0': MSB, MSB-1, LSB = 1(data already stored in SAR), 0(data stored in SAR), 0(possible regenerative latch output)</li><li>Parallel path '1': MSB, MSB-1, LSB = 1(data already stored in SAR), 0(data stored in SAR), 1 (possible regenerative latch output)</li></ul></li></ul></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Once the comparator 120 outputs the data, one of the thermometric encoders 150 outputs the data to associated MUX 160, which is then multiplexed to switch drivers of DAC 110. Also, upon the regenerative latch output is stored in MSB logic block of SAR; it is made transparent to the thermometric encoder input through the corresponding MSB logic block A and B outputs for a next bit trial.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Similarly, for a second bit trial before the comparator 120 makes the decision, one more logic block 140 corresponding to MSB-1 bit is enabled to provide the preset data of I and 0 to the thermometric encoders 150. Also, the logic block 140 associated with the MSB-2 bit is also addressed to set outputs A and B, i.e., 1 and 1 and are applied to 5 to 31 segments of thermometric encoder 150 before the comparator 120 outputs the result. This<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> process repeats itself for each of the remaining bits associated with the inputted analog signal</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In these embodiments, before the regenerative latch 124 in the comparator 120 outputs either a "0" or "1" the plurality of thermometric encoders 150 are set to "0" and "1" and encode the MSB bits so that the output at the plurality of thermometric encoders 150 are ready and waiting at the associated plurality of MUXs 160. Either one of the encoded data waiting at the plurality of thermometric encoders 150 is selected and outputted by the plurality of MUXs 160 upon receiving the digital data from the regenerative latch 124. Basically, the plurality of thermometric encoders 150 starts encoding the data while the regenerative latch 124 is being strobed using the SCLK signal.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In these embodiments, the plurality of logic blocks 140 is substantially equal to number of bits. For example, if an ADC has 12 bits, then 5 MSB bits are applied to the thermometric encoder 150 to segment them in to (2<sup>5</sup>-1) 31 segments and the 7 LSB bits are directly applied to the MUXs. In these embodiments, segmenting the bits may help improve DNL and settling time. Further in these embodiments, top 5 MSB bits are segmented using the two thermometric encoders 150, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, by assuming the comparator 120 output as "1" and "0". It can be seen that 5 logic blocks having A and B outputs are required in order to preset the 5 MSB bits. Also it can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> that the parallel digital path 180 bypasses the delay introduced by the SAR 130 and the two thermometric encoders 150. Further, it can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> that for the remaining 7 LSB bits the delay introduced by the SAR 130 is bypassed. In these embodiments, the regenerative latch makes a decision any time during its allotted time and depending on its<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> input (pre-amplifier output) difference to send data to the MUX 160 to select input 130 and it does not wait for the completion of its allotted time to send the data to SAR 130 as in the conventional SAR ADCs. The regenerative latch 124 output in the SAR ADC 100 of the present subject matter using parallel digital path 180 can be applied to the DAC 110 through the MUX 160 without waiting for its allotted time. Therefore, it can be seen that the delay in LSB bit trials is also reduced. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, 'm' represents a number of MSB bits that are segmented and 'n' represents a number of LSB bits that are not segmented. Sometimes thermometric encoder 150 may be used in some of the LSB bits if the DAC 110 is divided into two units with some coupling in between the divisions. Even in these embodiments, the above described can be used to reduce delay in LSB bits.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is an example timing diagram that shows the difference in digital data path timing between the conventional SAR ADC 210 and the parallel processing SAR ADC 220 of the present subject matter. These example times are obtained using 5 bit thermometric encoder with a SAR register made using 0. 35 micron process. It can be seen that the conventional SAR ADC has nearly 2.8 nanoseconds delay whereas as the parallel processing SAR ADC of the present subject matter has only about 0.7 nanoseconds. The SAR ADC of the present subject matter, such as those shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, yield about 2 nanoseconds reduction in critical data path travel time. Further improvement in performance can be achieved by using the regenerative latch 124 output in MUX whenever the decision by the comparator 120 is outputted, without waiting for the designated time: Generally, the designated time is usually set by a timer using the CLK.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> schematically illustrates another example successive approximation analog to digital converter (SAR ADC) 300 that uses parallel processing technique of the present subject matter to significantly reduce delay in the digital data path. Further, the SAR ADC 300 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> includes logic to enable selecting different capacitor switching sequences randomly without affecting the reduced delay achieved with the SAR ADC 100 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. It can be seen that the digital data path 180 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is similar to the digital data path shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. Also, it can be seen that the circuit shown in SAR ADC 300 is similar to the circuit of SAR ADC 100 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> except that it has a random sequence selector 310 that is coupled between the plurality of thermometric encoders 150 and the MSB MUX 160 and a set of latches 320 that is coupled between the plurality of MUXs 160 and the switched capacitor DAC 110. The random sequence selector 310 can be a mismatch noise shaper or any other processing circuit that performs substantially similar function. Further as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the SAR ADC 300 has a latch enable generator 325 that is coupled between the pre-amplifier 120 and the set of latches 320. In some embodiments, the latch enable generator generates a signal so that the data from the comparator 120 by passes the set of latches 320 are is available to the DAC 110. This can ensure adding the additional set of latches 320 do not cause any delay in the SAR digital data path 180.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The outputs of the plurality of MUXs 160 are latched by the set of latches 320 to avoid any glitches at the switched capacitor DAC 110. This can significantly reduce the glitches in the DAC output. Also, such latching by the set of latches 320 can enable in starting the parallel processing substantially ahead to improve the performance of the SAR ADC 300 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. In these embodiments, the parallel processing starts<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> upon a rising edge of SCLK signal. In contrast, the SAR ADC 100 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> starts upon the falling edge of the SCLK signal along with the regenerative latch 124. It can be seen that the SAR ADC 300 provides substantially more time for parallel processing in addition to adding randomizing switching sequences. Also, it can be seen that the thermometric encoding for a current bit trial can be started in the previous bit trial as shown in the timing diagram <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>. Further, it can be seen that the data_ready signal in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> enables the latch whenever the data is ready from the regenerative latch 124, so that its input to output delay is not added to the total digital path delay.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Furthermore it can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, that the parallel path starts upon the rising edge of the SCLK signal. Moreover, the data_ready signal shows that the regenerative latch 124 has completed its decision. Typically, the regenerative latch 124 does not take the complete 5 nanoseconds to complete the decision. However, in some embodiments, bit trials require all the 5 nanoseconds to complete the decision. In such a situation, the data_ready signal is available at substantially end of the regenerative latch period. This portion of the regenerative latch period, where the data_ready signal's rising edge can appear, is shown in dotted lines in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>. It can also be seen in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, that when the data_ready signal is high the set of latches 320 is transparent and hence only the MUX 160 delay is seen in the digital data path 180.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Even though, the above technique is described with reference to using random sequence selector, it can be envisioned that any other kind of processing can be used to improve INL profile as well as to reduce DNL from capacitor mismatches. It can also be envisioned that even though using the random sequence selector 310 introduces some delay in the digital data path 180, by using the parallel digital data processing of the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> present subject matter, this delay can be bypassed and can get the benefit of reducing the mismatch errors introduced by the capacitor. The above technique reduces SAR logic delay and significantly improves ADC throughput.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0005"><b>FIG. 5</b></figref> schematically illustrates example SAR ADC 500 including parallel digital processing scheme according to another embodiment of the present subject matter that uses a modified digital data path for the 5 MSB bits to achieve a reduced delay in the digital data path. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, the SAR ADC 500 includes a counter 510, a comparator 520, a look forward thermometric encoder with associated latch 530, a SAR 540, a thermometric encoder 550, a pair of drivers and switches 560 and an output register 570. In some embodiments, the counter 510 can be state machine. The term "look forward" means the segments/thermometric elements for a next bit trial (i.e., n+1<sup>th</sup> bit trial) are addressed (being determined and conveyed through the logic chain) in the current bit trial (i.e., n<sup>th</sup> bit trial). In these embodiments, the slow bit is converted in advance of needed information, i.e., at the start of the bit trial.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In operation, an analog input signal is inputted into DAC during sampling/acquisition. Upon a rising edge of the clock signal CLK, the conversion of the inputted analog signal is started during first bit trial. Substantially simultaneously, outputs are set high on previously addressed look forward thermometric encoder 530 and binary encoder 550. The next potential outputs are addressed on the look forward thermometric encoder 530 and the thermometric encoder 550. The DAC is allowed to settle during the remaining clock period. The comparator 510 is then strobed during the clock cycle and the 5 MSB bits and the remaining 7 LSB bits are latched at output of the associated look forward thermometric encoder 530 and the binary encoder 550.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the above technique there is no SAR 540 for the MSBs for the bits that are significantly different. Further, the latching is done at the output of the look forward thermometric encoder 530 and the binary encoder 550. The slow path through the thermo metric encoder is the addressing of the new bit, which is done while a present bit is being trialed.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The following table illustrates the working of the above technique using a three bit example:
