CLA is a conjugated dienoic fatty acid having 18 carbon atoms. As a result of the presence of the two double bonds in CLA, geometrical isomerism is possible and the CLA molecule or moiety may exist in a number of isomeric forms.

For example, the processes that rely on the selectivity of a lipase for one isomer compared to another isomer require the reaction not to proceed to completion and there is, therefore, a compromise between yield and the degree of isomer enrichment. There remains a need for a process for preparing CLA isomer<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> mixtures that are enriched in one isomer, which can give a relatively high yield and/or a relatively high content of one isomer relative to other isomers and which can be carried out relatively inexpensively on a relatively large scale, for example without the need for very low temperatures (e.g., below -57 °C).</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The separation of CLA isomers is generally carried out with the CLA isomers in the form of esters. The reason for this is thought to be due to the larger difference in the melting point of the esters compared to the free acids. This greater difference in melting point makes the esters easier to separate than the free acids by crystallisation. Indeed, the separation of the isomers of the corresponding free acids has been described in the literature as almost impossible (see, for example, <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US20010018453A"><text>US 2001/0018453</text></patcit>). Also, <nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>Jain et al, J. Agric, Food Chem, Volume 54 (2006), pages 5590-5596</text></nplcit> describes the inseparability of the isomers as limiting their commercial utility. However, separation of the esters may require the additional step of forming esters from the free acids and this can be costly and time consuming. Thus, there remains a particular need for a process for preparing CLA isomer mixtures that are enriched in one isomer which can overcome these problems.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to the invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of a composition comprising the cis9, trans11 and trans10, cis12 isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which comprises:
<ul><li>providing a mixture comprising the free acids of cis9, trans11 and trans10, cis12 isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in which one of the cis9, trans11 and trans10, cis 12 isomers is present in a first weight ratio X of from 1.3:1 to 4:1 with respect to the other isomer; and<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></li><li>subjecting the mixture to crystallisation to form a composition comprising the cis9, trans11 and trans10, cis12 isomers in which one of the cis9, trans11 and trans10, cis12 isomers is present at a second weight ratio Y with respect to the other isomer, wherein Y is greater than X,</li></ul>
wherein the composition comprises at least 60% by weight of the cis9, trans11 isomer or the trans10, cis12 isomer, based on the total amount of C18:2 fatty acids in the composition, wherein the crystallisation is carried out in the presence of a solvent and wherein the weight ratio of solvent to total cis9, trans11 and trans10, cis12 isomers is in the range of from 20:1 to 1:1.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The process of the invention has been found to allow the production of compositions containing relatively high amounts of the cis9, trans11 or the trans10, cis12 isomer, preferably the cis9, trans11 isomer, in a good yield.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Surprisingly, it has been found that a mixture comprising the free acids of cis9, trans11 and trans10, cis12 isomers of CLA may be separated by subjecting the mixture to a crystallisation step according to the invention, despite the two isomers having very similar melting points.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Moreover, by adjusting the ratio of the isomers before crystallisation, it has surprisingly been found that it is possible to separate the different isomers as free acids by crystallisation, at a higher temperature than would be required, for example, for the crystallisation of the corresponding esters.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The crystallisation is carried out in the presence of a solvent. Suitable solvents comprise a polar organic compound. More preferred solvents comprise a C3 to C6 ketone, a C1 to C6 alcohol, water or a mixture thereof. The most preferred solvent is acetone, either alone or in admixture with one or more other solvents such as water, but in which acetone is the major component of the solvent (i.e., in which acetone is present in an amount of at least 55 % , more preferably at least 70 %, even more preferably at least 90 %, by weight). The crystallisation is preferably carried out in the substantial absence or the complete absence of urea. For example, urea is preferably present in an amount of less than 5 % by weight of the solvent, more preferably less than 3 % by weight, such as less than 1 % by weight, e.g., less than 0.5 % by weight, less than 0.1 % by weight or even 0 % by weight.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The crystallisation step that forms part of the process of the invention is carried out using a weight ratio of solvent to total cis9, trans 11 and trans10, cis12 isomers that is in the range of from about 20:1 to about 1:1, such as about 10:1 to about 1:1, more preferably from about 9:1 to<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> about 2:1, even more preferably from about 8:1 to about 2:1, such as from about 6:1 to about 5:2 or from about 5:1 to about 3:1. The use of a ratio of about 4:1 is particularly preferred. Working at these levels of solvent allows the most effective selective crystallisation, at a temperature in the range of about -15 °C to - 35 °C. When the ratio of solvent to total cis9, trans11 and trans10, cis12 isomers is less than about 1.5:1, it has been found that the selectivity of the process is greatly reduced.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The conditions for the crystallisation step are selected to allow effective and selective separation of the cis9, trans11 and trans10, cis12 isomers. The preferred temperature at which the crystallisation is carried out is a temperature below 0°C, more preferably a temperature in the range of from -10 to -40 °C, such as -15 to - 35 °C, for example -18 to -30 °C.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In one embodiment of the invention, the crystallisation step is carried out in the absence of mechanical stirring. The crystallisation may be carried out essentially quiescently i.e., with only convection currents providing movement in the mixture.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The crystallisation may be effected by controlled cooling or by sudden ("crash") cooling, typically starting at room temperature. Controlled cooling may take place for up to 72 hours and may involve cooling over a period of 2 to 24 hours at a rate of about 1 to 5 °C per hour. Crash cooling may take place in less than 5 hours, more preferably less than 2 hours or less than 1 hour, even more preferably less than 30 minutes such as less than 15 minutes or less than 5 minutes. Both cooling methods may be followed by keeping the cooled mixture and solvent at the low temperature for up to 48 hours e.g., up to 60 hours.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The invention comprises the step of providing a mixture in which one of the cis9, trans11 and trans10, cis12 isomers is present in a first weight ratio X of from 1.3:1 to 4:1 with respect to the other isomer. It has been found that this first step of ensuring inequality of the amount of the two isomers allows more effective and/or selective crystallisation to be carried out. The mixture can be provided in a number of<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> different ways. Typically, the mixture is formed by treatment of a composition comprising the cis9, trans11 and trans10, cis12 isomers in roughly equal molar amounts. However, the mixture may be provided in other ways.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Preferably, the mixture is provided by a process comprising the step of treating a composition comprising the cis9, trans11 and trans10, cis12 isomers with an enzyme that exhibits greater selectivity for one of the isomers than the other isomer. Typically, the enzyme is a lipase.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In one embodiment, the mixture may be provided by at least partially esterifying a composition comprising conjugated linoleic acid with an enzyme that is selective for the cis9, trans 11 isomer compared to the trans10, cis12 isomer to form an ester fraction enriched in the cis9, trans11 isomer compared to the trans10, cis12 isomer and hydrolysing the ester fraction to form the free acid.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In another embodiment, the mixture may be provided by at least partially esterifying a composition comprising conjugated linoleic acid with at least one monohydric alcohol having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms to obtain the corresponding conjugated linoleic acid esters and selectively hydrolysing at least a proportion of the esters with an enzyme to produce alcohol, free fatty acids enriched in the c9t11 isomer and CLA esters enriched in the t10c12 isomer, with removal of at least part of the alcohol formed.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Starting compositions for providing the mixture are preferably CLA compositions comprising roughly equimolar amounts of the cis9, trans11 and trans10, cis12 isomers, such as can be obtained by chemical synthesis of CLA, such as by conjugation of linoleic acid, as described in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="EP0902082A"><text>EP-A-0902082</text></patcit>, for example.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Preferably, one, more than one or all of the esterification and hydrolysis steps are carried out using a lipase. The most preferred lipases are those exhibiting selectivity for either the cis9, trans11 or the trans10, cis12 isomer compared to the other isomer. Examples of suitable lipases are those from <i>Candida rugosa</i> or <i>Geotrichum candidum.</i> However, it is only necessary that one of the esterification<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> or hydrolysis steps exhibits selectivity for one of the isomers and the other esterification or hydrolysis steps may be non-selective and may involve non-selective chemical or enzymatic reactions.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The first ratio X is at least about 1.3 to 1, such as at least about 1.4:1 or at least about 1.5:1. The first ratio X does not exceed about 4:1 and preferably is less than about 3:1 or less than about 2:1, such as less than 1.8:1, for practical reasons.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The crystallisation step is carried out so as to increase the relative proportion of one of the isomers compared to the other isomer. The weight ratio of the isomers after the crystallisation step is a second ratio Y. Y is greater than X and is typically greater than about 1.5:1, more preferably greater than about 1.7:1, such as greater than about 2:1, for example at least about 3:1 or at least about 4:1 or at least about 5:1 1 or even at least about 10:1. Y is usually not more than about 20:1, more preferably not more than about 50:1 or about 100:1.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The process of the invention may comprise further steps. For example, the process preferably comprises the step of separating the composition after the crystallisation step, optionally washing the composition and optionally drying the composition. However, preferably the composition is not washed. It is also preferred that the composition is allowed to dry by removal of the solvent to the atmosphere without any external heating, either at ambient pressure or under reduced pressure. The composition typically forms the crystalline product and may be separated from the liquor (i.e., the liquid remaining after crystallisation) by filtration or centrifugation, for example.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The composition may be subjected to one or more further crystallisation steps, as described herein, in order to increase the value of Y even further.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The process may comprise a step of forming an ester from the composition.
