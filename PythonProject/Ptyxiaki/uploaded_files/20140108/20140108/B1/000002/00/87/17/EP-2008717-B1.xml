incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0003">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The present invention relates to reaction devices. More specifically, the invention relates to a reaction device that can carry out temperature control with high accuracy.</p><heading id="h0004">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">If there is a need to control a reaction based on a temperature condition, it is desired that the temperature condition can be controlled with higher accuracy. Furthermore, it is desired that temperature control can be carried out with high accuracy in a reaction device in which a reaction is performed irrespective of which of liquid, solid, and gas is the reaction target. Such a demand arises also in e.g. the technical field of gene<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> analysis.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">One example of the gene analysis technique requiring the high-accuracy temperature control is analysis by use of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, in which gene amplification is performed. The PCR method could be a standard method for quantitative analysis of a trace of nucleic acid.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the PCR method, the amplification cycle of "thermal denaturation → annealing of primers → polymerase extension reaction" is continuously repeated. This can amplify DNA and so on by a factor of hundreds of thousands. The quantitative analysis of a trace of nucleic acid can also be performed by monitoring the thus obtained PCR-amplified product in real time.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the PCR method, however, it is necessary that the amplification cycle be controlled accurately. To accurately control the amplification cycle, high-accuracy temperature control is required. Insufficient temperature control leads to a problem that irrelevant DNA sequences are amplified or amplification is not found at all.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Therefore, it is important that the above-described device can carry out thermal control with high accuracy as a reaction device. As techniques relating to this respect, techniques for temperature control of the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> reaction device are disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2003298068A"><text>2003-298068</text></patcit> and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2004025426A"><text>2004-025426</text></patcit>.

Certaom devices include a rotary microfluidic channel and a plurality of temperature regions at different locations along the rotary microfluidic channel at which temperature is regulated. Solution can be repeatedly passed through the temperature regions such that the solution is exposed to different temperatures. Other microfluidic devices include an array of reaction chambers formed by intersecting vertical and horizontal flow channels, with the ability to regulate temperature at the reaction chambers. The microfluidic devices can be used to conduct a number of different analyses, including various primer extension reactions and nucleic acid amplification reactions.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO03048295A1"><text>WO 03/048295 A1</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US2005019792A1"><text>US 2005/019792 A1</text></patcit> a variety of elastomeric-based microfluidic devices and methods for using and manufacturing such devices are disclosed. Certain of the devices have arrays of reaction sites to facilitate high throughput analyses.

The manner in which the operation time is controlled should be obfuscated such that a malicious intruder cannot identify the control function that determines the operation time of the object by means of probing and/or reverse engineering the object to eliminate, remove or bypass the control function.

The gate electrode for the transistor is formed within a silicon substrate and a gate dielectric is positioned over the gate electrode. A pass transistor is coupled to the gate electrode, the pass transistor having a source/drain region in the same semiconductor substrate and positioned adjacent to the gate electrode of the thin film heating transistor. When the pass transistor is enabled, a voltage is applied to the gate electrode which causes the current to flow from the drain to the source of the thin film transistor. The current flow passes through a highly resistive region which generates heat that is transmitted to the heat reaction chamber.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="US6093370A"><text>US 6 093 370 A</text></patcit> discloses how different probes each having a specific base sequence are immobilized to each of independent areas formed on the surface of a substrate. complementary polynucleotides in a sample solution are hybridized to the probes. and each of the independent areas on the substrate is heated and then cooled in sequence, and hence the solution is recovered to extract different polynucleotides separately corresponding to individual probes.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="EP1994980A1"><text>EP 1 994 980 A1</text></patcit> discloses that a real-time PCR system for detecting gene expression levels includes plural reaction regions, a like plural number of heating portions arranged corresponding to the reaction regions and having heat sources, respectively,<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> an optical unit capable of irradiating exciting light of a specific wavelength to all of the plural reaction regions, and a like plural number of fluorescence detecting portions arranged corresponding to the reaction regions, respectively. The heating portions are each provided with a temperature detector for detecting a temperature in a vicinity of the corresponding heat source and converting the temperature into an electrical signal and also with a controller for controlling a thermal dose from the corresponding heat source based on a correlation between electrical signals and calorific values of the heat source stored beforehand.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">However, even the technique of carrying out temperature control by use of semiconductor elements and so on in the related-art reaction device involves the following problems.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Specifically, the semiconductor element involves manufacturing variation in general. Therefore, even when the same temperature control is carried out for the respective reaction areas, the heating amount varies from substrate to substrate, and from heating part to heating part even on the same substrate. This results in difficulty in high-accuracy temperature control as a reaction device.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In addition, characteristics of the semiconductor element change depending on the temperature in general. For example, a MOS transistor based on single-crystal silicon has a negative temperature characteristic. Thus, even when the same voltage is applied thereto, a higher<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> temperature leads to a smaller amount of the current flowing therethrough. Consequently, even when the same voltage is applied, the heating amount varies depending on the temperature, which results in difficulty in high-accuracy temperature control.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">There is a need for the present invention to provide a reaction device that can carry out temperature control with high accuracy.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">This need is satisfied by the subject-matter of the claims.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The present inventors did not merely conceive the use of semiconductor elements or the like for a thermal control system but focused on the circuit arrangement and so on of the thermal control system. As a result, the present inventors conceived the idea to incorporate an active-matrix structure capable of controlling the respective heat units into the thermal control system, and thereby completed the present invention.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a reaction device including a plurality of reaction areas, and a plurality of heating parts configured to be each provided for a respective one of the reaction areas. Each of the heating parts includes a heat source, a scan line for selecting the heating part, and a data line that transmits heating amount information used for heating to the heat source. Each of the heating<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> parts further includes a writer that acquires the heating amount information transmitted from the data line, a holder that stores the heating amount information also after the scan line is turned to the non-selected state, and a heat generation controller that controls heat generation of the heat source based on the heating amount information.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">By providing the heating part for each of the reaction areas of the reaction device, heating control can be carried out individually. Heating only at the timing when the scan line is selected is not performed, but the heating amount information for the respective heating parts (heat units) that are desired to generate heat can be held after the heating amount information is written and until the next heating amount information is written. As a result, the time during which the heating is performed is not limited to the selection period of the scan line, which is a short time. Thus, easy and stable heating operation is achieved.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the reaction device, the heating amount information transmitted from the data line may be a signal current, and the heating part may include a converter that converts the signal current to a voltage level. Furthermore, the holder may hold the heating<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> amount information as the voltage level, and the heat generation controller may convert the held voltage level to a current level to thereby control heat generation.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">By converting the form of the heating amount information from the signal current to the voltage level, the signal current can be temporally stored as the voltage level in the holder. By converting the voltage level to the current level, high-accuracy heating control can be carried out.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the reaction device, the converter may include a first field effect transistor whose gate and drain are electrically connected to each other. The holder may include a capacitor that holds the voltage between the gate and source of the first field effect transistor, generated due to the flow of the signal current through the first field effect transistor. The heat generation controller may include a second field effect transistor through which a current dependent upon the voltage between the gate and source of the first field effect transistor flows.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Using the first field effect transistor allows generation of the voltage dependent upon the applied signal current. The voltage between the gate and source of the first field effect transistor can be held by the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> capacitor.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the reaction device, the first field effect transistor and the second field effect transistor may be identical transistors. In addition, conversion operation of converting the signal current to the voltage level by the converter and control operation of controlling heat generation of the heat source based on the heating amount information by the heat generation controller may be carried out in a time-sharing manner.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">By alternately carrying out the conversion operation and the control operation in a time-sharing manner, more accurate heating amount information can be transmitted to the heat generation control system of the heat generation controller. As a result, the heating amount can be controlled with higher accuracy.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the reaction device, the converter may include the first field effect transistor and a third field effect transistor whose gate and drain are electrically connected to each other, and the source of the first field effect transistor and the drain of the third field effect transistor may be electrically connected to each other.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The provision of the third field effect transistor can further enhance the degree of matching between the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> drive current and the signal current. As a result, more accurate heating amount information can be transmitted to the heat source, which allows heating control with higher accuracy.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The reaction device may further include a unit configured to stop a drive current during the period from acquisition of the heating amount information by the writer to acquisition of the next heating amount information.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The reaction device may be a PCR device that performs a gene amplification reaction in the reaction areas.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">By using the reaction device as a PCR device, temperature control of the heating cycle of the gene amplification reaction can be carried out for each reaction area individually with high accuracy. As a result, the amplification factors of the samples loaded in the respective reaction areas can be uniformed to a constant magnification factor. Consequently, individual and high-accuracy temperature control can be carried out for each reaction area, which allows exhaustive analysis with high accuracy.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The reaction device used as the PCR device may further include an optical unit configured to irradiate<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the reaction areas with excitation light having a predetermined wavelength, and a fluorescence detector configured to detect fluorescence generated due to irradiation of the excitation light.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">By further providing the PCR device with the optical unit and the fluorescence detector, the gene amplification reaction can be analyzed in real time.</p><heading id="h0006">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0038" num="0038"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a circuit diagram showing the circuit arrangement of a heating part included in a reaction device according to one embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a circuit diagram showing one state of the circuit operation of the circuit of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a circuit diagram showing another state of the circuit operation of the circuit of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a circuit diagram showing a modification example of the circuit arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> is a circuit diagram showing another modification example of the circuit arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> is a circuit diagram showing yet another modification example of the circuit arrangement shown in<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> is a circuit diagram showing yet another modification example of the circuit arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> is a circuit diagram showing a specific configuration example of the circuit of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> is a block diagram of heating parts included in a reaction device according to one embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref> is a circuit diagram showing a modification example of the circuit arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11</figref> is a circuit diagram showing another modification example of the circuit arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 12</figref> is a circuit diagram showing yet another modification example of the circuit arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 13</figref> is a circuit diagram showing yet another modification example of the circuit arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 14</figref> is a conceptual sectional view of a first application example in which the reaction device according to the embodiment of the present invention is used as a PCR device; and<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 15</figref> is a conceptual sectional view of a second application example in which the reaction device according to the embodiment of the present invention is used as a PCR device.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0039" num="0039">Reaction devices according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described below based on the accompanying drawings.

In this manner, the drain-source voltage Vds of the transistor T1 at the time of writing does not correspond with that at the time of driving in<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> general.

Due to this configuration, the temperatures of the respective reaction areas A1 can be individually controlled with high accuracy.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">It is also possible to carry out higher-accuracy temperature control by employing the heating amount information obtained in consideration of the temperature information of the respective reaction areas A1. As a result, the gene expression dose can be analyzed with high accuracy. Details of the respective components of the PCR device 1 will be described below.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">The well substrate 11 has the plural reaction areas (wells) A1. A predetermined reaction is performed in the reaction area A1. For example, this well substrate 11 is formed of a low-fluorescence-emission plastic material or glass. In the well substrate 11, substantially the same number of reaction areas A1 as the number of genes of a human can be arranged in a matrix.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">In the embodiment of the present invention, it is<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> desirable that the reaction area (well) A1 for a PCR reaction be a micro-space. For example, if one well has a size of 300 µm × 300 µm × 300 µm (a volume of about 30 nL) and about forty thousand wells are arranged in a PCR device, this device will have an area of about six centimeters square.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">The shapes of the individual reaction areas A1 are not particularly limited, but any shape is available as long as the reaction areas A1 can hold a reaction solution therein. A suitable shape can be optionally selected in consideration of the optical path for emission and introduction of the excitation light beams L1 and L2, the optical path for detection of the fluorescence L3, and so forth. In the PCR device 1, the reaction areas A1 have a curved part so that the fluorescence L3 can be reflected in the reaction area A1.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">In order to suppress the lowering of the detection sensitivity due to the influence of light scattering and external light, it is desirable that the reaction areas A1 be coated by a light-shielding material (e.g. diamondlike carbon).</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">In the embodiment of the present embodiment, the light source 12 and the excitation-light scanning plate 13 for guiding the excitation light beam L1 to the<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> respective reaction areas A1 can be used as an optical unit that allows all of the plural reaction areas A1 to be irradiated with excitation light having a specific wavelength.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">The kind of the light source 12 is not particularly limited as long as the light source 12 can emit light of a specific wavelength. However, it is desirable to use a white or single-color light emitting diode (LED) as the light source 12. Using a light emitting diode allows easy acquisition of light free from unnecessary ultraviolet and infrared rays.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">In the embodiment of the present invention, there is no particular limitation on the place of the light source 12 and the number of light sources. Although not shown in a drawing, plural light sources 12 may be so provided as to face the respective reaction areas A1 and each light source 12 may emit excitation light directly toward the corresponding reaction area A1. In this configuration, each reaction area A1 can be directly irradiated with excitation light by the light source 12. Thus, a larger amount of excitation light can be obtained. Furthermore, the light amounts of the excitation light beams L1 and L2 can be individually controlled, and thus the respective reaction areas A1 can be uniformly<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> irradiated with the excitation light beams L1 and L2.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">The excitation-light scanning plate 13 guides the excitation light beam L1 emitted from the light source 12 to the respective reaction areas A1 in the well substrate 11. The excitation light beam L1 emitted from the light source 12 is introduced into the spacer 131 inside the excitation-light scanning plate 13. A reflective film 132 is provided at the bottom of the excitation-light scanning plate 13, and can introduce the excitation light beam L2 into the well substrate 11. Due to this structure, a fluorescent substance in the reaction liquid in the respective reaction areas A1 can be excited with a uniform light amount. There is no particular limitation on the material and so on of the reflective film 132. However, it is desirable to use a dichroic mirror as the reflective film 132.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">Furthermore, in the embodiment of the present invention, it is desirable to provide over the excitation-light scanning plate 13 a filter 133 that allows the passage of only a light beam having the same wavelength as that of the excitation light beams L1 and L2. Due to the filter 133, the excitation light beam L2 can be efficiently extracted from the light emitted by the light source 12 and be guided to the reaction areas<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> A1. As this filter 133, e.g. a polarizing filter can be used.</p><p id="p0105" num="0105">The excitation light beam L2 guided to the reaction area A1 is applied to a fluorescent substance or the like of probes in the reaction liquid in the reaction area A1. This generates the fluorescence L3. This fluorescence L3 is reflected by the wall surface of the reaction area A1 so as to be detected and measured by the fluorescence detector 15 provided below the reaction area A1.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">In the embodiment of the present invention, the filter 14 can be disposed between the reaction area A1 and the fluorescence detector 15 so that light of a specific wavelength can be extracted. The material of the filter 14 is not limited as long as light of a specific wavelength (e.g. fluorescence L3) can be extracted therethrough. For example, a dichroic mirror can be used as the filter 14.</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">The fluorescence detector 15 detects and measures fluorescence that is emitted due to excitation of a fluorescent dye intercalated in probes in response to the excitation light beam L2 guided to the reaction area A1.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">In the PCR device 1, the heating part 16 is provided for each reaction area A1. The heating part 16 includes a temperature control mechanism, which allows<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> the heating part 16 to carry out temperature control of the reaction area A1. Due to this configuration, e.g. in the case of carrying out a PCR cycle, higher-accuracy temperature control can be carried out for the steps of "thermal denaturation → annealing → extension reaction".</p><p id="p0109" num="0109"><figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 15</figref> is a conceptual sectional view of a second application example in which the reaction device according to the embodiment of the present invention is used as a PCR device. In the following, differences from the configuration shown in <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 14</figref> are mainly described, and the description of the same parts is omitted.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">This PCR device 2 is the same as the PCR device 1 of <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 14</figref> in that a fluorescence detector 25 and a heating part 26 are provided over a measurement substrate 27 for each reaction area (well) A2. However, the PCR device 2 is different from the PCR device 1 in that the excitation light beam L2 is guided through the upper part of a well substrate 21 and the fluorescence L3 that has passed through the reaction area A2 is detected.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">In the PCR device 2, the excitation light beam L1 emitted from a light source 22 is guided to the reaction area A2 by an excitation-light scanning plate 23. The excitation light beam L1 passes through a spacer 231 in the excitation-light scanning plate 23, so that the<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> excitation light beam L2 is guided to the well substrate 21 by a reflective film 232 and a filter 233.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">The excitation light beam L2 is applied to a fluorescent substance or the like of probes in the reaction liquid in the reaction area A2. This generates the fluorescence L3. This fluorescence L3 is detected and measured by the fluorescence detector 25 provided below the reaction area A2.</p><p id="p0113" num="0113">Temperature control is carried out by the heating part 26 provided below the reaction area A2, and temperature control such as a heating cycle can be carried out by a Peltier element 28 and so on.</p><p id="p0114" num="0114">In a typical PCR device, the cycle of "thermal denaturation → annealing → extension reaction" is carried out about thirty times, and the thirty cycles take a reaction time of 25 to 30 minutes. In the cycles, temperature control with a temperature change rate of about 2° C/second is carried out. In contrast, in the PCR device according to the embodiment of the present invention, temperature control with a temperature change rate of about 20°C or higher/second is possible. Thus, the time shortening by about 40 seconds per one cycle is possible, and thus a reaction time shorter than 25 minutes can be achieved for the whole of the thirty<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> cycles.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">Furthermore, the annealing time and the extension reaction time can be controlled depending on the design of primers, and thus the amplification factor can be uniformed to a constant multiplication factor (e.g. twice). Consequently, the accuracy of detection of the gene expression dose can be enhanced.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56986166" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Reaktionsvorrichtung (1), die Folgendes umfasst:
