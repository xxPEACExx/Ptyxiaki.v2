As a control circuit mounted in the anti-blinding device 2 controls the liquid crystal display, i.e. the anti-blinding plate 5 to be darkened such that the illumination intensity of light passing through the anti-blinding plate 5 is reduced, the anti-blinding device 2 may serve to protect the eyes of a welder who wears the welding helmet 1.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The above described conventional electronic welding helmet including the anti-blinding device has been developed to provide the welder with a fixed darkness degree of a shutter (i.e. the anti-blinding plate), or to change a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> darkness degree of the shutter to a standard level according to a welding operation environment. The conventional electronic welding helmet also enables not only control of a shutter operation to shield welding light, but also variable control of a shutter delay time to prevent the welder's eyes from being blinded by light emitted from a base metal after welding.

More particularly, the light detecting device 30 serves to detect light generated from a welding or cutting torch.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The main control device 40 functions to set a reference value required to control the detection sensitivity of the light detecting device 30 based on an input signal from the control switch 60 and also, to set a light transmittance and operation delay time of the anti-blinding plate 51. If the luminance of light detected by the light detecting device 30 is a preset reference value or more, the main control device 40 determines that the light is welding light, and then, operates the light transmission control device 50 based on the determined result.
