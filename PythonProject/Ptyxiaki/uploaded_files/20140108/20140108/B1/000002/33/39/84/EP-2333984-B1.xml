load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of wireless communication systems, and more specifically, to an apparatus and method for improving the formation of transmitted signals and processing of received signals by providing a remote unit for use with a method of altering the beam shaping characteristics of the antenna elements in a receiving or transmitting communication station that includes an array of antenna elements to take into account a changing interference environment.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Adaptive smart antenna processing may be used in a communication station (e.g., a base station) equipped with multiple antennas to either reject interference when communicating from a subscriber unit to the communication station (i.e., on the uplink) or to deliver power in a spatially or spatio-temporally selective manner when communicating from the communication station to a subscriber unit (i.e., on the downlink). Smart antenna communication systems may use linear spatial processing as part of the adaptive smart antenna processing of the received signals during uplink communications. In this situation, amplitude and phase adjustments are applied, typically in baseband, to each of the signals received at the antenna array elements to select (i.e., preferentially receive) the signals of interest while minimizing any signals or noise not of interest (i.e., interference). Such amplitude and phase adjustment can be described by a complex valued weight, the receive weight, and the receive weights for all elements of the array can be described by a complex valued vector, the receive weight vector.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Similarly, the downlink signal transmitted from the base station to remote receivers may be formed by adjusting, typically, but not necessarily in baseband, the amplitude and phase of the signals that are transmitted by each of the antennas of the antenna array. Such amplitude and phase control can be described by a complex valued weight, the transmit weight, and the weights for all elements of the array by a complex valued vector, the transmit weight vector. In some systems, the receive<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> (and/or transmit) weights include temporal processing terms, and in such cases, the receive (and/or transmit) weights may be functions of frequency and applied in the frequency domain or, equivalently, functions of time applied in the form of convolution kernels. Alternatively, each convolution kernel may itself be described by a set of complex numbers, so that the vector of convolution kernels may be re-written as a complex valued weight vector, which, for the case of there being M antennas and each kernel having K entries, would be a vector of KM entries.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The RF environment in which the base station is operating (i.e., the number and location of users of the communication systems and sources of interference, the physical propagation environment, and the condition of the transmitting and receiving systems) may change dynamically during usage of the communication system. In such a situation, an adaptive smart antenna processing system can be used to modify the system's processing strategies (e.g., modify the weights applied) for forming the transmitted beam and processing the received signals to compensate for the changes. This provides a method of adapting the signal transmission and received signal processing operations to reflect changes in the operating environment.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">One approach to modifying the signal transmission and received signal processing characteristics of a communication system uses the transmission of training signals which are previously known at the receiver. By examining the form of the known data when it is received, the receiver can estimate the user and interferer spatial or spatio-temporal signatures. This is useful because signature estimation facilitates the computation of downlink and uplink weights. The receive spatial signature characterizes how the base station array receives signals from a particular remote (e.g., subscriber) unit in the absence of any interference or other subscriber units. The transmit spatial signature of a particular user characterizes how that remote user receives signals from the base station in the absence of any interference. See United States patent <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5592490A"><text>5,592,490</text></patcit>, entitled "SPECTRALLY EFFICIENT HIGH CAPACITY WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS", to Barratt, et al., and United States patent <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5828658A"><text>5,828,658</text></patcit> , entitled "SPECTRALLY EFFICIENT HIGH CAPACITY WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS WITH SPATIO-TEMPORAL PROCESSING", to Ottersten, et al., both of which are assigned to the assignee of the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Another method of modifying the signal transmission and received signal processing characteristics of a communication system is based on inserting a period of silence at a known position in the transmitted signal. This is useful because all other signal energy received during this interval is assumed to constitute interference and thus represents a characteristic of the operating environment. See United States patent application serial no. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US08729387B"><text>08/729,387</text></patcit>, entitled "ADAPTIVE METHOD FOR CHANNEL ASSIGNMENT IN A CELLULAR COMMUNICATION SYSTEM", to Yun, et al., assigned to the assignee of the present invention.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP0899894A"><text>EP 0899894</text></patcit> describes the use of weights in a smart antenna system.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Thus, the training sequence and period of silence approaches both involve inserting data having a known characteristic into a set of data and then observing how that known data (or lack thereof) appears after propagation through the desired environment. The difference between the form of the known transmitted data and the received data is then used to estimate the characteristics of the environment and improve the processing of the unknown received data. While both of these approaches are useful, they have significant disadvantages because both methods expend valuable spectral bandwidth on signals which do not carry actual data. Furthermore, the methods are limited because they are only reliable to identify interference that overlaps spectrally or temporally with the training data or silence period.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">So called "blind" methods are also known and used to improve the formation of transmitted signals and the processing of received signals. Such methods use one or more properties of the received signal, such as a geometric propagation model, cyclo-stationarity, constant envelope, or finite alphabet, to separate the desired user signal from interference. The resulting estimated signals and parameters for the properties are then used to formulate uplink and downlink signal processing strategies. While blind methods can respond robustly to changes in the interference environment, these methods suffer from a high computational burden, the need for a large amount of data over which the interference environment remains substantially constant, and the "association problem." The latter problem entails deciding which of the communication waveforms present in the received data is the signal of interest and which are produced by interferers.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Blind weight determining methods usually are iterative. The speed of convergence of any iterative method is usually dependent on the quality of the initial value used for the weights in the iterative method. One common approach is to use a previously determined value of weights. In a rapidly changing interference environment, the quality of such a set of weights may be significantly degraded from when the set was determined.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Thus, there is a need in the art for apparatus and methods that overcome the limitations of known methods for processing transmitted or received signals to account for changes in the operating environment. In this regard, it is desirable to have such apparatus and methods which do not require training data. It is also desirable to have apparatus and methods with modest data computational requirements and which are capable of responding quickly and robustly to even large changes in the interference environment. It is also desirable to have methods that can rapidly compute a processing strategy that can be used as an initial condition for iterative strategy determination.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method in a remote unit.

The processing method may be implemented in a communication station that includes a receiver, an array of antennas and means for adaptive smart antenna processing of received signals. The processing method may also be implemented in a communication station that includes a transmitter, an array of antennas, and means for adaptive smart antenna processing of transmitted signals. In the examples presented below, the communication station includes a transceiver and the capability of implementing both uplink and downlink adaptive smart antenna processing.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">When receiving a signal from a subscriber (remote) unit, the signals received by each of the antenna array elements are combined by the adaptive smart antenna processing elements to provide an estimate of a signal received from that subscriber unit. In the preferred embodiment, the smart antenna processing comprises linear spatial processing, wherein each of the complex-valued (i.e., including in-phase I and quadrature Q components) signals received from the antenna elements is weighted in amplitude and phase by a weighting factor and the weighted signals are then summed to provide the signal estimate. The adaptive smart antenna processing scheme (i.e., the strategy) can then be described by a set of complex valued weights, one for each of the antenna elements. These complex valued weights can be described as a single complex valued vector of M elements, where M is the number of antenna elements. Thus, in the linear case, the smart antenna processing is designed to determine a set of weights such that the sum of the products of the weights times the antenna element signals provides an estimate of the remote user's transmitted signal which satisfies some prescribed "estimation quality" measure.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">This representation of the adaptive smart antenna processing can be extended to include spatio-temporal processing, where the signal at each antenna element, rather than being weighted in amplitude and phase, is filtered by a complex valued filter, typically for purposes of time equalization. In such a method, each filter can be described by a complex-valued transfer function or convolving function. The adaptive smart antenna processing of all elements can then be described by a complex valued M-vector of M complex valued convolving functions.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Several methods are known for determining the weighting vectors to be applied when processing received signals. These include methods that determine the directions of arrival of signals from subscriber units, and methods that use the spatial or spatio-temporal characteristics of subscriber units, for example, the spatial or spatio-temporal signatures. See for example United States patents <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US5515378A"><text>5,515,378</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US5642353A"><text>5,642,353</text></patcit>, entitled "SPATIAL DIVISION MULTIPLE ACCESS WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS", to Roy, et al. for methods that use directions of arrival. See also the above-referenced United States patents <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US5592490A"><text>5,592,490</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US5828658A"><text>5,828,658</text></patcit> for methods that use spatial and spatio-temporal signatures.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">"Blind" methods determine the weights from the signals themselves, but without resorting to a priori knowledge such as training signals or silent periods, that is, without determining what weights can best estimate a known symbol sequence (or in the case of the period silence, the absence of a known sequence). Such blind methods typically use some known characteristic of the signal transmitted by the subscriber unit to determine the best receive weights to use by constraining the estimated signal to have this property, and hence are sometimes referred to as property restoral methods.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Property restoral methods in turn can be classified into two groups. Simple property restoral methods restore one or more properties of the signal without completely reconstructing the modulated received signal, for example by demodulating and then re-modulating. More complex restoral methods typically rely upon reconstruction of the received signal.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Property restoral methods determine a signal (a "reference signal") that is constrained to the required property and then determine a set of weights corresponding to the reference signal, such that if the reference signal was transmitted by a remote<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> user, the signals at the antenna elements of the receiving array would be acceptably "close" to the signals actually received. One example of a simple restoral method is the constant modulus (CM) method, which is applicable to communication systems that use a modulation scheme having a constant modulus, including, for example phase modulation (PM), frequency modulation (FM), phase shift keying (PSK) and frequency shift keying (FSK). The CM method has also been shown to be applicable to non-CM signals. Other partial property restoral techniques include techniques that restore the spectral properties of the signal, such as the signal's spectral self-coherence.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">"Decision directed" (DD) methods construct a reference signal by making symbol decisions (e.g., demodulating) the received signal. Such decision directed methods use the fact that the modulation scheme of the transmitted subscriber unit signal is known, and then determine a signal (a "reference signal") that is constrained to have the characteristics of the required modulation scheme. In such a case, the reference signal production process includes making symbol decisions. Weights are determined that produce a reference signal, that if transmitted by a remote user, would produce signals at the antenna elements of the array that are acceptably "close" to the signals actually received. See, for example, United States patent application serial no. <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US08729390B"><text>08/729,390</text></patcit>, entitled "METHOD &amp; APPARATUS FOR DECISION DIRECTED DEMODULATION USING ANTENNA ARRAYS &amp; SPATIAL PROCESSING" to Barratt, et al., and serial no. 09/153,110, entitled "METHOD FOR REFERENCE SIGNAL GENERATION IN THE PRESENCE OF FREQ UENCY OFFSETS IN A COMMUNICATION STATION WITH SPATIAL PROCESSING" to Petrus, et al. for descriptions of systems that use decision directed weight determination methods.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As previously mentioned, weight determining schemes also are known that use training data, that is, data whose symbols are known a priori. The training data (possibly with a timing offset or frequency offset, or both applied) is then used as a reference signal to determine the smart antenna processing strategy (e.g., the weights). Therefore, reference signal based methods include the case in which the reference signal includes training data, the case in which the reference signal includes a signal constrained to have some property of the transmitted signal, and the case in which the reference signal includes constructing a signal based on making symbol decisions.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Non-linear uplink and downlink processing strategies also are known. In the uplink direction, such methods typically include demodulation and act to determine an estimate of the symbols transmitted by a desired remote user from the set of signals received at the antenna elements of the communication station. One known example of such a processing scheme is based on a Viterbi algorithm using branch metrics. In this regard, it is noted that the present disclosure is not limited to linear spatial and spatio-temporal processing methods that include weight determining, but also is equally applicable to non-linear methods such as those based on Viterbi algorithms and branch metrics, which may not necessarily include determining weights.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">All the above strategy computation methods have the following elements in common: they include use of a known or determined reference signal, they determine a strategy based on processing received signal data, and they to take into account the one or more aspects of operating environment, e.g., the location, number, and characteristics of interfering transmitters, changing characteristics of the channel, etc. Such an operating environment is referred to herein as the interference environment, and such strategy determining methods are called "interference mitigating" weight determining methods herein.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In theory, adaptive smart antenna processing permits more than one communication link to exist in a single "conventional" communication channel so long as the subscriber units that share the conventional channel can be spatially (or spatio-temporally) resolved. A conventional channel includes a frequency channel in a frequency division multiple access (FDMA) system, a time slot in a time division multiple access (TDMA) system (which usually also includes FDMA, so the conventional channel is a time and frequency slot), and a code in a code division multiple access (CDMA) system. The conventional channel is then said to be divided into one or more "spatial" channels, and when more than one spatial channel exists per conventional channel, the multiplexing is called space division multiple access (SDMA). SDMA is used herein to include the possibility of adaptive smart antenna processing, both with one and with more than one spatial channel per conventional channel.</p><heading id="h0007">Base Station Architecture</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --><p id="p0032" num="0032">One example of the disclosed method and apparatus is implemented in a communication receiver, in particular, a Personal Handyphone System (PHS)-based antenna-array communication station (transceiver) such as that shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1</figref>, with M antenna elements in the antenna array. The PHS standard is described, for example, in the Association of Radio Industries and Businesses (ARIB, Japan) Preliminary Standard, Version 2, RCR STD-28 and variations are described in Technical Standards of the PHS Memorandum of Understanding Group (PHS MoU - see http://www.phsmou.or.jp). The disclosed examples may be implemented in two versions of the communication station of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1</figref>, one aimed at low-mobility PHS system, with M=4, and another, aimed at a wireless local loop (WLL) system, with a variable number, with typically M=12.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">It will be appreciated that this approach need not be restricted to using the PHS air interface or to TDMA systems, but may be utilized as part of any communication receiver that includes adaptive smart antenna processing means, including CDMA systems using the IS-95 air interface and systems that use the common GSM air interface.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In the system of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1</figref>, a transmit/receive ("TR") switch 107 is connected between an M-antenna array 103 and both transmit electronics 113 (including one or more transmit signal processors 119 and M transmitters 120), and receive electronics 121 (including M receivers 122 and one or more receive signal processors 123). Switch 107 is used to selectively connect one or more elements of antenna array 103 to the transmit electronics 113 when in the transmit mode and to receive electronics 121 when in the receive mode. Two possible implementations of switch 107 are as a frequency duplexer in a frequency division duplex (FDD) system, and as a time switch in a time division duplex (TDD) system.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The PHS form of the approach described above uses TDD. The transmitters 120 and receivers 122 may be implemented using analog electronics, digital electronics, or a combination of the two. Receivers according to this approach 122 generate digitized signals that are fed to signal processor or processors 123. Signal processors 119 and 123 incorporate software and/or hardware for implementing the disclosed method and may be static (always the same processing stages), dynamic (changing processing depending on desired directivity), or smart (changing processing<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> depending on received signals). In the approach described above, processors 119 and 123 are adaptive. Signal processors 119 and 123 may be the same DSP device or DSP devices with different programming for the reception and transmission, or different DSP devices, or different devices for some functions, and the same for others. Elements 131 and 133 are for implementing the method for downlink and uplink processing, respectively, in this approach, and include programming instructions for implementing the processing methods.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Note that while <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> shows a transceiver in which the same antenna elements are used for both reception and transmission, it should be clear that separate antennas for receiving and transmitting may also be used, and that antennas capable of only receiving or only transmitting or both receiving and transmitting may be used with adaptive smart antenna processing.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The PHS system is an 8 slot time division multiple access (TDMA) system with true time division duplex (TDD). Thus, the 8 timeslots are divided into 4 transmit (TX) timeslots and 4 receive (RX) timeslots. This implies that for any particular channel, the receive frequency is the same as the transmit frequency. It also implies reciprocity, i.e., the propagation path for both the downlink (from base station to users' remote terminals) and the uplink (from users' remote terminals to base station) is identical, assuming minimal motion of the subscriber unit between receive timeslots and transmit timeslots. The frequency band of the PHS system used in the preferred embodiment is 1895-1918.1 MHz. Each of the 8 timeslots is 625 microseconds long. The PHS system includes a dedicated frequency and timeslot for a control channel on which call initialization takes place. Once a link is established, the call is handed to a service channel for regular communications. Communication occurs in any channel at the rate of 32 kbits per second (kbps), a rate termed the "full rate". Less than full rate communication is also possible, and the details of how to modify the examples described herein to incorporate less than full rate communication would be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In the PHS used in the above approach, a burst is defined as the finite duration RF signal that is transmitted or received over the air during a single timeslot. A group is defined as one set of 4 TX and 4 RX timeslots. A group always begins with the first TX timeslot, and its time duration is 8 x 0.625 = 5 msec.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The PHS system uses (π/4 differential quaternary (or quadrature) phase shift keying (π/4 DQPSK) modulation for the baseband signal.

In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, a plurality of M antennas 103 are used, where M = 4. More or fewer antenna elements may be used. The outputs of the antennas are connected to a duplexer switch 107, which in this TDD system is a time switch. When receiving, the antenna outputs are connected via switch 107 to a receiver 205, and are mixed down in analog by RF receiver modules 205 from the carrier frequency (around 1.9 GHz) to an intermediate frequency ("IF"). This signal is then digitized (sampled) by analog to digital converters ("ADCs") 209. The result is then down converted digitally by digital downconverter 213 to produce a four-times oversampled complex valued (in phase I and quadrature Q) sampled signal. Thus, elements 205, 209 and 213 correspond to elements that might be found in receiver 122 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. For each of the M receive timeslots, the M downconverted outputs from the M antennas are fed to a digital signal processor (DSP) device 217 (hereinafter "timeslot processor") for further processing. In the above approach, commercial DSP devices are used as timeslot processors, one per receive timeslot per spatial channel.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The timeslot processors 217 perform several functions, which may include the following: received signal power monitoring, frequency offset estimation/correction and timing offset estimation/correction, smart antenna processing (including determining receive weights for each antenna element to determine a signal from a particular remote user, in accordance with the present disclosure), and demodulation of the determined signal.

The disclosure, however, also is applicable to non-linear processing strategies, for example those that use Viterbi algorithm with branch metrics. The current example may conveniently be described by considering received data to be one of two types: primary data, for which a reference signal (or other characterizing information) is available, and secondary data, for which a reference signal may or may not be available. The primary data is the data that is used in some known processing strategy (e.g., weight) determining process, and one goal is to adaptively update or improve this process by using "secondary" data, for example more<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> recent data, without carrying out all of the computational steps required by the known process when applied to the primary data.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">For example, secondary data might come from the payload of the current burst or from a future data burst (possibly on a new channel). The source of the reference signal for the primary data depends on the particular known strategy (e.g., weight) determining process to which the disclosed method is applied: it could be, without limitation, from previous CM method iterations or from DD iterations, or training data. Thus, the present disclosure is generally directed to a modified or adaptive transmit and receive smart antenna processing strategy computation method (e.g., a weight determining method) in which an amount of secondary data is combined with primary data prior to execution of an existing strategy computation method. This permits incorporation of additional information into the primary data prior to execution of the strategy computation method on that data.

where β is an adjustable factor. Preferably, β is set large enough to cause the weights to respond to interference that is present in the secondary data Z<sub>2</sub>, while not so large as to degrade the performance of the weights when no new interference is present in the secondary data. This constraint provides a means of testing the desirability of different values of β, perhaps in an iterative manner.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">One way to determine if the weights have responded adequately to interference is to apply the weights to tertiary data that contains both a desired signal (with the same structure as the signal in Z<sub>1</sub> that corresponds to the reference signal) and an interference signal (with the same structure as the interference present in Z<sub>2</sub>). The resulting signal quality can be estimated and taken as a measure of the interference-rejecting performance of a particular value of β. Signal quality measuring and estimating methods are known, and an improved signal estimation method and apparatus is disclosed in United States patent application serial no. <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="US09020049B"><text>09/020, 049 to Yun</text></patcit> entitled "POWER CONTROL WITH SIGNAL QUALITY ESTIMATION FOR SMART ANTENNA COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS,".</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Similarly, one way to determine if a value of β generates weights with degraded performance in the absence of new interference is to apply the weights to Z<sub>1</sub> and estimate the resulting signal quality.

Conversely, β must be large enough to allow the strategy generating method to recognize and respond to interference. In the preferred least-squares embodiment, the sensitivity of the weights to interference increases with the number of samples in Z<sub>1</sub>, so β can be reduced as the number of samples grows.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">One application of the method of determining weights incorporating the effects of secondary data is to provide an initial strategy to use in an iterative strategy determining method. In a system which communicates burst-by-burst, like the PHS system of the disclosed examples, an iterative method may be used for weight determining, an in the prior-art, the initial values of the weights may be the weights determined from the previous burst. Using any of the approaches described herein, the initial value used may be improved by taking into account new (secondary) data to produce an improved initial set of weights.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">When further iterations are employed (e.g., using the same weight calculation method as in the first iteration, preferably with β =0, or alternatively with a completely different iterative weight calculation method), a larger initial value of β may be selected. This will increase the interference rejection performance at the expense of decreased signal quality when the interference environment does not change. The loss in signal quality will be reversed by the subsequent iterations. One useful constraint on β, then, is that the signal quality after the first iteration be high enough to allow the later iterations to rapidly converge.

For such air interfaces the desired user signal and the interferer signals are received intermittently; some bursts contain the desired user signal only, some bursts contain interferers only, and some bursts containing both or neither. As a further complicating factor, the decision to transmit a signal to the desired user on a given burst may be independent of whether the preceding received burst contains a signal from that user. A useful downlink transmission strategy under these conditions is to direct a beam towards the desired user and to direct nulls towards all interferers that were received during the last several bursts, say N<sub>T</sub> bursts. Downlink weights that substantially implement this strategy may be computed by setting Z<sub>1</sub> equal to the last received burst that contains a signal from the desired user, and setting Z<sub>2</sub> equal to the concatenation of those bursts within the last N<sub>T</sub> bursts that do not contain a signal from the desired user. In an alternative simplified implementation Z<sub>2</sub> is set equal to the concatenation of the N<sub>T</sub> most recent bursts, regardless of whether they contain the desired user signal or not.

In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure, the past array inputs (in general any primary data) are modified by adding a scaled version of the present array inputs (in general, any secondary data) to the past array inputs prior to computation of the strategy. Thus, in this case the input "signal" used as part of the weight determining computation (along with the reference signal) is a linear combination of the primary and secondary data (e.g., Datap<sub>rimary</sub> + β Data<sub>secondary</sub>).</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">Note that in some circumstances, the method shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 13</figref> might need an additional functional block not shown to deal with the situation when the amount of primary and secondary data is different, for example there is less secondary data than primary data. In such a case, the amount of primary data may be reduced to be equal to the amount of secondary data, or the amount of secondary data can be extended, for example, by data repetition. The main criterion for extending the data (primary or<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> secondary, whichever is the smaller in quantity) is to maintain whichever property ("characteristic feature" or "characteristic features") of the data is used by the strategy generating method.

The implementation in general includes a signal synthesizer which generates a signal (e.g., a synthetic signal) that has substantially the same characteristic feature or features the strategy-generator uses (implicitly or explicitly) as the secondary data. The generated signal, for example, may be a random signal. The generated signal should have the same spatio-temporal properties as the secondary data (e.g., the present array inputs), measured, for example, by the empirical covariance matrix. One advantage of this method is that the existing hardware or software may not readily accommodate the copying of a potentially large signal from one place to another; in such a case it could be faster to simply transmit the covariance to a secondary processor.

In the approach as applied to PHS, one way this "false" this convergence may be detected is using the 16 bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) present in each PHS burst to test the payload of the burst for corruption.

One aspect of the disclosed method is overcoming this limitation by using as the primary data the most recent burst and reference signal to pass a reference signal selection test, for example the CRC test, and using as the secondary data the current burst yet to be processed.

The updating of the strategy computation process can be used to alter the antenna beamforming (and nullforming) characteristics of an array of antenna elements in order to adapt to a changing operating environment, e.g., differences in the location, number, or motion of interfering transmitters, changing characteristics of the channel, etc., which may differ between data bursts. Such a changing operating environment is referred to as a changing interference environment. In one approach, the disclosed method alters the data set used as an input to a known processing strategy computation method by incorporating a scaled version of a second set of data, or a characteristic of the second set of data. The combination of the first data set and the scaled version of the second data set is input to the known processing strategy computation method in place of using the first data set as an input. The resulting processing strategy computation method is thereby altered to incorporate information obtained from the second set of data, but without the computational overhead required to completely process the second set of data.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">Note that the apparatus and method does not need to explicitly identify any new interferer waveforms and does not need to attempt to separate the desired remote user signal from the interferer in the secondary data, for example, the present burst. For example, in the signal injection examples, no computation other than scaling of the secondary data and combination of that scaled data with the primary data is performed.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">Note also that the various approaches can be used in a wireless receiver that has an array of antenna elements for processing signals received at the antenna elements, or in a wireless transmitter having an array of antenna elements for processing a signal to be transmitted to form signals for transmission by the antenna elements. In general, the term "wireless station" therefore may be used for a receiver having an array of antenna elements or for a transmitter having an array of antenna elements or for a transceiver having an array of antenna elements for both reception and transmission.<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --></p><p id="p0117" num="0117">The terms and expressions which have been used herein are used as terms of description and not of limitation, and there is no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding equivalents of the features shown and described, or portions thereof, it being recognized that various modifications are possible within the scope of the invention claimed.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56985785" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Verfahren in einer entfernten Einheit, wobei das Verfahren umfasst:
