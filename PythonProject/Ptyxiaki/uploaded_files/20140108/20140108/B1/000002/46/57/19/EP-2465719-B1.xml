load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a battery casing for receiving battery modules for an electric vehicle.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">A battery unit used for an electric vehicle typically includes multiple battery modules and a battery casing that receives the battery modules. One type of structure of a battery casing includes a tray member that supports battery modules and a cover member that covers the top of the tray member, as disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2010153130A"><text>2010-153130</text></patcit> (<patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2010153130A"><text>JP 2010-153130 A</text></patcit>). In this structure, the tray member and the cover member are coupled together by means of multiple bolts and nuts at the joint part between the periphery of the tray member and the periphery of the cover member.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The tray member included in the battery casing disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2010153130A"><text>JP 2010-153130 A</text></patcit> is provided with partitioning walls extending in the width direction for dividing the tray member in the longitudinal direction, and separation walls (ribs) extending in the front-rear direction for dividing the tray member into multiple<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> compartments. The multiple battery modules are placed into the respective sections separated by the partitioning walls and the separation walls and are secured therein.<br/>
For a larger battery casing that receives larger-capacity battery modules, a higher stiffness is required so as to withstand the weight of the battery modules. As disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2010153130A"><text>JP 2010-153130 A</text></patcit>, such a battery casing is made from a fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) having the electric insulation property, and separation walls are provided to the tray member that supports the battery modules, for securing the battery modules, as well as enhancing the stiffness of the casing.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For a tray member made from a fiber reinforced plastic, in order for the separation walls provided in the tray member to secure sufficient stiffness required for the battery casing, the separation walls must be formed thicker. However, forming thicker separation walls means reduced space for receiving the battery modules on the tray member.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="EP1950070A"><text>EP 1 950 070 A</text></patcit> discloses a structure for mounting batteries onto electric vehicles.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention was conceived of in view of the above issue, and an object thereof is to provide a battery casing which can enhance the stiffness of the battery casing, while providing sufficient space in a tray member. This object can be achieved by the features specified in the claims.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In order to solve the above-described issue, a battery casing of the present invention is a battery casing for receiving a battery<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> for driving an electric vehicle including: a tray member made from a resin and supporting the battery; a support member provided under a lower face of the tray member and supporting the tray member from a bottom thereof; a standing wall provided so as to stand in the tray member; and a sheet metal tray member made from a sheet metal and placed on the tray member.<br/>
Furthermore, the sheet metal tray member includes a plurality of sheet metal recesses that receive the battery and a sheet metal flange section placed on an upper face of the standing wall.<br/>
Furthermore, the standing wall includes a through hole formed through the standing wall in a standing direction of the standing wall.<br/>
In addition, the support member and the sheet metal flange are fastened to the tray member by means of a sheet metal fastening member provided through the through hole.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is preferred that the standing wall is a partitioning wall extending in a transverse direction of the tray member and provided in a center portion in the longitudinal direction, or a surrounding wall at the ends in the longitudinal direction of the tray member.<br/>
Furthermore, it is preferred that the battery includes a battery flange placed on the upper face of the standing wall, the support member and the battery flange are fastened to the tray member by means of a battery fastening member provided through the through hole, and the sheet metal fastening member and the battery fastening member are arranged side by side.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the above configuration, it is more preferred that the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> sheet metal fastening member and the battery fastening member each include a through nut inserted in the through hole and a bolt, and the support member and the sheet metal flange, and the support member and the battery flange are fastened to the tray member once the bolt is screwed with the through nut from the upper face of the standing wall and the lower face of the tray member.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In accordance with the battery casing of the present invention, a sheet metal tray member is placed on a resin tray member that supports the battery. The sheet metal flange is provided on the upper face of the standing wall of the tray member, and the support member is provided under the lower face of the standing wall. In other words, the standing wall of the tray member is sandwiched between the sheet metal flange and the support member, and the sheet metal flange and the support member are fastened to the standing wall of the tray member by means of the sheet metal fastening member. Accordingly, the stiffness of the standing wall is enhanced, thereby enhancing the stiffness of the entire battery casing. Thus, the thickness of the standing wall provided so as to stand on the tray member can be reduced, which helps to increase the space for receiving the battery. As described above, the battery casing of the present invention is more suitable as a casing for large-capacitance batteries since the stiffness is enhanced and space for receiving the batteries is increased.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The nature of this invention, as well as other objects and<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> advantages thereof, will be explained in the following with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters designate the same or similar parts throughout the figures and wherein:

Furthermore, enhancement of the stiffness of the standing walls can also help to reduce the thicknesses of the standing walls provided so as to stand on the tray member 10. In other words, the reduced stiffness of thinner standing walls can be compensated for by the sheet metal flanges 42 and the support member 30.

Furthermore, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the ribs 41d made from sheet metals are thinner than ribs 11f made from a resin.

Generally, since batteries used for driving an electric vehicle require higher outputs, their capacities tend to be increased, as compared to other batteries (such as batteries for auxiliary machines of the vehicle). Such larger-capacity batteries tend to generate stronger electromagnetic waves than other batteries. A battery casing only made from a resin tray member would not shield electromagnetic waves generated by the batteries. In contrast, the battery casing 7 according to the present invention includes sheet metal tray members 40 and is able to shield electromagnetic waves. Accordingly, disadvantages can be reduced, such as noise in in-vehicle radio caused by electromagnetic waves from the batteries.<br/>
Furthermore, the battery casing 7 according to the present invention is more suitable as a casing for larger-capacity batteries since the stiffness is enhanced and space for receiving the batteries is increased.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Although an embodiment of the present invention has been described, the present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above and various modifications may be made without departing from the present invention.<br/>

Furthermore, the sizes and the numbers of the sheet metal flanges 42 and the battery flanges 81 are not limited to those in the above-described embodiment. The sheet metal flanges 42 and the battery flanges 81 may be partially overlapped, as long as the sheet metal tray through holes 46 and the battery through holes 86 are not overlapped.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --></p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Furthermore, the numbers of the through holes 6 provided in the standing walls and the like are not limited to those in the above-described embodiment. In other words, at least three through holes 6 (i.e., two at the ends and one at the center of the sheet metal flanges 42) are required for fastening the sheet metal flanges 42 of the sheet metal tray members 40. This number can be suitably adjusted in accordance with the length of the sheet metal flanges 42. Furthermore, the number of through holes 6 for securing the battery module 8 is determined by the number of the battery module 8 to be received in the tray member 10.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Furthermore, the sheet metal fastening members 50 and the battery fastening members 60 may not be constructed from the through nuts 51 and 61 and the bolts 52 and 62. For example, the sheet metal fastening members 50 and the battery fastening members 60 may be constructed from bolts longer than the through holes 6 and weld nuts, or may be constructed from through bolts and nuts. Furthermore, the sheet metal fastening members 50 and the battery fastening members 60 may have different configurations, or may not be arranged side by side.</p><heading id="h0001">Following is a list of reference signs.</heading><p id="p0055" num="0055"><dl id="dl0001"><dt>6</dt><dd>THROUGH-HOLE</dd><dt>7</dt><dd>BATTERY CASING</dd><dt>8</dt><dd>BATTERY MODULE (BATTERY)</dd><dt>10</dt><dd>TRAY MEMBER<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --></dd><dt>11</dt><dd>SURROUNDING WALL (STANDING WALL)</dd><dt>11a</dt><dd>FRONT WALL (STANDING WALL)</dd><dt>11b</dt><dd>REAR WALL (STANDING WALL)</dd><dt>13</dt><dd>PARTITIONING WALL (STANDING WALL)</dd><dt>13F</dt><dd>FRONT PARTITIONING WALL (STANDING WALL)</dd><dt>13R</dt><dd>REAR PARTITIONING WALL (STANDING WALL)</dd><dt>16</dt><dd>TRAY THROUGH-HOLE (THROUGH-HOLE)</dd><dt>20</dt><dd>COVER MEMBER</dd><dt>30</dt><dd>SUPPORT MEMBER</dd><dt>31</dt><dd>WIDTH-DIRECTION SUPPORT</dd><dt>40</dt><dd>SHEET METAL TRAY MEMBER</dd><dt>41</dt><dd>SHEET METAL RECESS</dd><dt>42</dt><dd>SHEET METAL FLANGE</dd><dt>50</dt><dd>SHEET METAL FASTENING MEMBER</dd><dt>51</dt><dd>THROUGH NUT</dd><dt>52</dt><dd>BOLT</dd><dt>60</dt><dd>BATTERY FASTENING MEMBER</dd><dt>61</dt><dd>THROUGH NUT</dd><dt>62</dt><dd>BOLT</dd><dt>81</dt><dd>BATTERY FLANGE</dd></dl>
