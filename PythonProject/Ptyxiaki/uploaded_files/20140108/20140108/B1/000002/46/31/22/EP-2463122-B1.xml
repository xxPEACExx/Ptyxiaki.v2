Assuming that axial widths of the crown rib 5, middle ribs 6, and shoulder ribs 7 are designated as w5, w6, and w7, respectively, the relationship w5≤w6≤w7 holds in this embodiment.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The crown main grooves 3 and the shoulder main grooves 4 are straight grooves extending circumferentially in a straight line, and are arranged in linear symmetry with respect to the ti re equator Co.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> widths and depths of the crown main grooves 3 and the shoulder main grooves 4 may be preferably identical to widths and depths of common circumferential main grooves. In the case of tires for passenger car, for example, the groove width is preferably not less than 3 mm, in particular not less than 5 mm, and not more than 14 mm, in particular not more than 12 mm. In addition, the groove depth is preferably not less than 5 mm, in particular not less than 6 mm, and not more than 12 mm, in particular not more than 10 mm. In this embodiment, the crown main grooves 3 have a groove width W3 of 10.5 mm and a groove depth H3 of 8.2 mm, and the shoulder main grooves 4 have a groove width w4 of 8.2 mm and a groove depth H4 of 8.2 mm.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Each shoulder rib 7 is provided with a plurality of shoulder lateral grooves 10 at a tire circumferential pitch Ps, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>. The shoulder lateral grooves 10 extend at an angle α of from 65 to 115 degrees with respect to a tire circumferential direction, from axial outside of the tread edges Te to axial inside. Such a shoulder lateral grooves 10 are formed at an angle approximate to that of a flowing water line. This realizes effective water drainage toward outside of the tread edges Te and provides sufficient lateral rigidity of the shoulder ribs 7, thereby improving uneven wear resistance. If the angle α deviates from the range of from 65 to 115 degrees, the foregoing advantages cannot be achieved.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In this embodiment, the shoulder lateral grooves 10 have axial inner ends 10ei discontinued within the shoulder ribs 7. In addition, the shoulder ribs 7 are provided with shoulder narrow grooves 11<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> extending in circumferential direction through the axial inner ends 10ei of the shoulder lateral grooves 10. Therefore, high circumferential rigidity of the shoulder ribs 7 is maintained, which contributes to improvement in steering stability.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The groove width w11 of the shoulder narrow grooves 11 is smaller than the groove width W4 of the shoulder main grooves 4. In this embodiment, the groove width W11 is set not more than 3 mm, preferably not more than 2 mm. The groove depth H11 of the shoulder narrow grooves 11 is smaller than the groove depth H4 of the shoulder main grooves 4. In this embodiment, the groove depth H11 is set not more than 3 mm, preferably not more than 2 mm.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The shoulder lateral groove 10 has a groove width w10 set smaller than the groove width W4 and larger than the groove width w11. In addition, the shoulder lateral groove 10 has a groove depth (depth of a deepest portion) H10 set at the groove depth H4 or less and larger than the groove depth H11.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Distance Ds between the shoul der main groove 4 and the shoul der narrow groove 11 is preferably set in a range of from 2.5 to 10.0 mm. The distance Ds of less than 2.5 mm decreases rigidity and deteriorates uneven wear resistance and steering stability, whereas the distance Ds exceeding 10.0 mm might deteriorate drainage performance.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Next, each middle rib 6 is provided with a plurality of middle inclined grooves 12 spaced at a tire circumferential pitch Pm.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The middle inclined grooves 12 extend with a steep inclination<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> at a small angle β of 0 to 75 degrees with respect to the tire circumferential direction, axially inward from the shoulder main grooves 4, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>. The middle inclined groove 12 has an axial inner end 12e discontinued within the middle ribs 6. Axial distance Dm between the axial inner end 12e and the crown main groove 3 is preferably set in a range of from 1.5 to 5.0 mm, which is set smaller than the distance Ds in this embodiment. Circumferential length Lm of the middle inclined groove 12 is set at 70 to 125% of the tire circumferential pitch Pm of the middle inclined grooves 12.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The middle inclined groove 12 includes on axial inside thereof straight groove portion 12A extending in a straight line at an angle β1 of 15 degrees or less with respect to the tire circumferential direction. The description "extending in a straight line"includes not only an arrangement in which the middle inclined groove 12 has a groove width center lines 12i forming a straight line, but also an arrangement in which the middle inclined groove 12 has one bending portion with two straight lines bent at an angle of 170 to 180 degrees.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Specifically, the mi ddl e inclined groove 12 of this embodi ment is formed by the straight groove portion 12A extending from the inner end 12e, and extending groove portion 12B warping in an arc and/or bending in a broken line such that the angle β increases axially outward, from the straight groove portion 12A to the shoulder main grooves 4. For example, the straight groove portion 12A has an axial inner groove edge 12Ae forming a straight line. In addition, it is desirable that the straight groove portion 12A has a circumferential<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> length Lm1 preferably set at not less than 50% of the circumferential length Lm of the middle inclined groove 12.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As in the foregoing, the middle inclined groove 12 is steeply inclined with the circumferential length Lm, thereby to reduce drainage resistance and enhance drainage performance. In addition, the mi ddl e inclined groove 12 has the axial inner end 12e discontinued at the distance Dm from the crown main groove 3, whereby it is possible to provide high circumferential rigidity of the middle ribs 6 and improve uneven wear resistance and steering stability while maintaining drainage performance. In particular, forming the straight groove portion 12A in the middle inclined groove 12 further enhances drainage performance. Moreover, the straight groove portion 12A decreases smoothly the distance from the crown main groove 3, which suppresses formation of a great rigidity transition point that may cause uneven wear.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In addition, the straight groove portion 12A has the inner groove edge 12Ae formed in a straight line. This further suppresses formation of a rigidity transition point, which is advantageous for uneven wear resistance. If the angle β exceeds 75 degrees, it is difficult to provide sufficient drainage performance. If the angle β1 of the straight groove portions 12A exceeds 15 degrees and the circumferential length Lm1 becomes smaller than 50% of the circumferential length Lm of the middle inclined groove 12, it is not possible to achieve sufficiently the effects of the straight groove portions 12A of enhancing drainage performance and improving<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> uneven wear resistance while suppressing occurrence of a starting point of uneven wear. If the distance Dm is smaller than 1.5 mm, the rigidity of the middle rib 6 decreases, which leads to deterioration of uneven wear resistance and steering stability. In contrast, if the distance Dm exceeds 5.0 mm, drainage performance becomes insufficient.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The extending groove portion 12B is formed in such a manner that, out of the angle β, an angle βj is 30 to 75 degrees at intersecting portions Ja with respect to the shoulder main groove 4. This suppresses deterioration in drainage performance and lateral rigidity of the intersecting portions Ja. If the angle βj deviates from the foregoing range, the intersecting portions Ja decrease in drainage performance, thereby bringing about deterioration of lateral rigidity.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The middle inclined groove 12 has a groove width w12 smaller than the groove width w4. In addition, the middle inclined groove 12 has a groove depth (depth of a deepest portion) H12 smaller than the groove depth H4. In this embodiment, the groove depth H12 gradually decreases from the intersecting portions Ja to the axial inner end 12e.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The middle rib 6 has first and second middle sub grooves 14 and 15 extending axially inward from the shoulder main groove 4 passing between circumferentially adjacent middle inclined grooves 12 and 12. The first and second middle sub grooves 14 and 15 are inclined at an angle γ of not more than 75 degrees with respect to<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> tire circumferential direction as with the middle inclined groove 12, and have axial inner ends 14e and 15e both discontinued within the middle rib 6. The first and second middle sub grooves 14 and 15 have circumferential lengths L14 and L15 equal to or less than 30% of the circumferential length Lm of the middle inclined groove 12. In this embodiment, the first and second middle sub grooves 14 and 15 warp in an arc such that the angle γ decreases axially inward. If the lengths L14 and L15 exceed 30% of the circumferential length Lm, the middle ribs 6 excessively decrease in rigidity, which have adverse effect on steering stability.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Assuming that the intersecting portion of the shoulder main groove 4 and the middle inclined groove 12 is designated as Ja, intersecting portion of the shoulder main groove 4 and the first middle sub groove 14 is designated as Jb, and intersecting portion of the shoulder main groove 4 and the second middle sub groove 15 is designated as Jc, a circumferential distance Q1 between the circumferentially adjacent intersecting portions Ja and Jb, a circumferential distance Q2 between the intersecting portions Jb and Jc, and a circumferential distance Q3 between the intersecting portions Jc and Ja, all is preferably set in a range of from 30 to 35 % of the circumferential pitch Pm of the middle rib 6. Therefore, the first and second middle sub grooves 14 and 15 are spaced at circumferential intervals almost equal to each other between the middle inclined grooves 12 and 12.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Next, the crown rib 5 has a plurality of crown lateral grooves<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> 16 spaced at a tire circumferential pitch Pc so as to cross over the crown rib 5, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>. specifically, both axial ends of the crown lateral groove 16 are opened at the crown main grooves 3. The crown lateral groove 16 is a narrow groove with a groove width w16 of from 0.3 to 2.0 mm, and extends at an angle δ with respect to the tire circumferential direction. Such a crown lateral groove 16 relieve appropriately lateral rigidity of the crown rib 5 to allow the tire to easily follow changes in slip angle during running of the vehicle, which brings about enhancement in responsiveness of the tire and improvement in steering stability.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In the present invention, the pitch Pc of the crown lateral grooves 16 is set larger than the pitch Ps of the shoulder lateral grooves 10 and smaller than the pitch Pm of the middle inclined grooves 12. In, addition, the pitch Pm is set within a range of 2.5 to 4.0 times the pitch Ps. In a conventional tire, the pitch P2 of the lateral grooves d2 arranged on the middle ribs c2 is set as small as 2.0 times or less, in general 1.0 time the circumferential pitch P3 of the lateral grooves d3 arranged on the shoulder ribs c3, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Here, if the pitch Pc, Pm, or Ps vary by a variable pitch method or the like, the pitch Pc can be an average circumferential pitch PcN obtained by dividing a length Lc of a distance of the crown rib 5 around the tire by a pitch count (number of pi tches) NC of the crown lateral grooves 16 (= LC/NC). Similarly, the pitch Pm can be an average circumferential pitch PmN obtained by dividing a length Lm<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> of a distance of the middle rib 6 around the tire by a pitch count (number of pitches) Nm of the middle inclined grooves 12 (= Lm/Nm). Similarly, the pitch Ps can be an average circumferential pitch PsN obtained by dividing a length Ls of a distance of the shoulder rib 7 around the tire by a pitch count (number of pitches) Ns of the shoulder lateral grooves 10 (= Ls/Ns).</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As in the foregoing, the circumferential length Lm of the middle inclined grooves 12 is set at 70 to 125% of the pitch Pm of the mi ddl e inclined grooves 12, and the pi tch Pm is set within a range of 2.5 to 4.0 times the pitch Ps of the shoulder lateral grooves 10. Therefore, the circumferential length Lm of the middle inclined grooves 12 is set longer than that of a conventional tire, thereby further improving drainage performance. In this embodiment, particularly, the middle inclined groove 12 has the straight groove portion 12A to further enhance drainage performance.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Meanwhile, since the circumferential length Lm of the middle inclined grooves 12 is made longer and the straight groove portion 12A is formed as described above, there is a fear that the middle rib 6 mi ght decrease rigidity in tire equator si de regions to thereby deteriorate steering stability. However, as described above, the tire 1 of this embodi ment has the circumferential pitch Pm set larger than a conventional one, specifically at 2.5 to 4.0 times the circumferential pitch Ps, which suppresses the reduction of rigidity and achieves higher-level compatibility between drainage performance and steering stability.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In addition, the pitch Pc of the crown lateral grooves 16 is set larger than the pitch Ps of the shoulder lateral grooves 10. Therefore, lengthening the circumferential pitch Ps further compensates for deterioration in steering stability due to reduction in rigidity of the middle ribs 6 in a tire equatorial region. This provides an appropriate rigidity balance among the crown rib 5, the mi ddl e ribs 6, and the shoulder ribs 7, thereby achi evi ng improvement of steering stability.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">If the circumferential length Lm of the middle inclined grooves 12 is less than 70% of the circumferential pitch Pm of the middle inclined grooves 12, drainage performance becomes insufficient. In contrast, if the same exceeds 125%, it is impossible to solve lack of rigidity of the middle ribs 6 in the tire equator side regions. In addition, if the circumferential pitch Pm of the middle inclined grooves 12 is less than 2.5 times the circumferential pitch Ps of the shoulder lateral grooves 10, it is impossible to provide sufficiently the circumferential length Lm of the middle inclined grooves 12, thereby resulting in insufficient drainage performance, or it is impossible to solve lack of rigidity of the middle ribs 6 in the tire equator side regions. In contrast, if the circumferential pitch Pm exceeds 4.0 times the circumferential pitch Ps, the middle ribs 6 lack drainage performance in ground-contact edge side regions.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Although a preferred embodiment of the present invention is as described above, the present invention is not limited to the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> embodiment shown in the drawings, and can be modified and carried out in various manners.</p><heading id="h0007">Comparative Test:</heading><p id="p0039" num="0039">Prototype radial tires for passenger car with a tire size of 195/65R15 were produced based on the tread pattern shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> in accordance with specifications in Table 1.
