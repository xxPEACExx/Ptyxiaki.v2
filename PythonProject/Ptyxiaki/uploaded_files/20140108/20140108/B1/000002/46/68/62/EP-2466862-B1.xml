This forwarding rule is activated by programming the automatic exchange that establishes the communications. This programming is carried out by the user who wishes to forward the calls that are to arrive at his or her extension, using the buttons of his or her telephone, particularly in order to indicate the number of the extension to which the call must be forwarded. To cancel the call forwarding rule, the user also uses the buttons of his or her telephone, or his or her personal computer. The user who programs the forwarding rule is informed of the activation of the forwarding rule by an audible and/or visual (light or readout) indication on his or her telephone or personal computer. On the other hand, the user of the extension to which the calls will be forwarded received no indication provided by the telecommunication network at the time that the forwarding is programmed. Some automatic exchanges provide a forwarding indicator, but only when the telephone rings because a call has been forwarded to it.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">This indicator is often too late. The user of the telephone receiving the forwarding rule often regrets not having been warned before a call is actually forwarded to his or her telephone for the first time, for various reasons:
<ul><li>That user may have activated forwarding to a third telephone, but that second forwarding rule is not compatible with the first forwarding due to how the company is organized.</li><li>That user might be unable to actually answer a call, for example, because he or she is busy with an important meeting.</li><li>That user may have wanted to ask the first user if an important call had been expected.</li><li>That user may have detected that the forwarding rule to his or her telephone had been due to the forwarded call having a wrong number.</li></ul></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A first known solution consists in that the first user personally warns the second user by means of a telephone call or e-mail. However, the first user might forget to do this,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> or might fail to reach the second user at the time when he or she wants to program the forwarding rule. The document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20050002511A"><text>US 2005/0002511</text></patcit> describes a method consisting of automatically establishing a communication with the recipient terminal, in order to enable the first user to warn the second user. The document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO0120885A"><text>WO 01/20885</text></patcit> describes another method consisting of automatically establishing a communication with the terminal receiving the forwarding rule, to warn the second user by means of a voice message read by a robot. The second user replies to the robot by accepting or by refusing the forwarding rule. The drawback of these known methods is that the second user can only be warned if he or she is close to his or her terminal at the time when the forwarding rule is programmed. If the second user is temporarily absent and then returns, he or she is not informed of the forwarding rule when he or she returns.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A second known solution consists of using a presence server within the company's telecommunication network. Any user of the network, who has the status of being an observer of a user's presence state, may observe (on his or her personal computer) that that user has forwarded the calls that are intended for him or her to the telephone of another user explicitly indicated by that presence server. However, not all of the network's users have this status of being an observer of a user's presence state. The user of the telephone receiving the forwarding does not necessarily have this right. Furthermore, that user is not necessarily present at the time when the forwarding is activated, so he or she might not necessarily observe the change in the presence state of the user who requested the forwarding.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The purpose of the invention is to remedy these drawbacks.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A first object of the invention is a method for informing a first user that he or she is the recipient of forwarded telephone calls initially intended for a second user, comprising the steps consisting of:
<ul><li>sending to a telephone application server a forwarding publication message, containing the first user's identity, the second user's identity, and an indicator indicating that a forwarding rule has been created,</li><li>then sending a forwarding notification, from that telephone application server to a terminal of the first user, this notification containing the second user's identity, and an indicator indicating the creation of a forwarding rule;</li></ul>
characterized in that in order to send this notification, it consists of sending it in the form of text; and in that it further consists of persistently displaying a forwarding indication and a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> text indicating the identity of the second user, on the terminal that received that notification.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Thanks to that forwarding notification in the form of text, the first user's terminal can inform that first user of the second user's identity persistently. If the second user is temporarily absent at the time when the forwarding rule is programmed, then comes back, he or she is informed anyway because the display of that text is persistent.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to one particular embodiment, this method further consists of:
<ul><li>including within the publication message an indication of the type of forwarding rule,</li><li>then including this indication in the forwarding notification,</li><li>and displaying the type of forwarding rule on the first user's terminal.</li></ul></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to one particular embodiment, this method further consists of:
<ul><li>including within the publication message a text that can be displayed on the first user's terminal,</li><li>then including this text in the forwarding notification,</li><li>and displaying this text on the first user's terminal.</li></ul></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A second object of the invention is a communication terminal that makes it possible to inform the user of that terminal that he or she is the recipient of telephone calls initially intended for a second user, characterized in that it comprises:
<ul><li>means for receiving a forwarding notification sent by a telephone application server, in the form of text;</li><li>and means for persistently displaying a forwarding indication and a text indicating the second user's identity, this text having been extracted from the received notification.</li></ul></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">One particular embodiment, which further makes it possible to inform the user of another terminal that the calls initially intended for the first terminal are being forwarded to that other terminal, further comprises means for sending a forwarding publication message to a telephone application server, making it possible to inform that server that the telephone calls initially intended for the first terminal are being forwarded to that other terminal.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to one particular embodiment, this terminal further comprises means for displaying a forwarding type indication, contained within the received notification.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to one particular embodiment, the means for sending a publication message comprise means for inserting into that publication message: an indicator indicating that a forwarding has been created, and the identity of a user of that terminal, who is the initial recipient of the calls.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A third object of the invention is a telephone application server that makes it possible to inform a user that he or she is the recipient of a call forwarding rule, comprising:
<ul><li>means for receiving a forwarding publication message, coming from a second user's terminal, and containing: an indicator indicating that a call has been created, the identity of the initial recipient of the calls, who is the second user, and the identity of the recipient of the forwarded calls, who is the first user;</li><li>and means for subsequently sending a notification to a terminal of the first user, this notification containing an indicator indicating the creation of a forwarding rule, and the identity of the initial recipient of the calls, who is the second user;</li></ul>
characterized in that these means for subsequently sending a notification comprise means for sending the notification in the form of text.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The fact that this server is sending a notification in the form of a text enables the recipient terminal to display the second user's identity in the form of a text, and therefore enables him or her to display it persistently.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to one particular embodiment, the means for receiving a forwarding publication message comprising means for receiving a forwarding type indicator, contained within that message;<br/>
and the means for sending a notification to the first user's terminal further comprise means for including a forwarding type indicator within that notification.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to one particular embodiment, the means for receiving a forwarding publication message comprise means for further receiving a variable text contained within that message;<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> -->and wherein the means for sending a notification to a terminal of the first user further comprise means for including that text in that notification.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to one particular embodiment, the means for receiving a forwarding publication message, and the means for sending a notification, comprise a web interface.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to one particular embodiment, whereby the means for receiving a forwarding publication message, and the means for sending a notification, comprise an interface compliant with the SIP protocol.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The invention will be better understood and other characteristics will become apparent with the help of the description below and the accompanying figures:
<ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> illustrates the operation of a first example embodiment of the inventive method, comprising a communication server and remote terminals, like a signaling protocol, the session initialization protocol, SIP.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> illustrates the operation of a second example embodiment of the inventive method, comprising a telephone application server equipped with a web interface, that server being coupled to a conventional enterprise network automatic exchange</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> illustrates the operation of a third example embodiment of the inventive method, further comprising an application executed on a personal computer, for each user.</li></ul></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the example depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Figure 1</b></figref><b>,</b> an enterprise network comprises a communication server CS and telephone terminals TA, TB, etc., using the Internet protocol and the session initialization protocol, SIP. In this example, the inventive method is implemented using the functions of the SIP protocol: PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, described in the RFC3903 standard.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The communication server CS, and the telephone terminals TA, TB, etc., each comprise a processor executing software, which particularly makes it possible to inform a user that he or she is the recipient of a call forwarding rule, in accordance with the inventive method. For example, a first user, Alice, has the telephone terminal TA; and a second user, Bob, has the telephone terminal TB.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the communication server CS, a software module is tasked with SIP signalling. It comprises software means for notifying a user of the creation and then deletion of a forwarding rule, if that user is a subscriber to that notification service. In each telephone<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> terminal TA, TB, etc., a software module called a "user agent" is tasked with SIP signalling. This module comprises software means to enable a user using that terminal to subscribe to that service, and to receive a notification via that terminal whenever a forwarding rule to that user is created/deleted.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><b>Step 1:</b> Bob uses the keyboard and screen of the terminal TB to ask to benefit from the notification service for informing a user that he or she is the recipient of a call forwarding rule (In other embodiments, this operation may be automatic or be carried out when the terminal is being configured). The user agent of the terminal TB sends the communication server CS a message:
<ul><li>"SUBSCRIBE <u>sip:server@example.com</u> SIP/2.0</li><li>To: <u>&lt;sip:server@example.com&gt;</u></li><li>From: <u>&lt;sip:Bob@example.com&gt;</u></li><li>Call-ID: ...</li><li>CSeq: 1 SUBSCRIBE</li><li>Event: forward-indication</li><li>Accept: application/x-forward-indication</li><li>Content-Length: 0 "</li></ul>
This message requests that the user bob@example.com be alerted when an event called "forward-indication" constituted by the creation of a forwarding rule to the terminal of that user. The RFC 3903 standard describes the general principle of event subscription, publication, and notification. It is applicable for any event types (currently the events that exist have the types "presence", "registration", "mwi", etc.). The event type "forward-indication" does not yet exist in this standard. It would need to be created.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><b>Step 2:</b> In the communication server CS, the software means tasked with reporting the forwarding rule creation/deletion events to a user who is the recipient of that forwarding rule, send a SIP message to Bob's terminal TB:
<ul><li>"NOTIFY <u>sip:Bob@example.com</u> SIP/2.0</li><li>To: <u>&lt;sip:Bob@example.com&gt;</u></li><li>From: <u>&lt;sip:server@example.com&gt;</u></li><li>Call-ID: ...</li><li>CSeq: 2 NOTIFY</li><li>Event: forward-indication</li><li>Content-Type: application/x-forward-indication</li><li>Content-Length:...<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></li><li>forwarded: EMPTY"</li></ul>
This message is similar to a forwarding rule creation/deletion notification message, except that it does not contain any indication about the identity of a user who had created a forwarding rule, in the event that there is not yet any forwarding rule to Bob. In this case, this message's only function is to indicate that the user bob@example.com has subscribed to the requested service. In the event that there is already a forwarding rule to Bob, this message additionally indicates the existence of that rule and the identity of the person who created that rule.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><b>Step 3:</b> Alice uses the keyboard and screen of the terminal TA to create a forwarding rule to the user bob@example.com.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><b>Step 4:</b> The user agent of Alice's terminal TA then sends a SIP forwarding publication message to the communication server CS:
<ul><li>"PUBLISH <u>sip:server@example.com</u> SIP/2.0</li><li>To: <u>&lt;sip:server@example.com&gt;</u></li><li>From: <u>&lt;sip:Alice@example.com&gt;</u></li><li>Call-ID: ...</li><li>CSeq: 333 PUBLISH</li><li>Event: forward-indication</li><li>Content-Type: application/x-forward-indication</li><li>Content-Length:...</li><li>forwarded: <u>sip:Alice@example.com</u></li><li>destination:<u>sip:Bob@example.com</u></li><li>condition: unconditional</li><li>reason: "out of office for 2 hours"</li></ul>
which indicates that there is a forwarding rule for calls initially intended for the user alice@example.com, to the user bob@example.com. It contains an indication about the type of forwarding rule: "unconditional" means that the forwarding has no conditions. It also contains a Reason field for a variable text, which may be an explanation of the forwarding rule, and which is intended to be displayed on the terminal TB of the user Bob, who is the recipient of the forwarding rule. In this example, the text "out of office for 2 hours" means that Alice is absent from his or her office for about two hours (This text may be entered manually or selected from a list of preset texts).<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><b>Step 5:</b> In the communication server CS, the software means tasked with reporting the forwarding rule creation/deletion events to a user who is the recipient of that forwarding rule, send a SIP message to Bob's terminal TB:
<ul><li>"NOTIFY <u>sip:Bob@example.com</u> SIP/2.0</li><li>To: <u>&lt;sp:Bob@example.com&gt;</u></li><li>From: <u>&lt;sip:server@example.com&gt;</u></li><li>Call-ID: ...</li><li>CSeq: 444 NOTIFY</li><li>Event: forward-indication</li><li>Content-Type: application/x-forward-indication</li><li>Content-Length:...</li><li>forwarded: <u>sip:Alice@example.com</u></li><li>destination:<u>sip:Bob@example.com</u></li><li>condition: unconditional</li><li>reason: "out of office for 2 hours"</li></ul>
which informs the user bob@example.com that the calls initially intended for the user alice@example.com are being forwarded to the user bob@example.com; that the forwarding rule is "unconditional"; and it attaches an explanation for the forwarding rule, intended to be displayed on the terminal TB: "out of office for 2 hours", meaning that Alice is absent from her office for two hours.<br/>
This information is persistently displayed on Bob's terminal, so that he is informed after he returns if he had been temporarily absent at the time that the forwarding rule had been programmed.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">When Alice orders the deletion of the forwarding rule, the "user agent" software module of the terminal TB sends a SIP message to the server CS:
<ul><li>"PUBLISH</li><li>From: sip: Alice@example.com</li><li>Event: forward-indication</li><li>Forwarded: sip: Alice@example.com</li><li>Destination: sip: bob@example.com</li><li>Condition: canceled</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Then, in the communication server CS, the software means tasked with reporting the forwarding rule creation/deletion events to a user who is the recipient of that forwarding rule, send a SIP message to Bob's terminal TB:
<ul><li>"NOTIFY</li><li>To: sip: bob@example.com</li><li>Event: forward-indication"</li></ul>
which informs the user bob@example.com that there are no longer any forwarding rules that have him as a destination. This information is persistently displayed on Bob's terminal, so that he is informed after he returns if he had been temporarily absent at the time that the forwarding rule had been deleted.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Figure 2</b></figref> depicts the operation of a second example embodiment of the inventive method, comprising a server WS which is a telephone application server equipped with a web interface.
