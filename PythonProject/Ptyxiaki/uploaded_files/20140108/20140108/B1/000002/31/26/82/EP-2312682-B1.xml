The width direction of sealing tape 200 refers to an axial direction when the electrode assembly is wound. The heat shrinkage of sealing tape 200 takes place around trenches or grooves 210 at a predetermined temperature, thereby increasing a thickness of a region 200a between trenches or grooves 210 due to the heat shrinkage. That is, when sealing tape 200 is heated to the predetermined temperature, sealing tape 200 shrinks such that trenches or grooves 210 become polygons or diamonds as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. Here, when sealing tape 200 is shrunken in the width direction, the separator of electrode assembly 110 may also be shrunken.

Here, sealing tape 200, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, may include a plurality of trenches or grooves 210 having predetermined lengths to control a region 200a increasing in thickness due to heat shrinkage.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the method of fabricating is described as surrounding the circumferential surface of electrode assembly 110 with a sealing tape 200.

Then, can 130 is sealed using cap assembly 140.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Afterwards, sealing tape 200 is shrunken by heating the periphery of can 130 at a predetermined temperature, and thus electrode assembly 110 is close to can 130. Here, since the heat shrinkage of sealing tape 200 progresses around trenches or grooves 210, after the heat shrinkage is completed, sealing tape 200 increases in thickness in region 200a between trenches or grooves 210. As a result, electrode assembly 110 surrounded by sealing tape 200 is close to can 130 in position. Trenches or grooves 210 may be transformed to a polygonal, particularly, a diamond, shape due to the heat shrinkage.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The predetermined temperature may be about 90 °C or less, and preferably, about 40 °C to 60 °C to prevent denaturation of the electrolyte solution housed in can 130 or damage to the electrode assembly.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">When sealing tape 200 is shrunken by less than 50%, electrode assembly 110 may not be sufficiently close to can 130. When sealing tape 200 is shrunken by 70% or more, separator 113 of electrode assembly 110 may also be shrunken. Thus, sealing tape 200 may be formed of a heat-shrinkable material which is shrunken 50 to 70%, and preferably, a heat-shrinkable material which is shrunken 50 to 70% at about 40 °C to 60 °C to prevent damage to the secondary battery as described above.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the secondary battery having a centre pin, which is disposed in the electrode assembly wound in a cylindrical shape, and the can formed in a cylindrical type have been described. However, a prismatic or pouch-type secondary battery also has an electrical short circuit between an electrode assembly and a cap assembly when the electrode assembly is moved or revolves due to an external impact such as being dropped.
