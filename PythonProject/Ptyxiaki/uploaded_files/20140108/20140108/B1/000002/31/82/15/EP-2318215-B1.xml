mxw-id="PDES63961047" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to liquid containers and image forming apparatuses. More specifically, the present invention relates to an image forming apparatus having a recording head configured to jet liquid drops and a liquid container used in the image forming apparatus.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">As an image forming apparatus such as a printer, facsimile, copier, plotter, or a multifunctional peripheral including the printer, facsimile, copier, and the plotter, an inkjet recording apparatus is known. The inkjet recording apparatus is a liquid jet recording type image forming apparatus using a recording head configured to jet ink liquid drops. In this liquid jet recording type image forming apparatus, the ink liquid drops are jetted from the recording head onto a conveyed sheet so that image forming such as recording or printing is performed.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Hereinafter, the "image forming apparatus" means an apparatus configured to jet liquid onto a medium such as a paper, thread, fiber, leather, hides, metal, plastic, glass, wood, or ceramic so that images are formed. The image forming apparatus includes a mere liquid jetting apparatus. In addition, "image forming" means not only providing an image of characters, figures, or the like on the medium but also providing an image such as a pattern having no meaning on the medium. "Image forming" includes adherence of the liquid drops onto the medium.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Furthermore, "ink" is not limited to the recording liquid or the ink and any liquid that is a fluid when being jetted can be applied to the liquid such as fixing liquid. In addition, the "ink" includes a liquid whereby the image forming can be performed, such as a resist or DNA testing material.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In addition, "sheet" is not limited to a paper but includes an OHP sheet or leather. In other words, the sheet means a subject where the ink drops are adhered. The sheet includes a recorded medium, a recording medium, a recording paper, and a recording sheet.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As such an image forming apparatus (hereinafter "ink jet recording apparatus"), the following apparatuses have been known. In one apparatus, a sub-tank (buffer tank) configured to supply ink to a recording head is mounted on a carriage; a main ink cartridge (main tank) is provided at an apparatus main body; and the ink is supplied and supplemented from the main ink cartridge of the apparatus main body to the sub-tank. In another apparatus,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> an ink cartridge which is a liquid container exchangeable with a recording head is provided.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2003001846A"><text>2003-1846</text></patcit> and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2003089217A"><text>2003-89217</text></patcit>, a sub-tank having an air opening valve configured to open an inside to the atmosphere has been suggested. In this suggested example, the air opening valve includes an opening part, a seal part, a spring mechanism, a pressing mechanism part, and a filter. The opening part corresponding to an air opening part is provided on an upper surface of the sub-tank. The seal part is configured to seal the opening part. The spring mechanism part presses the seal part to the opening part. The pressing mechanism part is configured to press the seal part into a sub-tank. The filter is provided outside the opening part. The air opening valve normally blocks an inside of the sub-tank from the atmosphere and is opened by the pressing mechanism part. The example where the filter is provided has been suggested in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2003053985A"><text>2003-53985 </text></patcit>and Japanese Patent 3087535.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, in a case where the filter is simply provided at the air side opening of an air communicating path like the above-mentioned related art, foreign particles which cannot be caught by a filter member may enter the air opening path as they are so that of sealability of the valve member may be degraded. As a result of this, sealability of the liquid container may be degraded so that the air enters the container. Hence, it may not be possible to supply the ink stably.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2008143171B"><text>JP 2008 143 171</text></patcit> discloses an image forming apparatus comprising a liquid jet head and air opening for opening an air path. The opening comprises a filter member.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention may provide a novel and useful liquid container and image forming apparatus solving one or more of the problems discussed above.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">More specifically, the embodiments of the present invention may provide a liquid container whereby the probability of entry of foreign particles which cannot be caught by a filter member into an air opening path as they are is decreased so that degradation of sealability of a valve member is prevented, and an image forming apparatus having the liquid container.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">One aspect of the present invention may be to provide an image forming apparatus, including a liquid jet head configured to eject a liquid droplet onto a recording medium; a container main body configured to receive liquid to be supplied to the liquid jet<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> head from an liquid cartridge; an air opening mechanism configured to open and close an air opening path in the container main body, the air opening path being configured to open an inside of the container main body to the atmosphere, wherein the air opening mechanism includes a holding part including a valve body part configured to open and close the air opening path, and an opening member movably provided at the holding part, the opening member being configured to open and close the valve body part by pushed from an outside the container main body; wherein the opening member includes an air communicating path configured to be in communication with the atmosphere and forming a part of the air opening path; a filter member provided at an air side opening part of the air communicating path of the opening member, the filter member having an external surface coming in contact with the atmosphere; and an air room provided at an internal surface side of the filter member; and wherein an opening cross-sectional area of the air room in a direction perpendicular to an air flow-in direction is greater than an opening cross-sectional area of the air communicating path in a direction perpendicular to an air flow-in direction.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the liquid container of the present invention, an air room is provided between the filter member and the air communicating path or the communicating path which communicates with the air communicating path. The air room has an opening cross-sectional area greater than that of the air communicating path or the communicating path. Accordingly, the foreign particles which cannot be caught by the filter member stay in the air room. Hence, it is possible to prevent the foreign particles from entering the valve member so that bad operations of the valve member can be prevented or the probability of the bad operations can be reduced.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to the image forming apparatus of the present invention, since the image forming apparatus has the above-mentioned liquid container, it is possible to prevent the sealability of the liquid container from being decreased and prevent the air from unnecessarily entering. Hence, it is possible to perform stable ink supplying without wasting the ink.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will become obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.

Thus, the sheet 42 is recorded one line at a time by the ink liquid ejected from the ejecting heads 34a and 34b. The image forming apparatus ends recording of the sheet 42 and ejects the sheet 42 to the ejecting tray 3 when the image forming apparatus receives a recording completion signal or a signal indicating that the rear end of the sheet 42 reaches the recording area.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The image forming apparatus moves the carriage 33 to a home position at which the ejecting heads 34a and 34b oppose the maintaining recovering mechanism 81 when the image forming apparatus maintains and recovers the nozzles of the ejecting heads 34a, 34b. The image forming apparatus suctions the ink liquid in the ejecting heads 34a and 34b with the caps 82 capping the nozzle surfaces of the ejecting heads 34a and 34b, and idle-ejects the liquid which does not contribute to the recording in order to maintain the ejecting heads 34a and 34b.

In this state, by driving the solenoid 402 so that the plunger 403 is pulled in a direction indicated by an arrow A, the first lever 405 is oscillated in a direction indicated by an arrow B and the first lever 405 is oscillated. As a result of this, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 25(b)</figref>, the second lever 407 pushes the pressing member 401 due to the first lever 405 so that the engaging part 401 a of the pressing member 401 comes in contact with the carriage 33.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">At this time, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 25(c)</figref>, the amount of oscillation of the first lever 405 is fixed by the engaging part 403a of the plunger 403 of the solenoid 402 coming in contact with the solenoid 402.
