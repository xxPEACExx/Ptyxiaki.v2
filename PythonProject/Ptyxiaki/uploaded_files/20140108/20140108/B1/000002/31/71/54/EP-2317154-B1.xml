As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref>, a cylinder briefly includes a tube 10 which serves as a pressure vessel and guides a rectilinear movement of a piston, a rod 20 which is a long circular bar shaped shaft<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> portion that performs a rectilinear reciprocating movement; a head cover 30 having a packing mounted thereon to prevent outer leakage of hydraulic fluid in the tube; a piston which maintains hydraulic power in a large chamber and a small chamber provided in the tube; and a cushion ring 50 which absorbs mechanical impact at a stroke end.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1B</figref> is a view exemplifying a state where a cushion ring 50 rushes into head cover 30, and <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1C</figref> is a view exemplifying a time point where an initial operation starts on the opposite side after the entrance of the cushion ring is completed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the case of a cylinder with built-in cushion, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>, a cushion system is constructed to reduce the mechanical impact in a stroke end, and most approaching schemes are to construct a structure that reduces impact force through reduction of the speed of a piston 40. The speed of the piston 40 is reduced by gradually throttling a flow path through adjustment of an open area on an outlet flow path using a ring type or plunger type cushion system.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1C</figref>, at the time point where the cushion tool's rushing into the stroke end is almost completed, a gap is kept in a minimum state for sufficient cushion, and the mutual contact surfaces of an end portion and an outer peripheral portion are in mutually strong surface contact with each other.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">If the cushion gets out of the stroke end, an additional frictional force is formed, and a cross-sectional area for actually transferring the cylinder rod, although the hydraulic fluid has been transferred from the pump to the flow path, is formed only by the ring-shaped projection area of the cushion ring, which is too narrow. Accordingly, a time delay occurs until the pressure is accumulated and a sufficient force is formed.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to some cylinders in the market, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, a cushion chamber is inserted into the lower end of the cushion ring to lead the check function. In this case, however, since a groove process is performed with respect to one end of the rod, which copes with a relatively great force and is exposed at all times, there is possibility of damage due to the stress concentration.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">From the viewpoint of the hydraulic system, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, when the cylinder is initially operated at the stroke end, the operation of the discharge side of the pump is delayed due to the insufficiency of a pressed area in the cylinder, and thus the pressure is increased. Sometimes, the increased pressure reaches the relief pressure, and this cause unnecessary energy consumption. From the viewpoint of the cylinder operation, an instantaneous initial abrupt operation or the like occurs after the operation delay, and this causes a deathblow to the performance of the cylinder in the case where<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> an elaborate work is required.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In addition, the above-described phenomenon aggravates fuel economy of the equipment due to the unnecessary energy consumption, and in order to give smooth initial operability, the phenomenon causes a system overdesign element such as an increase of pump capacity or the like to increase the cost.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4301714A"><text>US 4,301,714 A</text></patcit> describes a damping device in pressurized fluid cylinders, especially in hydraulic cylinders, for end position damping of the piston stroke. The device comprises a closure member connected to the piston and adapted to enter during a damping process into an outlet opening in front of the piston. A ring, serving as a non-return valve, is arranged with an axial play in an annular groove so as to choke the flow of pressurized fluid through the annular passage between the wall defining the outlet opening and the closure member, while permitting a fluid flow in the opposite direction during the return stroke of the piston. According to the invention, the ring has a cross-section permitting at least a radial deformation, and circumferentially distributed by-pass openings located in the region of the inside of the annular groove so as to permit said fluid flow during the return stroke of the piston.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP10169614A"><text>JP 10-169,614 A</text></patcit> describes a cushion device comprising a cushion ring arranged in a small diametric part formed in a piston rod to have an internal diameter larger than an external diameter of the small diametric part and to also have a length almost equal to the length of the small diametric parts is provided, in a set position on the cushion ring opposed to a region between a piston and a cushion seal, a through liquid hole penetrating the internal/external peripheral surfaces of this ring is provided.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">It is an object of the present invention to provide a hydraulic cylinder cushion device overcoming the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art while advantages achieved by the prior art are maintained intact.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">This object is achieved by a hydraulic cylinder cushion device according to claim 1 or claim 3.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">An embodiment of the present invention relates to an improvement of the cushion performance by forming a check ring.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a hydraulic cylinder cushion device installed in a hydraulic cylinder, in which a rod performs reciprocating movement in a cylinder tube and which discharges high-pressure hydraulic fluid that is formed in pressure chambers between a piston and a head cover and between the piston and a cover end during a stroke-end operation, which includes a check ring which is installed in a groove provided on an inner surface of the head cover or the cover end, and moves to one side in the groove so as to close a flow path during rushing into a stroke end while it moves to the other side in the groove so as to open the flow<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> path during an initial operation in the stroke end.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The hydraulic cylinder cushion device as constructed above according to an embodiment of the present invention has the following advantages.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">First, the check ring is formed, and thus the operation delay in the stroke end and the initial abrupt operation can be prevented.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Second, since the excessive pressure increase of the pump due to the operation delay in the stroke end can be prevented, the pump efficiency is heightened.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Third, since the check ring is applied, the cushion function is additionally improved during the entrance into the stroke end, the excessive operation of the pump is prevented, and the operation delay is improved to heighten the fuel efficiency with the cost saved.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:

Since the tube 10 guides the movement of the piston 40, the piston 40 slides on the tube, and since an internal pressure is applied thereon, pressure resistance and abrasion resistance are required. In order to heighten the mechanical performance as described above, the inner surface of the tube 10 is smoothed with a surface roughness below 1.6S. Generally, as a material of the tube 10, aluminum, rolled steel for machine structural purposes, brass tube, or the like, has been used. Recently, a stainless steel tube or a plastic tube is used for a small cylinder.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Since the rod 20 requires strength and abrasion resistance enough to endure load, such as tensile, compression, bending, vibration, and the like, according to an acting load, it may be made of a hard chromium plated steel machine carbon to improve the corrosion resistance and abrasion resistance, and for special purposes, it may be made of stainless steel series.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Since the hydraulic cylinder used in heavy equipment moves large mass load, the piston 40 may collide with the head cover 30 to generate mechanical shock during the stroke-end operation. In order to mitigate such shock and to smoothly operate the cylinder at high speed and with a large load, a hydraulic cylinder cushion device is required.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The hydraulic cylinder cushion device absorbs shock occurring when the piston 40 and the head cover 30 collide with<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> each other, lengthens the life span of the hydraulic cylinder, and prevents the damage of appliances or tubes of a hydraulic device due to vibration generated caused by the shock and so on.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">3</figref>, the hydraulic cylinder cushion device in the related art has the problem that the time delay and the excessive pressure increase due to the time delay occur during the initial operation in the stroke end.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>, the hydraulic cylinder cushion device according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a check ring 90. The check ring 90 is installed in a groove provided on an inner surface of the head cover 30 or the cover end 80, and is relatively movable in the groove.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The check ring 90 performs a check function for opening and closing the flow path in a manner that it relatively moves to one side in the groove so that a flow path is closed during rushing into the stroke end, and moves to the other side in the groove so that the flow path is opened during an initial operation in the stroke end.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In the hydraulic cylinder cushion device according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the check ring 90 is installed in the groove provided on the inner surface of the head cover 30 or the cover end 80.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4A</figref>, the check ring 90 is formed in the groove<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> provided on the inner surface of the head cover 30. In the same manner, the check ring 90 may be formed in the groove provided on the inner surface of the cover end 80, or may be formed in the grooves provided on the inner surfaces of the head cover 30 and the cover end 80, respectively. In this case, the operation delay and the pump pressure increase can be prevented during the initial operation at the stroke end of both the head cover 30 and the cover end 80.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a hydraulic cylinder cushion device installed in a hydraulic cylinder, in which a rod 20 performs reciprocating movement in a cylinder tube 10 and which discharges high-pressure hydraulic fluid that is formed in pressure chambers between a piston 40 and a head cover 30 and between the piston 40 and a cover end during a stroke-end operation, includes a check ring which is installed in a groove provided on an inner surface of a cushion ring 50 that is provided on an outer surface of the rod 20 or a groove provided on an outer surface of a cushion plunger 60 that is inserted into one end of the rod end 20 on the side of the cover end 80, and moves to one side in the groove so as to close a flow path during rushing into a stroke end while it moves to the other side in the groove so as to open the flow path during an initial operation in the stroke end.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>, in order to absorb the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> mechanical impact in the stroke end, the cushion ring 50 is provided on the outer surface of the rod 20, and the cushion plunger 60 is inserted into one end of the rod 20.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">It is also possible that the check ring 90 is installed on the cushion ring 50 or the cushion plunger 60 instead of the head cover 30 or the cover end 80. <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4B</figref> shows a state where the check ring 90 is formed on the cushion ring 50.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The detailed structure of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4B</figref> is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5A</figref>, when the cushion ring 50 rushes into the stroke end, the cushion pressure according to the flow path throttling pushes the rear surface of the cushion ring 50, and thus the cushion ring 50 reaches the check ring 90 through a gap produced by the pushing operation and a slot formed on the rear surface of the cushion ring 50. However, after the cushion ring 50 reaches the check ring 90, the flow path is closed by the function of the check ring 90 and thus a sufficient cushion can be maintained.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">By contrast, in the case where the cushion ring 50 gets out of the stroke end as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5B</figref>, the cushion ring 50 is pushed as far as the designed gap by inflow pressure, and hydraulic fluid discharged from the pump flows through the gap 96 and an orifice or a slot 97 in the front end portion of the cushion ring 50 to reach the check ring 90 through the inner gap of the cushion ring 50.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">At that time, the check ring 90 is pushed, and a flow path<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> is connected up to the slot 97 on the rear surface of the cushion ring 50 along a path formed in an outer periphery or inner periphery 91 of the check ring 90. The fluid, having passed through the flow path, forms pressed hydraulic fluid on the front surface of the piston 40 to greatly increase the initial pressed area, and thus by adding an area 95 in addition to the area 94 on which the actual hydraulic pressure acts, smooth movement becomes possible without any initial operation delay.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In the hydraulic cylinder cushion device according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the check ring 90 is formed in a groove provided on the inner surface of the cushion ring 50 provided on the outer surface of the rod 20 and the outer surface of the cushion plunger 60 that is inserted into one end of the rod 20 on the side of the cover end 80.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4B</figref> shows a state where the check ring 90 is formed in the groove provided on the inner surface of the cushion ring 50.
