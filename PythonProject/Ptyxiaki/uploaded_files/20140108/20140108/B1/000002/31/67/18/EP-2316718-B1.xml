Among the conventionally-known motorcycle seat rails are ones made of pipes, plates, etc. as well as ones made by casting as disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2007261587A"><text>2007-261587</text></patcit> ("patent literature 1").</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As disclosed in patent literature 1, a seat frame, which constitutes the seat rail, is made by die-casting and extends obliquely rearward and upward from a rear arm bracket that is a rear-part member of the vehicle body frame.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The seat frame comprises left and right rail sections interconnected at their upper ends by a cross member. Each of the rail sections includes a large-thickness base portion, an extension portion extending from the large-thickness base portion, and a large-thickness edge portion formed at the lower end of the extension portion.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The seat frame has a generally U sectional shape opening downward, and thus, it can be readily released from a mold; particularly, the seat frame has a sectional configuration suited for die-casting. As loads of a passenger and goods onboard act downwardly on the seat frame, stress would increase in the edge portion. As measures against such a stress increase, the edge portion is formed to have a large thickness as noted above in order to provide an increased sectional area so that the stress increase can be limited to below a predetermined level. Namely, it is effective to increase the thickness of the edge portion.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">So far, the dominating seat frames of this type have been ones made by die-casting an aluminum alloy (i.e., aluminum-alloy die-cast seat frames), because such an aluminum alloy can achieve a lighter weight than an iron-based alloy.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In recent years, more and more seat frames made by die-casting a magnesium alloy (i.e., magnesium-alloy die-cast seat frames) are being brought into practical use, for purposes of further weight reduction etc. Magnesium has a high specific strength and superior workability and vibration absorbing performance as compared to aluminum. However, because a magnesium alloy is easily subject to oxidation, it took a long time to establish a technique for making a seat frame by die-casting a magnesium alloy, and thus, practical realization of a seat frame made by die-casting a magnesium alloy has been delayed until recent<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> years.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The following explain specific gravities and Young' s moduli of such an aluminum-alloy die-cast seat frame and magnesium-alloy die-cast seat frame, with reference to Table 1 below.

Because the Young's modulus influences an amount of bending or deflection, the magnesium alloy bends more greatly than the aluminum alloy in response to a same load. To limit the amount of bending to below a predetermined value, it is necessary to increase second moment of area. For that purpose, there is a need to further increase the thickness of the above-mentioned edge portion. However, if the thickness of the edge portion is increased, the seat frame would increase in overall weight and size, so that manufacturing cost of the seat frame would increase.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Further, if the edge portion is formed to project horizontally, water tends to accumulate on/in the upper surface of the horizontally projecting edge portion.

It is known that a groove-shaped sectional configuration has a particularly great section modulus and second moment of area as compared to a rectangular sectional configuration. Each of the rail sections, where such groove-shaped sectional configurations are disposed in vertically-spaded-apart relation to each other, has a great bending rigidity and deflection rigidity as a whole. Namely, even when the seat rail bends due to a load applied from above, stress produced in a lower region of the rail section can be lowered below an acceptable value because the rail section has a great rigidity. In addition, through the drainage hole, water accumulating on/in the second groove section can be promptly drained from the second groove section, so that occurrence of galvanic corrosion can be suppressed.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The annular protruding portion is formed integrally on the lower surface so as to surround the lower opening end of the drainage hole. When the seat rail bends due to a load applied from above, stress may concentrate<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> in a region around the drainage hole. However, because that region is reinforced by being formedas the annularprotruding portion, it is possible to sufficiently lower the stress level.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The increased-thickness portion is formed around the threaded through-hole such that the threaded through-hole has a length equal to two times the diameter of the through-hole plus a length in a range of 2mm to 4 mm. JIS B 1181 prescribes that a nut made of carbon steel should have a thickness that is about 85 % of the diameter of a threaded hole. A magnesium alloy is more liable to present a more noticeable permanent strain due to heating than other metals. As measures against such a permanent strain, the seat rail of the invention has the increased-thickness portion around the threaded through-hole such that the length of the threaded through-hole is equal to two times the diameter of the through-hole plus a length in the range of 2mm to 4 mm. Further, if a distal end portion of the bolt projects out of the threaded through-hole, galvanic corrosion may occur in the projecting portion. Thus, in the present invention, the length of the threaded through-hole is set to be equal to two times the diameter of the through-hole plus a length in the range of 2mm to 4 mm as noted above, so that a sufficient axial force can be secured.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The outer wall portion has a boss formed integrally thereon so that the distal end of a push pin abuts against the boss at the time of mold release. The provision<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> of the boss can achieve an enhanced mold release performance. At the same time, the outer wall portion can be reduced in thickness in the other region than the boss, and thus, the second groove section can be reduced in thickness and weight as a whole.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Because the second groove section is segmented in a plurality of segmented groove portions, the groove section can have an increased rigidity in the width direction of the groove section. In addition, because the drainage hole provided in each of the segmented groove portions is located at the lowermost position in the segmented groove portion in a state where the seat rail is mounted in place on the vehicle body in a slanting posture, water can be caused to drop reliably from each of the groove portions.

An exhaust pipe 15 and muffler 16 are disposed beneath the seat rail 30. Thus, the seat rail 30 tends to assume relatively high temperatures. The seat rail 30 is made by casting a magnesium alloy that, for example, consists of Al making up 5.5 - 6.5 %, Mn making up 0.24 - 0.6 %, Zn making up 0.22 % or less, Si making up 0.1 % or less, RE making up 0.2 % or over, minute amounts of Cu, Ni and Fe, with the remaining percentage being Mg.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Further, a pillion step holder 17 extends downward from a portion of the seat rail 30 located forward of the middle of the seat rail 30.

Namely, in order to have an increased total thickness, the seat rail 30 has the increased-thickness portion 33 integrally formed thereon around the through-hole 31. The other threaded through-hole 32 per se has a length L2 equal to two times a diameter d of the through-hole 32 plus a length in a range of 2mm to 4 mm. Namely, because the seat rail 30 has, around the through-hole 32, an increased thickness equal to two times the diameter d of the through-hole 32 plus a length in the range of 2mm to 4 mm, no increased-thickness portion 33 is formed around the through-hole 32.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The pillion step holder 17 is fixed to the seat rail 30 by the leg portions 25 being abutted against the underside of the seat rail 30 via alumite-coated washers 34 and by chrome-plated bolts 35 being screwed into the threaded through-holes 31 and 32. Because alumite has Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as its main component, it has electric insulating performance. Thus, the alumite-coated washers 34 can serve to prevent galvanic corrosion between the seat rail 30 and the pillion step holder 17 that is a separate member from the seat rail 30.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">JIS B 1180 prescribes that a nut made of carbon steel should have a thickness that is about 85 % of a diameter of a threaded hole. Namely, if the nut and the threaded hole are each made of carbon steel, the threaded hole only need<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> have a length that is about 0.85 times the diameter of the threaded hole.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">A magnesium alloy is more liable to present a more noticeable permanent strain due to heating than other metals. As measures against such a permanent strain, the seat rail 30 has the increased-thickness portion 33 around the threaded through-hole 31 in such a manner that the length L1 of the threaded through-hole 31 is equal to two times the diameter d of the through-hole 31 plus a length in the range of 2mm to 4 mm.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">If the seat frame 30 is made of the magnesium alloy and the plated bolts 35 are made of chrome-plated steel, and if water is present between the seat frame 30 and any of the plated bolts 35, galvanic corrosion would occur, because the seat frame 30 and the plated bolts 35 are made of different materials.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The inventors of the present invention conducted an experiment to find that the galvanic corrosion between the seat frame 30 and the plated bolt 35 is below 2 mm at most.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">As measures against such galvanic corrosion, the lengths L1 and L2 of the threaded through-holes 31 and 32 are each set to equal two times the diameter d of the through-hole 31 or 32 plus a length in the range of 2mm to 4 mm. Thus, even where some galvanic corrosion has occurred, the length L1 of the threaded through-hole 31 can secure a bearing width two times the hole diameter d. Namely, with<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the lengths L1 and L2 of the threaded through-holes 31 and 32 set appropriately, it is possible to achieve two advantageous benefits, i.e. securement of necessary screw-fastening performance and galvanic corrosion measures. Note that the thickness of the increased-thickness portion 33 only need be set such that the length of the threaded through-hole 31 is equal to or greater than two times the diameter d of the through-hole 31 (i.e., 2d + 2mm), more preferably (2d + a value in the range of from 2mm to 4 mm).</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, a distal end portion of the seat rail 30 is lapped on the vehicle body frame 11 made by casting, and a plated bolt 37 is passed through the distal end portion of the seat rail 30 and vehicle body frame 11 via an alumite-coated washer 36 of a 2.5 mm thickness.

Thus, the alumite-coated washer 36 is disposedbetween the plated bolt 37 and the seat rail 30, to electrically insulate between the plated bolt 37 and the seat rail 30. However, if a water drop 39 lies astride between the head of the plated bolt 37 and the seat rail 30 as indicated by imaginary line, galvanic corrosion might occur. Therefore, the outer diameter of the alumite-coated washer 36, i.e.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> dimension w, becomes important.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The inventors etc. conducted a CCT (combined cyclic corrosion test), focusing on the distance w between the outer periphery of the alumite-coated washer 36 and the outer periphery of the plated bolt 37.

Further, where the distance w is 2.5 mm, the amount of corrosion is not much different from that in the case where the distance w is 1.5 mm.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The inventors etc. further examined correlationship between the dimension w and the thickness of the alumite-coated washer, results of which were shown in the graph of (b) of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In (b) of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, the horizontal axis represents the thickness of the alumite-coated washer, while the vertical axis represents the dimension w. It could be confirmed that, where the thickness of the alumite-coated washer 36 is 1.0 mm, a small-large boundary of the corrosion amount exists at a point where the dimension w is 3.5 mm, and that, where the thickness of the alumite-coated washer 36 is 2.5 mm, the small-large boundary of the corrosion amount<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> exists at a point where the dimension w is 1.5 mm. For example, by setting the thickness of the alumite-coated washer at 2 mm and setting the dimension w at 3 mm, it is possible to limit the corrosion of the alumite-coated washer within a small corrosion amount region, as indicated by broken line. Namely, by selecting (designing) a thickness of the alumite-coated washer 36 and a dimension w such that the amount of corrosion of the alumite-coated washer can fall within the small corrosion amount region, it is possible to suppress galvanic corrosion.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, the driver' s seat 12 is placed on the seat rail 30, indicated by broken line, via four cushion rubbers 41, and the driver's seat 12 is fastened to the seat rail 30 by means of a plurality of bolts 42.
