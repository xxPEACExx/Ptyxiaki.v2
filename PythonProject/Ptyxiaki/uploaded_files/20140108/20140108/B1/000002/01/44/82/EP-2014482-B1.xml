The water-ink is contained in contact with the ink-retaining part 1.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The liquid-flow-type writing instrument according to the present invention uses a water-ink or an aqueous ink. The water-ink includes water and a dye or pigment. It may further include a surfactant. The used ink may be black or in color.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">A preferred surface tension of the water-ink is in a range from 30 to 50 dyne/cm. Around 40 dyne/cm is more preferred. One example of commercially available blue inks has a surface tension of 34.3 mN/m or 34.3 dyne/cm. One example of commercially available black inks has a surface tension of 38.6 mN/m or 38.6 dyne/cm.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The water-ink having a preferable surface tension has a good wettability to an ink-retaining part, and makes it possible to make a clear record with a dried ink without running to a record material such as a paper.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The above-mentioned water-ink having a preferable surface tension has a good wettability to the ink-retaining part obtained from the resin composition of the present invention. Accordingly, in the present invention, the wettabilty can be improved without applying any wettability-improving treatment<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> such as etching treatment which is adopted in conventional technologies.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The water-ink of the present invention may include a small amount of an organic solvent mainly for adjusting the surface tension.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The water-ink used in the direct liquid-writing instrument according to the present invention may be a known one. It may contain water as the base component, a coloring-matter and optionally other components. In general, it has a surface tension of around 40 dyn/cm as above shown.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">As the coloring matter, a dye such as an acidic dye, a direct dye or a basic dye, an organic pigment such as an azo pigment, a nitroso pigment, a nitro pigment, a basic dye pigment, an acidic dye pigment, a vat dye pigment, a mordant color pigment or a natural dye pigment, ocher, barium yellow, iron blue, barium sulfate, titanium oxide, red oxide, iron black, carbon black or may be used.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">As the other component, a viscosity modifier including, for example, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylic acid or a poly saccharide such as a cellulose derivative such as hydroxypropyl cellulose or carboxymethyl cellulose, gur gum, xantan gum or hyaluronan; a surfactant; a water-soluble organic solvent such as ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol or glycerin; and a reducing compound such as an anticorrosive agent, an antibacterial and antifungal agent,<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> ascorbic acid, kojic acid or a polyphenol such as hydroquinone, resorcin, catechol, pyrogallol, tannic acid or gallic acid may be used.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">When a pigment is used as a colorant, a dispersant may be used for dispersing the pigment stably, such as a water-soluble resin a styrene acrylaric salt or a styrene maleic salt, another water-soluble resin or an anionic or nonionic surfactant.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Regarding the direct liquid-writing instrument according to the present invention, since the part contacting with a water-ink (preferably an ink-retaining part in a bellows-like shape) is made of a resin composition containing the above components (A) and (B), and further if needed, the component (C) and the like, adequate wettability can be achieved. Consequently, in this instance, it never happens that wettability becomes excessively high and the supply of ink becomes poor as is the case for an ink-contacting part made of sole component(A), or by contrast wettability becomes excessively low and ink leakage is caused as is the case for an ink-contacting part made of sole component(B).</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The part contacting with a water-ink may be formed preferably into an ink collector, a bellows-like shape, an accordion shape or a retainer having a row of baffle plates closely arranged. It works to regulate the ink flow into the pen tip to prevent too much an amount of flow and too small an amount of flow.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The direct liquid-writing instrument according to the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> present invention is applicable to ballpoint pens, fountain pens, and the like using water-ink, currently available in the market.</p><heading id="h0011">Examples</heading><p id="p0054" num="0054">Examples of the present invention given below are for carrying out the present invention, although Examples provided here should not be construed as limiting the invention.</p><heading id="h0012">Examples and Comparative Examples</heading><p id="p0055" num="0055">The components shown in Table 1 were mixed in a V-shape tumbler for Examples and Comparative Examples, respectively, and were then melt-kneaded in a twin screw extruder (230°C of cylinder temperature, TEX 30, manufactured by The Japan Steel Works Ltd.), thus obtaining the pellets of the respective resin compositions.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Next, using an injection molding machine (240°C of cylinder temperature and 60°C of mold temperature), the ink-retaining part 1 in a bellows-like shape shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> was molded by injection molding. Thus prepared ink-retaining part 1 in a bellows-like shape was attached to the ballpoint pen 10 having the structure of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. A heat-cycle test was conducted under the following condition to evaluate the presence/absence of ink leakage from the pen-tip. The used water-ink cotained 80% by mass of water, 19.9% by mass of a dye and 0.1% by mass of a nonionic surfactant, having a viscosity at 25°C of 2.1 mPa·s, a surface tension of 40.2 dyn/cm and a<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> pH value of around 7.</p><heading id="h0013">(Heat cycle test condition)</heading><p id="p0057" num="0057">For each example, 200 ballpoint pens were prepared. The single heat cycle was defined as: 20°C (5 min) → temperature drop (30 min) → -10°C (5 min) → temperature rise (90 min) → 60°C (5 min) → temperature drop (10 min) → 20°C: (Total 145 min). After 36 cycles for each ballpoint pen, the number of ballpoint pens which caused ink leakage from the pen-tip was counted. The result showed that the smaller the number of ballpoint pens which caused the ink leakage becomes, the greater wettability of the ink-retaining part in a bellows-like shape becomes.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> -->
