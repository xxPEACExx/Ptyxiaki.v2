Generally in such devices, with reference to prior at <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 5 and 6</figref>, a honeycomb extrusion body 20 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref> includes cells 22 extending from a first end 26 to a second end 28 of the body 20 along a common direction D. Plugs or a sealing material 46 is used to close off a plurality 34 of the cells 22. A serpentine fluid passage 32 may be formed within the plurality 34 of cells closed off by the plugs or sealing material 46. Access to the fluid path 32 may be through an end face of the body 20 as in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref> or through openings 31 in flats 33 machined on side faces of the body 20 as in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 6</figref>. The resulting device 12 may be used as a reactor and/or a heat exchanger, for example, by flowing reactants or fluids to be heated or cooled along the fluid path 32, while flowing temperature control fluid along the cells 30not closed off. The pattern of the closed off cells and the path 32 they contain, when viewed parallel to direction D, may take various forms, such as the straight path of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref> or the serpentine one of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 6</figref>.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Some details of how plugs or seals 46 help form the path 32 are shown in the cross-sectional views of prior art <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 7 and 8</figref>. In these figures may be seen that selectively lowering walls of some of the cells 34 of the honeycomb body 20 allows U-bends 14 to be formed along the path 32, joining adjacent cells of the body 20 to each other in a serpentine fluid path 32.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2008121390A"><text>WO-A-2008/121390</text></patcit> discloses a honeycomb extrusion body in accordance with the preamble of claim 1.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present inventors have recognized that it would be desirable to improve the utility of the honeycomb extrusion body devices for any combination of heat<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> exchange and mixing and relating processes, but particularly for mixing, while maintaining ease of fabrication. An embodiment of the present invention addressing this need takes the form of a honeycomb extrusion body according to claim 1 having multiple cells extending along a common direction from a first end of the body to a second end and separated by cell walls, the body having at least one fluid path defined within a plurality of said cells, the fluid path having including at least one direction-reversing bend, at which bend the path on entering the bend includes two or more separate cells and at which the path on leaving the bend includes only one cell. The body desirably includes first and second input ports, the first fluid input port being in fluid communication with one of the two or more separate cells and the second fluid input port being in fluid communication with another of the two or more separate cells. The flow path provided in such a body has surprisingly good mixing characteristics while being relatively easy to manufacture.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">These features, as well as others described herein below, provide increased heat exchange performance, increased mixing performance, increased preservation of emulsions, and the like, by inducing secondary flows within the cells in which the fluid path lies.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Additional features and advantages will be set forth in the detailed description which follows, and in part will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art from that description or recognized by practicing the embodiments as described herein, including the detailed description which follows, the claims, as well as the appended drawings.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are merely exemplary, and are intended to provide an overview or framework to understanding the nature and character of the claims.

As may be seen in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the path 32 on entering the bend 14 includes exactly two cells 22A, and multiple bends 14 may be repeated serially along the path 32 if desired. In this case, two bends 14 are arranged serially in along the path 32. Plugs or sealing material 46 help define or form the bends 14. The span of the sealing material or plugs 46 appears relatively large in the cross-section of the figure but is small (one cell wide, typically) in the direction into the plane of the figure, so the sealing material or plugs 46 can provide the needed seal. Flow simulations show good mixing in the stream exiting the bends 14.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Bends 14 of the type disclosed herein can also be used to laminate multiple streams as shown in the cross-section of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>. Four streams, of two types, A and B, represented by two types of lines in the figure, and desirably by two separate input ports (not shown) are laminated and mixed by passing through the bend 14.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The full utility of these structures can be better appreciated from the plan view diagrams of a portion of a honeycomb body U-bend mixer shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 3 and 4; Figure 3</figref> corresponds to a variation of the device of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, while Figure corresponds to a variation of the device of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In both <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 3 and 4</figref>, two input ports 1 and 2 provide external access allowing separate fluids to be fed for mixing purposes.

U-bends are all of the simple type shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref>, except where the heavy-lined rectangles surround the cells.
