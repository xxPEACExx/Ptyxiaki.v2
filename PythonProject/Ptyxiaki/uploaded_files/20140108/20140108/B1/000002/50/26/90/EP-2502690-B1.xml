The tool body has a cutting portion having an insert pocket for mounting the cutting insert therein and a shank at an end opposite to the cutting portion for securing the cutting tool in a tool holder of a machine tool.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In a face-shaping or face-grooving operations, a surface at an end of the work piece that is usually substantially perpendicular to the axis about which the work piece rotates is, respectively, shaped and/or formed with a groove. The surface being shaped or grooved may be an internal surface, relatively deep inside the work piece and a groove being formed in a surface may be a relatively deep groove. For such operations, the cutting tool and insert must be appropriately shaped so that the insert can be inserted into the work piece to a sufficient depth to reach the surface being shaped or the groove being formed. Whereas the cutting tool and insert must have substantial reach, it is generally advantageous that they be sufficiently robust so that in use they are not subject to excessive vibration that prevents them from shaping surfaces of acceptable quality.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, providing a cutting tool with relatively large reach needed for shaping or grooving an internal surface may affect the robustness of the tool. The cutting tool and/or insert must often be shaped relatively long but having a relatively small cross section. In addition, surfaces of the cutting tool that are close to a curved surface being worked must generally be curved so that they do not contact and interfere with the surface. As a result, it may be difficult for the cutting tool to provide robust mechanical support for the cutting insert near the cutting tool's cutting edge.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">To meet design constraints of cutting tools used for face-shaping or face-grooving, the cutting insert retained in these tools may be mounted therein using an adapter. The adapter may be shaped to be mounted on an end of the tool body and may be configured to receive the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> cutting insert in a suitable insert pocket formed in the adapter. The adapter may be configured with various component support structures for stabilizing the cutting tool and reducing its tendency to vibrate during use and may comprise means for clamping the cutting insert in the pocket. The adaptor may also include means for adjusting the position of the cutting insert in the pocket. Typically, various configurations of bolts are used to secure the components of the adapter to the tool body and to provide the clamping and adjustment functions.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5159863A"><text>US Patent 5,159,863</text></patcit> describes "an adjustable face-grooving tool holder for holding a cutting insert for cutting circular face grooves having widely differing diameters". The holding tool comprises a "blade unit" to which a cutting insert is mounted and a "clamping arm" that is mounted on the blade unit using a screw that is tightened to clamp the cutting insert to the blade unit. The blade unit is mounted to the tool body using another screw.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5709508A"><text>US Patent 5,709,508</text></patcit> describes a cutting tool assembly having an adaptor that is mounted to a tool block using a pair of bolts.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6244789B"><text>US Patent 6,244,789</text></patcit> describes a cutting tool for cutting the walls of small deep holes. The tool comprises a cutting insert secured to a holder, or tool body. The cutting insert has a "stick-shaped" cutting portion that extends away from a planar plate-like base. The cutting portion has a cutting edge at a far end from the base. Near the center of the base is a bolt through hole which is aligned with a tapped hole in the holder. The cutting insert is secured to the holder by bolting the base into an insert pocket in the holder using a fixing bolt which is inserted through the bolt through hole and screwed into the tapped hole. The pocket has a seating surface on which a planar surface of the plate-like base rests and three projections that extend from peripheral surfaces of the pocket to contact a peripheral side surface of the base along three regions of the base peripheral surface. The cutting insert is clamped at four points. In addition to the three-point contact by the three projections, the insert is also clamped by a set bolt which is fitted through a tapped hole to make contact with the base peripheral side surface. When the set bolt in the tool body is screwed down to contact a fourth region of the base peripheral side surface the insert "is locked at four points by the three projections ... and the set bolt".</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">An aspect of an embodiment of the invention, relates to providing a tool body and insert such that when the insert is mounted to the tool body, forces are generated between surfaces of the tool body and the insert that align the insert with the tool body.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to an aspect of some embodiments of the invention, the forces generate a torque that presses an abutment surface of the insert against an abutment surface of the tool body thereby substantially fixing the orientation of the insert and its cutting edge relative to the tool body.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">An aspect of an embodiment of the invention relates to providing a tool body and groove-cutting insert for which the insert is mounted directly to the tool body. In an embodiment of the invention, the tool body has a pocket comprising a base surface and a back wall surface formed at a rear end of the pocket. The cutting insert comprises a mounting portion from which a cutting portion having a cutting edge extends. The mounting portion of the cutting insert has an inner surface that corresponds to the base surface of the pocket and a peripheral surface of the mounting portion corresponds to the pocket's back wall surface. The pocket formed in the tool body is formed having a forward male part having a pocket abutment surface and the mounting portion of the insert is formed having a matching forward female part respectively that has an insert abutment surface.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The cutting insert is mounted to the tool body by placing the mounting portion of the insert in the tool body pocket with the male part inserted into the female part and with the inner and peripheral surfaces of the insert mounting portion adjacent to or in contact with, respectively, the base and back wall surfaces of the pocket. The inner surface of the mounting portion of the insert is then forced against the base surface of the pocket optionally using a single threaded bolt to clamp the inner and base surfaces together. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the back wall surface of the pocket and the corresponding peripheral surface of the mounting portion of the insert are formed such that when the insert is mounted in the pocket, two abutment surfaces of the back wall surface are brought into forcible contact with two abutment surfaces of the peripheral surface. The abutment surfaces are oriented so that forces between the abutment surfaces generate a torque that causes the cutting insert to be securely retained in the pocket. The single clamping bolt thus securely mounts the cutting insert to, and aligns the insert with, the tool body.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In a particular application of the invention, the cutting insert is a face-grooving cutting insert configured to cut a circular groove in a face surface of a work piece. The cutting edge of the insert's cutting portion is substantially perpendicular to a radius of curvature of the groove and is located at a region of the cutting portion farthest from the mounting portion of the insert. The cutting portion is defined at least in part by inner and outer cylindrical surfaces that are closer respectively to walls of the groove having smaller and larger radii of curvature.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In accordance with the present invention there is provided a cutting insert comprising the features of claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Further advantageous embodiments are described in the dependent claims 2 to 8.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In accordance with some embodiments, the first and second insert abutment surfaces are oriented at an acute angle to each other and converge in a direction away from the cutting edge of the cutting insert.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The following items are preferred embodiments of the invention.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES</b></heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">The invention will be more clearly understood by reference to the following description of exemplary embodiments thereof read in conjunction with figures attached hereto.

Peripheral surface 58 extends between the inner surface 56 and the outer surface 57. The peripheral surface 58 is transverse to the inner and outer surfaces 56 and 57. A reference plane P of cutting tool 20 is defined by longitudinal axis A and bore axis B. Reference plane P may be a median plane of mounting portion 52 of the cutting insert 50. First and second rear insert abutment surfaces 157 and 158, respectively, are located on opposite sides of peripheral surface 58 and on opposite sides of reference plane P. First and second rear pocket abutment surfaces 137 and 138 are located on opposite sides of the back wall surface 36 and on opposite sides of reference plane P.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Optionally, a male part, a protuberance 60, which substantially matches socket 37 in tool body 30, protrudes from inner surface 56 of mounting portion 52 of insert 50 near to where cutting portion 54 joins mounting portion 52 of the insert. Protuberance 60 is optionally formed having an insert abutment surface 160 that abuts forward pocket abutment surface 40 of socket 37 when insert 50 is mounted on tool body 30 as described below. Protuberance 60 is optionally formed having a bevel surface 161. A through bore 62 for receiving bolt 80 is formed transverse to inner surface 56.

Regions of the cutting insert peripheral surface 58 that contact rear pocket abutment surfaces 137 and 138 of pocket 34 are respectively rear insert abutment surfaces 157 and 158 of the cutting insert 50. Contact between first rear abutment surfaces 137 and 157 generates a force on cutting insert 50 schematically represented by block arrow 91. Contact between second rear abutment surfaces 138 and 158 generates a force on the cutting insert schematically represented by block arrow 92. Forces 91 and 92 generate a torque represented by circular block arrow 93. Torque 93 operates to rotate cutting insert 50 and forcibly press insert abutment surface 160 of the cutting insert on forward pocket abutment surface 40 of the tool body as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 2C</figref> which schematically shows a front end view of cutting tool 20 from a direction indicated by a block arrow 95 in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 2A</figref> in which insert abutment surface 160 of protuberance 60 abuts forward pocket abutment surface 40 of socket 37.
