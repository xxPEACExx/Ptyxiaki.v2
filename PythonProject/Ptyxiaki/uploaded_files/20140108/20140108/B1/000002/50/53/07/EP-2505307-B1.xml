load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a power tool according to the preamble of claim 1, such as a disc grinder, an electric screwdriver, or a drill for boring, which is equipped with an electric motor therein as a power source. Such a power tool is known by <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2011024698A"><text>WO 2011/024698</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Such a power tool is generally equipped with either a gear train for changing the number of output revolutions of a motor or a gear train for changing the output direction. A CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) that continuously varies the gear train and reduction ratio is commonly used as a transmission mechanism for power tools. Technology concerning CVT traction drives are disclosed, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP6190740A"><text>JP No.6-190740 A</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2002059370A"><text>JP No.2002-59370 A</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP3073411B"><text>JP No.3-73411 B2</text></patcit>. Further, <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO2011024698A1"><text>WO 2011/024698 A1</text></patcit> discloses a power tool having a continuously variable transmission.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In a continuously variable transmission traction drive, a plurality of conical planetary rollers are supported by a holder. A centrally located sun roller is pressed onto the planetary rollers. A shift ring located around the holder is pressed onto the planetary rollers. Through rolling contact, planetary rollers transmit rotational power to an output shaft. The number of output revolutions is continuously altered due to the changing of the position of the shift ring relative to the planetary rollers. The pressing position of the shift ring pressed to the conical surfaces of the planetary rollers is varied between a small diameter and a large diameter.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A screw-tightening tool equipped with a continuously variable transmission therein is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP6190740A"><text>JP 6-190740 A</text></patcit>. In the screw-tightening tool, it is possible to continuously vary the speed and torque output. This is accomplished by moving a shift<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> ring. In creating low speed/high torque output, thread-fastening can be easily performed.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A continuously variable transmission mechanism traction drive has various problems. In this type of continuously variable transmission mechanism, a transmission case is filled with a lubricant for transmitting power. Typical lubricants include traction oil or traction grease. Appropriate lubricants for use in CVTs have a relatively high viscosity in order to produce a high transmission coefficient (traction coefficient). During operation, the lubricant filled in the transmission case is scraped and supplied to the pressing portion of the planetary rollers. This occurs during the revolution of the planetary rollers and the rotation of the holder. This operation results in power transmission.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">When the planetary rollers rotate, they in turn, scrape the lubricant. Accumulated lubricant unintentionally becomes stirring resistance in the power transmission system. As the load from this stirring resistance increases, the torque in the power transmission system decreases.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, a power tool is desired that can suppress reduction of the output torque and/or prevent increase of load current in a motor. One method for accomplishing this is by reducing the stirring resistance of a lubricant, such as traction oil.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention provides a power tool according to claim 1, having a motor and a continuously variable transmission mechanism. The continuously variable transmission mechanism comprises a sun roller rotated by the motor, a plurality of planetary rollers where the sun roller is pressed, a holder radially supporting the plurality of planetary rollers, a shift ring being in internal contact with the plurality of planetary rollers, and a resistance reducing portion disposed at the holder to fill a gap between the two of planetary rollers adjacently located in the circumferential direction of the holder.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Preferably, the space between two planetary rollers adjacently located in the circumferential direction of the holder is filled with the resistance reducing portion. Consequently, it is possible to achieve an assembly closer to a smooth cylindrical shape by reducing concavities and convexities in the holder. As a result, it is possible to reduce scraping resistance of a lubricant, such as traction oil, when the planetary rollers revolve, which in turn, reduce the current load of the motor.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Additional objects, features, and advantages, of the present invention will be readily understood after reading the following detailed description together with the claims and the accompanying drawings, in which:

The power tool of the embodiment described below is an example of a disc grinder 1. The disc grinder 1 generally includes a tool main body 2, a shifting portion 3, and a gear head portion 4. A circular grindstone 41 is mounted on a spindle 40 protruding downward from the bottom of the gear head portion 4. A grind stone cover 42 for preventing grind dust from scattering is mounted at the rear half of the grind stone 41.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the tool main body 2, a motor 10 is used as a drive source in a cylindrical main body case 2a. The main body case 2a may also serve as a handle for a user. A cooling fan 12 is fitted on an output shaft 11 of the motor 10. External air is suctioned from the rear portion of the tool main body 2 by rotation of the cooling fan 12 and moved to the front portion of the tool main body 2c The air serves to cool the drive motor 10. The output shaft 11 of the drive motor 10 is rotatably supported inside the main body case 2a by bearings 11a and 11b.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The rotational output of the drive motor 10 is transmitted to the spindle 40 through the continuously variable transmission mechanism 30 and the gear head portion 4.

The three planetary rollers 33are supported to be rotatable about the pivot axes of the support shaft portions 3 3 a with respect to the holder 37. The planetary roller 33 is supported with the rotational axis (support shaft portion 33a) inclined at a predetermined angle from the vertical position (position perpendicular to the output shaft 31).</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The push roller 34 is supported by the output shaft 31 whereby it may be rotated, axially displaced, and be pressed against the planetary rollers 33. The holder 37 is rotatably supported with respect to the transmission case 3a through a boss portion 34a disposed on the rear surface of the push roller 34. The pressure-adjusting cam mechanism 35 is disposed on the side of the front surface of the push roller 34.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The pressure-adjusting cam mechanism 35 may include a plurality of steel balls 39 interposed between the front surface of the push roller 34 and a pressing plate 38.

Consequently, it is possible to easily adjust the pressure-adjusting pushing force and the engagement drive force.</p><p id="p0143" num="0143">While the invention has been described with reference to specific configurations, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many alternatives, modifications and variations may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variations that may fall within the scope of the appended claims. For example, the present invention should not be limited to the representative configurations, but may be modified as described below.</p><p id="p0144" num="0144">The gear train, comprised of the drive gear 141 and the receiving gear 145, may be implemented in any configuration, as long as the gears generate a pushing force in the drive state. The shape, the engagement configuration, and the quantity of the gears involved may vary. For example, the drive gear 141 and the receiving gear 145 may be spiral bevel gears, straight bevel gears, helical gears, spur gears, or the like. Also, the<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> gears may be a combination of different or various gears.</p><p id="p0145" num="0145">Because the gear train can be used with various types of gears, a manufacturer can choose from a range of gears suitable of their needs</p><p id="p0146" num="0146">The pressure-adjusting means may be a spring 135, a cam mechanism 160, or any other suitable structural configuration. For example, an actuator may be used. This actuator could be is electrically controlled. It may be disposed between a continuously variable transmission mechanism and an output side gear train.</p><p id="p0147" num="0147">The power tool may be a disc grinder or appropriate power tools, such as a screw tightening machine or an electric drill for boring. The power-driving source may be an electric motor, as described above, or may be an air motor.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56983505" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Kraftwerkzeug (1), mit
