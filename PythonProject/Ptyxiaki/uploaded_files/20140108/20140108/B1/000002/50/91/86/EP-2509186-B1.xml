According to <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2001327001A"><text>JP2001-327001A</text></patcit>, two system main relays (SMR1, SMR2) are connected in parallel to each other between battery modules (BM1, BM2) of an HV battery (194) and a drive circuit (191, 192) and a motor (MG1, MG2) (see <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> of <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2001327001A"><text>JP2001-327001A</text></patcit>). A limiting resistor (LR) is connected in series to one of the system main relays (SMR1).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For energizing the motors, firstly the system main relay (SMR1) is turned on to perform a precharging process. Since the limiting resistor (LR) is connected to the system main relay (SMR1), a load voltage (Vinv) increases gradually to prevent an inrush current from being generated (<figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> and paragraph [0049] of <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2001327001A"><text>JP2001-327001A</text></patcit>).

However, <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="JP2001327001A"><text>JP 2001-327001 A</text></patcit> does not refer to the specifications of a power supply voltage sensor (VB) for the power supply voltage (Vbat) and a load voltage sensor (VI) for the load voltage (Vinv). When a large inrush current occurs, the contacts of the relay to which no resistor is connected in series, i.e., the system main relay (SMR2), tend to be damaged. For reliably preventing an inrush current from occurring, it is necessary to increase the detection accuracy of both the power supply voltage sensor (VB) and the load voltage sensor (VI). However, if the detection accuracy for an entire voltage range to be detected, i.e., a voltage range used therefor, is increased, then the cost of the voltage sensors is also increased.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is an object of the present invention to provide a power supply apparatus which is capable of reliably preventing damage by an inrush current and yet which is low in cost, and a method of controlling such a power supply apparatus.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the present invention, there is provided a power supply apparatus comprising a battery connected to an<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> electric load through a power supply circuit and which supplies electric power to the electric load, the power supply circuit including a first switch whose contacts are connected between one of positive and negative terminals of the battery and the electric load, a second switch whose contacts are connected in parallel to the first switch, a resistor connected in parallel to the first switch and in series to the second switch, and a controller for selectively opening and closing the first switch and the second switch to control supply of electric power to the electric load, a power supply voltage detecting unit for detecting a power supply voltage between the battery and the power supply circuit, a system voltage detecting unit for detecting a system voltage between the power supply circuit and the electric load, and an internal resistance detecting unit for detecting an internal resistance of the battery, wherein when the first switch is in an open state, the controller switches the second switch from an open state to a closed state, and thereafter switches the first switch from the open state to a closed state depending on the voltage difference between the power supply voltage detected by the power supply voltage detecting unit and the system voltage detected by the system voltage detecting unit, and if the controller detects that the internal resistance of the battery detected-by the internal resistance detecting unit is of a relatively high value being a value within a predetermined first internal resistance range of a resistance range in which the battery is used, the controller switches the first switch from the open state to the closed state using a first threshold value with respect to the voltage difference, and if the controller detects that the internal resistance of the battery detected by the internal resistance detecting<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> unit is of a relatively low value being a value within a predetermined second internal resistance range of the resistance range in which the battery is used, said predetermined second internal resistance range being smaller than said predetermined first internal resistance range, the controller switches the first switch from the open state to the closed state using a second threshold value which is smaller than the first threshold value.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">With the above invention, when the internal resistance of the battery is relatively high, the threshold with respect to the voltage difference between the power supply voltage and the system voltage is increased, i.e., the greater first threshold value is used, and when the internal resistance of the battery is relatively low, the threshold with respect to the voltage difference is reduced, i.e., the smaller second threshold value is used. Consequently, in a battery voltage range wherein the internal resistance of the battery is high, the detection accuracy of at least one of the power supply voltage detecting unit and the system voltage detecting unit is allowed to be reduced. As a result, regardless of the internal resistance of the battery, the specification requirements of at least one of the power supply voltage detecting unit and the system voltage detecting unit may be less strict than the case where the detection accuracy of the power supply voltage detecting unit and the system voltage detecting unit is high. The cost of at least one of the power supply voltage detecting unit and the system voltage detecting unit can thus be reduced.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In addition, when the internal resistance of the battery is high, the first threshold value is selected. Therefore, when the detection accuracy of the system voltage detecting unit is high in the battery voltage range wherein the internal resistance of the battery is high, it is<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> possible to turn on, i.e., close, the first switch more early.

Advantages of the present embodiment:</heading><p id="p0052" num="0052">According to the present embodiment, as described above, when the internal resistance Rbat of the battery 20 is relatively high, i.e., when the battery voltage Vbat is equal to or higher than V1 and lower than V2, the threshold value THΔV1 is selected (step S13 shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>), and when the internal resistance Rbat of the battery 20 is relatively<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> low, i.e., when the battery voltage Vbat is equal to or higher than V2 and equal to or lower than V3, the threshold value THΔV2 is selected (step S15 shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>). Therefore, the detection accuracy of the system voltage sensor 32 is allowed to be lowered in the battery voltage range which is equal to or higher than V1 and lower than V2, i.e., in the range wherein the internal resistance Rbat of the battery 20 is high.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Specifically, when the internal resistance Rbat is high, the system current Isys that flows at the time the high-voltage relay 22 is turned on increases more gradually than when the internal resistance Rbat is low. The high internal resistance Rbat corresponds to the low battery voltage Vbat (see <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>). Therefore, when the battery voltage Vbat is low, the possibility that the contacts of the high-voltage relay 22 will be damaged is low even if the detection accuracy of the system voltage sensor 32 is relatively low, i.e., if the detected value from the system voltage sensor 32 is lower than the true value, and the voltage difference ΔV is increased. According to the present embodiment, consequently, the detection accuracy of the system voltage sensor 32 is allowed to be lowered in the battery voltage range which is equal to or higher than V1 and lower than V2, i.e., in the range wherein the internal resistance Rbat of the battery 20 is high (see <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>).</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">As a result, regardless of the internal resistance Rbat of the battery 20, the specification requirements of the system voltage sensor 32 are less strict than in the case wherein the detection accuracy of the system voltage sensor 32 is high in the overall range in which the battery 20 is<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> used (see the comparative example shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>).

Therefore, when the detection accuracy of the system voltage sensor 32 is high in the battery voltage range which is equal to or higher than V1 and lower than V2 wherein the internal resistance Rbat of the battery 20 is high, it is possible to turn on, i.e., close, the high-voltage relay 22 more early.

If the ECU 36 detects that the battery voltage Vbat is relatively high, i.e., equal to or higher than V2 and equal to or lower than V3, then the ECU 36 switches the high-voltage relay 22 from the open state to the closed state using the relatively small threshold value THΔV2 (&lt; THΔV1).</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The battery 20 has such characteristics that the battery voltage Vbat which is relatively low corresponds to the internal resistance Rbat which is relatively high, and the battery voltage Vbat which is relatively high corresponds to the internal resistance Rbat which is relatively low. Therefore, the battery voltage sensor 28 can directly be used to detect the internal resistance Rbat. The power supply apparatus 16 can thus be further reduced in<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> cost.
