load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention pertains to a method and circuit according to the preamble parts of claims 1, 7, 9 and 10. In particular the invention relates to bit error estimation (BER) in the context of maximum likelihood detectors based on path metrics differences.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Subject matters of the preamble parts of the independent claims are known from <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5944844A"><text>US 5,944,844</text></patcit>, which will be discussed below.</p><heading id="h0001"><i>Background</i></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">An important consideration in the design of any communication system is the ability to assess the performance of the system while it is in operation. In digital communication systems, the ultimate criterion of performance of a data transmission link is the probability of error, often expressed in terms of the BER. As an element of an adaptive communication system BER estimation can be used to optimize receiver performance by adaptive changes of receiver parameters. In "<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Techniques for estimating the bit error rate in the simulation of digital communication systems" by M. C. Jeruchim, IEEE J. Sel. Areas Commmun., vol. 2, pp. 153-170, Jan. 1984</text></nplcit>. and in "<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="b"><text>Simulation of Communication Systems", by M. C. Jeruchim, P. Balaban, and K. S. Shanmugan, New York: Plenum Press, 1992, ch. 5</text></nplcit>, authors mention that a factor of 2 is a reasonable uncertainty for BER estimation. Consequently, the inventors of this patent believe that error rate estimation accurate within a factor 3 (cf. <figref idrefs="f0007 f0008">Figures 10 to 12</figref>) appears to be satisfactory for most applications, and for adaptive systems even a weak but monotonic estimator might be sufficient.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Based on operational conditions off-line and on-line monitoring are distinguished. This invention is related to On-line monitoring.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><b>On-line monitoring</b> comprises the following classes among others:
<ul><li>signal parameter measurement</li><li>path metrics processing in trellis based decoding</li></ul></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The performance of digital communication systems is a complex function of many signal parameters. Some of these parameters have a direct relationship to the BER while others are more qualitative. A well-known and quantitative method is to analyze the eye pattern. The feature of the eye pattern is the separation of the received signals into one<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> of several levels at the sampling time. Noise and distortion will make the signal vary at the sampling time and thus decrease the separation between levels. A good example of this technique is the measurement of height and width of the eye (<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>E. A. Newcombe and S. Pasupathy, "Error Rate Monitoring For Digital Communications". IEEE Proceedings, Vol. 70, no. 8, pp.805-828, 1982</text></nplcit>). While the height of the eye indicates the margin against disturbances in the signal amplitude, the width of the eye shows the margin for timing variations, which may be just as important to performance.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Related is a method disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5325397A"><text>US 5,325,397</text></patcit> "Error rate monitor" to determine a discrete estimate of the probability density function of a decision variable e. g. received amplitude and to determine the estimated BER by similarity comparison with stored probability density functions, each associated with some BER.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A maximum-likelihood sequence detector using the Viterbi Algorithm bases its bit decisions on probabilistic decision variables (branch and path metrics differences) that are ultimately related to conditional probabilities of observing a given received signal when a given symbol or symbol sequence has been sent. The well-known Viterbi algorithm is described in several publications e. g. <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="b"><text>S. Benedetto and E. Biglieri, "Principles of Digital Transmission: With Wireless Applications", Kluwer Academic / Plenum Publishers, 1999</text></nplcit>.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The Viterbi algorithm is widely used for channel decoding of trellis codes in communication systems as well as for detection in the presence of ISI ("equalization") (<nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>G. D. Forney, Jr., The Viterbi Algorithm", IEEE Proceedings, Vol. 61, pp.268-278, 1973</text></nplcit>). In the ISI context, some may consider the term "detector" to be more appropriate. For practical reasons, the decoder may be designed such that the information bits associated with a branch on a survivor path at time <i>t</i> can be released when the decoder begins operation on the branches at time <i>t</i> + <i>D</i> (<nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="b"><text>S. B. Wicker, "Error Control Systems for Digital Communication and Storage", Prentice Hall, 1995</text></nplcit>). <i>D</i> is the decoding depth, and is usually set to be five to ten times the constraint length of the code or the "memory" of the channel. An information-sequence error that occurs as a result of the release of information bits before the entire received sequence or stream has been decoded is called a truncation error. At low signal-to-noise ratio, the probability of truncation error is negligible for <b><i>D ≥</i></b> 6<i>M</i>, where <i>M</i> is the maximal memory order. We will hereinafter refer to the truncation mode Viterbi decoding as standard Viterbi decoding (SVD).<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The achievable speed of standard Viterbi decoding is limited by the nonlinear Add-Compare-Select (ACS) recursion, which cannot be parallelized. It was shown (<nplcit id="ncit0007" npl-type="s"><text>G. Fettweis and H. Meyr, "High-Speed Parallel Viterbi Decoding: Algorithm and VLSI-Architecture". IEEE Commun. Magaz., pp. 46-55, 1991</text></nplcit> (later referred to as Fettweis91): <nplcit id="ncit0008" npl-type="s"><text>H. Dawid and G.

In PVD schemes, the received sequence of symbols is usually divided into blocks and these blocks are processed in a specific, overlapping manner, basically exploiting the self-synchronizing nature of the blindly started Viterbi algorithm and the so called path merging effect.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Based on these decision variables it is possible to produce reliability information along with or instead of the decided bit stream, which e.g. is done in so-called soft-output detectors (e.g. soft output Viterbi algorithm SOVA, or maximum a posteriori probability MAP, detectors). Typically this reliability information is then used in a downstream soft-decision FEC decoder, which can provide better decoding results by making use of this reliability information.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">But also in the absence of a FEC decoder, the reliability information available in a hard decision output Viterbi detector allows to estimate the rate of decision errors.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5944844A"><text>US 5,944,844</text></patcit>, "Method for determining connection quality in a receiver utilizing a Viterbi Decoder" uses accumulated path metric differences, i. e. the sum of decision variables and the minimum of decision variables along the decoded path in the VA (Viterbi algorithm) to estimate BER. A drawback of this method is an increase of complexity since decision variables need to be stored until the trace-back step is completed and since accumulation of decision variable introduces complexity due to a floating-point format. Apart from the disclosure to compare estimates with predetermined threshold values the <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5944844A"><text>US 5,944,844</text></patcit> fails to expose a practical mapping from the measured observable to a BER estimate.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US6141388A"><text>US 6,141,388</text></patcit>, "Received signal quality determination method and systems for convolutionally encoded communications channels". Unlike the method of <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US5944844A"><text>US 5,944,844</text></patcit>, rather than using decision variables accumulated along the decoded path, this invention uses only the final decision metric in a decoded frame. This final decision<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> metric is then mapped to a BER estimate. The method is described only in connection with convolutionally encoded data streams and frame decoding. Again, there is no disclosure how to map the measured decision metrics to a BER estimate.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the context of decoding or detection techniques utilizing the VA for optical data transmission European patent application <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="EP1443697A"><text>EP 1 443 697 A</text></patcit>, wherein the preambles of the independent claims are based, suggests to determine the frequency of unreliable detection events. An unreliable detection event is defined as a decision under indifference amongst alternatives, e.g. when an output-relevant decision is made in a Viterbi detector between two alternative paths with identical metrics. This method is simple and provides very good estimation for high BER. Due to the high data rates in optical data transmission, this method is well usable down to a BER of 10<sup>-10</sup>. However, relatively long monitoring time is needed for estimating low BER. Also it is necessary to determine a calibration coefficient used in a BER estimation formula.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US5768285A"><text>US 5,768,285</text></patcit>, "Circuit for Evaluating Bit Error Rate Performance of a Data Decoder Having a Viterbi Detector" describes a circuit for evaluating bit error rate performance of a data decoder having a Viterbi detector in the context of synchronous data channels, particularly those used in telecommunications and magnetic data recording e. g. disk drives. Statistics are computed about the Euclidean distance between the correct branch at a time n and the closest competing branch. This distance referred to as the amplitude error margin (AEM) in <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US5768285A"><text>US 5,768,285</text></patcit>, is the distance between the current Viterbi decision metric and the decision boundary, which, when crossed, causes elimination of the correct path through the trellis as result of an error event. More specifically the difference between two Viterbi metrics for each state at the time n is calculated. After performing several other additions, subtractions and comparisons the resulting signal is counted and averaged over time in order to determine AEM statistics.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to the disclosure of <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="US5878098A"><text>US 5,878,098</text></patcit> "Method and Apparatus for Rate Determination in a Communications System" path metrics are used to determine the transmission data rate which may be a full, half, quarter etc. data rate. More specifically discriminant functions D12, D14, D18, D24, D28, D48 are calculated based on weighted differences of path metrics TM1, TM2, TM4, TM8 which are also referred to as total metrics in this reference. The various discriminant functions are compared to 0 and, depending on the results, a full, half, quarter or eighth rate frame is decoded provided that a cyclic redundancy check code does not indicate an error and a quality parameter is met.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">It is the object of this invention to provide a more quantitative method and circuit for bit error estimation.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">This object is achieved by the subject matters of the independent claims.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Preferred embodiments of the invention are the subject matters of the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Inventive embodiments based on equations (33) or (34) work without a priori knowledge about the type of channel.

The method is more complex than <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="EP1443697A"><text>EP 1 443 697</text></patcit> but it allows more accurate estimation. As a further advantage, the BER estimation requires less monitoring time for the same accuracy.

describe the application of the error monitoring method for both of them. For sake of simplicity, we will derive the new method for the case of MLSD "equalization" and binary transmission. This does not imply that application of the new estimation method is limited to this case. In the "equalization" scenario to be discussed, the channel memory <i>M</i> determines a number of states in the corresponding trellis, and two branches enter and leave each trellis state. For binary transmission, the number of the trellis states per stage is equal to 2<sup>M</sup> <i>.</i></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the following section, a schematic illustration of paths in a trellis 51 is used as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>.

Decoding starts either after having received the last transmitted symbol or after having received <i>D</i> symbols. In the latter case, which is also referred to as truncation mode, it might be assumed that a window 62 comprising D stages slides over the trellis. The left side of sliding window 62 indicates stage 63 at which the final decision on the most likely path is being taken. In any case, each state along the actually decoded path may be characterized by the metrics difference of two paths entering the state.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">An absolute difference of quantized log probabilities of two paths (quantized path metrics) entering the trellis state, named absolute path metrics difference (APMD) 64, is assigned to each state along the decoded path in the trellis.

Such values are available both after the first and after the second step of the PVD, i.e. at block centers and at block boundaries. Practically, each block can be characterized by two APMD values.
