The power tool of the embodiment described below is an example of a disc grinder 1. The disc grinder 1 generally includes a tool main body 2, a shifting portion 3, and a gear head portion 4. A circular grindstone 41 is mounted on a spindle 40 protruding downward from the bottom of the gear head portion 4. A grind stone cover 42 for preventing grind dust from scattering is mounted at the rear half of the grind stone 41.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the tool main body 2, a motor 10 is used as a drive source in a cylindrical main body case 2a. The main body case 2a may also serve as a handle for a user. A cooling fan 12 is fitted on an output shaft 11 of the motor 10. External air is suctioned from the rear portion of the tool main body 2 by rotation of the cooling fan 12 and moved to the front portion of the tool main body 2c The air serves to cool the drive motor 10. The output shaft 11 of the drive motor 10 is rotatably supported inside the main body case 2a by bearings 11a and 11b.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The rotational output of the drive motor 10 is transmitted to the spindle 40 through the continuously variable transmission mechanism 30 and the gear head portion 4. The number of revolutions of the output shaft 11 of the drive motor 10 is altered by the shifting portion 3. The shifting portion 3 includes a continuously variable transmission mechanism 30 and a shift control portion 20 for controlling the continuously variable transmission mechanism 30. The shifting portion 3 is located in a transmission case 3a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> connected to the front portion of the tool main body 2.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The continuously variable transmission mechanism 30 is preferably a three-point pressure type which includes a centrally-located sun roller 32 fitted on the output shaft 11 of the motor 10. It may also contain a plurality (three in the embodiment) of planetary rollers 33 having a conical surface 33b, a push roller 34 pressed to the planetary rollers 33, a pressure-adjusting cam mechanism 35 for transmitting a pushing force to the push roller 34 and shift rings 36 having an inner circumference pressed to the conical surfaces 33b of the planetary rollers 33.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the three-point pressure continuously variable transmission mechanism, the planetary rollers 33 rotate about the center axis and revolve around the sun roller 32 in the same direction as the rotation of the sun roller 32.

The sun roller 32 may be rotatably supported by the bearing 32a in the transmission case 3a. The sun roller 32 may then be pressed to the heads of the three planetary rollers 33.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The rear portion of the output shaft 31 is rotatably supported by the bearing 32b<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> fitted on the sun roller 32. The sun roller 32 and the output shaft 31 are coaxially positioned with the output shaft 11 of the motor 10.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The front portion of the output shaft 31 is rotatably supported in the front portion of the transmission case 3a by the bearing 31b. The front portion of the output shaft 31 protrudes from the inside of the transmission case 3a to the inside of the gear head portion 4. A bevel gear 43 of the driving side is mounted at the front end of the output shaft 31.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The three planetary rollers 33 are supported by support shaft portions 33a and are inserted in support holes 37e formed at three positions with regular intervals in the circumferential direction of the holder 37. The three planetary rollers 33are supported to be rotatable about the pivot axes of the support shaft portions 3 3 a with respect to the holder 37. The planetary roller 33 is supported with the rotational axis (support shaft portion 33a) inclined at a predetermined angle from the vertical position (position perpendicular to the output shaft 31).</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The push roller 34 is supported by the output shaft 31 whereby it may be rotated, axially displaced, and be pressed against the planetary rollers 33. The holder 37 is rotatably supported with respect to the transmission case 3a through a boss portion 34a disposed on the rear surface of the push roller 34. The pressure-adjusting cam mechanism 35 is disposed on the side of the front surface of the push roller 34.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The pressure-adjusting cam mechanism 35 may include a plurality of steel balls 39 interposed between the front surface of the push roller 34 and a pressing plate 38. Each of the steel balls 39 is fitted in cam grooves formed on the front surface of the push roller 34 and the rear surface of the pressing plate 38. A compressing spring 35a is disposed between the push roller 34 and the pressing plate 38. The pressing plate 38 is pressed to a flange portion 31a of the output shaft 31 and the axial movement is restricted<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> by the compressing spring 35a. The pressing plate 38 is coupled to the output shaft 31 by a key 31c. The pressing plate preferably integrally rotates with the output shaft 31.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">When a rotational load is applied to the output shaft 31, rotation is generated between the push roller 34 and the pressing plate 38, such that the steel balls 39 are moved to the shallow side of the cam groove by an external force. Eventually the force that presses the push roller 34 to the planetary roller 33 increases. The push roller 34 is pressed against each of the planetary rollers 33 by the external force and the biasing force of the compressing spring 35a. The sun roller 32 is pressed to the head of each of the planetary rollers 33 and the shift ring 36 is pressed to the conical surface 33b of each of the planetary rollers 33 by the same force.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The motor 10 rotates the sun roller 32 which thereby rotate the planetary rollers 33 about the pivot axis. The planetary rollers 33 revolve around the output shaft 31 while being supported by the holder 37. As the planetary rollers 33 revolve around the output shaft 31, the push roller 34 integrally rotates with the holder 37.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">When the push roller 34 rotates, the output shaft 31 integrally rotates via the pressure-adjusting cam mechanism 35. When the motor 10 is started, rotational power is transmitted to the spindle 40 through the continuously variable transmission mechanism 30 in the three-point pressing state. This power is used by a reduction gear train 45 of the gear head portion 4, to rotate a grindstone 41.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A bevel gear 43 of the driving side of the gear head portion 4 is fitted on the output shaft 31 of the continuously variable transmission mechanism 30. A bevel gear 44 of the receiving side is engaged with the bevel gear 43. The bevel gear 44 may be fitted on the spindle 40. The reduction gear train 45 with a constant reduction ratio may be composed of the engaged bevel gears 43 and 44. The spindle 40 lies perpendicular to the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> output shaft 31 of the continuously variable transmission mechanism 30 (output shaft 11 of the drive motor 10) and next to the reduction gear train 45. The output shaft 31 of the continuously variable transmission mechanism 30 is coaxially positioned with the output shaft 11 of the motor 10.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG 1</figref> a side grip 46 protrudes in a side direction at the left side of the gear head portion 4. A user holds the tool main body 2 with the right hand and holds the side grip 46 with the left hand.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">During power transmission between the spindle 40 and the grindstone 41, the shift ring 36 of the continuously variable transmission mechanism 30 may be positioned at an area on the planetary rollers 33 having a small diameter. When this occurs, the revolving speed of the planetary rollers 33 decreases, the rotation speed of planetary rollers 33 increases, and the rotational speed of the push roller 34 increases. In paragraphs, 29 and 30, for clarification, the "revolving speed" refers to the speed about which the planetary rollers revolve about the output shaft 31, while "rotational speed" refers to the speed about which they rotate about their own axis. In this way the reduction ratio of the continuously variable transmission mechanism 30 decreases and the spindle 40 rotates at a high speed.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">When the shift ring 36 is positioned at an area of the planetary rollers 33 having a large diameter, the revolving speed of the planetary rollers 33 increases, the rotation speed of planetary rollers 33 decreases and the rotation of the push roller 34 decreases. In this way the reduction ratio of the continuously variable transmission mechanism 30 increases and the spindle 40 rotates at a low speed.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The shifting portion 3 includes a shift control portion 20 for shifting the continuously variable transmission mechanism 30. The shift control portion 20 is disposed at the upper portion of the shifting portion 3, on the outer circumference of the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> shift ring 36. The shift control portion 20, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>, includes a shift motor 21, a drive pulley 22 fitted on the output shaft of the shift motor 21, an operation shaft 23 disposed in parallel with the output shaft of the shift motor 21, a receiving pulley 24 fitted on the operation shaft 23 and a driving belt 25 held around the drive pulley 22 and the receiving pulley 24. When the shift motor 21 starts, the operation shaft 23 rotates about the pivot axis by movement of the drive belt 25.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">A threaded portion 23a is formed on the operation shaft 23. An operation sleeve 26 is fitted on the circumference of the operation shaft 23. The threaded portion 23a of the operation shaft 23 is fastened in a threaded hole 26a of the operation sleeve 26. When the operation shaft 23 rotates about the pivot axis, the threaded portion 23a moves along the threaded hole 26a, such that the operation sleeve 26 moves in the axial direction (left-right direction in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>) of the operation shaft 23. A bifurcated operation arm 27 is disposed on the operation sleeve 26, preferably immovably, in the forward direction with respect to the operation sleeve 26.

When shifting the continuously variable transmission mechanism 30 to a low speed, the number of revolutions of the motor is reduced and one can rotate the spindle 40 with a large reduction ratio.

The stirring resistance of the lubricant effectively adds to the resistance of the planetary rollers 33, the rotational resistance of the holder 37, and the rotational resistance of the output shaft 31 of the continuously variable transmission mechanism 30. This, in turn, generates a loss of torque in the power transmission system.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The stirring resistance of the lubricant causes a decrease of the rotational torque of the spindle 40, such that the current load of the drive motor 10 increases.
