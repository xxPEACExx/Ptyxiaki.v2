A tubular lock ring having a plurality of dents or pawls<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> is slidably received between the outer and inner tubular members. In use, a pipe to be coupled is inserted into the coupling to the fullest extent and then slightly pulled back until the lock ring reaches a position near the inlet opening of pipe whereupon the dents or pawls are urged against the outer surface of pipe by the interaction with the tapered inner surface of the outer tubular member to block the pipe from withdrawal.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is necessary for the pipe coupling of this type to provide with means for preventing the lock ring from axial movement in the direction opposite to the pipe-insertion opening.

The distal end of the lock rings are, therefore, urged toward the insertion-opening even before insertion of pipe into the coupling so that the width of insertion-opening is narrowed. Accordingly, it is necessary to insert the pipe into the pipe coupling with a force sufficient for overcoming the biasing force applied to the lock rings without injuring inner and/or outer surfaces of the pipe with dents or pawls of the lock rings.

In the illustrated embodiment, a plurality of inwardly protruding pawls 74 and 75 have an inclined surface on the pipe insertion side and a generally vertical surface on the opposite side.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">As a result, when a pipe 8 is inserted into the pipe-receiving space 10 in place as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 12(c)</figref> and then moved in the direction of arrow, a plurality of inwardly protruding pawls 74 are urged on the outer surface 81 of pipe 8 to fasten the pipe 8 whereupon the outer lock ring 7 is moved together with pipe 8 in the same direction. At the same time, the free end 71 of the outer lock ring 7 is advanced over the inclined wall 55. The outer lock ring 7 is forcibily deformed there by the interaction with the inclined wall 55 to decrease its diameter and urge a plurality of radially inwardly protruding second pawls 75 against the outer surface 81 of the pipe 8.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">A plurality of inwardly protruding first pawls 74 are, therefore, carried by the outer lock ring 7 at the shrinked portion 72 to apply a pressure on the outer surface 81 of the inserted pipe 8, while a plurality of inwardly protruding second pawls 75 are carried at the free end 71 of the outer lock ring 7 such that the second pawls 75 are not normally contacted<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> under pressure with the outer surface 81 of inserted pipe 8. Accordingly, the pipe may easily be inserted into the pipe coupling 1 but steadily and firmly locked by the interaction between the second pawls 75 and the inclined wall 55 when the pipe 8 is pulled in a direction for withdrawing.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Since the outer lock ring 7 is necessarily moved with the inserted pipe 8 when the pipe 8 is moved in a direction for withdrawing, it is not necessary to constantly bias the lock ring 7 toward the opening for inserting a pipe by a spring as in the prior art pipe coupling comprising a movable lock ring.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">In cases where a pipe coupling for detachably connecting one or more pipes is desired, it is necessary to detachably connect the outer tubular member 5 around the inner tubular member 4. The inserted pipe may be removed by disconnecting the outer tubular member from the inner tubular member and releasing the pipe from the outer lock ring.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 11</figref>, the inner lock ring 6 has an outwardly bulged portion 62 of which free end 61 is spaced apart from the inclined wall 45 before insertion of pipe 8. Similarly, the outer lock ring 7 has an inwardly shrinked portion 72 of which free end 71 is spaced apart from the inclined wall 55 before insertion<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> of pipe 8. Accordingly, the second pawls 65 of the inner lock ring 6 and the second pawls 75 of the outer lock ring are each retracted radially inwardly or outwardly to a position where the second pawls 65 or 75 do not essentially abut on the inner or outer surface of the pipe 8.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">The inner and outer surfaces 80 and 81 of a pipe 8 to be inserted are thus kept substantially free of injury when the pipe 8 is inserted. In the prior art pipe couplings comprising a movable or unmovable lock rings, the inner or outer surface of pipe is often injured by the pawls when the pipe is inserted. Moreover, the locking effect and the sealing effect by the inner lock ring 6 or outer lock ring 7 of the illustrated pipe coupling 1 are further improved by the use of one or more seal rings as will be discussed below.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">In the illustrated embodiment, a plurality of radially outwardly protruding first pawls 64 carried by the inner lock ring 6 and a plurality of radially inwardly protruding first pawls 74 carried by the outer lock ring 7 are located one another in axially displaced positions.

Also in the illustrated embodiment, the first pawls 64 on the inner lock ring 6 are located at a position where the distance of bulged portion 62 is maximum from the center axis of the inner lock ring 6. Similarly, the first pawls 74 on the outer lock ring 7 are located at a position where the distance of shrinked portion 72 is minimum from the center axis of the outer lock ring 7. The location of the first pawls 64 of the inner lock ring 6 and the first pawls 74 of the outer lock ring 7 in this manner allows both of first pawls 64 and 74 to deform to the fullest extent radially inwardly or radially outwardly without increasing the resistance of the pawls 64 and 74 when pipe 8 is inserted.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">In the illustrated embodiment, the second pawls 65 and 75 are also located one another at axially displaced positions.
