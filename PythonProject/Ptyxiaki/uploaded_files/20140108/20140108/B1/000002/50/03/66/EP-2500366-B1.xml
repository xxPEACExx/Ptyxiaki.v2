load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a process for producing a polytetrafluoroethylene aqueous emulsion whereby the environmental load is little, and it is possible to obtain a polytetrafluoroethylene aqueous emulsion containing polytetrafluoroethylene microparticles having a high molecular weight, a polytetrafluoroethylene aqueous emulsion obtainable by such a process, a polytetrafluoroethylene aqueous dispersion obtainable by using such an aqueous emulsion, a polytetrafluoroethylene fine powder, and a stretched porous material.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">An aqueous emulsion of polytetrafluoroethylene (hereinafter referred to as "PTFE") is obtainable by emulsion-polymerizing tetrafluoroethylene (hereinafter referred to as "TFE"). Such an aqueous emulsion of PTFE (hereinafter referred to as a "PTFE aqueous emulsion") is subjected to stabilization treatment by adding e.g. a nonionic surfactant, as the case requires, and concentrated to obtain a PTFE aqueous dispersion. And, after adding various compounding ingredients, such a dispersion is used for application to various coatings or application for impregnation. Further, a fine powder of PTFE (hereinafter referred to as a "PTFE fine powder") is obtainable by exerting a shearing force to a PTFE aqueous emulsion to coagulate PTFE microparticles, followed by drying. The PTFE fine powder is molded by a method such as paste extrusion molding and then used for various applications.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the emulsion polymerization of TFE, a fluorinated emulsifier is usually employed. As such a fluorinated emulsifier, ammonium perfluorooctanoate (structural formula: CF<sub>3</sub>(CF<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>COONH<sub>4</sub>, hereinafter referred to as "APFO") having 8 carbon atoms wherein the main chain is composed solely of carbon atoms, is commonly used. However, APFO is not present in the natural world and is a hardly decomposable substance, and further, it has been pointed out that its biological accumulation property is high, and it has been proposed to suppress its discharge from the environmental aspect.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Whereas, many techniques have been proposed to use a fluorinated carboxylic acid containing etheric oxygen atoms in its molecule, or its salt, as a fluorinated emulsifier having a low biological accumulation property (e.g. Patent Documents 1 to 3).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent Document 1 discloses a fluorinated emulsifier of the formula CF<sub>3</sub>-(OCF<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub>-O-CF<sub>2</sub>-X (wherein X is a carboxylic acid or its salt, and m is from 1 to 6) and/or CF<sub>3</sub>-O-(CF<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>-(OCF(CF<sub>3</sub>)-CF<sub>2</sub>)<sub>z</sub>-O-L-Y (wherein Y is a carboxylic acid or its salt, z is from 0 to 3, and L is -CF(CF<sub>3</sub>)-, -CF<sub>2</sub>- or -CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>-). Further, in Example 1 thereof, CF<sub>3</sub>-O-C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub>-OCF(CF<sub>3</sub>)COONH<sub>4</sub> is disclosed, and relatively high molecular weight PTFE having a standard specific gravity (hereinafter referred to as "SSG") of 2.154 is<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> produced. However, in a Comparative Example using APFO, SSG is 2.148, whereby it is suggested that with the above fluorinated emulsifier, the molecular weight can hardly be increased. Further, the solid content concentration is less than 10%, whereby the ability as a surfactant is presumed to be low as compared with APFO.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Patent Document 2 discloses a process for producing PTFE by using at least 800 g/mol of a dispersant wherein a fluoropolyether acid or its salt, and a fluorinated emulsifier having a main chain length of at most 6 atoms are used in combination. In Examples 5 to 9 therein, a fluoropolyether having a molecular weight of about 2,100 and C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>7</sub>-O-CF(CF<sub>3</sub>)-COONH<sub>4</sub> are used in combination. Although a few percent of PTFE is coagulated and deposited during the polymerization, it is possible to obtain a PTFE aqueous emulsion having a solid content concentration of from 28.0 to 29.9%, and a sufficient stability of the PTFE aqueous emulsion can be secured. However, SSG of PTFE is 2.177, whereby it is presumed difficult to increase the molecular weight of PTFE. Further, 20% of the dispersant used, is a fluoropolyether having a molecular weight of about 2,100. Such a fluoropolyether has a molecular weight higher than APFO, whereby there is a concern about its accumulation in vivo or its discharge in vitro as well as its residual amount in a PTFE product or its influence to a molded product.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Patent Document 3 discloses a method for emulsion-polymerizing TFE by means of such a fluorinated emulsifier that among compounds represented by Rf<sup>1</sup>-O-(Rf<sup>2</sup>O)<sub>n</sub>-Rf<sup>3</sup>-COOM (wherein Rf<sup>1</sup> is a C<sub>1-3</sub> fluoroalkyl group, each of Rf<sup>2</sup> and Rf<sup>3</sup> which may be the same or different, is a C<sub>1-3</sub> fluoroalkylene group, M is anyone of H, K, Na or NH<sub>4</sub>, and n is an integer of 0 or more), at least two compounds different in the value of n are present so that the average value is from 2 to 4. If the fluoroalkyl group in the fluorinated emulsifier becomes a long chain, the residual amount in PTFE increases, although the surface activating performance may be improved, and if it becomes a short chain, the surface activating performance tends to be inadequate, although the residual amount in PTFE may be small. It is disclosed that by combining fluorinated emulsifiers having long and short chains, the fluorinated emulsifiers can easily be removed from PTFE, and further, the surface activating performance can sufficiently be obtainable. In Examples, the solid content concentration is 33.0%, and a sufficient stability of a PTFE aqueous emulsion is secured. On the other hand, SSG is 2.189, whereby it is presumed difficult to attain a high molecular weight of PTFE.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The residual amount in PTFE is influenced by the chain length of the long chain component and the mixing ratio to the short chain component. In Examples in Patent Document 3, CF<sub>3</sub>O(CF<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>COONH<sub>4</sub> contained in an amount of 10% has a length of the main chain excluding the carboxy group being 11 atoms as the sum of carbon and oxygen atoms, and thus, is likely to have a high residual nature as compared with APFO having a length of the main chain being 7 atoms.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Thus, with the fluorinated emulsifier presumed to have a lower residual nature in PTFE than APFO and low biological accumulation, the surface activating performance is low, the stability of the PTFE aqueous emulsion is inadequate, and various problems may occur, and it is difficult to obtain PTFE having a high molecular weight. By using a high molecular weight fluoropolyether or a fluorinated emulsifier having a longer chain in combination, the surface activating performance will be improved, but there is a concern about the problem of the residual nature in PTFE or the influence to a molded product.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Patent Document 4 discloses that by copolymerizing a (perfluoroalkyl)ethylene to<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> TFE at the initial stage of emulsion polymerization of TFE so that the content of polymerized units derived from the (perfluoroalkyl)ethylene will be from 0.005 to 0.05 mol%, it is possible to obtain a PTFE fine powder excellent in extrusion processability, whereby uniform stretch processing is possible, and a high strength porous material can be obtained. It is disclosed that as a fluorinated emulsifier, a C<sub>7-9</sub> ammonium perfluoroalkane carboxylate is preferably employed, but in each of Examples, APFO is used. Thus, since APFO is used as a fluorinated emulsifier, there has been a problem that the environmental load is large. Further, Patent Document 4 discloses nothing about the heat resistance which is an important element in the molding of a stretched porous material of PTFE. Further, there is no disclosure relating to the stability of the PTFE aqueous emulsion. Therefore, it has been not known whether or not it is possible to obtain a PTFE aqueous emulsion whereby the stability of the PTFE aqueous emulsion is sufficiently high to such an extent not to impair the processability or moldability, and it is possible to prepare a molded product excellent in heat resistance, in a case where a fluorinated emulsifier having a lower surface activating performance than APFO is employed.</p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT DOCUMENTS</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>Patent Document 1:</dt><dd><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20070015865A"><text>US Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0015865</text></patcit></dd><dt>Patent Document 2:</dt><dd><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20080269408A"><text>US Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0269408</text></patcit></dd><dt>Patent Document 3:</dt><dd><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2009014136A"><text>WO 2009/014136</text></patcit></dd><dt>Patent Document 4:</dt><dd><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP11240917A"><text>JP-A-11-240917</text></patcit></dd></dl></p><heading id="h0005">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">TECHNICAL PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">It is an object of the present invention to provide a PTFE aqueous emulsion, whereby the environmental load is little, the stability of the PTFE aqueous emulsion is sufficiently high to such an extent not to impair the subsequent processability and moldability, and a molded product excellent in heat resistance can be produced, and a process for its production, a PTFE aqueous dispersion, a PTFE fine powder, and a stretched porous material.</p><heading id="h0007">SOLUTION TO PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present invention provides the following.

This CF<sub>2</sub>=CF-O-C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>7</sub> (the number of carbon atoms in Rf<sup>2</sup> is 3) having a monomer reactivity ratio r<sub>TFE</sub> exceeding 8, has a low reactivity with TFE, and as will be shown in Comparative Example 3 given hereinafter, even if the reaction is initiated with a very small amount at the initial stage of the polymerization, the polymerization rate substantially decreases, the molecular weight of PTFE cannot be increased, and further, a sufficient yield of PTFE cannot be obtained.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">With respect to the comonomer represented by the above formula (3), the monomer reactivity ratio r<sub>TFE</sub> in copolymerization of CF<sub>2</sub>=CF-O-(CF<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CF=CF<sub>2</sub> with TFE was calculated by the Fineman-Ross formula by obtaining the composition in the polymer formed immediately after the initiation of the copolymerization with TFE in various charge compositions and found to be 5.7.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The comonomer represented by the above formula (4) may, for example, be perfluoro(5-methoxy-1,3-dioxole), or perfluoro(2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxole). The monomer reactivity ratio r<sub>TFE</sub> in copolymerization of perfluoro(2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxole) with TFE was calculated by the Fineman-Ross formula by obtaining the composition in the polymer formed immediately after the initiation of the copolymerization with TFE in various charge compositions and found to be 1.8.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Thus, the present inventors have found that by adding a very small amount of the highly reactive comonomer having a monomer reactivity ratio r<sub>TFE</sub> within the above range at the initiation of emulsion polymerization of TFE, even if a fluorinated emulsifier having a low surface activating performance is used, it is possible to produce a PTFE aqueous emulsion having PTFE microparticles with a high molecular weight dispersed, whereby the stability of the PTFE aqueous emulsion is sufficiently high to such an extent not to adversely affect processabilities, etc., and it is possible to obtain a molded product having a high heat resistance. The reason is not necessarily clear, but is considered to be as follows.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">That is, it is considered that at the initial stage of the emulsion polymerization of TFE, TFE and the highly reactive comonomer are copolymerized, whereby PTFE formed at the initial stage of the polymerization takes a crystalline-destroyed structure, and at the time of forming nuclei of primary particles, it is likely to take a structure close to a sphere. And, it is considered that as the nuclei of primary particles are likely to take a structure close to a sphere, the degree for association of the nuclei to one another tends to be less, and more nuclei of primary particles tend to grow in a state where the particle sizes are uniform, while formation of abnormal particles such as rod-form<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> particles or coarse particles is suppressed. Further, it is considered that as the formation of abnormal particles such as rod-form particles or coarse particles is suppressed, a uniform stretched structure can easily be formed, and a defective structure can be suppressed, whereby the mechanical strength will be improved.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">And, in order to increase the molecular weight of PTFE, it is important that the comonomer is consumed in the very initial stage of the emulsion polymerization and becomes nonexistent from the emulsion polymerization system. Especially, in order to obtain an excellent stretched porous material of PTFE, it is important that in the later stage of the polymerization, the amount of radicals newly generated in the emulsion polymerization system is suppressed as far as possible to let living polymerization proceed as far as possible until the polymerization reaction is deactivated and not to hinder the polymerization reaction for improving the molecular weight.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Each of the (polyfluoroalkyl)ethylene (a) represented by the above formula (1) and the comonomer (b) having a monomer reactivity ratio r<sub>TFE</sub> of from 0.1 to 8, is excellent in the reactivity with TFE, and therefore, by incorporating it in such a very small amount as to be from 0.001 to 0.01 mass% relative to the final amount of PTFE produced in the emulsion polymerization system, it will be almost completely consumed in the initial stage of the emulsion polymerization of TFE and it is possible to prevent deactivation of the polymerization reaction at a later stage of the polymerization. It is considered that as a result, PTFE microparticles having a high molecular weight and having an average primary particle size of from 0.1 to 0.3 µm can be formed.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Here, if the amount of the highly reactive comonomer used is too much, the comonomer is not wholly consumed at the very initial stage of the emulsion polymerization of TFE and will thereafter remain in the emulsion polymerization system, whereby deactivation of the polymerization reaction is caused, and the molecular weight of PTFE will not be increased so much, and further, the primary particle size of PTFE microparticles tends to be small. As a result, the stability of the PTFE aqueous emulsion tends to be remarkably high, and at the time of carrying out concentration of PTFE microparticles by adding a stabilizer to the obtained PTFE aqueous emulsion, the PTFE microparticles tend to be hardly sedimented, whereby the concentration rate decreases, and the productivity decreases. Further, at the time of coagulating PTFE microparticles by exerting a shearing force to the PTFE aqueous emulsion to obtain a PTFE fine powder, the coagulation time tends to be long, and the productivity of the PTFE fine powder tends to decrease.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Further, the molecular weight of PTFE cannot be made high, and in the PTFE microparticles, a region where a crystal structure cannot be formed, will increase, whereby the formed PTFE tends to be inadequate in stretchability and heat resistance. Particularly, the heat resistance represented by the stress relaxation time, will decrease.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Therefore, in the present invention, the highly reactive comonomer is incorporated to the emulsion polymerization system at the beginning of the emulsion polymerization, so as to be from 0.001 to 0.01 mass% relative to the final amount of PTFE produced. It is preferably from 0.002 mass% to 0.01 mass%. If the content of the highly reactive comonomer is lower than 0.001 mass%, the effect to improve the stability of the PTFE aqueous emulsion tends to be low. If the content exceeds 0.01 mass%, the highly reactive comonomer will not be consumed at the very initial stage of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the emulsion polymerization and will remain in the emulsion polymerization system, whereby the molecular weight of PTFE will not be increased so much, and the primary particle size of PTFE microparticles tends to be small.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In the present invention, the highly reactive comonomer may be used as diluted with a solvent free from causing a chain transfer. It is thereby possible to precisely control the amount of the comonomer to be added. As such a solvent, a fluorinated solvent having little chain transfer property may, for example, be used. Specifically, C<sub>5</sub>HF<sub>11</sub>, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>2</sub>F<sub>10</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>HF<sub>13</sub>, C<sub>7</sub>HF<sub>15</sub>, C<sub>8</sub>HF<sub>17</sub>, CF<sub>3</sub>CHFCHFCF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub> or CF<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OCF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>H may be mentioned. As the degree for dilution, it is preferred to use the solvent in an amount of from 0.1 to 10 parts by mass, per 1 part by mass of the highly reactive comonomer. If the amount of the solvent used is too small, precise control of the amount of the comonomer added tends to be inadequate, and if it is too much, chain transfer is likely to be caused even slightly by the dilution solvent to lower the molecular weight of PTFE thereby to present an adverse effect to the physical properties.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Now, the process for producing a PTFE aqueous emulsion of the present invention will be described.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In the present invention, TFE is emulsion-polymerized in the presence of an aqueous medium, a radical polymerization initiator and a fluorinated emulsifier.

Further, in an application to an electrode material for batteries, manganese dioxide powder, zinc powder, graphite powder, nickel oxyhydroxide powder, lithium manganate powder, lithium cobaltate powder, hydrogen storing alloy powder, may, for example, be mentioned.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The process for producing the PTFE fine powder is not particularly limited, and a<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> conventional process may be used for the production. For example, a shearing force such as stirring is exerted to the PTFE aqueous emulsion of the present invention to coagulate dispersed primary particles of PTFE microparticles, and coagulum are separated from the aqueous medium, followed by agglomeration, particle size regulation and drying to obtain a PTFE fine powder. Here, the agglomeration means a process wherein secondary particles obtainable by coagulation of primary particles of PTFE which were dispersed at the time of coagulation of the PTFE aqueous emulsion, will grow to a particle size of a several hundred µm. Further, the particle size regulation is a process wherein the particle state and particle size distribution of the secondary particles are regulated by continuous stirring after the agglomeration.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Specifically, by the following process, a PTFE powder can be produced.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">That is, the PTFE aqueous emulsion is diluted with water so that the PTFE concentration will be from 8 to 20 mass%, followed by exerting a shearing force by e.g. vigorous stirring to coagulate primary particles of PTFE. At the time of coagulating primary particles of PTFE, the pH of the PTFE aqueous emulsion may be adjusted, or an coagulation aid such as an electrolyte or a water-soluble organic solvent may be added to the PTFE aqueous emulsion, as the case requires. As the pH adjusting agent, sodium carbonate or sodium hydrogencarbonate may be mentioned. Further, the pH adjustment may be carried out in the presence of at least one compound selected from the group consisting of ammonia, an ammonium salt and urea. As the electrolyte, an inorganic salt such as potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, sodium carbonate or sodium hydrogencarbonate may be mentioned. As the organic solvent, an alcohol or acetone may, for example, be mentioned.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Then, a PTFE fine powder having primary particles of PTFE coagulated, is separated from the aqueous medium, followed by agglomeration and particle size regulation to obtain a wet state PTFE fine powder. Here, in the aqueous medium after separating the PTFE fine powder, the fluorinated surfactant is contained, and the fluorinated surfactant contained in such an aqueous medium, can be recovered by means of a method for adsorption by an ion exchange resin, a concentration method such as evaporation of moisture, or adsorption on activated carbon.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Then, the separated wet state PTFE fine powder (hereinafter referred to as a non-dried PTFE fine powder) is dried.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The temperature for drying the non-dried PTFE fine powder is preferably from 110 to 250°C, more preferably from 120 to 230°C. If the drying temperature is lower than 110°C, it takes time for the drying, and there may be a case where the moisture cannot adequately be removed. If the drying temperature exceeds 250°C, the paste extrusion pressure properties may not be improved. Here, in a case where the non-dried PTFE fine powder contains the fluorinated surfactant as adsorbed thereon, by introducing the air discharged during the drying into an aqueous alkaline solution, it is possible to recover the fluorinated surfactant contained in the dry air.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The drying of the non-dried PTFE fine powder is preferably carried out in an atmosphere containing ammonia. Here, the atmosphere containing ammonia means an atmosphere wherein ammonia gas can be in contact with the non-dried PTFE fine powder. For example, it means an atmosphere containing ammonia gas, or an atmosphere wherein ammonia or a compound to generate ammonia is dissolved in the moisture contained in the non-dried PTFE fine powder, and ammonia gas is generated by e.g. heating. As the compound to generate ammonia, an ammonium salt or urea may, for example, be mentioned, and such a compound is decomposed by heating to<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> generate ammonia gas. By carrying out the drying in an atmosphere containing ammonia, it is possible to lower the paste extrusion pressure of the fine powder without impairing the physical properties.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">The PTFE fine powder of the present invention has a stress relaxation time of at least 500 seconds, preferably at least 525 seconds, more preferably at least 550 seconds. In the present invention, the stress relaxation time means a time required for breaking of a sample when a stretched bead prepared by using the PTFE fine powder is stretched under conditions of a clamp distance of 3.8 cm, a stretching rate of 1,000 %/sec, and a total stretching of 2,400%, and such a stretched bead sample is left in an oven of 390°C with its both ends fixed by fixtures. As disclosed, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US5470655A"><text>US Patents 5,470,655</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US4576869A"><text>4,576,869</text></patcit>, the longer the stress relaxation time, the higher the heat resistance.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The PTFE fine powder of the present invention preferably has a SSG of from 2.135 to 2.175, more preferably from 2.135 to 2.165, particularly preferably from 2.135 to 2.155. SSG is used as an index for a relative molecular weight, and the lower the value, the higher the molecular weight generally. However, if the amount of the highly reactive comonomer introduced is large, the region of a non-crystalline structure further increases, whereby the density decreases and the value of SSG becomes small. The SSG value being too small means that the amount of the highly reactive comonomer introduced is large. In such a case, the average primary particle size of PTFE microparticles tends to be too small, and the stability of the PTFE aqueous emulsion tends to be excessively high. Further, the stress relaxation time becomes less than 500 seconds in many cases. This is considered to be attributable to an influence due to collapse of the crystal structure of PTFE. On the other hand, if the SSG value is too high, such means that the molecular weight is low, whereby various physical properties are deteriorated.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">By subjecting the PTFE fine powder of the present invention to paste extrusion molding, it is possible to obtain a desired molded product.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">A conventional method may be employed as a method for paste extrusion molding of the PTFE fine powder. For example, a method may be mentioned wherein the PTFE fine powder and a lubricant are mixed to impart flowability to the PTFE fine powder, followed by paste extrusion molding to obtain a desired shape. The mixing proportion of the lubricant may suitably be selected so as to let the PTFE fine powder have flowability. Such a proportion is usually preferably from 15 to 30 parts by mass, more preferably from 20 to 25 parts by mass, of the lubricant, per 100 parts by mass of the PTFE fine powder. As the lubricant, naphtha or a petroleum type hydrocarbon having a dry point of at least 100 is preferred. Further, it is also possible to add an additive such as a pigment for coloration or various fillers to impart strength and electrical conductivity.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Various shapes such as a tube shape, a sheet shape, a film shape and a fiber shape, may be employed as the shape of the paste extrusion molded product of the PTFE fine powder. As applications of the molded product, a tube, an electric wire covering, a sealing material, a porous membrane and a filter may be mentioned. Further, a stretched porous material of PTFE is obtainable by stretching after the paste extrusion of the PTFE fine powder. As the stretching conditions, a suitable rate, e.g. a rate of from 5 %/sec to 1,000 %/sec, and a suitable stretching ratio, e.g. a stretching ratio of 500%, may be employed. The porosity of the stretched porous material is not particularly limited, but the porosity is usually preferably within a range of from 50 to<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> 99%, particularly preferably within a range of from 70 to 98%. Various shapes such as a tube shape, a sheet shape, a film shape and a fiber shape may be adopted as the shape of an article made of the stretched porous material.</p><heading id="h0010">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p0070" num="0070">Now, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to Examples and Comparative Examples, but it should be understood that the present invention is by no means thereby restricted.</p><heading id="h0011">[Measuring methods]</heading><heading id="h0012">(A) Average primary particle size of PTFE microparticles (unit: µm)</heading><p id="p0071" num="0071">Measured by means of a laser scattering type particle size distribution analyzer (trade name "LA-920" manufactured by HORIBA, Ltd.).</p><heading id="h0013">(B) Standard specific gravity (hereinafter referred to also as SSG) of PTFE fine powder</heading><p id="p0072" num="0072">Measured in accordance with ASTM D1457-91 a, D4895-91 a. 12.0 g of a PTFE fine powder was weighed and held for two minutes under 34.5 MPa in a cylindrical mold having an inner diameter of 28.6 mm.
