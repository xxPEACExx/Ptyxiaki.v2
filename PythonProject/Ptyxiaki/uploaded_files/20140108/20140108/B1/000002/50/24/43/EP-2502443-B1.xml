mxw-id="PDES63960267" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to the field of wireless communications, and, more specifically, to apparatuses and methods for reducing the load on a serving gateway during a handover of a user equipment from a serving radio base station to a target radio base station in a communications network system.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) which is responsible for the standardization of the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Service) system is currently intensively discussing and working on the next generation mobile communication system of the UMTS system which is called LTE (Long Term Evolution). LTE is a technology for realizing high-speed packet-based communication that can reach high data rates both in the downlink and in the uplink. The 3GPP is not only working on LTE but also on the SAE (Service Architecture Evolution). The standardization work on those two items i.e. LTE and SAE has led to specifications of the so called EPC (Evolved Packet Core) and a new radio access network referred to as the E-UTRAN (Evolved Universal Terrestrial Access Network). The specifications of the SAE/LTE can be viewed as a milestone in the development of standards for the mobile/wireless broadband industry. The first release of SAE/LTE, referred to as release-8 (Rel-8) can provide peak rates of 300 Mbps in the downlink direction and about 75 Mbps in the uplink direction, a radio-network delay of e.g. 5 ms or less, a significant increase in spectrum efficiency and a network architecture designed to simplify network operation, reduce cost, etc. In order to support high data rates, LTE allows for a system bandwidth of up to 20 MHz. LTE is also able to operate in different frequency bands and can operate in at least frequency division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex (TDD).<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Other operation modes can also be used. The modulation technique used in LTE is known as OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The EPC is a multi-access core network based on IP (Internet Protocol) that enables deployment of operation of one common packet core network for 3GPP access (LTE, 3G and 2G), non-3GPP radio access (e.g. WLAN, WiMaX) and fixed access (e.g. Ethernet, xDSL, cable and fiber). The EPC is defined around important paradigms of mobility, policy management, security etc. User equipments or user terminals are provided with handover schemes between different radio access technologies (e.g. between LTE and WiMaX). Unlike the 2G/3G 3GPP radio access networks, which are connected to the circuit-switched domain (CS-domain) of the 3GPP core network, the E-UTRAN is instead connected to the EPC. The E-UTRAN protocols and user plane functions are therefore used for the transmission of traffic from IP-based real-time and non-real time applications/services. The LTE/SAE system architecture is considered flat where the user LTE/SAE architecture user plane as defined, e.g., in the document <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>ETSI TS 123 401 v8.6.0 (2009-06) "LTE; General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) enhancements for Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Networks (E-UTRAN) access</text></nplcit>" involves only two nodes: the LTE radio base station also known as eNB or eNodeB, and a network gateway node also known as S-GW (Serving-GateWay). This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> which depicts the 2G/3G architecture for user and control planes and the corresponding LTE architecture for user and control planes. As shown and as mentioned above, the LTE flat architecture user plane involves only two nodes the eNodeB and the serving gateway, whereas the 2G/3G architecture involves four nodes in the user plane. The advantage with having a flat architecture is that it obviously reduces the number of nodes involved in the signalling connections and media paths. A further advantage is that due to that the radio network controller (RNC) functionality of 2G/3G is incorporated inside the eNodeB, handovers and mobility will be easily negotiated and managed between eNodeBs which are connected to the core network using the core network radio access network interface. The S-GW acts as mobility anchor for mobility within 3GPP-specific access technologies, and also relays traffic between the 2G/3G GPRS support node (SGSN) access and the packet gateway. For E-UTRAN (i.e. LTE access network), the S-GW is directly connected to it<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> through an interface known as S1 interface, while the SGSN is the intermediate node when 2G/3G radio access network (i.e. GERAN/UTRAN) is used. The S-GW is thus highly involved in mobility and<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> handover scenarios within SAE/LTE alone and/or between SAE/LTE and 2G/3G and/or between SAE/LTE and non-3GPP access networks (e.g. WLAN, WiMaX). The MME (Mobility Management Entity) is also, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, incorporated in the architecture for handling control functions such as authentication, security and mobility/handover of a user equipment. The MME is thus a control plane entity in E-UTRAN access network technology. <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> also shows a HA (Home Agent); a GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node); a PDSN (Packet Data Serving Node); a BSC (Base Station Controller); a BTS (Base Transceiver Station) and a NodeB, which are part of 2G/3G.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Even though the flat architecture has it advantages as mentioned earlier, it also has it drawbacks. One of the drawbacks is that a flat architecture puts very high requirements on the S-GW node in terms of route updates in a high mobility environment i.e. in a network where a great number of base stations from the same and/or different technologies are deployed. In other words, since the S-GW node uses "normal" router technology with very high requirements on routes update capacity, the S-GW node may limit the total capacity of an environment wherein seamless mobility for a user equipment's sessions across the same and/or different access technologies is a requirement. By mobility is meant handing over ofUEs from a serving radio base station to a target radio base station.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">An object of the exemplary embodiments of the present invention is thus to address the above mentioned problem by apparatuses in the form of a proxy entity and a mobility management entity respectively and methods in the proxy entity and in the mobility management entity respectively, for handing over user equipments (UEs) from a source/serving radio base station to a target radio base station in a wireless telecommunications system without increasing route updates in a serving gateway of the system and without limiting the capacity of the system due to handover and/or roaming of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> user equipments within the same network access technology and/or between different network access technologies.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to an aspect of exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the above stated problem is solved by means of a proxy entity for reducing a load on a serving gateway (S-GW) of a wireless communications network system, during a handover of a UE from a serving radio base station to a target radio base station. The network system further comprising a MME.

However, it will be apparent from the following detailed description that the exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from these specific details.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The different exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described herein by way of reference to particular example scenarios. In particular the embodiments are described in a non-limiting general context in relation to a communications network based on LTE. It should be noted that the exemplary embodiments of the present invention are not restricted to only LTE but can be applicable in any other suitable wireless communication system wherein handover is performed such as in UMTS (or WCDMA), WiMaX (Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access), GSM, GPRS, etc. It should also be noted that the exemplary embodiments of the present invention can also be applicable in hybrid inter-operating systems such as LTE and UMTS and/or GSM and/or GPRS etc.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>, there is illustrated a simplified diagram 200 depicting the signalling involved in a conventional handover scenario in a wireless communications network LTE system. As shown, the diagram comprises a serving gateway (S-GW) 210; a mobility management entity (MME) 220, a first radio base station 230 denoted eNodeB LTE 1 here considered to be the radio base station serving a UE (not shown); and a second radio base station 240 denoted eNodeB LTE 2 to which the UE is to be handed over. eNodeB LTE 2 240 is therefore considered to represent the target radio base station.<br/>
The functions of S-GW 210 comprise: routing and forwarding of user data packets, while also acting as a mobility anchor for the user plane during e.g. inter-eNodeB handovers and as an anchor for mobility between the 3GPP LTE and other 3GPP or non-3GPP technologies. For idle state UEs, the S-GW 210 is configured to terminate the downlink (DL) data path and is also configured to trigger paging when DL data arrives for the UE. S-GW 210 is also configured to manage and store UE contexts, e.g. parameters of the internet protocol (IP) bearer service, network internal routing information. It also is configured to perform replication of the user traffic of the UE in case of lawful interception. The S-GW 210 is further responsible for tunnelling user plane traffic between a radio base station, e.g. eNodeB LTE1 230 and a packet data network gateway (PDG) (not shown). The S-GW 210 also performs other functions not explicitly described here.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The MME 220 acts as a control node. It is responsible for idle mode UE tracking and paging procedure including retransmissions. MME 220 is also involved in the bearer activation/deactivation process and is also responsible for choosing or selecting a S-GW for a UE at the initial attach and at time of intra-network handover (e.g. intra-LTE handover) involving Core Network (CN) node relocation. MME 220 is responsible for authenticating the user (by interacting with the e.g. a Home Subscriber Server (HSS), not shown). It should also be mentioned that the so called Non-Access Stratum (NAS) signaling terminates at the MME and it is also responsible for generation and allocation of temporary identities to UEs. The NAS is a functional layer running between the UE the CN. The layer supports traffic and signalling messages between the CN and UE.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The MME 220 also checks the authorization of the UE to camp on e.g. a service provider's Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) and also enforces UE roaming restrictions. The MME 220 is also the termination point in the network for ciphering/integrity protection for NAS signaling and handles the security key management. Lawful interception of signaling is also supported by the MME 220. The MME 220 also provides the control plane function for mobility between LTE and 2G/3G access technologies.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Referring back to <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>, prior to that a handover is initiated; the MME 220 is configured to set up a connection between the S-GW 210 and eNodeB LTE 230. This is performed by the MME 220 sending a connection setup request message S21 to the S-GW 210 and a connection set up request message S22 to eNodeB LTE 1 230. The message S21 is sent on a control plane and it comprises a group of parameters comprising e.g. the IP address of the destination terminating point which, in this case, is the S-GW 210. The message S22 is also sent on a control plane and it comprises a group of parameters comprising e.g. the IP address of the destination terminating point which, in this case, is the eNodeB LTE 1 230.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">After the setting up of the connection, a tunnel S23 is established between the S-GW 210 and eNodeB LTE 1 230. This tunnel S23 is a GPRS tunneling protocol for UMTS used<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> for user plane (GTP-U) and it comprises the IP address of eNodeB LTE 1 230, the IP address of the S-GW 210 and the tunnel identity/identifier of user data packet(s). The interface used for this tunnel is the so-called S1 interface.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">At mobility i.e. when the UE is to be handed over from eNodeB LTE 1 230 to eNodeB LTE 2 240 a handover request is negotiated between eNodeB LTE 1 and eNodeB LTE 2 on the control plane S24A and on the user plane S24B (GTP-U). The interface used for S24A and S24B is a so-called X2 interface defined between the serving eNodeBs LTE 1 and the target eNodeB LTE 2 240. Subsequently, a handover request S25 is transmitted from eNodeB LTE 1 230 to MME 220 on the control plane. The MME 220 then sends a handover request S26 to S-GW 210 on the control plane and a handover request S27 to eNodeB LTE 2 240, also on a control plane, requesting the setting up of a connection between the UE and the target radio base station eNodeB LTE 2 240. The MME 220 also sends a request S28 to eNodeB LTE 1 230 to release the connection between the UE and the serving radio base station eNodeB LTE 1 230. Thereafter a GTP-U tunnel S29 is established between S-GW 210 and the new serving radio base station e.g. eNodeB LTE 2 240. The GTP-U tunnel comprises the IP address of S-GW 210; the IP address of eNodeB LTE 2 240 and the tunnel identity/identifier.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">As described above, the S-GW 210 is highly involved during all handovers involved in the network. This also means that high requirements on routes update capacity are put on the S-GW 210 which therefore can limit the total capacity of a network. The capacity limitation due to the involvement of the S-GW 210 is even be higher since the functions of the S-GW are not restricted to handovers, as described earlier.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref> there is illustrated a simplified diagram 300 depicting the signalling involved in a handover according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br/>
As shown, the diagram comprises, as in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>, a serving gateway (S-GW) 310; a MME 320, a first radio base station 340 denoted eNodeB LTE 1, here considered to be the radio base station serving a UE (not shown); and a second radio base station 350 denoted eNodeB LTE 2 to which the UE is to be handed over. eNodeB LTE 2 240 is therefore the target radio base station. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> also depicts a proxy entity 330 which according to<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> exemplary embodiments of the present invention is configured to reduce the load on S-GW 310 during a handover of the UE from the serving radio base station eNodeB LTE 1 340 to the target radio base station eNodeB LTE 2 350 as will be described below.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>, prior to that a handover is initiated, the MME 320 is configured to set up a connection between the S-GW 310 and eNodeB LTE 1 340. This is performed by the MME 320 sending a connection setup request message S31 to the S-GW 230 and a connection set up request message S32 to eNodeB LTE 1 340. The message S31 is sent on a control plane and it comprises a group of parameters comprising e.g. the IP address of the destination terminating point which, in this case, is the S-GW 310. The message S32 is also sent on a control plane and it comprises a group of parameters comprising e.g. the IP address of the destination terminating point which, in this case, is the eNodeB LTE 1 340.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">After the setting up of the connection the MME 320 is, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, configured to send, on the control plane, a cross connect request message S33 to the proxy entity 330 or to a cross connect circuit/circuitry of the proxy entity 330 which supports a tunneling link protocol. The cross connect setup request message S33 is a request to establish, using the tunneling link protocol (GTP), a tunnel between the proxy entity 330 and the serving radio base station eNodeB LTE 1 340. The cross connect setup request message S33 comprises the address of eNodeB LTE 1 340. Subsequently, the cross connecting circuit of the proxy entity 330 is configured to establish a GTP-U tunnel S35 towards eNodeB LTE 1 340. This is done to replace or to reuse a previously established GTP-U tunnel S34 between the cross connecting circuit of the proxy entity 330 and the S-GW 310.The GTP-U tunnel S35 between the proxy entity 330 and eNodeB LTE 1 340 comprises a tunnel identity/identifier, the IP address of the proxy entity 330 and the IP address of the serving radio base station eNodeB LTE 1 340. The previously established GTP-U tunnel between the proxy entity 330 and the S-GW 310 comprises the tunnel identity/identifier, the IP address of S-GW 310 and the IP address of the proxy entity 330.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Referring back to <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>, at mobility i.e. when the UE is to be handed over from eNodeB LTE 1 340 to eNodeB LTE 2 350, a handover request is negotiated between eNodeB LTE I and eNodeB LTE 2 on the control plane S36A and on the user plane (GTP-U) S36B. The interface used for signals S36A and S36B is the X2 interface defined between the serving eNodeBs LTE 1 340 and the target eNodeB LTE 2 350. The MME 320 is further configured to receive a handover request S37 from eNodeB LTE 1 340 as in a conventional handover scenario (see <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>). However and according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the MME 320 is configured to send to the proxy entity 330 (or to the cross connecting circuit of the proxy entity 330), on the control plane, a request S38 to handover the UE from the eNodeB LTE 1 340 to eNodeB LTE 2 350, the request S38 comprising an identifier of the established tunnel and an address of eNodeB LTE 2 350. The MME 320 is further configured to transmit a request S39 to eNodeB LTE 2 350 requesting eNodeB LTE 2 to set up a connection towards the UE. The MME 320 is further configured to send to eNodeB LTE 1 340 a request S40 to release the connection between the UE and the serving radio base station. Subsequently and according to an exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the proxy entity 330 (or the cross connecting circuit of proxy entity) is configured to execute the cross connecting between the proxy entity and eNodeB LTE 2 by establishing a cross connect tunnel S41 (GTP-U) towards eNodeB LTE 2 350 using the identifier of the established tunnel and the address of eNodeB LTE 2, thereby reducing the load on the S-GW 310 during the handover of the UE. This is because the S-GW 310 is not involved in the mobility of the UE. This also means that the load on the control plane of the S-GW due to mobility is reduced or relieved leaving the S-GW 310 to perform other functions instead such as packet forwarding; replication of the user traffic of the UE in case of lawful interception etc. Furthermore, since the proxy entity 330 effectively handles the cross connection and the route updating of the cross connection between the proxy entity and eNodeBs, the proxy entity 330 limits the impact (over interface S1) on S-GW 310 and thereby relaxes the computational processing (CP) requirements in S-GW 310. The proxy entity 330 can be viewed as an aggregating node having a cross connecting functionality that offloads the requirements regarding route update capacity of the S-GW 310. The proxy entity 330 is not restricted to LTE. The proxy entity can e.g. be implemented in a<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> radio network control (RNC) node of a WCDMA network or can be a separate proxy entity connected to the RNC and located at the same layer as the base station controller (BSC) and RNC has in a GSM or a WCDMA network, respectively. Furthermore, the functionality of the proxy entity according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention can be implemented in a combined RNC and BSC node and connected to LTE leading to that all 3GPP standards share a common network topology over IP and one node type for each NAS type.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>, it should be mentioned that the GTP-tunnel S42 between the proxy entity 330 and the S-GW 310 is unchanged meaning that is it similar to the previously established tunnel S34. In other words, S42 is not involved during the handover process described above.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As described earlier, the MME 320, in according with the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, is responsible in sending the cross connect setup message to the proxy entity 330 and to further send to the cross connecting circuit of the proxy entity 330 the request to perform the handover of the UE from the serving to the target radio base station which is executed in the proxy entity. Thus the MME 320 controls the GTP-U tunnel cross connect in the cross connecting circuit of the proxy entity 330. Furthermore, at mobility the GTP-U tunnel between the S-GW 310 and the proxy entity is 310 reused since a new tunnel between the proxy entity 330 and the target base station is established (update of the cross connect). It should be mentioned that the functionalities of the MME 320 and the proxy entity 330 described above are not restricted to a handover scenario within a LTE network. In other words, the above is applicable in handovers in hybrid networks involving different technologies e.g. a handover between radio base stations of 3GPP technologies (e.g. LTE &lt;--&gt; LTE; or LTE &lt;--&gt; UMTS etc.), or between 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies (e.g. LTE &lt;--&gt; WLAN or LTE &lt;--&gt; WiMaX).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 4</figref> there is illustrated a hybrid network system 400 comprising nodes of a WCDMA network; nodes of a LTE network and nodes of a GSM network respectively, wherein the proxy entity 460 and the MME 420 in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the present invention can be applied.
