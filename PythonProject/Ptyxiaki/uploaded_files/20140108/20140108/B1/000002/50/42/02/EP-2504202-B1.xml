mxw-id="PDES63960262" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to covers for seat belt tongues, and to seat belt tongues.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows a typical configuration of a known three point inertia vehicle seat belt SB comprising a webbing W, an inertia reel I, a B-pillar BP, a tongue T, a buckle B and an end bracket EB. The webbing W is retractably connected to the inertia reel I, and extends from the inertia reel I up through the B-pillar BP, usually positioned adjacent to a user's shoulder. The webbing then passes through a webbing slot WS in the tongue T and then on to the end bracket EB. The buckle B is usually positioned adjacent to a user's hip on the opposite side of the user to the B-pillar BP.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref> shows a typical tongue T for engaging with the buckle B. The tongue T comprises a piece of plastic P moulded around a stainless extension E. The webbing slot WS is formed through both tongue T to enable the tongue T to be moved along the webbing W. To use the seat belt SB a user grasps the tongue T (usually the plastic part P thereof) to draw the webbing W from the inertia reel I. The user then fastens the tongue T to the buckle B using the extension E.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Proper use of the inertia reel seat belt involves the user (i) sitting well back in the seat, (ii) buckling up, ensuring the webbing is not twisted and the lap belt is laying across the hip bone (not the stomach) and (iii) removing the slack from the lap belt portion by gently pulling up on the shoulder section of the seatbelt webbing. A major problem with seat belts is that the lap belt portion of the seat belt tends to slacken over time when in use, which may lead to the seat belt webbing moving from the optimum position for safety (moving from over the hip bone, to across the stomach) and comfort. This is particularly relevant for the type of seatbelt shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> where the job of maintaining belt tension is done by the retraction mechanism in the inertia reel after the occupant removes the lap belt slack by gently pulling up on the shoulder section of the webbing. Persons wearing a seat belt with slack in the lap belt portion are typically at increased risk of injury and also are likely to take on a poor posture with the lower portion of the spine not aligning with the lumbar support of the vehicle seat. This poor posture or 'slouched' position often leads to lower back pain. Any vehicle collision with a seat belt with slack in the lap belt can lead to bruising of the stomach, internal bleeding/organ damage and in severe cases, the occupant may 'submarine' under the seatbelt, drastically reducing the efficiency of safety features of the vehicle such as airbags. On rollover, a slack lap belt can lead to significantly higher head movement towards the inner roof of the vehicle, leading to significantly higher chance of serious injury or death. Maintaining the tension on the lap belt is therefore desirable for maximum safety in any vehicle equipped with regular inertia reel seat belts.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE2741297"><text>DE 2741297</text></patcit> discloses a cover for a seat belt tongue according to the preamble of claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is an aim of the present invention to address problems associated with seat belts, whether identified herein or otherwise.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the present invention in a first aspect, there is provided a cover for a seat belt tongue according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The deformable body may be stretched, in use, to be elastically fitted to the seat belt tongue.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Suitably, the body has a first textured region for being gripped by a user. Suitably, the first textured region has a compressible element. Suitably, the first textured region has an elastically compressible element. Suitably, the first textured region has a plurality of compressible elements. Suitably, each compressible element is a protrusion extending from the body. The protrusion may be one of a nodule, a rib or a ridge. Suitably, the body has a second textured region distinct from the first textured region. Suitably, the second textured region has the features described for the first textured region. Suitably, the first and second textured regions are separated by an intermediate region. Suitably, first and second textured regions are arranged at an edge region of the body. Suitably the intermediate region is provided in region at which the webbing of seat belt will run<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> when the cover is in place on a seat belt tongue. Suitably, the webbing engagement projection is provided at the intermediate region.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Suitably, the webbing engagement projection is of similar or equal width to the webbing.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Suitably the webbing engagement projection comprises a wider portion that tapers to a narrow portion, the wider portion, narrow portion and taper being provided on a webbing engagement projection base. Suitably, the webbing engagement projection base provides a generally planar surface from which the taper and wider portion extend. Suitably, the generally planar surface lies generally parallel to a plane in use contains the seat belt tongue. Suitably, the webbing engagement portion does not obstruct passage of the webbing through a webbing slot in the tongue, through which the webbing passes, when the webbing is arranged in a plane parallel to and passing through the webbing slot but perpendicular to the tongue body. Suitably, the webbing engagement projection defines a webbing engagement angle to the webbing slot, at which the webbing engagement projection contacts the webbing. Suitably, the webbing engagement angle is a smaller angle than the angle at which the tongue would<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> contact the webbing, absent the cover and the webbing engagement projection. Suitably, the cover is shaped and dimensioned to allow the seat belt tongue to be moved uninhibited relative to webbing of a seat belt when in place on a seat belt tongue and when the tongue and webbing are arranged at an angle smaller than the webbing engagement angle. Suitably, the engagement angle is less than 30 degrees.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Suitably, the cover comprises one or more secondary belt retaining features, arrangeable in use to urge the lap belt portion of seat belt webbing toward contact with the webbing engagement projection. Suitably, the secondary belt retaining feature is integral with the cover. Suitably, the secondary belt retaining feature comprises the same material as the cover.

The cover 1 has an elastically deformable body 10 to allow it to be easily fitted to and removed from a tongue T as required. The cover 1 is stretchable to envelop a portion of the tongue T, but when released contracts toward its original un-stretched shape. In use, the cover 1 is attached to the tongue T and improves the ability of the user to grasp that tongue T and arrange the seatbelt SB associated with the tongue T for his or her protection during a crash. Furthermore, the cover 1 comprises a webbing engagement projection 100. The webbing engagement portion 100 is arranged to resist movement of the webbing relative to the tongue T when the seat belt SB is<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> fastened in use. Proper use of the inertia reel seat belt involves the user (i) sitting well back in the seat, (ii) buckling up, ensuring the webbing is not twisted and the lap belt is laying across the hip bone (not the stomach) and (iii) removing the slack from the lap belt portion by gently pulling up on the shoulder section of the seatbelt webbing. When the seat belt SB is in use the webbing contacts the webbing engagement projection 100 and provides a frictional resistance thereto.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The position and size of the webbing engagement projection 100 are such that the tongue T is able to freely slide over the webbing to allow the seatbelt SB to be fastened with the tongue T in the buckle B. Once fastened, in accordance with safety guidelines the slack is removed from the lap belt portion of the seat belt SB by pulling up on the shoulder section of the seat belt SB. Initially, tension is maintained in the seatbelt by the inertia reel spring. Removing the slack from the lap belt portion of the seat belt SB is important to ensure that it rests over the pelvis and hips of the wearer, rather than the abdomen. The former set up is that used when conducting crash tests for EuroNCAP, NCAP and other safety organisations.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Movement of the wearer may serve to loosen the shoulder section and lap belt section, leading to the lap belt section riding up onto the abdomen of the wearer with a consequent reduction in protection provided by the seatbelt SB and very different dynamics of movement compared to the crash test situation using ATDs (Crash. Test 'Dummies'). However, cover 1 comprising the webbing engagement projection 100 serves to maintain tension in the lap belt section, and to prevent any slack in the shoulder section being transferred through the tongue to the lap belt section. As the lap belt and/or shoulder section of webbings are flexed in use across the wearer's body they press against the webbing engagement projection, giving rise to the functional resistance against movement of the webbing through the webbing slot.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The body 10 has an external surface and an internal surface. The internal surface comprises a channel 11 that is accessed through an opening 12 in the body 10. The channel 11 is shaped and dimensioned to in use receive a tongue T. The external surface includes the webbing engagement projection 100. In use, the body 10 is stretched to allow the tongue T to be inserted through the opening 11 into the channel 12, and then the body 10 is released to elastically secure the cover 1 onto the tongue T.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> shows that the body 10 has a spine 13 from which first and second hooked portions 14, 15 extend. The spine 13 and hooked portions 14, 15 are dimensioned to allow the cover 1 to elastically fitted to a plastic part P of the tongue T, so that the cover 1 is hooked over the tongue T and held in place. The cover 1 of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> has a pattern provided on the webbing engagement projection 100 to provide suitable friction characteristics between the cover 1 and the webbing W when in use.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">Figures 4a to 4d</figref> show how according to another example embodiment the cover is fitted to the tongue T, and how the tongue is fitted to webbing . The cover 1 is selected by a user then stretched in preparation for attachment to the tongue T. The user inserts the tongue T through the opening 12 into the channel 11. The hooked portions 14, 15 are positioned around the ends of the tongue T. After the user has positioned the hooked portions 14, 15, and they are released to contract around the tongue T. The contraction of the hooked portions 14, 15 draws the cover 1 onto the tongue T, where it is held in position as shown by <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4b</figref>.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The example embodiments shown are intended to be fitted onto any standard size or shape of 'single pass' seat belt tongue.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref> shows a second embodiment of a cover of the present invention having all the features of the first embodiment and a securement means 30. The securement means 30 is a strap 31 and a fastening means 32. The strap 31 is located in an end region of one the hooked portion 15, and the fastening means 32 is located in an end region of the other hooked portion 14. The strap 31 is fitted to the fastening means 32, in use, after the cover has been fitted on the tongue. The securement means 30 provides and additional means for securing the cover to the tongue 7.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The fastening means is a combination of a protrusion 33 extending from the hooked portion 14 and an aperture 34 located at or near the distal end of the strap 31, i.e., the aperture 34 is located at the end of the strap 31 that is not attached to the hooked portion 15. In use, the strap 31 is secured by stretching and then slot-fitting the protrusion 33 into the aperture 34.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Although <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref> shows only one strap 31 and fastening means 32, it is possible to provide more than one strap, for example two straps, one on either side of the cover 1.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">After the cover 1 has been positioned on the tongue T, a user is able to grab the cover 1 to draw the webbing W across their body and insert the extension E into the buckle B. The cover 1 is fabricated from or with a covering of a rubbery or, suitable, pliable plastics material, such as silicone elastomers. The cover 1 is slightly squashed under the grasp of a user, which generates more friction between the user's fingers than would be the case with the normal hard plastic P of the known tongue T shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>.
