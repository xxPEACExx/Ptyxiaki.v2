whiteboard.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Teaching professionals utilize many different educational tools to illustrate concepts and assist student understanding and development. Instructors have used chalkboards for decades to illustrate visual characteristics to a students to help them visualize and understand information. A chalkboard utilizes a piece of chalk, usually of a lighter color, against a darker color board. The chalk, however, caused dust when used. Chalkboards were also limited in their color range and the visibility of the chalk to a large audience. Whiteboards or dry-erase boards, were subsequently developed to permit an instructor to write on a white colored board with markers of various colors. The marks were then easily removed by wiping them off the surface of the board. The whiteboards are generally easier to use and less messy. The use of whiteboards have proliferated into everyday use in offices, meeting rooms, classrooms, and other environments.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, one common problem with conventional whiteboards, is that there are essentially only two types: (1) permanently mounted, and (2) portable. The permanently affixed whiteboard acts as a replacement to the chalkboard, but is limited to only that functionality. A portable whiteboard generally has a plurality of feet and a support to hold the board on a wheelable base. Therefore, the whiteboard may be replaced and moved to a new location as needed by the user- The portable whiteboard is generally smaller, and is still cumbersome to set up, remove, and store. Interactive whiteboards are generally even more difficult to transport as<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> they are generally heavier and more delicate because of the additional electronics within the board.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">United States patent publication <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6688568B1"><text>US 6,688,568 B1</text></patcit> describes a fixing device comprising a rod hooked on a wall.

In an exemplary embodiment, the mounting system 100 has a top rail 110 that is attached to a wall or support surface (not shown) for the whiteboard (not shown). The mounting arm 120 is removably attached to the top rail 110. The top rail 110 may include a support protrusion 112 that is configured to mate with an attachment portion 122 of the mounting arm 120. At least one and, alternatively, a plurality, of support rails 130 is/are connected to the mounting arms 120 and support the attached whiteboard. In an embodiment, the whiteboard (not shown) may be removably attached directly to the support rail 130 or may utilize a support feature 132 on the support rail 130.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The support rails 130 are positioned along the mounting arms 120 at a plurality of heights to vertically adjust the whiteboard location. Additionally, the board may be supported at a plurality of positions on the support rails 130 which may permit horizontal adjustment of the board relative to the support rails 130. The mounting arm 120 has at least a first end and a second end. The second end of the mounting arm 120, which is located opposite to the attachment portion 122 and the first end 119 of the mounting arm 120, includes a leveling foot 124 that may adjust the distance from the wall which may ultimately assist in properly aligning the mounting system 100 relative to the wall.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In an exemplary embodiment, the mounting arms 120 may be contoured to fit over an existing wall feature. It is contemplated that the mounting arms 120 may have a convex and/or concave portion which may hold the whiteboard away from the supporting surface, such that a user may install the whiteboard over an existing blackboard. Moreover, the mounting arms 120 may be constructed to be longer than the height of the whiteboard, to permit greater placement options for the whiteboard on the mounting arms 120. Further the extended length of the mounting arms 120 may permit the mounting arms 120 to span and if necessary, exceed the height of the underlying blackboard (not shown). However, it should be understood that the mounting arms 120 may alternatively be configured to have no convex or concave portions, and alternatively be flat against the support wall or within the frame of the whiteboard, to provide different aesthetic and special options.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a close up of the support rail 130 whereby the support rail 130 attaches to the mounting arm 120.

For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 1A</figref>, the support feature 132 is a cleat similar to the support protrusion 112 of the top rail 110. In an exemplary embodiment, the support feature 132 may be a cleat that resembles an upside down, half U-shaped hook that engages a corresponding feature on the back of the whiteboard (not shown). The whiteboard may include an upper edge including a lip projected outward then downward<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> to create a mating hook for the support feature 132. In another exemplary embodiment, the support feature 132 of the support rail 130 and the corresponding feature of the whiteboard (not shown) are configured to permit the whiteboard to easily slide in a horizontal direction. A stop may be provided along the support rail 130 or the corresponding feature of the whiteboard to prevent the board from sliding out of its rail or overbalancing the mounting system. It should be understood that a cleat is provided to removably attach the board to the support rail, however, a plurality of different attachment means may be utilized to attach same.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In another alternate embodiment, the mounting system may utilize hook and loop fasteners that may be used in place of the support feature on at least one of the support rails 130. For example, the mounting system 100 may include two support rails 130a and 130b, as seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. The upper support rail 130a may be attached to the whiteboard with a support feature 132, as described above, while the lower support rail 130b may be attached to the whiteboard with a hook and loop fastener. In this case, the surface of the support rail 130b may have a hook or loop fastener, while the back of the whiteboard has the corresponding loop or hook fastener. The hook and loop fastener may be attached to the support rail or whiteboard by taping, gluing,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> adhering, bonding, stapling, or other device. Alternatively, for a more permanent connection, the support rail may be adhered to the whiteboard directly through taping, gluing, adhering, bonding, or other device.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates the lower corner of the mounting system 100 including the mounting arm 120 and leveling foot 124. In an exemplary embodiment, the mounting arms 120 includes a leveling foot 124 to adjust the angle of the mounting system 100. The leveling foot 124 may be an adjustable pad 128. The height of the leveling foot 124 may be adjusted utilizing devices, such as a sliding extension, a screw extension, or the like. The leveling foot 124 may be attached to the mounting arm 120 or another embodiment may be integrally formed with the mounting arm 120. In an exemplary embodiment, the leveling foot may be a cap portion that may be fitted over the end portion 131 of the mounting arm 120. The adjustable pad 128 may be adjusted to properly align the whiteboard mounting system 100.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 1C</figref> illustrates a cut away view of the lower corner of the mounting system 100, including the leveling foot 124 and finger cleat 140, according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. In an exemplary embodiment, a finger cleat 140 may be mounted to the support surface (not shown) to additionally secure the leveling foot 124 and potentially add further support to the mounting system 100. The finger cleat 140 includes an indention 142 to fit around a neck 129 of the leveling foot 124 between the adjustable pad 128 and the mounting arm 120. The finger cleat 140 may be positioned so that the indention 142 in horizontal, and therefore, locks the mounting system 100 in place once installed. The finger cleat 140 may optionally be installed so the invention 142 faces upwards, and therefore, permits the mounting system 100 to be removed and replaced, repeatedly sliding into the indention from the top side while fitting the mounting system to the top rail. The finger cleat 140 may be secured to the support surface by a screw or nail 144 through hole 146. Other securing devices may be used, such as taping, anchoring, adhering, gluing, bonding, and the like.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In an exemplary embodiment, the system may utilize hook and loop fasteners that may be added to the mounting system 100 for additional stability. The adjustable pad 128 located on the leveling foot 124 of the mounting arm 120 may include a hook or loop fastener surface. A corresponding loop or hook fastener may be adhered to the mounting surface for attaching to its<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> corresponding hook and fastener on the mounting arm 120.
