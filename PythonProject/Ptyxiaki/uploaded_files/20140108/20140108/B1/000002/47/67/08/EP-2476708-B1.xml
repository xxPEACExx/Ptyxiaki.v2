load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a modified natural rubber, a method for producing the modified natural rubber, a tire rubber composition produced using the modified natural rubber, and a pneumatic tire produced using the rubber composition.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In conventional vehicles, fuel consumption is reduced by reducing the rolling resistance of tires to suppress heat build-up. A demand for lower fuel consumption of vehicles owing to tires is becoming increasingly greater, and thus further studies are essential for improving fuel economy. Natural rubber generally used in tires has been considered to have better fuel economy than styrene-butadiene rubber; however, styrene-butadiene rubber is now being improved to give lower fuel consumption. Therefore, natural rubber is also required to give much lower fuel consumption in order to achieve good fuel economy of the tire as a whole.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In order to improve natural rubber in terms of fuel economy, modification of natural rubber has been proposed. For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a modification method in which a natural rubber latex is mixed with a surfactant and then washed. In this method, however, proteins and a gel fraction are removed to some extent but still in an insufficient level; further reduction in tanδ<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> is desired. In addition, tires are also required to have properties such as heat-aging resistance; however, no documents teach simultaneous achievement of good fuel economy and good heat-aging resistance.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP3294901B"><text>JP 3294901 B</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention aims to provide a modified natural rubber which is capable of solving the above problems and of simultaneously achieving good fuel economy and good heat-aging resistance, and the production method thereof. In addition, the present invention aims to provide a tire rubber composition produced using the modified natural rubber and a pneumatic tire produced using the tire rubber composition.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention relates to a modified natural rubber obtainable by treating a rubber coagulated from a saponified natural rubber latex, with a basic compound and then with an acidic compound.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The basic compound is preferably a basic inorganic compound. The basic inorganic compound is preferably at least one selected from the group consisting of metal hydroxides, metal carbonates, metal hydrogen carbonates, metal phosphates and ammonia.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The coagulated rubber is preferably treated with the basic compound for 1 minute to 48 hours.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The modified natural rubber preferably has a nitrogen content of 0.15% by mass or less after immersed in acetone at room temperature for 48 hours. Also, the modified<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> natural rubber preferably has a phosphorus content of 200 ppm or less.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention also relates to a method for producing the modified natural rubber, comprising: Step 1 in which a natural rubber latex is saponified; Step 2 in which the saponified natural rubber latex obtained in Step 1 is coagulated and the resulting coagulated rubber is treated with a basic compound; and Step 3 in which the treated rubber is treated with an acidic compound.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention further relates to a tire rubber composition comprising: a rubber component; and carbon black and/or a white filler, wherein the composition contains the modified natural rubber in an amount of 5% by mass or more based on 100% by mass of the rubber component.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention furthermore relates to a pneumatic tire produced using the rubber composition.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Since the present invention relates to a modified natural rubber which is obtainable by treating a rubber coagulated from a saponified natural rubber latex, first with a basic compound and then with an acidic compound, proteins and phospholipids in rubber can be sufficiently removed, and the fuel economy can be improved. In addition, the modified natural rubber is less likely to suffer reduction in the molecular weight during storage, and then it has heat-aging resistance equivalent to that of usual natural rubber (non-modified). Therefore, the present invention can provide a tire rubber composition and pneumatic tire excellent in fuel economy and heat-aging resistance.</p><heading id="h0004">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><heading id="h0005">[Modified natural rubber]</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The modified natural rubber of the present invention is obtainable by treating a rubber coagulated from a saponified natural rubber latex, with a basic compound and then with an acidic compound.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the case that a natural rubber latex is saponified so as to improve natural rubber in terms of fuel economy, proteins and phospholipids decomposed during the saponifying step are trapped in the rubber or remain on the rubber surface in a state of being strongly adsorbed thereon upon rubber coagulation; these components are not sufficiently removed by washing with water or the like. In contrast, in the present invention, a rubber coagulated from a saponified natural rubber latex is first treated with a basic compound, and thereby residual components such as proteins can be sufficiently removed. Thus, the modified natural rubber of the present invention is capable of further improving fuel economy. These steps have some problems such as that natural antioxidant components including proteins are removed due to the saponification, and the heat-aging resistance is reduced due to the treatment with a basic compound; however, further treatment with an acidic compound can solve such problems and provide good heat-aging resistance.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Furthermore, treatment with a basic compound may disadvantageously cause premature vulcanization or rubber scorch; however, the treatment with an acidic compound can eliminate this concern, and a curing rate similar to that in the case of non-modified natural rubber can be achieved. In addition, treatment with an acidic compound may disadvantageously cause reduction in crosslinking density; however, such reduction can be suppressed in the present<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> invention.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Specifically, the modified natural rubber of the present invention can be prepared, for example, by a production method comprising: Step 1 in which a natural rubber latex is saponified; Step 2 in which the saponified natural rubber latex obtained in Step 1 is coagulated and the resulting coagulated rubber is treated with a basic compound; and Step 3 in which the base-treated rubber is treated with an acidic compound.</p><heading id="h0006">(Step 1)</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">In Step 1, a natural rubber latex is saponified. Thereby, phospholipids and proteins are decomposed.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Natural rubber latex is taken as sap of natural rubber trees such as hevea trees, and contains components including water, proteins, lipids, inorganic salts as well as a rubber component. The gel fraction in rubber is considered to be derived from a complex of various impurities in rubber. In the present invention, the natural rubber latex to be used may be raw latex (field latex) taken from hevea trees by tapping, or may be concentrated latex (e.g. purified latex; high-ammonia latex in which ammonia is added to latex by a usual method; and LATZ latex which is stabilized with zinc oxide, TMTD, and ammonia) concentrated by centrifugation or creaming, for example.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The saponification may be suitably performed by the method disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2010138359A"><text>JP 2010-138359 A</text></patcit> or <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2010174169A"><text>JP 2010-174169 A</text></patcit>, for example, and specifically may be performed by the following method, for example.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The saponification is achieved by still standing of a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> natural rubber latex mixed with an alkali and, if necessary, a surfactant for a certain period of time at a predetermined temperature. If necessary, stirring or the like operation may be performed.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Preferable examples of the alkali to be used in the saponification include sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. The surfactant is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include conventional nonionic surfactants, anionic surfactants, and amphoteric surfactants such as polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfates. Preferable are polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfates because they enable good saponification without rubber coagulation. In the saponification, the amounts of an alkali and a surfactant, and the temperature and duration of the saponification may be appropriately adjusted.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the saponification step, an antioxidant may be added before, during, or after the saponification as appropriate. The antioxidant is preferably in the form of a dispersion of an antioxidant. For example, an antioxidant dispersion containing an antioxidant, a surfactant, and water (a dispersion in which an antioxidant is uniformly dispersed in water) may be used. Use of such a dispersion causes the antioxidant to be absorbed into (adsorbed on) rubber particles, and thereby good fuel economy and heat-aging resistance are achieved.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the case of adding an antioxidant dispersion before the saponification, the saponification is performed after the antioxidant is mixed with a natural rubber latex; in the case of adding it during the saponification, the antioxidant is mixed with a natural rubber latex, an alkali, and/or another agent; and in the case of adding it after the saponification, the antioxidant is mixed with a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> saponified natural rubber latex obtained by the saponification.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the antioxidant dispersion, the antioxidant is not particularly limited. Phenolic antioxidants are preferable because they are easy to use. Examples of the phenolic antioxidant include 2,2'-methylenebis-(4-methyl-6-tertbutylphenol) (Nocrac NS-6, Ouchi Shinko Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd.), 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (Nocrac 200, Ouchi Shinko Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd.), and 2,2'-methylene-bis-(4-ethyl-6-tert-butylphenol) (YOSHINOX 425, API Corporation), and hindered phenolic antioxidants such as a compound obtained by butylating a condensate of p-cresol and dicyclopentadiene (Wingstay L, ELIOKEM) and a reaction product of 4-methylphenol and dicyclopentadiene (Lowinox CPL, Chemtura Corporation). With respect to the surfactant to be used in the antioxidant dispersion, a known anionic surfactant, nonionic surfactant, hydrated magnesium aluminum silicate, or the like may be appropriately used.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The antioxidant dispersion may be prepared by a known method; for example, it may be prepared using a ball mill, high-speed shearing stirrer, homogenizer, or the like.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The amount of the antioxidant may be appropriately adjusted. The lower limit thereof is preferably 0.1 parts by mass or more, more preferably 0.2 parts by mass or more, and further preferably 0.3 parts by mass or more, relative to 100 parts by mass of the rubber component in natural rubber latex, while the upper limit thereof is preferably 5 parts by mass or less, more preferably 3 parts by mass or less, and further preferably 2 parts by mass or less. Also, the amount of the surfactant may be appropriately adjusted. It is preferably 1 to 20 parts by mass relative to 100<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> parts by mass of the antioxidant to be added.</p><heading id="h0007">(Step 2)</heading><p id="p0028" num="0028">In Step 2, the saponified natural rubber latex obtained in Step 1 is coagulated and the coagulated rubber is treated with a basic compound. As a result, proteins and the like components strongly attached to the coagulated rubber can be sufficiently removed, and therefore good fuel economy can be achieved.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Examples of the coagulation method in Step 2 include a method in which an acid such as formic acid, acetic acid, or sulfuric acid is added to adjust the pH, and a polymer coagulant may be added if necessary. As a result of the coagulation, not a large coagulation lump but a particulate rubber with a diameter of a few millimeters to 20 mm is formed, and proteins and the like components are sufficiently removed by the treatment with a basic compound. The pH is adjusted within the range of preferably 3.0 to 5.0, and more preferably 3.5 to 4.5.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Examples of the polymer coagulant include cationic polymer coagulants such as poly(dimethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate methyl chloride quaternary salt); anionic polymer coagulants such as poly(acrylate salt); nonionic polymer coagulants such as polyacrylamide; and amphoteric polymer coagulants such as a copolymer of a dimethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate methyl chloride quaternary salt and an acrylate salt. The amount of the polymer coagulant may be appropriately adjusted.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Then, the coagulated rubber obtained is treated with a basic compound. The basic compound is not particularly limited. Preferable is a basic inorganic compound due to its ability to remove proteins and the like components.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Examples of the basic inorganic compound include: metal hydroxides such as alkaline metal hydroxides and alkaline earth metal hydroxides; metal carbonates such as alkaline metal carbonates and alkaline earth metal carbonates; metal hydrogen carbonates such as alkaline metal hydrogen carbonates; metal phosphates such as alkaline metal phosphates; metal acetates such as alkaline metal acetates; metal hydrides such as alkaline metal hydrides; and ammonia.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Examples of the alkaline metal hydroxides include lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide. Examples of the alkaline earth metal hydroxides include magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, and barium hydroxide. Examples of the alkaline metal carbonates include lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, and potassium carbonate. Examples of the alkaline earth metal carbonates include magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate, and barium carbonate. Examples of the alkaline metal hydrogen carbonates include lithium hydrogen carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, and potassium hydrogen carbonate. Examples of the alkaline metal phosphates include sodium phosphate and sodium hydrogen phosphate. Examples of the alkaline metal acetates include sodium acetate and potassium acetate. Examples of the alkaline metal hydrides include sodium hydride and potassium hydride.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In particular, metal hydroxides, metal carbonates, metal hydrogen carbonates, metal phosphates, and ammonia are preferable; alkaline metal carbonates, alkaline metal hydrogen carbonates, and ammonia are more preferable; and sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogen carbonate are further preferable. Each of the basic compounds may be used alone, or two or more of these may be used in combination.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The method of treating the coagulated rubber with a basic compound is not particularly limited as long as the coagulated rubber is made in contact with the basic compound. Examples thereof include a method in which the coagulated rubber is immersed in an aqueous solution of a basic compound; and a method in which an aqueous solution of a basic compound is sprayed onto the coagulated rubber. The aqueous solution of a basic compound can be prepared by diluting and dissolving a basic compound with water.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The amount of the basic compound is preferably 0.1% by mass or more, and more preferably 0.3% by mass or more, based on 100% by mass of the aqueous solution. If the amount is less than 0.1% by mass, proteins may not be sufficiently removed. The amount is preferably 10% by mass or less, and more preferably 5% by mass or less. If the amount is more than 10% by mass, in spite of a large amount of the basic compound required, the amount of decomposed proteins does not increase, so that the efficiency tends to be poor.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The treatment temperature may be appropriately adjusted, and it is preferably 10°C to 50°C, and more preferably 15°C to 35°C. The treatment duration is usually 1 minute or longer, preferably 10 minutes or longer, and more preferably 30 minutes or longer. If the duration is shorter than 1 minute, the effects of the present invention may not be achieved well. The upper limit is not restricted; from the viewpoint of productivity, it is preferably 48 hours or shorter, more preferably 24 hours or shorter, and further preferably 16 hours or shorter.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">After the treatment with a basic compound is performed and the compound used is removed, washing may be<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> performed if necessary. Washing may be performed by for example, a method in which the rubber component is diluted with water, washed, and then separated by centrifugation, or a method in which, after such a washing, the rubber component is allowed to float in water by standing still, and then separated out by draining only the water phase.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">A basic compound such as sodium hydroxide is used upon the saponification in Step 1 and a basic compound is again used in Step 2, but the actions of these compounds are different from each other. Specifically, the basic compound used upon the saponification adjusts the pH, and the nitrogen content in the coagulated rubber is not greatly changed even if the amount of the compound increases. This is presumably because proteins separated out by the saponification exist as substances with reduced molecular weights or as amino acids, and they adsorb on the rubber or maintain interactions with the rubber.
