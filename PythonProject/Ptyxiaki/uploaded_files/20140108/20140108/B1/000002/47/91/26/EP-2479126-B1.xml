To this end a mobile artificial watering system is generally used with spray arms and spray nozzles that are positioned above the pots. It is important for the spray nozzles to be positioned exactly above the pots in order to prevent the wastage of water and nutrients next to the pots, and in order to be certain that the plants get enough water and nutrients.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Devices are already known for moving and spreading out pots with plants at a greater distance from one another. See e.g. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP0609148A1"><text>EP 0 609 148 A1</text></patcit> or <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="DE9211099U1"><text>DE 9 211 099 U1</text></patcit>.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, these known devices have the disadvantage that they are complex and relatively expensive and that the accuracy with which the pots are placed at well defined positions under the spray nozzles of the watering system often leaves something to be desired, which leads to the wastage of water or insufficient dosing or an overdose of water and nutrients for the optimum growth of plants.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Another disadvantage is that with the known devices a relatively large amount of time is needed to set out the pots between the original growth phase and the subsequent growth phase, whereby the pots are placed further apart.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The purpose of the present invention is to provide a solution to at least one or more of the aforementioned and other disadvantages.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">To this end the invention concerns a robot for setting out pots on a base that primarily consists of an undercarriage that can move in at least one drive direction and on this undercarriage:
<ul><li>a wide buffer conveyor belt on which there can be a number of rows of pots placed next to one another along the width of the buffer conveyor belt at the same time, in order to move the rows of pots in a transport direction parallel to the drive direction;</li><li>at one end of the buffer conveyor belt there is a 'singularisation system' for separating one row of pots from the rest of the pots, with a distance between the separated row of pots and the rest of the pots;<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></li><li>a spreading fork with a guide rail that extends breadthways along the buffer conveyor belt, and on which a number of pick-up forks for pots are movably affixed to pick up the pots of the separated row of pots and to spread out the pots along the width of the buffer conveyor belt with the desired distance between the pots;</li><li>a manipulator to be able to move the spreading fork in the vertical direction and in a direction parallel to the drive direction in order to be able to move the separated row of pots from the buffer conveyor belt to the aforementioned base; and,</li><li>a controller to control the robot in a cyclical way such that in each cycle the pots on the buffer conveyor belt are separated row by row; the pots of the separated row are picked up from the buffer conveyor belt, spread out and moved to the ground and the robot is moved over a desired distance in the aforementioned drive direction in order to commence a subsequent cycle.</li></ul></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Such a robot according to the invention has the advantage that the entire operation of setting out the pots can be done practically automatically, except for the supply of the pots, which can be done in a simple way by means of a forklift truck equipped with a series of forks with which a large number of pots that are close together can be picked up in one go, and which can place this large number of pots on the buffer conveyor belt of the robot at the same time, in order to further set them out.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Once the pots have been placed on the buffer conveyor belt, they can be moved row by row in successive cycles, thanks<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> to the aforementioned controller, and picked up from the buffer conveyor belt in a spread-out position and set down on the base, and this with quite a high accuracy with regard to the position of the pots set down and the mutual distance between the pots.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">This enables the plants in the spread-out pots to be provided with the correct quantity of water and nutrients with great precision in a subsequent growth stage.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">With respect to known installations the robot according to the invention is simple and cheap to produce, and pots can be set out at a high speed, such that relatively little time is required to set out a large series of pots.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Preferably the pick-up forks of the spreading fork are affixed alternately at two different heights, and the controller is such that the pots are set down on the base in two goes, i.e. in a first stage in which only the pots in the pick-up forks in the lowest position are set down on the base, after which the robot with the remaining pots in the pick-up forks in the highest position is moved over a desired distance and then these remaining pots are set down on the base in the second stage.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">When the pick-up forks are in alternate high and low positions, the pots that are set down in the first stage and the pots that are set down in the second stage follow each other in a chequer formation, such that the distance between the pots is approximately the same in all directions and whereby the plants are given more space to<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> grow than when the pick-up forks are all at the same height and are set down on the base in one go.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Preferably the controller contains a GPS receiver for the location of the robot and if applicable the spreading fork, such that the exact and accurate positioning of the pots is possible.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">With the intention of better showing the characteristics of the invention, a few preferred embodiments of a robot according to the invention are described hereinafter by way of an example, without any limiting nature, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:

moving pots 2 consists of the main components that are partly shown as separate components in <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 4</figref>, i.e. a mobile undercarriage 3; a wide buffer conveyor belt 4 affixed on the undercarriage 3; a 'singularisation system' 5 placed at one end of the buffer conveyor belt 4; a spreading fork 6; a manipulator 7 to move the spreading fork 6 in the vertical direction and in a direction parallel to the drive direction X-X'; and, a controller 8 to control the robot 1 in a cyclical way such that in each cycle the pots 2 are picked up row by row from the buffer conveyor belt 4 and set down on the base 9 in a spread-out state.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The mobile undercarriage 3 is equipped with a caterpillar track drive 10 on each side of the buffer conveyor belt 4 to move the undercarriage 3 in the drive direction X-X'.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Furthermore the undercarriage 3 has four wheels 11 that are adjustable in height and which to this end are affixed on telescopic legs 12.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The wheels 11 are adjustable in height between an operating position in which the wheels 11 are pulled upwards and the robot 1 rests on the caterpillar tracks, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">figures 1 to 3</figref>, and a conveyor belt not shown in the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> drawings whereby the wheels 11 are let down to push the robot 1 with the caterpillar tracks 10 from the base 9, whereby the robot 1 rests on the wheels 11 in order to be able to be moved.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">To this end the mobile undercarriage 3 is equipped with a shaft or towbar 13 in order to be able to push or pull the robot 1, for example by means of a tractor or another motorised vehicle.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The singularisation system 5 at the end of the buffer conveyor belt 4 is formed by a toothed slat 14 with teeth 15 that protrude above the buffer conveyor belt 4 in the direction of the pots 2 on the buffer conveyor belt 4, and which are a distance A apart along the width of the buffer conveyor belt 4, which primarily matches the diameter of the pots 2 to be set out, more specifically the diameter of the pots 2 at the height of the teeth 14 concerned above the buffer conveyor belt 4.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Each tooth 15 is equipped with a claw 16 that can be rotated around a vertical axis 17 between an open position, whereby the opening 17 between two teeth 15 is primarily clear, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">figure 4</figref>, and a closed position whereby the opening 18 between two teeth 15 is at least partially obstructed to secure the pots 2 between the teeth 15 when the buffer conveyor belt 4 moves.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The claws 16 are equipped with a common drive rod 19 with which the claws 16 are rotated simultaneously around their axis 17.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Between the teeth 15, the slat 14 is hollowed out with circular arch-shaped recesses 20 that each form an alignment rabbet for the pots 2 when they are moved with the buffer conveyor belt 4 in the direction of the singularisation system 5.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The radius of curvature of the circular arch-shaped recesses 20 is preferably equal to the diameter of the pots 2 at the height of the teeth 15 above the buffer conveyor belt 4.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The spreading fork 6 is primarily formed by a guide rail 21 on which a number of pick-up forks 22 for pots 2 are movably affixed.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The spreading fork 6 extends along the width of the buffer conveyor belt 4 and protrudes over a certain distance on either side of the buffer conveyor belt 4, whereby the length B of the rail is longer than the width C of the buffer conveyor belt 4, primarily corresponding to the width C of the toothed slat 14 of the singularisation system 5.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The number of pick-up forks 22 is preferably the same as the number of openings 18 between the teeth 15 of the toothed slat 14 of the singularisation system 5.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The pick-up forks 22 are each equipped to be able to pick up one single pot 2 and to this end are equipped with forks 23 with a spacing equal to the diameter of the pot 2, for<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> example just below the collar 24 on the top edge of the pot 2, at least when a pot 2 has such a collar 24.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The width D of the pick-up forks 22 is such that, when they are pushed together on the guide rail 21, they are spread out over a total width C that is equal to the width C of the toothed slat 14 of the singularisation system 5 and such that, when the spreading fork 6 is positioned opposite the toothed slat 14, there is a pick-up fork 22 for each opening 18 between the teeth 15 of the toothed slat 14.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The pick-up forks can each be equipped with a separate drive to be able to slide them on the guide rail 22, or in the simplified form of the drawings can be equipped with a drive 25 for each of the outermost pick-up forks 21, for example in the form of a belt drive 26 driven by a motor 27.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The other pick-up forks 22 are then connected together by means of flexible foldable belts 28, preferably in the form of a part of a toothed belt, such that when the outermost pick-up fork 22 is moved outwards, in other words in the direction of an extremity of the guide rail 21, the pick-up forks connected to it are carried by this movement to spread the pick-up forks 22 further apart than when they are positioned against one another.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The length of the flexible foldable belts 28 determines the mutual distance between the pick-up forks 22.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows a part of the pick-up forks 22 in a<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> situation whereby they are positioned against each other, and another part of the pick-up forks 22 is drawn in a more spread-out position.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Preferably the pick-up forks 22 present a rounded hollowing between the forks 23 whose radius of curvature primarily matches the diameter of the pots 2 just below the collar 24 of these last-mentioned.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Furthermore the robot 1 on the mobile undercarriage 3 is equipped with a manipulator 7 to be able to move the spreading fork 6 in the vertical direction and in a direction parallel to the drive direction X-X', to enable pots 2 to be moved with the spreading fork 6 from the buffer conveyor belt 4 to the base 9 in front of the robot 1.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The robot 1 is preferably equipped with an automatic controller 8 with which the drives for the components of the robot 1 can be controlled, more specifically the drives for the caterpillar tracks 10, the buffer conveyor belt 4, the claws 16 of the singularisation system 5, the drives for moving the manipulator 7 and the drives for the pick-up forks 22, whether individual drives or the drives for the outermost pick-up forks 22.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The controller 8 can thereby be equipped in the conventional way with the necessary detection means such as limit switches, light sensors, stepper motors and similar.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Additionally the controller can be connected to a GPS<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> receiver for the location of the robot 1, more specifically the spreading fork 6.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The use of the robot 1 is very simple and is illustrated on the basis of <figref idrefs="f0006 f0007 f0008 f0009 f0010 f0011 f0012 f0013 f0014 f0015 f0016">figures 6 to 18</figref>.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">At the start of the operation to spread out the pots 2, first and foremost the pots 2 to be spread out with plants that have completed their first growth stage are picked up from the cultivation zone by means of a forklift truck, for example equipped with a fork tray 29 with a series of parallel forks 30 that enable a large number of pots 2 placed next to one another to be picked up simultaneously and to be placed on the buffer conveyor belt 4 as a set, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">figure 6</figref>, in other words in a successive series of rows 31 of pots 2 placed next to one another.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The area of the buffer conveyor belt 4 enables an area of 4 metres by 2 metres to be covered with pots, for example.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">When the pots 2 are placed on the buffer conveyor belt 4 in this way, the buffer conveyor belt 4 is moved in the direction of the arrows M, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">figure 7</figref>, until the pots 2 of the first row 31 are between the teeth 15 of the singularisation system 5.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Then the claws 16 of the singularisation system are turned by means of the drive rod 19 to partially obstruct the openings 18 of the toothed slat 14, after which, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">figure 8</figref>, the buffer conveyor belt is moved in the opposite direction M whereby the pots are held between the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> teeth 15 of the singularisation system by the claws 16 to create a distance between the separated first row 31 and the remaining pots 2 on the buffer conveyor belt 4.</p><p
