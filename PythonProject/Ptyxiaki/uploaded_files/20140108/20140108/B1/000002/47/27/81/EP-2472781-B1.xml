When the device receives a service configuration command of the network management system, whether the service is currently in operation or not is automatically judged, and the verification judgment is performed in accordance with the operational status and the current service configuration state, and when the service is currently in operation and the received configuration information does not match with the current service, the network device actively reports the relevant information to the network management system, and the operation and maintenance personnel make a judgment and confirmation again in order to achieve the correctness of sending the service.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The network management system might also provide a service judgment criterion to implement the correlation verification between the sent service and the related configuration, and when the network management system sends the service configuration command and other related configuration commands, the correlation judgment can be performed in advance so as to further ensure the correctness of sending the service.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> shows a network system when the device service is verified in the present invention, comprising the network management system and network device, and furthermore,<br/>
the network management system comprises a service command sending module and an event prompting module;<br/>
said network device comprises a board verification module and one or more boards.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">When the operation and maintenance personnel needs to send the service configuration command to the network device through the network management system:
<ul><li>the service command sending module is used to send the service configuration command<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> to the board verification module; the board verification module is responsible for checking the board type, the service type and the function type and so on of the network device, finishing verifying the service configuration command, determining whether to perform verification or not according to the verification result.</li></ul></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The board verification module firstly check whether the service board corresponding to the service configuration command is currently in operation or not, if no, it directly uses the service configuration command to configure the service board and reports the configuration result to the event prompting module; if yes, it compares the service information to be configured in the service configuration command with the service information currently in operation so as to perform verification, and if the service information to be configured is found to be consistent with the service information currently in operation, it allows to configure the service and reports the configuration successful result to the event prompting module, otherwise, it doesn't allow to perform the configuration process and reports the configuration unsuccessful result to the event prompting module.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The event prompting module is used to record the configuration result information, which is reported by the board detection module, related to the service configuration command, and display the configuration result to the user in real time, and when the configuration is unsuccessful, prompt the user to perform confirmation, and the operation and maintenance personnel manually and eventually select whether to perform configuration or not.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Therefore, with the network system shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, by adding the verifications for the sent configuration command in the present invention, the user is prompted that the current verification is unsuccessful so that the user performs a second confirmation when the verification is unsuccessful. When the verification is successful, the operation and maintenance personnel can be assured to perform configuration without a second cumbersome confirmation.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, the network management system might further comprises a correlation verification module which is used to perform the correlation verification on the service configuration command before the service command sending module sends the configuration command, and only those commands that pass the correlation verification are allowed to be sent, while those that do not meet the correlation requirements can be directly<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> reported to the event prompting module to prompt the user that the current service configuration command has the problem of correlation, therefore, one verification can be completed before sending the service configuration command to further ensure the correctness of the service command configuration.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The correlation verification module is used to perform matching detection according to the type to be configured of related function of the board to be configured in the service configuration command and the current service type of corresponding board. If the detected service type is consistent with the type to be configured of the related configuration function, the correlation verification is considered as being passed, and the configuration is allowed; if the detected service type is not consistent with the type to be configured of the related configuration function, the correlation verification is considered as not being passed, and the configuration is not allowed.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">For some relatively simple service configuration commands, they might not comprise the configuration parameters required by the correlation detection, thus, the correlation verification module is further used to: judge whether the service configuration command requires the verification of correlation detection or not, if it is found through verification that the service configuration command doesn't need the correlation verification, it is directly reported to the event prompting module, and the event prompting module is triggered to send the service command, and if it is found that the service configuration commands requires the correlation verification, the correlation verification is performed on the service configuration command, and the correlation verification is reported to the event prompting module. For the service configuration commands passing the correlation verification, the event prompting module is triggered to send the service commands, and for those without passing the correlation verification, the event prompting module prompts the user to perform selection and confirm whether to send the commands eventually or not. When the commands are sent, they are firstly sent to the board verification module for data verification, and the subsequent steps can refer to the description of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is a method for verifying the device service provided in the present invention, and the device service comprises one or more board services, and the method comprises:<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> -->
