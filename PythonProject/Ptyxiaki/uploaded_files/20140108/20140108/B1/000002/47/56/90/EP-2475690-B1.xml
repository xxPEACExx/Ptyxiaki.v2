It is known that a relevant problem to be overcome in a gas-phase polymerization process is the formation of polymer agglomerates, which can build up in various places, such as the polymerization reactor and the lines for recycling the gaseous stream. When polymer agglomerates form within the polymerization reactor there can be many adverse effects. For example, the agglomerates can disrupt the removal of polymer from the polymerization reactor by plugging the polymer discharge valves. Further, if the agglomerates fall and cover part of the fluidization grid a loss of fluidization efficiency may occur. This can result in the formation of larger agglomerates which can lead to the shutdown of the reactor.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It has been found that agglomerates may be also formed as a result of the presence of very fine polymer particles in the polymerization medium. These fine particles may be present as a result of introducing fine catalyst particles or breakage of the catalyst within the polymerization medium. These fine particles are believed to deposit onto and electrostatically adhere to the inner walls of the polymerization reactor and the associated equipment for recycling the gaseous stream such as, for example, the heat exchanger. If the fine particles remain active, in absence of heat removal, then the particles will grow in size resulting in the formation of agglomerates, also caused by the partial melting of the polymer itself. These agglomerates when formed within the polymerization reactor tend to be in the form of sheets. Agglomerates can also partially plug the heat exchanger designed to remove the heat of polymerization reaction.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Several solutions have been proposed to resolve the problem of formation of agglomerates during a gas-phase polymerization process. These solutions include the deactivation of the fine polymer particles, control of the catalyst activity and the reduction of the electrostatic charge.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP359444A"><text>EP 359444</text></patcit> describes the introduction into the polymerization reactor of small amounts of an activity retarder in order to keep substantially constant either the polymerization rate or the content of transition metal in the polymer produced. The process is said to produce a polymer<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> without forming agglomerates.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="USP4739015A"><text>USP 4,739,015</text></patcit> describes the use of gaseous oxygen containing compounds or liquid or solid active-hydrogen containing compounds to prevent the adhesion of the polymer to the inner wall of the polymerization apparatus.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="USP4803251A"><text>USP 4,803,251</text></patcit> describes a process for reducing the polymer sheeting utilizing a group of chemical additives, which generate both positive and negative charges in the reactor, and which are fed to the reactor in an amount of a few parts per million (ppm) per part of the monomer in order to prevent the formation of undesired positive or negative charges.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP560035A"><text>EP 560035</text></patcit> discloses a polymerization process in which an anti-fouling compound is used to eliminate or reduce the build-up of polymer particles on the walls of the reactors, or the formation of agglomerates of polymer particles, which may cause the fouling of pipes or other plant components. This anti-fouling compound is preferably selected from alkydiethanolamines, which may be fed at any stage of the gas-phase polymerization process in an amount greater than 100 ppm by weight with respect to the produced (co)polymer. Said anti-fouling compound is capable, when used in a standard polymerization test of ethylene and polypropylene mixture, to selectively inhibit the polymerization on polymer particles smaller than 850 µm, the latter being responsible for fouling problems and polymer sheeting. Other processes for reducing the electrostatic voltage include: (1) installation of grounding devices in the fluidized bed; (2) ionization of gas or particles by electrical discharge to generate ions, which neutralize electrostatic charges onto the particles; (3) the use of radioactive sources to produce radiation capable of generating ions which neutralize electrostatic charges onto the particles.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A novel gas-phase process for the olefin polymerization, which represents a gas-phase technology alternative to the fluidized bed reactor technology, is disclosed in the Applicant's earlier <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="EP782587B"><text>EP-B-782587</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="EP1012195B"><text>EP-B-1012195</text></patcit>. The polymerization process is carried out in a gas-phase reactor having interconnected polymerization zones, where the growing polymer particles flow through a first polymerization zone (riser) under fast fluidization or transport conditions, leave said riser and enter a second polymerization zone (downcomer) through which they flow in a densified form under the action of gravity, leave said downcomer and are reintroduced into the riser, thus establishing a circulation of polymer between the two polymerization zones.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Also the particular gas-phase technology described in <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="EP1012195B"><text>EP-B-1012195</text></patcit> may suffer from the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> typical drawbacks correlated with the formation of polymer agglomerates, due to the presence of electrostatic charges within the polymerization apparatus. It has been observed tendency to formation of polymer agglomerates, especially inside the second polymerization zone (downcomer). In fact, along the downcomer the polymer particles flow downward in a densified form in packed mode and this condition favors the formation of agglomerates, being more difficult to remove the polymerization heat due to the limited volume of gaseous phase. The polymer agglomerates can quickly plug the polymer discharge equipment, placed at the bottom part of the downcomer.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">There is therefore the need to find the best operative conditions for feeding an antistatic compound to a gas-phase polymerization process comprising polymer particles flowing downward along the reactor in a densified form, so as to optimize the effect of neutralizing the electrostatic charges in this particular type of gas-phase polymerization reactor.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The Applicant has surprisingly found that considerable differences in term of reactor fouling are achieved when suitably modifying the arrangement of the feed points of an antistatic compound in this polymerization process.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">It is therefore an object of the present invention a process for the gas-phase polymerization of one or more alpha-olefins in the presence of a polymerization catalyst, the process comprising:
<ul><li>at least a polymerization step wherein the polymer particles flow downward in densified form under the action of gravity so as to form a densified polymer bed,</li><li>metering an anti-fouling agent in said polymerization step by means of at least <b>N</b> feeding lines placed at different heights of said densified polymer bed, <b>N</b> being the integer number satisfying the equation <b>N≥ (1+0.08·H),</b> where <b>H</b> is the height (expressed in meters) of the polymer bed.</li></ul></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The process of the present invention applies advantageously to all the gas-phase polymerization processes in which the growing polymer particles flow downward into the reactor in a densified form, so that high values of density of the solid inside the reactor are reached, these values approaching the bulk density of the polymer.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The "poured bulk density" of a polymer is a parameter well known to the person skilled in the art: it can be measured according to ASTM D1895/69. The density of solid inside the reactor is defined as mass of polymer per volume of reactor occupied by the polymer.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Specifically, throughout the present specification the term "densified form" of the polymer<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> means that the ratio between the mass of polymer and the reactor volume is higher than 80% of the "poured bulk density" of the obtained polymer. Thus, for instance, in case of a polymer bulk density equal to 420 Kg/m<sup>3</sup>, a "densified form" of the polymer implies that the polymer mass/reactor volume ratio is of at least 336 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The operating parameters, such as temperature and pressure, are those usually adjusted in a gas-phase catalytic polymerization process: the temperature is generally comprised between 60°C and 120°C, while the pressure can range from 5 to 50 bar.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The terms "anti-fouling agent" or "antistatic agent" are used in the present description to include the following compounds:
<ul><li>antistatic substances capable of neutralizing the electrostatic charges of the polymer particles;</li><li>cocatalyst deactivators that partially deactivate the aluminium alkyl co-catalyst, provided that they do not substantially inhibit the overall polymerization activity.</li></ul></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Consequently, an "anti-fouling agent" or "antistatic agent" according to the invention is any substance that is capable to prevent, eliminate or substantially reduce the formation of build-up of polymer on any equipment of the polymerization plant, including sheeting of reactor walls, or deposits of polymer agglomerates onto any line of the polymerization plant, including the gas recycle line.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to present invention an anti-fouling agent is metered into the polymerization process by means of a specific arrangement, so as to maximise the anti-static effect of neutralizing the electrostatic charges on the polymer particles flowing downward in a densified form along the polymerization reactor. The feed of anti-fouling agent is arranged along the height of the densified polymer bed by means of at least <b>N</b> feeding lines, <b>N</b> being the integer number satisfying the equation <b>N≥ (1+0.08·H),</b> where <b>H</b> is the height (expressed in meters) of the polymer bed inside the reactor.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Throughout the present specification the "height <b>H</b> of the reactor" is referred as the height of the densified polymer bed inside the reactor. By way of an example, if said height H is equal to 15 m, the above equation becomes <b>"N≥ (1+0.08·15)≥ 2.2",</b> thus meaning that at least 3 feeding lines should be arranged along the height of the polymer bed in order to distribute homogeneously the anti-fouling agent. Said feeding lines are preferably located at a similar distance each other along the axes of the reactor. This set-up allows the achievement of a substantially uniform distribution of the antistatic agent inside the packed polymer bed<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> flowing downward along the polymerization reactor, thus reducing the regions of the reactor not influenced by the antistatic action.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According a preferred embodiment of the invention, the feed of anti-fouling agent is distributed along the height of the densified polymer bed by means of at least <b>N</b> feeding lines, <b>N</b> being the integer number satisfying the equation <b>N≥ (1+0.1·H),</b> where <b>H</b> is the height (expressed in meters) of the polymer bed inside the reactor.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The anti-fouling agent of present invention may be added to the polymerization process neat or diluted in a hydrocarbon solvent, which is useful to improve its dispersion. Suitable hydrocarbon solvents are isopentane, isohexane, n-hexane, cyclohexane, heptane. When a solvent is employed, the amount of antifouling agent in the solution (antifoulant+solvent) may range from 2% to 60% by wt, preferably from 4% to 40% by wt.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The antifouling agent is generally added to the polymerization process in a total amount ranging from 5 to 250 ppm weight, based on the weight of polyolefin being produced. Use of lower amounts will be less effective in preventing the polymer buildup, while use of larger amounts will adversely affect the operation of the reactor, more specifically the catalyst activity. Preferred amounts of said antifouling agent are within the range from 10 to 100 ppm weight, based on the weight of polyolefin being produced.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In particular, the process of the present invention can be advantageously applied to the gas-phase polymerization process disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="EP782587A"><text>EP 782587</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="EP1012195A"><text>EP 1012195</text></patcit>, where the polymerization of one or more olefins is carried out in two interconnected polymerization zones: in fact, the polymerization conditions inside the second polymerization zone are such that the polymer particles flow downward in a "densified form" under the action of gravity. Therefore, according to a preferred embodiment of present invention, one or more alpha-olefins are polymerized in a gas-phase reactor having two interconnected polymerization zones, the first polymerization zone, denominated the riser, comprising polymer particles flowing upward under fast fluidization or transport conditions, the second polymerization zone, denominated the downcomer, comprising polymer particles flowing downward in densified form under the action of gravity so as to form a 7densified polymer bed.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Fast fluidization conditions inside the riser are established by feeding a gas mixture comprising one or more alpha-olefms at a velocity higher than the transport velocity of the polymer particles. The velocity of said gas mixture is generally comprised between 0.5 and 15 m/s, preferably between 0.8 and 5 m/s. The terms "transport velocity" and "fast fluidization<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> conditions" are well known in the art; for a definition thereof, see, for example, "<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>D. Geldart, Gas Fluidisation Technology, page 155 et seq., J. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., 1986</text></nplcit>".</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the downcomer the polymer particles flow under the action of gravity in a densified form, so that the density of the solid inside this polymerization zone approaches the bulk density of the polymer.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">When the process of present invention is applied to the above gas-phase reactor, the feed of anti-fouling agent is arranged along the height of the downcomer by means of at least <b>N</b> feeding lines, <b>N</b> being the integer number satisfying the equation <b>N≥ (1+0.08·H),</b> where <b>H</b> is the height (expressed in meters) of the densified polymer bed inside the downcomer. The "height <b>H</b> of the downcomer" is also intended as the height of the packed polymer inside the downcomer.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">It has been observed that when the feed of anti-fouling agent along the downcomer is not concentrated in a single feed line, but it is distributed along the downcomer according to the teaching of present invention, a high level of incorporation of the antifouling agent on the densified polymer bed is achieved, thus reducing the formation of polymer sheeting and polymer agglomerates along the entire downcomer.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">On the contrary, when the feed lines of the anti-fouling agent into the downcomer are lower than the above identified number <b>N,</b> satisfactory results in term of fouling prevention are not achieved. The comparative example of present Application shows that, when using an antistatic amount ranging from 5 to 250 ppm based on the weight of produced polyolefin, and a number of feed lines lower than <b>N,</b> a correct and reliable working of the second polymerization zone is seriously prejudiced, due to formation of polymer agglomerates inside the downcomer.
