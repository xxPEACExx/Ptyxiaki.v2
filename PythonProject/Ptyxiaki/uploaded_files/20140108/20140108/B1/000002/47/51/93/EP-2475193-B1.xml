In particular, the invention relates to a method according to the preamble of claim 1 and to a device adapted to implement this method.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Nowadays stereoscopic contents, also known as 3D contents, are becoming more and more popular. 3D contents, like movies or live events, are broadcasted for example by satellite and terrestrial TV channels or distributed by Blu-Ray discs or Internet for home video entertainment.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As it is known, human brain perceives objects' depth by combining the two images viewed by the right and left eye. In order to provide a viewer with the perception of images that have different visual depth with respect to the plane of the screen wherein the 3D content is displayed, the 3D content is constituted of two frame sequences (often called Left and Right frames) intended for different eyes of the viewer. Different systems, like shutter glasses or polarized glasses are used to let each eye of the user view the corresponding frame sequence.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As well as 2D movies or TV signals, 3D multimedia contents comprise both a video component (in this case the 3D video stream) and an audio component. The audio component comprises one or more audio tracks that can be delivered over a plurality of audio channels useful to create real and impressive audio effects, like in Dolby Surround® or in Dolby True HD® technologies.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Since the depth of an object in 3D video contents depends on the position of the object in the left and right video frame, during production or post-production of the 3D video content the two video frames are opportunely processed so as to generate the visual depth effect desired by the art director. Nevertheless, if the 3D content is viewed on screens of different size (e.g. 15 inches or 18 inches screen)<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the visual depth perception is different.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to address this problem, European patent application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP0751689A"><text>EP0751689</text></patcit> discloses a system that computes the binocular fusional range of the viewer viewing the screen used for displaying the stereoscopic image of an object, on the basis of pre-entered parameters consisting at least of the size of the screen and the viewing distance between the screen and the viewer.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The inventor has noticed that even if the visual depth perception changes with different screen sizes, the perception of the distance of sound sources remains unchanged and may not be coherent with the current depth perception, in particular if the stereoscopic content was created for screens having sizes very different from the viewer's screen size. This mismatching between visual depth perception and sound distance perception causes not realistic effects to audio tracks reproduction.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">There's therefore the need for an audio-video system which allows reproduction of stereoscopic contents in a more realistic way.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US2010328419A1"><text>US2010/328419-A1</text></patcit> shows a system for relocating the audio source point in a video teleconferencing system, depending on the actual screen size and therefore of its diagonal, with respect to the original screen size reference. A trigonometric calculation is performed of the angles between the real position of the user and the virtual sound source, then the position is rescaled in depth and angle depending on the actual size of the screen of the user, and a new position of the virtual origin of the sound is obtained.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">In one aspect, the present invention is directed to an audio-video system, and in particular to stereoscopic audio-video system, which overcomes one, some or all of the drawbacks of prior-art devices and/or systems and/or methods for playing multimedia contents comprising 3D video contents.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In particular, it is an object of the present invention to present a method and a relative apparatus for playing multimedia contents comprising an audio component and a 3D video component, which provides a better viewing<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> experience in a viewer.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The invention is defined by the independent claims of this application. Preferred embodiments are specified in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In one aspect, the invention is directed to a method for playing a multimedia content comprising a 3D video component and an audio component, wherein the 3D video component is processed so as to deliver a video signal on a video output to be displayed on a screen and wherein the audio component is processed so as to deliver audio tracks to a plurality of loudspeakers. The method provides for processing the audio component so as to deliver the plurality of audio tracks based on a parameter associated to the size of an image of the video signal<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> displayed on said screen (1010).</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">This solution offers the advantage that audio can be adapted to the depth of objects perceived by the viewer. If the 3D video content is to be displayed on screen of bigger dimensions, thereby producing an increased visual depth perception, than audio tracks to be delivered to frontal loudspeakers can be anticipated so that sound arrives before to the viewer, therefore maintaining synchronization with the video. Alternatively control of the volume can be used to synchronize audio with a 3D video having changed depth perception.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In one aspect, processing of the audio component comprises the steps of storing (302) a plurality of temporary audio tracks (e.g. audio tracks received with the audio component or audio tracks generated locally based on the received audio component), modifying said audio tracks by time shifting at least one of said temporary audio tracks, delivering the modified audio tracks.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In one aspect, only a subset of the temporary audio tracks is time shifted.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one aspect, the method provides for changing volume of at least one of the temporary audio tracks, so as to obtain a finest synchronization of audio and video. Balancing the volume of the audio tracks together with time shifting of one or more of them, can be used to increase movement perception of the audio source,</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the invention this parameter is provided by a user, in particular a viewer of the video content. This solution has the advantage that it takes into consideration user's viewing preferences. As an example, in some case the viewer can operate a TV set to change the display format (e.g. 16:9 or 4:3 or letter box). This operation can cause the TV set to modify the image size.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In one aspect, the parameter used for time shifting the audio tracks is the size of a screen wherein the 3D content is to be displayed. This solution has the advantage that this parameter is more easily found by a user, who therefore can more easily set the audio video (A/V) unit in charge of playing the multimedia<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> content.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In another aspect, the method provides for time shifting at least an audio track also based on a second parameter (e.g. the diagonal size of a screen) associated to a reference physical size of an image for which the multimedia content is optimized. Such a parameter can be retrieved from the multimedia content or can be provided by a user of the A/V unit in charge of playing the multimedia content.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to the invention the method provides for retrieving a parallax parameter associated to the 3D video component, whereby said at least one audio track is time shifted also based on said parallax parameter. This solution allows a more fine synchronization of audio and video.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In one aspect, the invention is also directed to an audio-video unit comprising a receiving unit for receiving an audio component and a 3D video component of a multimedia content. The A/V unit comprises a video processor operatively connected to the receiving unit for processing the 3D video component and transmitting the processed video to an external device. Additionally the A/V unit comprises an audio processor operatively connected to the receiving unit for processing the audio component and to deliver audio tracks to a plurality of loudspeakers. A first memory area, operatively connected to a control unit, stores a parameter associated to the physical size of the video image to be displayed. The control unit is configured to control the audio processor so as to deliver the audio tracks, and in particular to time shift one of them, based on the stored parameter.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In one aspect, the A/V unit comprises a receiver for receiving inputs from a user and the control unit is adapted to control the audio processor and the video processor in order to implement the method of playing multimedia content as described above and in the following detailed description.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In one aspect, the invention is directed to a computer program comprising program code means for performing all the steps of the method described above (and in the following detailed description) when said program is run on a computer.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In one aspect, the invention is directed to a computer readable medium storing computer-executable instructions performing all the steps of the method described above (and in the following detailed description) when executed on a computer.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Notwithstanding the invention is described and illustrated herein with reference to a limited number of embodiments, it is understood that various combinations of the elements, decoders, units, computers, computer server, circuital and logic blocks, other than those specifically illustrated, are contemplated and are within the scope of the present invention which is defined by the attached claims forming integral part of the present description.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">The invention will be presented here below with reference to non limiting examples, provided for explicative and non limitative reasons in the annexed drawings.

It should be understood, however, that there is no intention to limit the invention to the specific form disclosed, but, on the contrary, the invention is to cover all constructions falling within the scope of the claims.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the following description and in the figures, like elements are identified with like reference numerals.

The use of "including" means "including, but not limited to," unless otherwise noted.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The terms "stereoscopic video" and "3D video" are used as equivalents in the following description.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> discloses a multimedia system 1 that allows a user to play multimedia contents, in particular multimedia contents that comprise a 3D video component and an audio component.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Multimedia system 1 comprises audio-video (A/V) components such as one or more media devices 100 (e.g. a DVD, CD or a Blu-Disc player, a game console, a set-top-box for receiving cable or satellite signals, etc...) connected via a video link to the TV set 101 and via audio links to six loudspeakers 102. Media devices are, to the purpose of the present invention, devices which are able to process multimedia contents comprising audio and video contents, in particular 3D video contents.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The video link can be an RF (Radio frequency) video link, a HDMI connection, S-Video, Composite Video, or other form of video link. The audio link can be a wireless or cable link.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In the following embodiment, one of the media devices 100 is a set-top-box (STB) 1000.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">STB 1000 receives broadcast stereoscopic TV signals from an antenna 103. Stereoscopic TV signals are preferably transmitted as digital signals in a TV transponder comprising audio, 3D video and metadata. STB 1000 decodes the received TV signals and provides output stereoscopic video signals to the TV set 101 over the above mentioned video link and output audio signals to the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> loudspeakers 102 over the above mentioned audio link.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>, in order to implement the above actions, STB 1000 comprises a receiver 200 (in particular a tuner) connected to the antenna 103 which receives TV signals.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Tuner 200 is controlled by a microcontroller 201 in order to tune on the desired TV channel, whose TV signal is output to a decoder 202 that decodes it and outputs audio and video. The decoded stereoscopic video signal is provided to a display controller 203 which provides video output signals over the video link connecting set-top-box 100 and TV set 101. The decoded audio signal is provided to an audio processor 205 comprising a first memory area 2050, a second memory area 2051 and a loudspeaker controller 2052 which provides audio output signals over the audio link to the six loudspeakers 102. Memory areas 2050 and 2051 are preferably of the DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) type.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Microcontroller 201 is operatively connected, e.g. via an I2C bus, to the audio processor 205 and to the display controller 203 for controlling respectively delivery of the audio to the loudspeakers 102 and of video to the TV set 101.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">By means of proper code portions stored in memory area 2010, the microcontroller 201 is configured to implement the method for playing multimedia contents described in the following with reference to the flowchart of <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The method starts at step 300, when microcontroller 201 controls the tuner 200 in order to tune it on a desired TV channel that, in the following example, is supposed to broadcast a multimedia content comprising a 3D video component and an associated audio component.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">At step 301, decoder 202 receives the TV signal, recognizes that the received multimedia content comprises a 3D video content and provides the relative information to the microcontroller 201, so that the latter can control the audio processor in the proper way. Decoder 202 provides the decoded video to display controller 203 and the decoded audio to audio processor 205.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">At step 302 the audio processor 205 stores in memory area 2050 the decoded audio component. In one embodiment, the audio component comprises six audio<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> tracks, one for each loudspeaker 102; therefore memory area 2050 is suitable for storing up to 200ms of audio tracks. In case of digital audio, each audio track preferably comprises at least an audio packet with a time stamp indicative of the playing time of the audio track; time stamps are therefore used to synchronize audio and video during playing of the multimedia content.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In an alternative embodiment, the audio component is a mono or a stereo audio respectively with one or two audio tracks; in this embodiment, the audio processor generates (in a per se known way) six audio tracks starting from the received one or two audio tracks. The generated audio tracks are then stored in memory 2050.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">At step 303, microcontroller 201 starts a communication process with the TV set 101 via the video link. In the preferred embodiment, microcontroller 201 queries the TV set 101 in order to retrieve a parameter relative to the size of the image currently displayed on the screen 1010 of TV set 101. As an example, TV set 101 can provide the information that the user is currently viewing an image in 4:3 format on a 32 inches display. In an alternative embodiment, the parameter provided to the STB 1000 by TV set 101 is more simply the diagonal size of the screen of TV set 101, for example 32 inches. This parameter is stored in a memory area 2011 of microcontroller 201.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">At step 304, microcontroller 201 analyzes the metadata of the TV signal to retrieve information about a reference display size for which the video component of the TV signal is optimized, for example 50 inches. If this information is available, it is stored in memory area 2012 of the microcontroller 201. In an alternative embodiment, the reference display size can be set by a user via the graphic user interface (GUI) of STB 1000. If no information on the reference display size is retrieved from the multimedia content or from the user, in the preferred embodiment, microcontroller will put in memory 2012 a preset value.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">At step 305 microcontroller 201 retrieves a parallax variation parameter that is preferably set by a user via the GUI. As it is well known to those skilled in the art of 3D contents, the parallax is a parameter that indicates the distance between left and right images of a stereoscopic video frame; by changing the parallax,<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> images are perceived as having more or less depth. By means of keys and buttons of a remote control, the user selects the preferred "visual depth" and therefore implicitly sets the parallax variation parameter, which is a relative parameter that takes care of the variation of parallax requested by the user. In one embodiment, this parallax variation parameter ranges from -5 to +5, whereby the parallax variation parameter has the value 0 if the user does not change the parallax. The parallax variation parameter is negative when the user reduces the visual depth and is positive when the user increases the visual depth of the 3D content.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Microcontroller 201 stores the parallax parameter in parallax memory area 2013.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">At step 306, microcontroller 201 analyzes information stored in memory areas 2011, 2012 and 2013, i.e. the TV set diagonal size, the reference display size and the parallax parameter, in order to calculate a time interval value Δt for each of the audio tracks of the audio components.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">As an example illustrated with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">fig. 4</figref>, if the 3D video component received is optimized for being displayed on a 32 inches TV set 400 and the TV set is a 65 inches TV set 401, than the user 402 will perceive an increased visual depth of the objects (objects moves from position A to position B), therefore microcontroller will move back in time, i.e. packets' time stamp is decreased, the audio tracks to be provided to the front loudspeakers. In this way the front sound is heard before by the viewer. Alternatively, in such a case the audio tracks to be delivered to the rear loudspeakers are processed so that the time stamp is increased, therefore moving forward in time (sound is heard later) the relative audio track. As a further alternatives both audio tracks intended for front and rear loudspeakers are modified and time shifted; in this embodiment, audio tracks intended for front and rear loudspeakers are processed in different ways, in particular if they are both time shifted, they are time shifted of different amounts.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The overall effect is that the virtual object is perceived as closer to the viewer.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In one embodiment, the time interval value Δt will depend on the ratio between reference and actual size of the screen, i.e. the values stored in memory area 2011 and 2012. If the user has changed the parallax by requesting to reduce<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the depth of 3D objects, than audio tracks will be changed accordingly moving back and forward in time one or more audio tracks.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In general, if we consider the source of a sound as an acoustic virtual object, by delaying sound in rear loudspeakers it is possible to create impression of moving rear loudspeakers back and in the same time moving virtual acoustic objects closer to the position of visual virtual object.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">By delaying sound in front loudspeakers it is possible to create impression of moving virtual acoustic objects in the direction of the screen. For human brain is important time difference between sounds from different directions to detect sound source position. Sound speed in the air is about 340 m/s, which means that sound moves 1 m in about 3 ms. Based on this information, microcontroller 201 therefore can calculates time shift Δt; as an example, by delaying of 3 ms sound from one of loudspeakers, the virtual sound source is moved of about 1 m.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">After that, microcontroller 201 modifies (step 307) the audio tracks stored in memory area 2050 by changing the time stamp associated to each audio packet. In detail, the time stamp is modified according to time interval value Δt calculated at step 306, and the modified audio tracks are stored in memory area 2051.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">At step 308, microcontroller 201 controls loudspeaker controller 2052 and display controller 203 so that audio and video to be played at the same time are provided respectively to the loudspeakers 102 and to the TV set 101.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In one embodiment, in addition to time shifting the audio tracks, microcontroller 201 controls the loudspeaker controller 2052 so as to modify amplitude of the same; in this way microcontroller 201 can better control movement of virtual acoustic objects in the space, so as to allow a better viewing experience.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In case the user has set a variation parallax parameter different from zero, i.e. it has modified the view to have more or less 3D effect, then microcontroller 101 controls display controller 203 so as to modify at least one of the right and left image of each video frame so as to obtain the 3D effect requested by the user.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0005">figure 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">6</figref>, in a further embodiment, the invention is directed to a multimedia system 500, wherein a media center (or more in general a<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> PC suitable to mange audio and video) 5000 delivers 3D video contents to a monitor 501 and audio to six loudspeakers 502.
