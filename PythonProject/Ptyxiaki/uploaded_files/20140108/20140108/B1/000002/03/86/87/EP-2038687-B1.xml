Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to optical fibers, and more specifically to microstructured optical fibers.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Technical Background</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Optical fibers formed of glass materials have been in commercial use for more than two decades. Although such optical fibers have represented a quantum leap forward in the field of telecommunications, work on alternative optical fiber designs continues. One promising type of alternative optical fiber is the microstructured optical fiber, which includes holes or voids running longitudinally along the fiber axis. The holes generally contain air or an inert gas, but may also contain other materials. The majority of microstructured fibers have a plurality of holes located around the core, wherein the holes continue for a relatively long (e.g. for many tens of meters or more) distance along the length of the fiber, and typically the holes extend along the entire length of the optical fiber. These cladding holes are also most typically arranged in a regular, periodic formation around the core of the optical fiber. In other words, if cross sections of the optical fiber are taken along the length of the optical fiber, the same individual holes can be found in essentially the same periodic hole structure relative to one another. Examples of such microstructured fibers include those described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6243522B"><text>US Pat No. 6,243,522</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Microstructured optical fibers may be designed to have a wide variety of properties, and may be used in a wide variety of applications. For example, microstructured optical<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> fibers having a solid glass core and a plurality of holes disposed in the cladding region around the core have been constructed. The position and sizes of the holes may be designed to yield microstructured optical fibers with dispersions ranging anywhere from large negative values to large positive values. Such fibers may be useful, for example, in dispersion compensation. Solid-core microstructured optical fibers may also be designed to be single moded over a wide range of wavelengths. Most solid-core microstructured optical fibers guide light by a total internal reflection mechanism; the low index of the holes acts to lower the effective index of the cladding region in which they are disposed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Micro-structured optical fibers are typically manufactured by the so- called "stack-and-draw" method, wherein an array of silica rods and/or tubes are stacked in a close-packed arrangement to form a preform, that can be drawn into fiber using a conventional tower setup. There are several disadvantages to the stack and draw method. The awkwardness of assembling hundreds of very thin canes (defined by rods or tubes), as well as the possible presence of interstitial cavities when stacking and drawing cylindrical canes, may affect dramatically the fiber attenuation by introducing soluble and particulate impurities, undesired interfaces and inducing a reshaping or reformation of the starting holes. Moreover, the relatively low productivity and high cost make this method not much suitable for industrial production.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">By way of prior art attention is directed to <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20050094954A"><text>US 2005/0094954</text></patcit> which discloses a fiber according to the preamble of claim 1 below.

The core region and cladding region provide improved bend resistance, single mode operation at wavelengths preferably greater than or equal to 1500 nm, in some embodiments also greater than 1400 nm, in other embodiments also greater than 1260 nm. The optical fibers preferably provide a mode field at a wavelength of 1310 nm preferably greater than 8.0 micrometer, more preferably between 8.0 and 10.0 micrometer. In preferred embodiments, optical fiber disclosed herein is thus single-mode transmission optical fiber.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> The holes or voids are located substantially, and preferably entirely in a region of the cladding of the fiber such that they surround the core in a void containing region, and the voids are preferably substantially absent from the core region, i.e., the core is preferably solid and void-free. In some preferred embodiments, the voids are located in void containing regions which are spaced apart from the core of the optical fiber. For example, a relatively thin (e.g. having a radial width less than 40 micrometer, and more preferably less than 30 micrometer) ring of a void containing region can be spaced apart from the core of the optical fiber, but not extending entirely to the outer perimeter of the optical fiber. The optical fiber may or may not include germania or fluorine to also adjust the refractive index of the core and or cladding of the optical fiber, but these dopants can also be avoided and instead, the voids alone can be used to adjust the refractive index of the cladding with respect to the core such that light is guided down the core of the fiber. While index of refraction adjusting dopants may be avoided, preferably at least one of germania or fluorine or a similar index of refraction adjusting dopant is employed together with the non-periodically distributed voids located in the cladding region of the optical fiber. However, use of germania and/or fluorine is not critical and, for example, the fiber could if desired be entirely or substantially devoid of both germania and fluorine.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The microstructured optical fiber according to the invention comprises a core region disposed about a longitudinal centerline, and a cladding region surrounding the core region, the cladding region comprising an annular hole-containing region comprised of non-periodically disposed holes, wherein the annular hole-containing region has a maximum radial width of less than 12 micrometer, the annular hole-containing region has a regional void area percent of less than 30 percent, and the non-periodically disposed holes have a mean diameter of less than 1550 nm.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">By "non-periodically disposed" or "non-periodic distribution", we mean that when one takes a cross section (such as a cross section perpendicular to the longitudinal axis) of the optical fiber, the non-periodically disposed holes are randomly or non-periodically distributed across a portion of the fiber. Similar cross sections taken at different points along the length of the fiber will reveal different cross-sectional hole patterns, i.e., various cross sections will have different hole patterns, wherein the distributions of holes and sizes of holes do not match. That is, the voids or holes are non-periodic, i.e., they are not periodically disposed<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> within the fiber structure. These holes are stretched (elongated) along the length (i.e. parallel to the longitudinal axis) of the optical fiber, but do not extend the entire length of the entire fiber for typical lengths of transmission fiber. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the holes extend less than a few meters, and in many cases less than 1 meter along the length of the fiber.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Spacing the hole-containing region (hole-containing ring or intermediate annular region) apart from the core assists in lowering the attenuation of the optical fiber 1550 nm. Additionally, limiting the radial extent of the hole-containing region facilitates single mode transmission within the optical fiber.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The fibers disclosed herein can be made using a relatively low cost manufacturing process, because expensive dopants such as fluorine and/or germania can be avoided in the hole-containing region, if desired, and the stack and draw manufacturing process of arranging spatially periodically disposed holes in the glass part of the optical fiber can likewise be avoided, if desired. Alternatively, the methods disclosed herein can be used simply to add holes or voids to a cladding of a fiber which is doped with one or more of germania, phosphorous, aluminum, ytterbium, erbium, fluorine or other conventional fiber dopant materials, or which also contains spatially periodically disposed holes in the cladding, to increase the bend resistance thereof. In some embodiments disclosed herein, the optical fiber contains no, or essentially no, fluorine or boron.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Additional features and advantages of the invention according to the claims will be set forth in the detailed description which follows, and in part will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art from that description or recognized by practicing the invention as described herein.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description provide an overview or framework for understanding the nature and character of the invention as it is claimed.

All optical properties (such as dispersion, dispersion slope, bending, etc.) are reported herein at a wavelength of 1550 nm unless otherwise noted.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">During the manufacture of transmission optical fibers by conventional soot deposition processes such as the outside vapor deposition (OVD) process or the vapor axial deposition (VAD) process, silica and doped silica particles are pyrogenically generated in a flame and deposited as soot. In the case of OVD, silica soot preforms are formed layer-by-layer by deposition of the particles on the outside of a cylindrical target rod by traversing the soot-laden flame along the axis of the cylindrical target. Such porous soot preforms are subsequently treated with a drying agent (e.g., chlorine) to remove water and metal impurities and are then consolidated or sintered into glass blanks at temperatures ranging from 1100-1500°C. Surface energy driven viscous flow sintering is the dominant mechanism of sintering, which results in densification and closing of the pores of the soot, thereby forming a consolidated glass preform. During the final stages of sintering, the gases used in consolidation may become trapped as the open pores are closed. If the solubility and permeability of the trapped gases in the glass are high at the sintering temperature, then the gases are able to migrate through and out of the glass during the consolidation process. Alternatively, gases which are still trapped after the consolidation phase of the fiber manufacturing process may be outgassed by holding the fiber preforms for a period until the gases migrate out through the glass preforms, thereby leaving one or more voids with vacuum therein within the preform. During the draw operation when the optical fiber is drawn from<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the preform, these voids close, leaving a void-free or essentially void-free optical fiber. In consolidation processes which are employed to make conventional transmission optical fiber, the goal is to achieve an optical fiber that is entirely free of voids in both the core and cladding region of the optical fiber. Helium is often the gas utilized as the atmosphere during the consolidation of conventional optical fiber preforms. Because helium is very permeable in glass, it very easily exits the soot preform and the glass during the consolidation process, so that after consolidating in helium the glass is free of pores or voids.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The optical fiber disclosed herein is made from a preform that was subjected to preform consolidation conditions which are effective to result in a significant amount of gases being trapped in the consolidated glass blank, thereby causing the formation of non-periodically distributed voids in the consolidated glass optical fiber preform. Rather than taking steps to remove these voids, the resultant preform is purposefully used to form an optical fiber with voids therein. In particular, by utilizing relatively low permeability gases and/or relatively high sintering rates, holes can be trapped in the consolidated glass during the consolidation process. The sintering rate can be increased by increasing the sintering temperature and/or increasing the downfeed rate of the soot preform through the sintering zone of the consolidation furnace. Under certain sintering conditions, it is possible to obtain glasses in which the area fraction of the trapped gases is a significant fraction of the total area or volume of the preform.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the optical fiber disclosed herein, the non-periodically distributed holes or voids which are present in the optical fiber as a result of using the processes disclosed herein are located in the cladding of the optical fiber. Such voids can be used to lower refractive index. By utilizing the consolidation parameters so that the maximum diameter of the holes or voids is less than the wavelength of the light which is to be transmitted along the length of the fiber (e.g. in the case of optical fibers for use in telecommunications applications, less than 1550 nm), the fiber may be effectively used to transmit information at a particular wavelength.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 1</b></figref> illustrates a method of manufacturing a soot optical fiber preform <b>20</b> which can be used to make the optical fiber disclosed herein.

The glass former compounds <b>28, 36</b> are oxidized in the flame <b>30</b> to form the generally cylindrically-shaped soot region <b>23</b>. In particular, a dopant compound <b>36</b> may be included if desired. For example, a germanium compound may be included as an index of refraction increasing dopant (e.g. in the core of the fiber), or a fluorine containing compound may be included to lower the index of refraction (e.g. in the cladding and/or void containing region of the fiber).</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Fig. 2</b></figref>, the soot preform <b>20</b> including the cylindrical soot region <b>23</b> may be consolidated in a consolidation furnace <b>29</b> to form a consolidated blank <b>31</b> (shown in subsequent <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Figure 3</b></figref>). Prior to consolidation, the mandrel <b>24</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Figure 1</b></figref> is removed to form a hollow, cylindrical soot blank preform. During the consolidation process, the soot preform <b>20</b> is suspended, for example, inside a pure quartz muffle tube <b>27</b> of the furnace <b>29</b> by a holding mechanism <b>21</b>. Preferably, before the consolidation step the preform <b>20</b> is exposed to a drying atmosphere. For examples, a suitable drying atmosphere may include about 95 percent to 99 percent helium and 1 percent to 5 percent chlorine gas at a temperature of between about 950°C and 1250°C and a suitable drying time ranges from about 0.5 and 4.0 hours. The soot preform can also be doped, if desired, for example using a dopant gas having fluorine or other optical fiber dopants therein. For example, to dope with fluorine, SiF<sub>4</sub> and/or CF<sub>4</sub> gas may be employed. Such dopant gases may be employed using conventional doping temperatures, for example between about 950 and 1250°C for 0.25 to 4 hours.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">During the consolidation step, which preferably takes place after a soot drying step, the furnace temperature is raised and the preform <b>20</b> is consolidated at a suitable temperature, for example between about 1390°C and 1535°C to form a consolidated preform.

For example, the preform may be held in an isothermal zone which is maintained at a desired drying temperature (950-1250°C), after which the soot preform is driven through a zone which is maintained at a desired consolidation temperature (e.g. 1225°C to 1550°C, more preferably 1390°C and 1535°C) at a rate of speed which is sufficient to result in the preform 20 temperature increasing by greater than 1°C/min. Upper zones of the furnace can be maintained at lower temperatures which facilitate a drying and impurity removal step. The lower zone can be maintained at the higher temperatures desired for consolidation. In one preferred embodiment, the soot containing preform is downfed through a consolidation hot zone at a first downfeed rate, followed by downfeeding of the preform through a second hot zone at a second downfeed rate which is less than that of the first downfeed rate. Such a consolidation technique results in the outside portion of the soot preform sintering before the rest of the preform sinters, thereby facilitating trapping of gases which will in turn facilitate formation of and retaining of voids in the resultant consolidated glass. For example, the preform can be exposed to such suitable consolidation temperatures (e.g. greater than about 1390°C) at a first speed which is sufficient to result in the preform temperature increasing by more than 15°C/ min, more preferably greater than 17°C/min, followed by at least a second downfeed rate/consolidation temperature combination which is sufficient to result in the preform heating by at least about 12°C/min, more preferably greater than 14°C/min. Preferably, the first consolidation rate results in the outside of the preform increasing in temperature at a rate which is greater than 2, more preferably greater than 3, and most preferably greater than about 4°C /min higher than the heating rate of the second consolidation rate. If desired, a third consolidation step can be employed which heats at a slower rate (e.g. less than 10°C/min). Alternatively, the soot preform can be sintered at even faster rates in order to create more voids by driving the soot preform through a furnace hot zone where the temperature is greater than 1550°C, more preferably greater than 1700°C, even more preferably greater than 1900°C. Alternatively, the soot preform can be sintered at even faster rates external to the furnace by using an open flame or plasma torch in contact with the soot.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Preferred sintering gases which may be used in the consolidation step are those which comprise at least one gas selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, argon, CO<sub>2</sub>, oxygen, Chlorine, CF<sub>4</sub>, CO, SO<sub>2</sub>, krypton, neon, and mixtures thereof Each of these gases<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> exhibits a relatively low permeability in silica glass at or below the consolidation temperature which is suitable for forming voids.<br/>

In fact, up to 100 percent nitrogen gas, up to 100 percent argon gas, and up to 100 percent oxygen gas have been utilized successfully. Voids can also be created by sintering the soot in a low permeability gas (e.g. nitrogen, argon, CO<sub>2</sub>, oxygen, Chlorine, CF<sub>4</sub>, CO, SO<sub>2</sub>) under a partial vacuum (e.g., wherein the preform is immersed in a sintering atmosphere is at a pressure of between about 40 to 750 Torr), and in such cases use of a diluent relatively high permeability gas such as helium is not necessary.

Regional<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> void area percent, as used herein, means the total area of the voids in a void containing region divided by the total area of the void containing region (when the optical fiber is viewed in cross-section taken perpendicular to the axis of the optical fiber) times 100, the void containing region being defined by the inner and outer boundaries of the void containing region. For example, if the radially innermost edge of the radially innermost void in the fiber has a radial location of 4 micrometer from the axial centerline of the fiber, and the radially outermost edge of the radially outermost void in the fiber has a radial location of 60 micrometer from the centerline, then the area of the void containing region is approximately 11309 - 50 = 11259 square micrometer. If the total cross sectional area of voids contained in this void containing region is 1100 square micrometer, then the void area percent of the void containing region is approximately 9.8 percent.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In combination with the other sintering gases described above, it is desirable to employ a consolidation process which includes a downfeed of the preform at a rate and temperature which is sufficient to result in at least some of the consolidation gases being intentionally trapped.

For example in one such embodiment, a soot preform is formed as described above with respect to <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 1</b></figref>, after which the soot preform is consolidated using conventional consolidation techniques (e.g., using consolidation temperatures of higher than 1300°C in an atmosphere of 100 percent helium) to form a void free core preform. For example, in the case of a fiber preform which is to be used to make a pure silica core fiber, the core preform would consist of relatively pure silica with no significant index of refraction adjusting dopants. Alternatively, in the case of an optical fiber preform which is to be used to<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> make a pure germania doped core fiber, the core preform could consist of a germania doped core region and optionally a portion of the cladding (e.g. undoped silica cladding).

Using the void producing consolidation techniques disclosed herein, it is possible to make optical fibers whose cladding comprises a void containing region having a regional void area percent greater than 0.5 percent, more preferably greater than about 1, even more preferably greater than about 5 and most preferably greater than about 10 percent. Most preferably, the region having holes does not extend to the outer edge of the cladding such that there are open voids or holes on the outside of the fiber.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The sintering temperatures employed preferably range from 1100°C to 1550°C, more preferably between 1300°C and 1500°C, and most preferably between 1350°C and 1500°C. One preferred sintering temperature is approximately 1490° C. The gaseous atmosphere employed during the consolidation process, the temperature inside the consolidation furnace, and preform consolidation rate are selected so that, during the soot consolidation process, gases are intentionally trapped within the preform, forming holes in the consolidated glass. These gas containing voids are preferably not entirely outgassed prior to and/or during the fiber draw process, so that the voids remain in the fiber after the fiber has been drawn. A variety of process parameters can be controlled to vary and control the size of the voids. For example, increasing the consolidation time or temperature can increase the void size, as the increased temperature causes the gases trapped within the voids to expand. Similarly, the size and area percent of the voids can be impacted by the draw conditions. For example, a longer hot zone in a draw furnace and/or faster draw speeds tend to increase the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> size as well as the area percent of the holes. Selection of a gas that is more permeable in glass at the consolidation temperature will result in smaller voids. Sintering rate can also have a significant effect on hole size and hole quantity. A faster sintering rate will result in the formation of more and larger voids. However, use of sintering rates that are too slow will result in no voids being formed, as the gas will have time to escape through the glass. Consequently, the downfeed rate of the preform and/or the consolidation temperature employed are preferably high enough to result in the heating of at least a portion of the preform at a rate greater than about 10°C/min, more preferably greater than about 12°C/min, even more preferably greater than about 14°C/min. Generally speaking, an optical fiber preform having a lower soot density will result in formation of more voids. However, the density of the deposited soot in a particular optical fiber preform can be varied to position more holes (higher regional void area percent) where desired. For example, a first high density soot region can be deposited directly onto a consolidated glass (e.g. pure silica) core cane, followed by a second region of soot having a lower density than that of the first. We have found that this causes a higher void area percent to form near the core (i.e. in the high density soot region). The silica containing soot preferably has a bulk density of between about 0.10 g/cc and 1.7 g/cc, more preferably between about 0.30 g/cc and 1.0 g/cc. This effect can also be used to form consolidated void containing preforms which alternate between low or no void containing regions and higher void containing regions; wherein the initial soot density radial variation is greater than 3 percent over a distance of at least 100 micrometer. Such preforms can be used, for example, to make optical fibers having cladding regions which alternate between regions of void free glass and void containing glass. Fibers having such alternating void containing and void-free regions would exhibit properties useful as Bragg gratings.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003"><b>Fig. 5</b></figref>, using the techniques described above, an optical fiber preform <b>150</b> can be formed which comprises a void-free core region <b>151</b> which is surrounded by a cladding <b>152</b> which is comprised of a plurality of voids.

Such void containing cladding regions can be used to lower the refractive index relative to the core and thus form the cladding region which guides light along the core of the optical fiber. By selecting the appropriate soot consolidation conditions, as will be described below, a variety of useful optical fiber designs can be achieved. For example, by selecting the maximum void size in the cladding to be less than that of the wavelength of light which is to be transmitted (for example, less than 1550 nm for some telecommunications systems), and preferably less than one half of the wavelength of light which is to be transmitted along the fiber, low attenuation fibers can be achieved Without having to use expensive dopants. Consequently,<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> for a variety of applications, it is desirable for the holes to be formed such that greater than 95% of and preferably all of the holes exhibit a mean hole size in the cladding for the optical fiber which is less than 1550 nm, more preferably less than 775 nm, most preferably less than about 390 nm. Likewise, it is preferable that the maximum diameter of the holes in the fiber be less than 7000 nm, more preferably less than 2000 nm, and even more preferably less than 1550 nm, and most preferably less than 775 nm, all of which diameters are achievable using the methods disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the fibers disclosed herein have fewer than 5000 holes, in some embodiments also fewer than 1000 holes, and iri other embodiments the total number of holes is fewer than 500 holes in a given optical fiber perpendicular cross-section. Of course, the most preferred fibers will exhibit combinations of these characteristics. Thus, for example, one particularly preferred embodiment of optical fiber would exhibit fewer than 200 holes in the optical fiber, the holes having a maximum diameter less than 1550 nm and a mean diameter less than 775 nm, although useful and bend resistant optical fibers can be achieved using larger and greater numbers of holes. The hole number, mean diameter, max diameter, and total void area percent of holes can all be calculated with the help of a scanning electron microscope at a magnification of about 800X and image analysis software, such as ImagePro, which is available from Media Cybernetics, Inc. of Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The optical fiber disclosed herein may or may not include germania or fluorine to also adjust the refractive index of the core and or cladding of the optical fiber, but these dopants can also be avoided in the intermediate annular region and instead, the holes (in combination with any gas or gases that may be disposed within the holes) can be used to adjust the manner in which light is guided down the core of the fiber.
