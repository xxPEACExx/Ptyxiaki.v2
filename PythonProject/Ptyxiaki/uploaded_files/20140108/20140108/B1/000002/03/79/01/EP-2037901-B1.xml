the use of cannabigerol (CBG) in the treatment of depression.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Mood disorders are generally classified by type and include, but are not limited to:</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A morbid or clinical depression, which is usually diagnosed when sadness or elation is overly intense and continues beyond the expected impact of an event. Symptoms often recur on an episodic basis or pursue a low-grade intermittent chronicity, which impairs the functioning of the sufferer.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Bipolar mood disorder, which commonly begins with depression and is characterised by periods of elation during the course of the illness.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Unipolar mood disorder, which is characterised as syndromal depression of episodes that last for typically 6 to 9 months.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The pharmaceuticals used in the treatment of Bipolar mood disorders can be grouped into three classes; the heterocyclic antidepressants (HCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and lithium salts.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">HCAs are the largest class of antidepressants and include tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine. The HCAs have no immediate effect on euphoria and therefore have a low abuse potential. This group of antidepressants work by increasing the availability of the biogenic amines norepinephrine and/or serotonin (5-HT) by blocking reuptake in the synaptic cleft. The side effects of HCAs include tachycardia, postural hypotension and cardio-toxicity. HCAs are also commonly associated with blurred vision, xerostomia, constipation, urinary hesitation, sedation and weight gain. The hypotensive side effects of HCAs often make them unsuitable for patients with mental disorders and the elderly.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">MAOIs such as phenelzine are often prescribed for panic disorders. They work by the inhibition of the oxidative deamination of the 3 classes of biogenic amines; noradrenergic, dopaminergic and 5-HT. MAOIs are underused because of clinician's fears of hypertension that may result from dietary or drug reactions, popularly known as the 'cheese reaction' due to the high tyramine content in cheeses and other foods. Other common side effects of MAOIs include erectile difficulties, anxiety, nausea, dizziness, insomnia, edema and weight gain.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Lithium is used to stabilise the often unpredictable mood swings in bipolar mood disorder. The precise mechanism of action is unknown, but it is postulated that it is able to cause hyperpolarisation of the neuronal membrane. The most common acute benign side effects are tremour, fasciculation, nausea, diarrhoea, polyuria, polydipsia and weight gain. Lithium toxicity is more likely in elderly patients.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The applicants have previously shown that the cannabinoid cannabichromene is useful in the treatment of mood disorders as described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2005000830A"><text>WO2005/000830</text></patcit>.

For example when the side chain is a pentyl (5 carbon) chain the compound produced will be CBG. If the pentyl chain is replaced with a propyl (3 carbon) chain the CBD type compound formed is CBGV (cannabigeroldivarin). The propyl variant will be formed if a 10 carbon precursor is reacted at the first stage of the biosynthetic pathway rather than a 12 carbon compound.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Synthetic variants of CBG include dimethylheptyl CBG.

Of these cannabinoids there are eight different main classes of cannabinoids: cannabigerol-type; cannabichromene-type;<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> cannabidiol-type; tetrahydrocannabinol-type; cannabielsoin-type; iso-tetrahydrocannabinol-type; cannabicyclol-type; and cannabicitran-type.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">All of these main classes of cannabinoids are derived from cannabigerol-type compounds and differ mainly in the way the CBG precursor is cyclised.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The structure of cannabigerol is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> and the biosynthetic pathway is detailed in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>. Cannabinoid production in cannabis plants begins when an enzyme causes geranyl pyrophosphate and olivetolic acid to condense to form cannabigerol. The CBG cannabinoid is then usually converted by cannabinoid synthase enzymes to cannabidiol (CBD), cannabichromene (CBC) or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Due to the nature of the biosynthetic pathway of cannabinoids most cannabis plants do not comprise a large amount of CBG. As such the pharmacology of CBG is largely unknown and it has been postulated that CBG is merely a precursor to other more pharmacologically active cannabinoids. The inventors postulated that it is possible, due to the biosynthetic pathway of the cannabinoids, that CBG will share some common properties with its products such as CBD and CBC. Also it is conceivable that the combination of CBG with products such as CBC, CBD and THC will produce a greater and more beneficial effect that that produced by CBG alone.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">It was shown by Elsohly et al. in 1992 that CBG had antimicrobial properties and more recently in 2005 Maor <i>et al</i>. described a synthetic analogue of CBG, CBG-dimethyl heptyl which possessed hypotensive and<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> vasorelaxant properties. Compared with the vast knowledge available on THC or CBD, CBG's properties are relatively unknown.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Some patients have found cannabis to be useful in the treatment of anxiety, depression and bipolar mood disorders (Zimmerman, 1998). However reports on the therapeutic potential of cannabis are often contradictory as they describe the effects of whole, usually smoked cannabis, rather than the actions of the specific cannabinoids themselves. Indeed THC is often associated with anxiety and mood disorders, particularly in recreational users.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Certain aspects of this invention are further described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:
<ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows the structure of cannabigerol; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> shows the biosynthetic pathway of the major cannabinoids.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><u>Example 1:</u></heading><heading id="h0006"><b>Alteration of behavioural despair in an animal model of depression</b></heading><p id="p0044" num="0044">A substantially pure extract of cannabigerol, purified from a cannabis plant extract, was tested for its ability to modify the behaviour of mice during an open field test and a tail suspension test (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Steru et al., 1985, Psychopharmacology (Berl.) 85(3), 367-370</text></nplcit>). The CBG<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> extract was compared to a known antidepressant imipramine.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The experiment used groups of 7-8 C57 B16J mice and these were tested with doses of 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mg/kg ip of CBG extract. The dose of imipramine that was used was the standard dose that is known to produce an anti-depressant effect of 30 mg/kg ip. One group of animals were administered a vehicle control.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The open field apparatus consisted of a 44.5 x 44.5 x 30 cm chamber with clear plastic walls and a white plastic floor. Behaviours were recorded using a Quasar video recorder suspended above the chamber. The chamber was divided into four equal sized quadrants during scoring by placing a clear plastic template on the video screen. Behaviours were scored using data collection software.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The animals were subjected to a tail suspension test whereby a sound-attenuated chamber with a titanium bar mounted 15cm from the floor was used. An opto-electronic sensor was mounted in a white plastic column and positioned from the mounting bar. An infra-red light transmitted from an LED onto the animal. If the animal moved, the amount of light collected by the phototransistor would increase or decrease depending on the size of the movement.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">On the day of testing the mice were weighed and randomly assigned to a group prior to test article or control drug being injected intraperitoneally. Thirty minutes later each mouse was tested on the tail suspension test for six minutes.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The mouse was suspended from a bar by the tip of its tail using adhesive tape so that the tip of their nose was 2cm from the floor of the chamber. The total number of movements and total amount of time spent immobile were recorded.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Immediately after the tail suspension test the mouse was placed individually in the open-field chamber for five minutes. The frequency of crossings, rears, grooming and defecation were recorded for each subject.</p><heading id="h0007"><u>Results:</u></heading><p id="p0051" num="0051">Antidepressant effects are indicated by an increase in the frequency of struggling activity during the test. In addition the degree or amplitude of struggling is thought to be a predictor of antidepressant activity.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">At a dose of CBG greater than or equal to 40 mg/kg the amount of struggling was significantly increased compared with the animals administered the vehicle control. This dose of CBG gave similar responses as the standard dose of imipramine.</p><heading id="h0008"><u>Conclusion:</u></heading><p id="p0053" num="0053">The data presented suggest that CBG may induce antidepressant effects. Moderate doses of CBG produced behaviours that were consistent to imipramine in the tail suspension test and as such the use of this naturally occurring cannabinoid may have beneficial effects over<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> that of HCA antidepressants such as imipramine which are known to cause many side effects in users.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56986079" lang="DE"
