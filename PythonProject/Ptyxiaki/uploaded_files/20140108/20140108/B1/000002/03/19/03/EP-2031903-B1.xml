In a system (audio signal transmission system) such as the home theater system which transmits an audio signal, an apparatus (transmitting apparatus) which transmits an audio signal and an apparatus (receiving apparatus) which receives an audio signal are often connected to each other through various connection cables.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In order to increase the degree of freedom of a layout of a plurality of loudspeakers configuring a home theater system, a so-called wireless connection between a transmitting apparatus which provides a sound source and a loudspeaker serving as a receiving apparatus has been attempted without using a connection cable (for example, see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2007027928A"><text>2007-27928</text></patcit>).

Up to now, allocation of the audio signals to the channels can hardly be changed. For this reason, even though an audio signal of a specific type (for example, a signal in a surround system) is not used, allocation of channels can hardly be changed, and channels included in a transmitting apparatus can hardly be effectively used.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Therefore, the present invention has been made in consideration, and it is desirable to effectively use a channel included in a transmitting apparatus by changing allocation of audio signals to channels in an audio signal transmitting apparatus, an audio signal receiving apparatus, an audio signal transmission system, an audio signal transmission system, and a program.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to an embodiment of the present invention,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> there is provided an audio signal

main signals.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The channel mapping unit may include: a transmitting scheme selecting unit which selects any one of the first transmitting scheme and the second transmitting scheme depending on a type of the external connection apparatus<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> which can output the audio signal transmitted by the audio signal transmitting unit; a channel allocating unit

turned off.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The channel allocating unit may allocate the surround signals to the channels the number of which is equal to the number of surround apparatuses which can output the audio signals transmitted by the audio signal transmitting unit and may allocate the main signal to the channel to which the surround signal is not allocated.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The channel allocating unit, when a new surround signal is allocated to the channel, on the basis of the channel mapping information acquired from the channel mapping information generating unit, may determine the presence/absence of an idle channel serving as the channel to which the audio signal is not allocated, and may allocate the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> new surround signal to one of the channels to which the main signal is allocated when it is determined that the idle channel is absent.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The audio signal transmitting apparatus further includes a channel managing unit which, when a plurality of main channels are the channels to which the main signals are allocated, on the basis of the connection apparatus information acquired from the connection apparatus information generating unit, confirms the number of main apparatuses which output the audio signals transmitted from the main channels and notifies the channel allocating unit of the channel

In this manner, according to the CH allocating process<!-- EPO <DP n="75"> --> in the surround mode according to the embodiment, even though an idle channel is absent, a new surround signal can be allocated while minimizing an influence on the operation of the main apparatus which outputs an audio signal transmitted from the main channel.</p><p id="p0185" num="0185">As a result of the determination in step S327, when it is determined that only one main CH is present, the CH allocating unit 163 requests the CH number changing unit 195 of the channel management unit 190 to perform a process of increasing the number of channels. The CH number changing unit 195 which receives the request performs a CH increasing process (step S333). After the CH increasing process, the CH allocating unit 163 allocates a new surround signal to an added channel (step S335), and the CH mapping information generating unit 165 generates CH mapping information on the basis of the allocation result (step S325).</p><p id="p0186" num="0186">In the example described above, even though the plurality of main CHs are present, the channel number increasing process may be performed. Even though the number of main CHs is one, allocation of a main signal in the main CH may be canceled, and a new surround signal may be allocated.</p><p id="p0187" num="0187">It should be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications, combinations, sub-combinations and alterations may occur depending on design requirements and other factors insofar as they are within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.<!-- EPO <DP n="76"> --></p><p id="p0188" num="0188">For example, the embodiments described above describe the case in which a 4-channel stereo system including 4 channels is used. However, the number of channels is not limited to the number described above, and 4 or more channels may be used. Since the number of settable channels depends on the processing capability of a CPU or a DSP arranged in the audio signal transmitting apparatus or the audio signal receiving apparatus, the numbers of channels can be changed depending on the processing capabilities of these processors.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56986094" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="90"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Audiosignalübertragungsvorrichtung (10), welche dafür eingerichtet ist, Audiosignale über mehrere Kanäle zu externen Verbindungsvorrichtungen (20) zu übertragen, welche Folgendes aufweist:
