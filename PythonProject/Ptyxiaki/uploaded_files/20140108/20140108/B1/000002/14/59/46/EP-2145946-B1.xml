Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a detergent composition containing a polyglycerol monoalkyl ether, water, a fat or oil, and a polyol. The detergent composition is useful typically as a cleansing agent for oily cosmetics.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Cleansing agents for cosmetics (make-ups) are roughly classified mainly oil, gel, and foamable cleansing agents. Oil and gel cleansing agents generally require massaging by fingers so as to satisfactorily mix with cosmetics and to remove the cosmetics. A pressure is applied to the skin upon massaging, and this often damages the skin. In addition, these agents cause sticky feeling upon use and are not readily rinsable. In contrast, foamable cleansing agents are less irritating to the skin, excel in feel upon use, and have thereby been desirably used as cleansing agents.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Known foamable cleansing agents include those containing a foamable aerosol composition that is composed of an oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion including two phases, i.e., an inner phase and an aqueous phase. The inner phase is composed of an oily phase containing a propellant dissolved therein, and the aqueous phase has poor compatibility or<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> miscibility with the propellant. However, cleansing agents using a foamable aerosol composition composed of an oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion are not appropriate as detergents for oily cosmetics, because they contain an aqueous phase as a continuous phase and thereby have poor miscibility with and poor detergency for oily cosmetics. Known foamable cleansing agents having improved detergency for oily cosmetics include water-in-oil (W/O) compositions for oily foamable aerosols, which contain a polyoxyethylene-added nonionic surfactant, an alkyl phosphate derivative, and a polyglycerol fatty acid ester, respectively (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (JP-A) No.<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004075589A"><text> 2004-75589</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2003035015A"><text>PCT International Publication Number WO 2003/035015</text></patcit>; and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (JP-A) No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2006347896A"><text>2006-347896</text></patcit>). These water-in-oil (W/O) compositions for oily foamable aerosols, however, often suffer from phase transition from a water-in-oil (W/O) phase to an oil-in-water (O/W) phase upon cleansing of cosmetics and are difficult to use when used under wet conditions. Additionally, they have still insufficient detergency. In the European Patent Application <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP2103298A"><text>EP 2103298</text></patcit>, lamellar liquid crystal compositions have been described containing combinations of polyglycerol monoether and liquid paraffin. Beside of cleansing agents, multi-layered cosmetic compositions are known, containing non-ionic and ionic detergents in a range of 0.02 to 4 % by mass of based on the total amount of the composition (<patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2005336089A"><text>JP-A No. 2005-336089</text></patcit>). Specifically, there has not yet been known a detergent composition which is useable as a foamable cleansing agent kind to the skin, exhibits superior detergency for oily cosmetics, and is usable even under wet conditions.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><p id="p0004" num="0004">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a detergent composition which is usable as a foamable cleansing agent kind to the skin, exhibits superior detergency for oily cosmetics, and is usable even under wet conditions.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">After intensive investigations, the present inventors have found that a detergent composition containing a polyglycerol monoalkyl ether in a specific amount, as well as water, a fat or oil, and a polyol can stably form fine and smooth foams and, if used as a cleansing agent for oily cosmetics, can sufficiently remove the oily cosmetics without placing a burden on the skin. They have also found that the detergent composition has superior solubility or miscibility both with an aqueous phase and with an oily phase, can thereby maintain a single-phase state within a wide range even where an aqueous phase and an oily phase are present as a mixture, can exhibit superior detergency even under wet conditions, and has good wash-up property. The present invention has been made based on these findings and further investigations.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Specifically, according to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a detergent composition containing a polyglycerol monoalkyl ether, water, a fat or oil, and a polyol, in which the polyglycerol monoalkyl ether is present at a content of 1 to 50 percent by weight based on the total amount of the composition.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The water is preferably present in the composition at a content of 1 to 50 percent by weight based on the total amount of the composition.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a cleansing cosmetic which includes the detergent composition.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">When the detergent composition according to the present invention is charged with a propellant into a tightly sealed container while being pressurized, a press of the spray button allows a mixture of the detergent composition and the propellant to be discharged at a single blow, and the propellant abruptly expands due to pressure reduction to thereby allow the detergent composition to form very fine foams.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The detergent composition according to the present invention contains a polyglycerol monoalkyl ether in a specific amount, as well as water, a fat or oil, and a polyol and can thereby stably form fine foams. The detergent composition, if used as a cleansing agent for oily cosmetics, can sufficiently remove the oily cosmetics without placing a burden on the skin, and shows good wash-up property. Additionally, the detergent composition has superior miscibility both with an aqueous phase and with an oily phase, can thereby maintain a single-phase state within a wide range even where an aqueous phase and an oily phase are present as a mixture, and can exhibit superior<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> detergency even under wet conditions.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will be understood more fully from the following description of the preferred embodiments.</p><heading id="h0005">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">A detergent composition according to an embodiment of the present invention contains a polyglycerol monoalkyl ether, water, a fat or oil, and a polyol, in which the polyglycerol monoalkyl ether is present at 1 to 50 percent by weight based on the total amount of the composition.</p><heading id="h0006">[Polyglycerol Monoalkyl Ether]</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">The polyglycerol monoalkyl ether is represented by following Formula (1):<br/>
