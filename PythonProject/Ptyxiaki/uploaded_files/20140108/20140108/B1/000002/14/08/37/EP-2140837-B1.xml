Such terms have well-understood meanings in both the study of anatomy and the field of orthopaedics. Use of such anatomical reference terms in the specification and claims is intended to be consistent with their well-understood meanings unless noted otherwise.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Referring to the drawings, <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> show a patella component 10 of a knee prosthesis. The patella component 10 includes a posterior bearing surface 12 configured to articulate with the natural or prosthetic condyles of the femur. As used herein, unless noted otherwise, the terms "femur" or "femoral" are intended to mean both natural and prosthetic features of a femur. As such, the term "femoral condyles" is intended to cover both natural femoral condyles and prosthetic femoral condyles. The patella component 10 is embodied as a monolithic polymer body constructed with a material that allows for smooth articulation between the patella component 10 and the femur. One such polymeric material is polyethylene such as ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE).</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The patella component 10 also includes a flat anterior surface 14 having a number of fixation members, such as pegs 16, extending away from it. The pegs 16 are configured to be implanted into a surgically prepared posterior surface of the patient's natural patella (not shown). In such a way, the posterior bearing surface 12 of the patella component 10 faces toward the femur thereby allowing the posterior bearing surface 12 to articulate with the femoral condyles during flexion and extension of the patient's knee.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The posterior bearing surface 12 has a curved peak surface 18. The curved peak surface 18 defines the posterior-most surface of the patella component 10. Specifically, a point on the curved peak surface 18 defines the posterior-most point 20 of the patella component 10. The curved peak surface 18 extends anteriorly from the posterior-most point 20 in the general direction toward the anterior surface 14. In particular, as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, the curved peak surface 18 transitions to a flat inferior surface 22 that extends inferiorly away from the curved peak surface 18. The flat inferior surface 22 in turn<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> transitions to a rounded inferior edge surface 24 that extends inferiorly away from the flat inferior surface 22 in the direction toward the anterior surface 14 of the patella component 10. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, the inferior edge surface 24 is embodied as a curved corner surface 26 that transitions from the flat inferior surface 22 to the anterior surface 14 of the patella component 10.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As also shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, the curved peak surface 18 transitions to a flat superior surface 28 that extends superiorly away from the curved peak surface 18. The flat superior surface 28 in turn transitions to a rounded superior edge surface 30 that extends superiorly away from the flat superior surface 28 in the direction toward the anterior surface 14 of the patella component 10. The rounded superior edge 30 includes a curved corner surface 32 that transitions to the flat superior surface 28 and a flat surface 34 that transitions the curved corner surface 32 to the anterior surface 14 of the patella component 10.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>, the curved peak surface 18 transitions to a flat medial surface 36 that extends medially away from the curved peak surface 18. The flat medial surface 36 transitions to a rounded medial edge surface 38 that extends medially away from the flat medial surface 36 in the direction toward the anterior surface 14 of the patella component 10. Similarly, a flat lateral surface 40 extends laterally away from the curved peak surface 18. The flat lateral surface 40 transitions to a rounded lateral edge surface 42 that extends laterally away from the flat lateral surface 40 in the direction toward the anterior surface 14 of the patella component 10.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">3</figref>, the curved peak surface 18 of the patella component 10 is offset in the superior direction relative to conventional dome-shaped patella components in which the tip of curved peak surface (i.e., the posterior-most point) is positioned in the centre of the component. Specifically, as can best be seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, the posterior-most point 20 of the posterior bearing surface 12 is positioned superiorly of the centre of the superior/inferior width of the patella component 10. This is demonstrated geometrically in the superior/inferior cross sectional view of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> where a pair of imaginary lines extend through the patella component 10 in the anterior/posterior direction. Specifically, an imaginary line 44 extends orthogonally from the anterior surface 14 of the patella component 10 through the posterior-most point 20 of the patella component 10, whereas another imaginary line 46 extends orthogonally from the anterior surface 14 of the patella component 10 through the midpoint 48 of the superior/inferior width of the anterior<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> surface 14 of the patella component 10. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, the imaginary line 44 extending through the posterior-most point 20 is parallel to the imaginary line 46 extending through the midpoint 48, but is spaced apart from it in the superior direction.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, offsetting the curved peak surface 18 of the patella component 10 in the superior direction in such a manner results in a thickened superior edge relative to conventional dome-shaped patella components in which the tip of the curved peak surface (i.e., the posterior-most point) is positioned in the centre of the component. Specifically, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the superior edge of the patella component 10 is thicker than its inferior, medial, and lateral edges. Because the edges of the patella component 10 are rounded, such a feature can be demonstrated geometrically in a number of different manners. One way to do so is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> and described below. However, it should be appreciated that the relative thickness of each of the component's edges may be demonstrated geometrically in other ways. As shown herein, the tangent point of the edge's rounded corner serves as a common point of reference for determining the thickness of each edge of the patella component 10. Specifically, an imaginary line 50 extends along the flat inferior surface 22 and defines a tangent point 52 at the transition of the flat inferior surface 22 and the rounded inferior edge surface 24. Another imaginary line 54 extends along the flat superior surface 28 and defines a second tangent point 56 at the transition of the flat superior surface 28 and the rounded superior edge surface 30. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, an imaginary line segment 58 extends orthogonally from the anterior surface 14 of the patella component 10 to the tangent point 52, whereas another imaginary line segment 60 extends orthogonally from the anterior surface 14 of the patella component 10 to the tangent point 56. Because the superior edge of the patella component 10 is thicker than its inferior edge, the imaginary line segment 60 is longer than the imaginary line segment 58.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref>, an imaginary line 62 extends along the flat medial surface 36 and defines a tangent point 64 at the transition of the flat medial surface 36 and the rounded medial edge surface 38. Another imaginary line 66 extends along the flat lateral surface 40 and defines a tangent point 68 at the transition of the flat lateral surface 40 and the rounded lateral edge surface 42. An imaginary line segment 70 extends orthogonally from the anterior surface 14 of the patella component 10 to the tangent point 64, whereas an imaginary line segment 72 extends orthogonally from the anterior surface 14 of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> patella component 10 to the tangent point 68. Because the medial and lateral edges are similar in size, the imaginary line segment 70 is equal in length to the imaginary line segment 72.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, the superior edge is the thickest edge of the patella component 10. As such, the imaginary line segment 60 is longer than each of the imaginary line segment 58, the imaginary line segment 70, and the imaginary line segment 72. Moreover, because the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> is geometrically constructed by offsetting the curved peak surface 18 of the patella component 10 in the superior direction relative to conventional dome-shaped patella components in which the tip of curved peak surface (i.e., the posterior-most point) is positioned in the centre of the component, the inferior edge is similar in size to the medial and lateral edges of the component 10. In other words, the imaginary line segment 58 is equal in length each of the imaginary line segment 70 and the imaginary line segment 72. It should be appreciated, however, that such need not be the case. For example, it is contemplated that the inferior edge could be thinner than the medial and lateral edges. Moreover, as will be discussed below in greater detail, the inferior edge could be thicker than the medial and lateral edges.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, the posterior bearing surface 12 extends away from the posterior-most point 20 of the curved peak surface 18 at a similar angle in all directions. This is shown geometrically in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> in the angles created by the intersection of the imaginary lines extending along the flat surfaces of the posterior bearing surface 12. Specifically, the imaginary line 50 that extends along the flat inferior surface 22 intersects the imaginary line 54 that extends along the flat superior surface 28 to define an angle of intersection (α), whereas, the imaginary line 62 that extends along the flat medial surface 36 intersects the imaginary line 66 that extends along the flat lateral surface 40 to define an angle of intersection (β). In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, the angle of intersection (α) is equal to the angle of intersection (β). In other words, the posterior bearing surface 12 extends away from the posterior-most point 20 of the curved peak surface 18 at the same angle in the superior/inferior direction as it does in the medial/lateral direction. Specifically, in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, the angles of intersection (α, β) are both approximately 1300<sub>.</sub> In such an arrangement (i.e., one in which the posterior bearing surface 12 extends away from the curved peak surface 18 at a common angle in each direction), the thickened superior edge of the patella component 10<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> is created, conceptually, by the "shortening" of the superior side of the component as a result of having an offset peak.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Another embodiment of a patella component 110 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">FIGS. 5 to 8</figref>. The patella component 110 shares many similarities with the patella component 10.

Each of such embodiments includes a superior edge which has been thickened relative to the design of conventional dome-shaped patella components in which the superior edge shares a common size with the component's remaining edges. Certain of the embodiments of the patella components described herein also include inferior edges that are thicker than the medial and lateral edges of the component. Certain of the embodiments of the patella components described herein also include a posterior bearing surface in which the curved peak surface thereof is offset in the superior direction relative to conventional dome-shaped patella components. It should be appreciated that the dimensional magnitude of such features may be varied to fit the needs of a given design of a patella component. In particular, a given design of a patella component is typically made commercially available in a variety of different sizes, particularly in a variety of different lengths and widths. This is done to accommodate the many variations in patient size and anatomy across a population. As such, the dimensions of a given design of the patella components 10, 110, 210, including the thickness of a given edge or the magnitude of the offset of the curved peak surface, may also be varied to accommodate such variations in patient size and anatomy across a population.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Features of the various embodiments described above may also be combined as needed to fit the design of a given patella component. For example, patella components having medial and lateral edges with differing thicknesses may be utilized. As a further example, a patella component having a centred curved peak surface (e.g., in a similar manner to the patella component 210) may be embodied with a superior edge that is thicker than its inferior edge (e.g., in a similar manner to the patella components 10, 110).</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Each of the patella components described herein includes a superior edge which has been thickened relative to the design of conventional dome-shaped patella components in which the superior edge shares a common size with the component's remaining edges. Unexpectedly, such a design helps resist the tendency of the patella component to extend during deep flexion of the knee. Moreover, such a design has also unexpectedly contributed to a reduction in polymer deformation on the superior edge of the patella component.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56986862" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Patellakomponente (10) mit (i) einer posterioren Lagerfläche (12), die konfiguriert ist, um mit den Femurkondylen eines Femurs gelenkig verbunden zu sein, und (ii) einer anterioren Fläche (14) mit einer Anzahl von Stiften (16), die sich davon nach außen erstrecken,<br/>
