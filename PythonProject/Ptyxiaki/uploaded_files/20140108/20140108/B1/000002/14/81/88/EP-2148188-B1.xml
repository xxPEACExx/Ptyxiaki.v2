In particular the present invention relates to a device for the parallel imaging of fluorescence intensities of a plurality of detection sites and in this connection in particular the excitation and imaging optics for the fluorescence detection of fluorescence signals.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of DNA analysis. In particular the present invention relates to a device for the parallel imaging of fluorescence intensities of a plurality of detection sites and in this connection in particular the excitation and imaging optics for the fluorescence detection of fluorescence signals.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A person skilled in the art is familiar with various applications of fluorescence methods and fluorescence techniques for analysing biological samples. In the case of electrophoretic methods, proteins or DNA are labelled with a fluorescent probe in order to visualize their electrophoretic bands in gels or columns. Furthermore, most of the previous applications of biochips are based on a fluorescence reading in which the specific binding of a fluorescently labelled target molecule to a probe molecule which is immobilized on a solid support is monitored. Applications of DNA analysis in the liquid phase include fluorescent hybridization probes such as the dye SybrGreenl which binds to double-stranded DNA or FRET probes (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) which utilize two fluorescent probes and energy transfer. One very important application for fluorescence methods in the liquid phase is the determination of the quantity of PCR products in real time, the so-called real time PCR.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a method for amplifying or multiplying amounts of double-stranded DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). In a PCR apparatus a block for thermal cycling has one or more holding devices with sample vessels (wells) which contain a mixture of components for a reaction which, starting with an initial amount of DNA, are used to obtain more DNA. The starting components comprise in an aqueous solution a "seeding amount" of DNA, certain primary DNA, DNA elements, enzymes and other chemicals. The temperature of<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the block is cycled between a low extension phase of the PCR reaction of about 60°C in which all DNA strands are recombined into double strands, and a higher denaturing phase of about 95°C in which the DNA is denatured or separated into single strands. Such a temperature program essentially doubles the DNA in each cycle which enables substantial amounts of DNA to be replicated from a small initial amount. The quantitative determination of the DNA is carried out using fluorescence measurements, also in real time.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In all these cases an optical instrument, i.e. an excitation and reading device for fluorescence, is required which provides light of a certain wavelength in order to excite the fluorescent marker of the assay and which is able to detect the fluorescence light from the marker which is emitted at a somewhat different wavelength. A major problem of all such fluorescence measuring devices is the enormous intensity of the excitation light in comparison to the fluorescence light which is emitted by the dye and one therefore has to ensure that the excitation beam does not strike the detector in order to be able to exactly monitor the fluorescence signals. In other words: The beam path (light path) of the excitation light must at least partially differ from the beam path (light path) of the fluorescent light. The following measures are commonly employed for this purpose: a) A spectral separation by excitation and emission filters the spectra of which do not significantly overlap. b) The use of a vertical illumination (or also epi-illumination) or of a side illumination. In these cases no beam of the illumination light points in a direction that can be directly detected (dark field). One requires at least one reflection, elastic scattering or fluorescence (inelastic scattering). Measure b) is usually used as a support for measure a) because the filter blocking according to measure a) is not perfect.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is quite simple to implement the principle of fluorescence if only one fluorescent probe in the liquid phase of for example a capillary has to be monitored. In this case a source of white light together with a set of dichroitic mirrors and filters is for example sufficient to fulfil the requirements. However, when more than one fluorescent marker is present in the sample, it is necessary to monitor a lateral distribution of the positions on a solid support or the fluorescence of a microtitre plate (except when different dyes are present and detected in a single sample vessel) and the demands on the optical instrument for the fluorescence measurement are more difficult to fulfil.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Basically there are two different strategies for exciting and monitoring the fluorescence of a lateral distribution of detection sites. The first strategy is to scan the lateral distribution of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> detection sites in which the individual detection sites are each individually analysed in succession. The second strategy is to simultaneously illuminate the entire distribution of detection sites and to image the corresponding fluorescence on a plurality of optical sensors e.g. a CCD chip. The scanning strategy has the obvious disadvantage that either the carrier has to be moved in two dimensions (see e.g. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO03069391A"><text>WO 03/069391</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="DE10200499"><text>DE 102 00 499</text></patcit>), the detector has to be moved relative to the carrier (<patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US2002159057A"><text>US 2002/159057</text></patcit>), the detector has to be moved in one dimension and the carrier has to be moved in the other dimension or the optical system must have a one-dimensional or two-dimensional scanning means i.e. galvo mirrors. On the other hand, the main difficulty of the second strategy of illuminating the entire carrier simultaneously is to ensure a uniform illumination over the entire distribution of detection sites.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">An alternative to the uniform illumination over the entire distribution of detection sites is to utilize an arrangement of light sources where each detection site is illuminated by its own light source. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="DE10131687"><text>DE 101 31 687</text></patcit> describes the strategy for evaluating PCR in a thermocycler with a plurality of wells using a beam splitter and an arrangement of LEDs for illumination. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="DE10155142"><text>DE 101 55 142</text></patcit> describes the dark field monitoring of fluorescence signals where the microarray is also illuminated by an arrangement of LEDs but no beam splitter is required in this embodiment.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">With regard to the requirement of at least partially separating the beam path of the excitation beam and of the fluorescent light (of the detected fluorescence signals), there are again two different alternatives. The first alternative is the so-called epi-illumination in which beam splitters are used and the excitation beam and the fluorescence light share at least a part of the optical system. The second alternative is to use inclined illumination. In this case the excitation beam is arranged in such a manner that it has a certain angle to the normal of the carrier surface and the corresponding reflection of the excitation beam is outside of the angle of aperture of the detection system (e.g. <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US20020005493A1"><text>US 2002/0005493 A1</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="EP1275954A2"><text>EP 1 275 954 A2</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US20030011772A1"><text>US 2003/0011772 Al </text></patcit>describes an optical device for simultaneously observing a plurality of fluorescent dyes in a probe using a beam splitter. <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="DE19748211A1"><text>DE 197 48 211 A1</text></patcit> discloses a system for simultaneously monitoring the fluorescence signals which are generated in the wells of a microtitre plate using a beam splitter, a field lens and an arrangement of lenses which focus the light onto each well. The detection is carried out by forming an image of the light on an arrangement of photodiodes or on a CCD chip. The fluorescence light which is collected in this embodiment of the system is determined by the amount of dyes which are excited by the light cone of the focussing lens and therefore depends on the fill level of the well.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="WO9960381A"><text>WO 99/60381</text></patcit> describes a device for simultaneously monitoring PCR reactions in a plurality of wells in a block whose temperature is controlled in cycles. The optical components of this device again comprise a beam splitter, a field lens, an arrangement of lenses for the wells which focus the individual light beams into each well, and a detection means which focuses the emitted light onto for example a CCD detector. Since an arrangement of lenses for the wells is required, the size and lateral density of the individual detection sites is limited. The light yield of this arrangement is low and there is considerable crosstalk between the individual detected wells i.e. the channel separation is low.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="JP2002014044B"><text>JP 2002014044</text></patcit> describes a fluorometric device for monitoring fluorescence which is generated in a plurality of wells.

Furthermore, according to the prior art high performance lamps with a high illumination density are used e.g. Xenon arc lamps in order to compensate for the previously low light yield. However, such high performance lamps do not only have a high thermal dissipation loss which requires an elaborate heat removal or cooling but also have a relatively short lifetime which is usually of the order of magnitude of about 500 hours. Accordingly a frequent lamp replacement is required in the prior art. If the lamp even fails during an ongoing measurement e.g. a real-time PCR, the entire measurement of a certain sample may even be lost. The signal gain and the sensitivity improvement by the invention avoids these problems and also creates the possibility of using weaker and thus more long-lasting lamps and also alternative light sources e.g. LEDs with a longer lifetime and higher reliability. Hence, an important advantage of the invention is the elongation of the lifetime of the light source that is used.

If the optical instrument 1 should be able to simultaneously image the fluorescence signals 7 from an arrangement of the plurality of individual detection sites 2 e.g. the wells of a microtitre plate or the spots of a microarray, it must be ensured that the excitation of the dyes with the excitation light 9 and the imaging of the fluorescence signals 7 in the centre of the arrangement and at the borders of the arrangement are comparable. Moreover, even if the requirement of a homogeneous intensity distribution across the light beam is fulfilled, the alignment of the planar support 4 is still important to ensure that the support 4 as a whole is in the focal plane of the imaging optics and also of the excitation optics. In addition some special problems arise when the support 4 or the plurality of individual detection sites 2 detected by the optical instrument 1 has a depth as in the case of the wells of microtitre plates.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">A solution for the above-mentioned problems is to use telecentric optics. In a telecentric optical system the main beams which emanate from the individual object points are quasi-parallel. Actually the main beams would even be strictly parallel if there were no optical aberrations. The latter is then referred to as telecentricity error. Each object point of course does not only see the main beam which comes from the centre of the pupil but also edge beams which come from the edge of the pupil and also beams which are between the edge beam and main beam. Hence, each object point is assigned to a bundle of rays that lies within a cone. The axis of this cone is the main beam. The cone ideally has a small angle of aperture. In fact there are even two cones namely one for the illumination and one for the detection. As a consequence of the telecentric optical systems all object points within a finite field of vision are observed with approximately the same perspective and the same intensity, in other words the telecentric optical systems has a large depth of focus and a uniform excitation or imaging profile.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The properties of an optical system can be characterized by its numerical aperture (NA) which in general should be as large as possible to achieve a high sensitivity and a good imaging resolution: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mi>NA</mi><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">sin θ</mi></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="34" he="14" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> wherein n is the refractive index of the medium and θ is the aperture angle.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Several aspects have to be taken into consideration when designing an optical instrument 1 for telecentric excitation of a lateral distribution of detection sites 2 and the telecentric imaging of fluorescence signals 7 from the detection sites 2.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">On the one hand, the NA values should be as large as possible because a small NA value for the imaging optics corresponds to a poor imaging resolution and a small NA value for the excitation optics corresponds to a waste of illumination power for the excitation. On the other hand, minimizing the NA value can increase the depth of focus of the telecentric optics which can be important when the arrangement of individual detection sites 2 has a certain depth as in the case of microtitre plates. Moreover, a small NA value is also preferred from a commercial point of view because an optical system with a small aperture is generally cheaper to manufacture.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">If it is intended to use the telecentric optical instrument 1 for a whole frequency range, the optics should also be achromatic. For the fluorescence imaging itself even more requirements have to be addressed since the fluorescence imaging must have the right scaling for the correct reproduction of the lateral distribution of detection sites 2 on the optical sensor 6. In addition imaging errors such as spherical or chromatic aberration, coma, astigmatism or curvature of field have to be taken into consideration.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">There are several ways to create telecentric optics. In general a telecentric optical system is in the form of a multielement lens where several lenses are arranged successively in the beam path. A telecentric optical system can be designed to be telecentric in the object plane or telecentric in the image plane or telecentric in both planes, a so-called doubly telecentric optical system. Moreover, it is possible to illuminate an object with telecentric light and/or to detect an object in a telecentric manner. In general it is sufficient to provide an optical system with telecentricity in the object plane because this already guarantees a homogeneous illumination of the whole object laterally as well as in the third dimension and the accurate collection of light irradiated from the object.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Within the scope of this invention the excitation of the plurality of individual detection sites 2 as well as the imaging of the fluorescence signals 7 emitted by the plurality of individual detection sites 2 takes place in a telecentric manner.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0060" num="0060">A central part of all telecentric optics is the field lens 8. This lens is closest to the object and determines the field of vision of the instrument 1. Therefore, the diameter of this lens usually increases when the arrangement of a plurality of individual detection sites 2 is distributed over a large area. Field lenses 8 exist as singlets (one single lens) or as achromats comprising e.g. two lenses glued together. A special field lens 8 that can also be used for this invention is a Fresnel lens. A Fresnel lens has a special complex curvature with multiple tapered regions on at least one optically active surface that provides the same telecentric properties as a field lens 8. In most cases Fresnel lenses have only one surface with multiple tapered regions which is supported by a planar surface perpendicular to the optical axis and therefore they are thinner compared to normal field lenses. So-called free-form lenses can also be used. In practice field lenses are often aspherical in order to minimize the telecentricity error. Normally these aspheres are, however, rotationally symmetrical. The latter is then not a free-form surface.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Especially in the case of wells of a microtitre plate which have a certain depth, a large angle of incidence has the effect that only a part of the inner region of the well is illuminated.

This means that the fluorescence signals 7 which are generated on the arrangement of a plurality of individual detection sites 2 are imaged onto an optical sensor 6 by a telecentric imaging optical system comprising a field lens 8 and an imaging lens arrangement 11. In other embodiments of the invention the telecentric imaging optical system additionally comprises for example a light beam folding unit and/or special imaging filter systems 13.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">The telecentric imaging optical system should be optimized to the size of the optical sensor 6 and the spatial dimensions of the arrangement of a plurality of individual detection sites 2.

A large number of lenses is advantageous for the imaging lens arrangement 11 because, in comparison to the excitation optical system, even higher requirements have to be taken into consideration for the imaging optics. The fluorescence image must have the right scale for the correct reproduction of the lateral distribution of detection sites 2 on the optical sensor 6. In addition imaging errors such<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> as spherical or chromatic aberration, coma, astigmatism, special errors or curvature of field have to be taken into consideration. Due to the imaging of the fluorescence signals 7 onto the optical sensor 6, the fluorescence imaging is carried out with an imaging optical system which is only telecentric on the object side of the field lens 8. The imaging lens arrangement 11 can be coupled to the optical sensor 6 to form an imaging unit 15.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">An also preferred embodiment of the optical instrument 1 according to the invention is an optical instrument wherein the individual detection sites 2 of the arrangement are spots on a planar support 4 and the fluorescent dyes are applied to these spots.

In a specific embodiment such an arrangement is a DNA arrangement where laterally restricted areas are functionalized with DNA probes which have different sequences. In this case the optical instrument 1 according to the invention can monitor hybridization events with samples which contain nucleic acid if for example the complementary DNA strand is labelled with a fluorescent dye.

The excitation light beam 9 itself has an angle of incidence to the microtitre plate of 2° and an intensity fluctuation over the object field (88 mm x 122 mm) of less than 10%.

The field lens array elements 20 of the field lens array 19 generate illumination pupils for the excitation light 9 and detection pupils for the fluorescence signals 7.

The tilting is selected such that the bundles of rays for the fluorescence excitation and fluorescence detection do not penetrate the field plane (object plane, at the detection sites 2) (see also <figref idrefs="f0007">figure 10</figref>) in order to achieve a separation between the excitation light 9 and fluorescence signals 7.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">Of course it is also possible to make a converse arrangement such that the fluorescence excitation is tilted with respect to the optical axis and the fluorescence detection takes place at an angle to the optical axis, or the fluorescence excitation as well as the fluorescence detection can be carried out at a different angle to the optical axis.

The axial diaphragm opening 25 (right) allows the fluorescence signals 7 to pass for fluorescence detection. Also the diaphragm opening 24 allows the detection light to pass because the fluorescence source irradiates in an isotropic manner.

At the position of the heating cover 16 (or of the detection sites 2) these beam directions again look different. In particular they are then field-dependent (or also location-dependent).

Furthermore, it may be expedient in some embodiments when the focal length of the field lens array elements 20 is so small that the diaphragm images of neighbouring channels (neighbouring detection sites 2) do not overlap in order to suppress interfering light.

Since these front lenses (field lens array elements 20) are directly situated in the field plane of the illumination and detection optics of the optical instrument 1, one refers to these quite generally as field lenses and in this case as field lens array elements 20. In other words near-field lenses (i.e. near to the field hence near to the object or image) are referred to as field lenses and near-pupil lenses are referred to as pupil lenses. A field plane is a plane which is illuminated or imaged i.e. an object, an image or an intermediate image. Pupils are diaphragms or images of diaphragms. Field lenses form an image of pupils and pupil lenses form images of fields. The field lens array 19 is near to the field and the pupil lens array 21 and the diaphragm array 23 are near to the pupils.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">The field lens array elements 20 do not contribute significantly to the total refractive power of the objective array 18 due to their position near to the field and their comparably large focal length i.e. they do not change the position and size of the image or only to an insignificant extent. Their central function is rather to spatially separate the optical channels i.e. they form pupils for the beam path by means of which the pupil position is adjusted and the angle of the rays is limited. The field lens array elements 20 preferably provide a telecentric optical system (in <figref idrefs="f0008">figure 11</figref> top: telecentric, bottom: not telecentric as elucidated above) on the exit side (at the observation position, on the side of the detection sites 2) i.e. the image of the diaphragms is at infinity. A pupil is an image of an aperture diaphragm. In an optical system there are entrance<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> pupils and exit pupils. If their images are at infinity, the optical system is denoted telecentric on the entry and exit side. Each field lens array element 20 produces in its diaphragm plane an outer-axial image of the diaphragm of the illumination system and an axial image of the diaphragm of the detection system. These images are separated by channels.</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">Almost the entire refractive power of a lens pair of the objective array 18 is concentrated in each case in the rear lens (pupil lens array element 22). Since they are located near to the pupil, one also refers to them quite generally as pupil lenses or in this case as a pupil lens array element 22. The pupil lens array elements 22 form an image of the edges of the field lens array elements 20 which is true to shape on the lower edges of the holes 17 of the heating cover 16. The holes 17 in the heating cover 16 thus act as an array of field diaphragms.</p><p id="p0118" num="0118">In each case a diaphragm array element (diaphragm opening, diaphragm) is placed in the focal diaphragm plane of the field lens array elements 20 and the diaphragm array elements mask the images of the diaphragm of the illumination system and the images of the diaphragm of the detection system. The entirety of these diaphragm array elements form a diaphragm array 23. "Masking" in this sense means that the diaphragm array 23 forms a mask or screen where each diaphragm array element has one or more diaphragm openings, is allocated in each case a field lens array element 20 and a pupil lens array element 23 and forms a mask for the beam path through the respective field lens array element 20 and pupil lens array element 23 (i.e. for each "channel" of the objective array 18). This masking is accurate to shape in the embodiment example of <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008 f0009">figures 2 to 12</figref> i.e. the shapes of the two openings of the diaphragm array elements correspond to the shapes of the images of the diaphragms of the excitation lens arrangement 10 and of the imaging lens arrangement 11. In other embodiments the shape of the diaphragm array elements can also correspond to the shape of the field lens array elements 20 and/or the pupil lens array elements 23 and/or the detection sites 2 (holes 17 in the heating cover 16).</p><p id="p0119" num="0119">In other embodiment examples the masking can also be additionally true to size. In this case the size of the diaphragm array elements for example corresponds to the size of the illumination pupils of the excitation light 9 and/or to that of the detection pupils of the fluorescence signals 7 and /or the pupils of the detection sites 2 (holes 17 in the heating cover 16).</p><p id="p0120" num="0120">However, the masking does not necessarily have to be true to shape and/or true to size. For example the diaphragm openings (diaphragm array elements) may also not be circular. Thus,<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> for example the two diaphragm images (image of the diaphragm of the illumination system (illumination pupil of the excitation light 9) and image of the diaphragm of the detection system (detection pupil of the fluorescence signals 7) can for example also be masked per channel by a common, circumscribed rectangle. This reduces the demand on the manufacturing accuracy and does not significantly impair the channel cross-talk.</p><p id="p0121" num="0121">Thus, in such an embodiment the objective array 18 has a diaphragm array 23 which forms a mask for the illumination pupils of the excitation light 9 and the detection pupils of the fluorescence signals 7. In this case the diaphragm array 23 is located between the field lens array 19 and the pupil lens array 21 in the embodiment example shown. The diaphragm array 23 could, however, also be located between the pupil lens array 21 and the arrangement of a plurality of individual detection sites 2 (heating cover 16) and in this case preferably near to the pupil lens array 21.</p><p id="p0122" num="0122"><figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 12</figref> shows an example of a top-view of such a diaphragm array 23 in which each diaphragm array element is formed from a pair of diaphragm openings 24, 25. The diaphragm array 23 that is shown is thus provided with 96 pairs of diaphragm openings 24, 25 each of which are allocated to one of the 96 detection sites 2. The diaphragm opening pairs are arranged such that in each case a first diaphragm opening 24 of a diaphragm opening pair allows the excitation light 9 for a detection site 2 to pass through and a second diaphragm opening 25 of the diaphragm opening pair allows the fluorescence signals 7 from the detection site 2 to pass through. The course of the imaginary lines which delimit the squares elucidated above with an edge length corresponding to the hole spacing d and an area AQ is also shown for illustration. In real diaphragm arrays 23 these lines are usually not present.</p><p id="p0123" num="0123">The essential function of the diaphragm array 23 is to suppress cross-talk between the various channels of the objective array 18. The cross-talk can be caused by internal reflections (directed interfering light) or undirected diffused scattered light in the objective array 18 and especially in the pupil lens array 21. The total area of the holes 24, 25 in the diaphragm array 23 is apparently very much smaller than the total area of the diaphragm array 23. This results in a very effective separation of useful light and interfering light which is indeed already very near to the site at which the fluorescence signals 7 are formed i.e. the detection sites 2 and thus at an early point in the detection beam path which is very advantageous for the optical detection. The ratio of these areas can in turn be interpreted as a filling factor. The effectiveness of the<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> diaphragm array 23 with regard to suppressing cross-talk increases with a decreasing filling factor.</p><p id="p0124" num="0124">Essential features of the invention and advantageous further developments can be briefly summarized as follows: The objective array 18 consists of a field lens array 19 and a pupil lens array 21 as well as of an additional diaphragm array 23. The field lens array 19 generates illumination pupils and detection pupils in each case corresponding to the number of detection sites 2 (in the example 96 of each). The diaphragm array 23 masks these pupils (in the example 192) to prevent local cross-talk. The pupil lens array 21 forms an image of the field lens array 19 on the detection sites 2 (the multiwell plate). With regard to illumination the objective array 18 increases the filling factor (packing density) of the detection sites 2 (wells). With regard to detection the objective array 18 increases the numerical aperture. The geometry results in a nominal signal gain (here by a factor of 9).</p><p id="p0125" num="0125">The field lens array elements 20 of the field lens array 19 do not necessarily have to be designed with a round border. In one preferred embodiment the field lens array elements 20 are quadratic. <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 13</figref> shows an image of a quadratic field lens array element 20 in a circular hole 17 of the heating cover 16. With a quadratic border with an edge length which corresponds to the hole spacing d in the heating cover 16 (in this case 9 mm) one can join all field lens array elements 20 to one another without gaps i.e. without interspaces between the field lens array elements 20 that are unused for the optical imaging.
