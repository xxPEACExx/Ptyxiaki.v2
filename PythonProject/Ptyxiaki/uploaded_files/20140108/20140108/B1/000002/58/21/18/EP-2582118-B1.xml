The server includes an interacting module 310, a sharing setting module 320, an uploading module 330, a storage module 340, an address list module 350, and a message sending module 360.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The interacting module 310 includes a re-sharing requesting unit 311, a re-sharing indicating unit 312, a sharing cancellation requesting unit 313, and a displaying unit 314. The sharing setting module 320 includes a re-sharing setting unit 321, a re-sharing unit 322, and a sharing cancellation unit 323.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The re-sharing requesting unit 311 of the interacting module 310 is adapted to send a re-sharing setting request for allowing re-sharing after receiving a re-sharing setting instruction for information from a sharing provider. In this embodiment, the re-sharing requesting unit 311 specifically selects a designated sharing receiver from a contact list provided by the address list module 350 after receiving the re-sharing setting instruction for information from the sharing provider, and then sends the re-sharing setting request for allowing re-sharing to allow the designated sharing receiver to re-share the target shared information.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The re-sharing setting unit 321 of the sharing setting module 320 is adapted to receive the re-sharing setting request for allowing re-sharing from the re-sharing requesting unit 311, and set target shared information to a re-sharing state in which a sharing receiver is allowed to re-share the information. Specifically, the sharing provider has already shared the information for the first time (initial sharing), and still needs to set the re-sharing authority on the shared information for others. For example, A shares information with B, and meanwhile sets the sharing authority on the information, so that when obtaining the information, B not only acquires the information, but is also granted the authority to re-share<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the information, for example, share with C.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The address list module 350 is adapted to provide contact information. In particular, the address list module 350 is adapted to provide the re-sharing requesting unit 311 with the contact information after the re-sharing requesting unit 311 receives the re-sharing setting instruction for information from the sharing provider, so that the re-sharing requesting unit 311 is enabled to add information of allowing the contact to re-share the target shared information in the re-sharing setting request for allowing re-sharing, that is, to generate the re-sharing setting request for the designated sharing receiver. To put it briefly, the address list module 350 is an online address list of the user, and can be shared with other systems. The address list records all the contacts, and the user can share the information with all the contacts stored in the address list module 350.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The message sending module 360 is adapted to send a sharing event notifying message to the designated sharing receiver after the re-sharing setting unit 321 sets the target shared information to a re-sharing state in which the sharing receiver is allowed to re-share the information. In this embodiment, the message sending module 360 is connected to a wired or wireless network, and sends the sharing event notifying message, for example, a short message, a multimedia message, or an instant message to the designated sharing receiver through the wired or wireless network.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The displaying unit 314 of the interacting module 310 is adapted to display information for the user. In particular, the displaying unit 314 is adapted to display a system interface, a login interface, and the like, and is also capable of automatically displaying information owned by a user after the user logs in to the system.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The uploading module 330 is adapted to process a data uploading request from the user, and perform necessary checks, for example, provide an interface for the user to select an information object, limit a file size, and the like together with the displaying unit 314 of the interacting module 310 so as to complete a content uploading operation. Moreover, when the user uploads information, the uploading module 330 transmits attribute data of the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> information to the re-sharing setting unit 321 of the sharing setting module 320, and thus the sharing setting module 320 is enabled to perform sharing setting on the information.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The storage module 340 is adapted to receive and store the data uploaded by the uploading module 330. In particular, the storage module 340 is adapted to store by category and manage the information uploaded by the user; the information uploaded by the user may include texts, graphics, and audio/video files.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The sharing cancellation requesting unit 313 of the interacting module 310 is adapted to send a sharing cancellation request after receiving a sharing cancellation instruction from the sharing provider. In this embodiment, the sharing cancellation requesting unit 313 specifically selects a cancelled sharing receiver from a contact list provided by the address list module 350 after receiving the sharing cancellation instruction from the sharing provider, and then sends the sharing cancellation request for canceling the sharing relationship between the cancelled sharing receiver and the target shared information.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The sharing cancellation unit 323 of the sharing setting module 320 is adapted to cancel the sharing state of the target shared information after receiving the sharing cancellation request.

In this embodiment, the re-sharing indicating unit 312 specifically selects a sharing receiver from the contact list provided by the address list module 350 after receiving the re-sharing requesting instruction from the sharing provider, and then sends the re-sharing request for sharing the target shared information that is already set to be re-shared with the sharing receiver.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The re-sharing unit 322 of the sharing setting module 320 is adapted to receive the re-sharing request from the re-sharing indicating unit 312, set the target shared information to a sharing state to the designated sharing receiver, and set the target shared information to a state of which the designated sharing receiver is not allowed to re-share the information after the information is set to the sharing state. For example, in accordance with the above example, A sets the sharing authority on the target shared information, so that when obtaining the information, B not only acquires the target shared information, but is also granted the authority to re-share the target shared information, for example, share with C. The sharing authority granted by A to B may be valid for only once. Therefore, after B re-shares the target shared information, the re-sharing unit 322 sets the target shared information to a not allowing re-sharing state for the designated sharing receiver C, that is, C cannot perform sharing setting on the target shared information after acquiring the target shared information. In an embodiment, data is set to be shared for several times, A may set the sharing authority of the information to multiple sharing.

The user who logs in to the system performs various operations through the interface, for example, viewing personal information, information shared by others and sharing-related information, and information shared with others; displaying an interface of management like uploading, deletion, and modification of the information; displaying an interface of setting or canceling information sharing; and displaying an interface of setting a sharing notification mode.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In particular, when others set to share certain information with the user through the re-sharing requesting unit 311 and the re-sharing setting unit 321, the user logs in to the system, the displaying unit 314 extracts various sharing-related information corresponding to the user from the re-sharing setting unit 321, for example, information that allows the user to re-share a certain information by the others, and the user may view an icon or a thumbnail of the information. The sharing-related information includes description of the sharing provider and sharing time, and can be extended according to actual applications. Similarly, after the user logs in to the system, the displaying unit 314 may extract and display related information shared by the user with the others through the re-sharing requesting unit 311 and the re-sharing setting unit 321. The displaying unit 314 may also extract and display information about the information uploaded by the user to the storage module 340, so as to enable the user to view and perform operations like re-sharing setting.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">When the information sharing server is used, the following operations are performed.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> -->
<ol><li>1) The displaying unit 314 provides a login interface, the sharing provider enters the system from the login interface, and uploads an entity of the information to the storage module 340 through the uploading module 330 and stores attribute data of the information to the re-sharing setting unit 321.</li><li>2) After the information is uploaded, the sharing provider views the uploaded information object in the storage module 340 through the interface displayed by the displaying unit 314, and sets an initial sharing of the information. Then, a designated sharing receiver is selected from a contact list of the user provided by the re-sharing setting unit 321. After the operations of the user, the re-sharing requesting unit 311 is triggered to generate and send a re-sharing setting request to the re-sharing setting unit 321, and the re-sharing setting unit 321 sets the information selected by the user in the storage module 340 to be shared with the designated sharing receiver.</li></ol></p><p id="p0044" num="0044">If the sharing provider is an information owner, when the sharing provider performs a sharing setting on a certain piece of information, the re-sharing requesting unit 311 may provide options regarding whether the information is allowed to be shared twice or shared for several times.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The re-sharing setting unit 321 queries data recorded therein and performs logic determination to realize the authority that controls whether the information can be shared twice or several times.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">After the sharing provider selects the information sharing mode, the re-sharing requesting unit 311 is triggered to send a re-sharing setting request for allowing re-sharing directed to the information object. The re-sharing setting unit 321 processes the re-sharing setting request, for example, storing the sharing relationship and sharing time, and setting a tag of allowing the information to be re-shared or shared for several times, so as to facilitate the subsequent displaying of the information and determining whether the information is allowed to be re-shared.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> -->
<ul><li>3) After the sharing setting is successfully performed, the message sending module 360 sends the sharing setting event to the sharing receiver (that is, the designated sharing receiver) in a wired or wireless mode, for example, through a short message, a multimedia message, or an instant message. The specific notification mode is recorded by the re-sharing setting unit 321, and the sharing setting event is sent through a message according to the recorded notification mode.</li></ul></p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Meanwhile, the displaying unit 314 extracts sharing setting information from the re-sharing setting unit 321, and refreshes the login interface of the user, that is, puts a sharing tag on the information allowed to be re-shared so as to distinguish the information allowed to be re-shared from information that is not allowed to be shared.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">As the attribute data and the sharing relationship of the shared information are recorded in the re-sharing setting unit 321, the displaying unit 314 displays the information, the attribute data of the information, and the shared information by querying the recorded data in the re-sharing setting unit 321.
<ul><li>4) The displaying unit 314 provides the login interface to the sharing receiver, and the sharing receiver initiatively logs in to the system, or logs in to the system after receiving a re-sharing message from the message sending module 360. After the sharing receiver logs in to the system, the displaying unit 314 displays the information owned by the user in the storage module 340, and extracts the user-related information from the re-sharing setting unit 321, and the user-related information includes related information about the information allowed to be re-shared, the sharing time, and the sharing receiver thereof. In addition, the information is displayed in the form of an icon or a thumbnail.</li><li>5) After the user selects the information object allowed to be re-shared, the sharing receiver may be selected from the contact list stored in the address list module 350 or manually added, or the sharing receiver is not limited and any user can obtain the shared information object. Then, the re-sharing instruction is delivered through an instruction delivery interface provided by the re-sharing indicating unit 312 of the interacting module<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> 310. The re-sharing indicating unit 312 sends the re-sharing request to the re-sharing unit 322 after receiving the re-sharing requesting instruction. The re-sharing unit 322 receives the re-sharing request for the target shared information, and sets the target shared information to a re-sharing state in which the designated sharing receiver is allowed to re-share the information. Here, the user selects a specific sharing receiver, and only the specific sharing receiver can obtain the information. Meanwhile, the displaying unit 314 displays the refreshed interface information, including the information already updated to the sharing state and other information that are not allowed to be shared.</li><li>6) After the information is set to the sharing state, the sharing may also be cancelled. In particular, the user delivers a sharing cancellation instruction for the target shared information through an instruction delivery interface provided by the sharing cancellation requesting unit 313 of the interacting module 310. The delivered instruction may include the information to be cancelled of sharing and the sharing receiver to be cancelled of the sharing relationship, or only include the information to be cancelled of sharing, and at this time, the sharing receiver to be cancelled of the sharing relationship includes all users by default. The sharing cancellation requesting unit 313 selects the information about the sharing receiver to be cancelled of the sharing relationship from the contact list provided by the address list module 350 after receiving the sharing cancellation instruction from the sharing provider, thereby forming a sharing cancellation request and sending the request to the sharing cancellation unit 323. The sharing cancellation unit 323 receives the sharing cancellation request, and cancels the sharing relationship between the cancelled sharing receiver and the target information.</li></ul></p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The cancellation of information sharing by the sharing provider has the following three circumstances.
<ol><li>1) The information owner cancels the sharing of the information. In particular, the sharing cancellation unit 323 allows the information owner to cancel the sharing of the information to a certain user or cancel all the sharing relationships of the information.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></li><li>2) A user other than the information owner cancels the sharing of the information. In particular, the sharing cancellation unit 323 prevents the user from canceling all the sharing relationships of the information. The sharing directly cancelled by the sharing provider is all set by the provider. If the information sharing with a certain user is cancelled, the sharing relationship depending on the user (transferred sharing relationship) is also cancelled.</li><li>3) The information owner cancels the re-sharing of the information. In particular, the sharing cancellation unit 323 allows the information owner to cancel the re-sharing of the information with a certain user and cancel the re-sharing of certain information, or cancel all the re-sharing relationships of the information. After the cancellation, the sharing receiver revoked of the re-sharing relationship cannot perform sharing setting on the information, but can acquire the information after the information owner shares the information with the receiver.</li></ol></p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In addition, the storage module 340 also provides information management operations like deletion, modification, and so on.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The embodiment of the information sharing server shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is similar to that in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, and the difference is as follows.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In the information sharing server shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the user performs operations like sharing or sharing cancellation on a remote information sharing server by using client software on the client; while in the information sharing server shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, the interacting module 310 of the information sharing server is adapted to perform operations like sharing or sharing cancellation.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is a functional block diagram of an information sharing system according to an embodiment of the present invention.

<ul><li>1) A sound and flexible information sharing mechanism is provided, so as to effectively use the network resources, facilitate a more rapid and extensive transmission of the information, enhance the information sharing efficiency, and improve the user experience. Thereby, the user finds it easier to perform information sharing and transmission. When the information is set to be shared twice or for several times, the content entity does not need to be transmitted, so that the information sources are enriched, the transmission channels of the information are increased, and it is easier to form an interactive circle around the user. Meanwhile, the user also finds it easier to cancel the information sharing and manage the<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> information.</li><li>2) The application range of the present invention is large, which is not limited to a certain type of network, but is applicable to the Internet and mobile networks. The wide application range of the invention facilitates the interworking of information between different networks.</li><li>3) The user views the shared information from the public server, and obtains the shared information without logging in to the server that the sharing provider registers to, thereby eliminating the technical problem that the user cannot log in to the server due to some failures.</li></ul></p><p id="p0083" num="0083">Persons of ordinary skill in the art should understand that all or a part of the steps of the information sharing method according to the embodiments of the invention may be implemented by relevant hardware under the instruction of a program.
