Using a peer structure of the roaming network without participation and control of a central control node, wherein the roaming of other services, such as telephone services, packet data services, and etc., follows the principles relative to the existing mobile communication system and can inherit the function and advantages of the existing system; the roaming of trunking service is associated with the external IP network through a dispatching server (PTT Dispatching Server, abbreviated as "PDS" in the following) and a dispatch home register (PTT Home Register, abbreviated as "PHR" in the following) of an individual dispatching subsystem, thereby implementing transmission of trunk signaling and data streams by means of the powerful routing capability of the IP network, wherein the respective dispatching subsystems are peer to peer, so that the topology of the system is more flexible, the flow is more compact, the roaming coverage is broader, and the fault-tolerant capability of the system is stronger;</li><li>4. Simplifying the control strategy of the system to the roaming user, wherein for the trunking services, both roaming user and non-roaming user are controlled by PDS, so that the complexity of the service flow is reduced effectively;</li><li>5. For trunking services, providing a method at the call level, wherein what the roaming user visits serves as a point of control in call for trunk private call and roaming home trunking systems serve as a point of control in call for trunk group call. This method is capable of keeping consistency of process performed by the system on roaming and non-roaming calls and makes the calls always in a status where they can be monitored by dispatching console, so that the management capability of the system is increased.</li></ol></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The technical solution of the present invention is defined in independent claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention provides a roaming implementation method for digital trunking communication system.

Wherein the base station subsystem performs the function of access to various services of a terminal; the switching subsystem performs the function of control and switching of telephone service of the terminal within its service coverage and serves as a control center of the telephone service; the dispatching subsystem performs the function of control and management of trunking service of terminal within its service coverage and serves as a control center of the trunking service; the packet data subsystem performs the function of control and access to packet data service of the terminal within its service coverage and serves as a control center of the packet data service. Furthermore, based on the above basic subsystem composition, components, such as a short message subsystem, an intelligent network subsystem, a positioning subsystem etc., may also be configured for providing abundance of services.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The network organization mode of the trunking system according to the present invention is a modularization mode, wherein the system is divided based on service into several relatively independent subsystems, each of the subsystems may develop in the light of its own state-of-the-art. Such a network organization mode makes the design and implementation of the various services, such as telephone service, packet data service, trunking service and etc., more definite and distinct and allows the deployment and performance of the various services to be more flexible and independent, so that the complexity of the system and service-coupling degree of the various services are effectively reduced.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The support of the trunking system according to the present invention for the roaming includes the support for the roaming of the various services of a user. The trunking system according to the present invention is the combination of the trunking communication and the modem mobile communication technologies, thus, besides the trunking service, the other kinds of services, such as telephone service, packet data service, short message service etc., as well as the roaming thereof supported by the system follow the relevant standard of the available mobile communication system, which is unnecessary to be described in detail here. The roaming method of the trunking system according to the present invention emphasizes particularly on describing the support to the roaming of user's trunking service, wherein the roaming<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> of trunking service is implemented by the dispatching subsystem of the trunking system according to the present invention, a local trunking system connects to IP network via PDS and PHR of the dispatching subsystem, so as to interconnect trunking systems within other regions.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The roaming method of the trunking system according to the present invention includes the following processes: roaming user registration, a roaming user initiating a private call, the roaming user initiating a group call, floor managementfloor, call release and voice forwarding etc..</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the roaming implementation method of digital trunking communication system according to the present invention, a plurality of trunking systems need to be taken part in a roaming call, wherein there may be participation of intermediate trunking systems which mainly engage in transparent transmission of signaling or translation of signaling. For the convenience of description, the description concerning the intermediate trunking system is ignored in the following description of the method. In a roaming trunk call, the trunking system controlling the flow of the whole call is called a main control trunking system. The main control trunking system controls the connection of the flow of the whole call, maintains all information of the whole call, and manages the distribution of floor to the call. Generally, a visited trunking system of an originator serves as a main control trunking system of a private call, and a home trunking system of an originator serves as the main control trunking system of a group call. The other trunking systems taking part in the roaming trunk call, which are exclusive of the main control trunking system and the intermediate trunking systems, are known as cooperating trunking systems. The cooperating trunking systems act as the trunking systems of the destination.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">For the convenience of description, in the present invention, instructions of the trunking system for paging a plurality of users, releasing a plurality of users and so on are processed in a serial manner, they may also be processed concurrently in practice, i.e. the trunking system may page a plurality of users at the same time or release a plurality of users simultaneously.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The network structure chart of the trunking system according to the present invention is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, and the respective components are explained as follows:
