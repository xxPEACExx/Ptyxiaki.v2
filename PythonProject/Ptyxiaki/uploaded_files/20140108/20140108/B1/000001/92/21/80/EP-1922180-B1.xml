INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The present invention relates to a paper tool. More particularly, the invention relates to a paper punch, stapler, or paper trimmer having an improved linkage to provide a mechanical advantage to the paper tool.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">Paper tools, including paper punches, staplers, and paper trimmers, are configured such that force input by a user results in an operation on paper or other substrates. For example, in a typical paper punch, the user actuates a handle, which causes a punch pin to move downwardly to punch a hole in a stack of sheets inserted into the punch. Punches that employ a linkage to actuate the punch typically include links generally aligned above a vertically oriented punch mechanism. The linkage increases the mechanical advantage within the punch such that less force input is required from the user to perform the punching operations. Staplers are also known that include linkages for increasing the mechanical advantage of the stapler during stapling operations. Paper trimmers can also be configured to contain similar linkages for increasing mechanical advantage.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Four-bar linkages are known in the construction of paper punches and staplers. One example of such a four-bar linkage in a paper punch is shown in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6688199B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,688,199</text></patcit> and prior-art <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1. FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a paper punch 100 generally including a base 110, punch pins 112 (only one shown), and a linkage for actuating the punch pins 112. The linkage is configured as a four-bar linkage including a drive member 114, a first end cap 118, and a handle member 122. The drive member 114 is pivotably coupled to the base 110 at pivot 120, and the handle member 122 is pivotably coupled to the drive member 114 at pivot 126. The handle member 122 is also pivotably coupled to a second end cap (not shown - positioned at one end of<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the punch 100) at pivot 134, while the second end cap is pivotably coupled to the base 110 at pivot 138.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> also schematically illustrates the "links" representative of the base 110, drive member 114, handle member 122, and the second end cap in a four-bar linkage. The base 110 is schematically illustrated by link 142, which is representative of the "ground," which is stationary in a four-bar linkage. The second end cap is schematically illustrated by link 146, which is representative of the "crank" in a four-bar linkage. The drive member 114 its schematically illustrated by link 150, which is representative of the "rocker" or "output link," which provides the output force or motion to the pivot pins 112. The handle member 122 is schematically illustrated by link 154, which is representative of the "coupler" or "coupler link," which connects the link 146 (the "crank") and the link 150 (the "rocker") in the four-bar linkage.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Such a four-bar linkage, when utilized in a paper punch, includes three movable links (i.e., the links 146, 150, 154) and a sliding point of contact, whether rotationally sliding or through an elongated cam slot. In the paper punch 100 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a push bar in the form of a cylindrical rod 158 is received in respective grooves 162 in the drive members 114. During actuation of the punch pins 112, sliding contact occurs between the rod 158 coupled with the drive members 114 and the punch pins 112 to transfer the pivoting motion of the drive members 114 to linear motion of the punch pins 112.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In typical manually-operated staplers, the upper cover often directly applies a force to the staple driver to drive a staple into a stack of sheets or other materials. Other staplers, such as the staplers shown in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6966479B"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 6,966,479</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6550661B"><text>6,550,661</text></patcit>,<patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US6776321B"><text> 6,776,321</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US6179193B"><text>6,179,193</text></patcit>, have used the leverage provided by two pivots and a sliding contact, rather than a four-bar linkage. Such staplers have only a main body pivot and a cover or handle pivot. The pivot between the magazine and the cover can facilitate opening the stapler for staple loading. Cam. slots have been used in staplers, such as the stapler shown in <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US6966479B"><text>U.S. Patent No: 6,966,479</text></patcit>, but only to provide clearance for opening the upper cover when loading staples into the stapler magazine. Such cam slots have not been used in the mechanism or linkage that transmits power to the staple driver.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="EP0761932A"><text>EP0761932</text></patcit> discloses a stapler and includes a driver-and-clincher mechanism for operating a driver and a clincher such that the driver-and-clincher operating mechanism operates the driver until the driver nearly reaches a bottom dead point thereof during a first half downward movement of an operating handle and then the driver-and-clincher mechanism operates the clincher during a latter half movement of the operating handle. This document is considered as disclosing the features of the preamble of claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention relates to a paper tool, such as a paper punch, a stapler, or a paper trimmer, for acting on a workpiece (e.g., a stack of sheets). In one embodiment of the invention, a paper punch includes a linkage that functions in a manner similar to a four-bar linkage to provide mechanical advantage during a punching operation, however, only two movable links are provided. By using the linkage of the present invention, the simulated pivot point of the eliminated third movable link may be placed in positions which give greater mechanical advantage but would be impractical when using a physical link. The elimination of the third movable link allows a less complex device both by reducing the number of components related to the eliminated third movable link, and also by allowing for the simplification of the paper tool as there is no longer a requirement to provide a mounting point and related structure for the eliminated third movable link.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Slots have been previously used in four-bar linkages and in conjunction with linkages having fewer pivot points, but these slots have not been the pivots of the linkages and have created limitations in the mechanical advantage offered. Known slots in a variety of linkages allow a sliding contact at some point within the linkage (not at a linkage pivot), so the application of force may remain at a known point. These linkages allow neither the simplification nor the mechanical advantage available when using a radial or arcuate slot at a linkage pivot and as a substitute for one of the movable links itself. The improvement is enabled by the configuration of the two remaining movable links and other structure so that the strength of the components themselves act in place of the eliminated third movable link. Thus, the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> linkage of the present invention delivers the full mechanical advantage of a traditional four-bar linkage with fewer physical links and pivots. Though the linkage of the present invention is first described in detail below with respect to use in a punch, it is also described and illustrated for use in a stapler to generate mechanical advantage during stapler operations. Similarly, the linkage of the present invention could be used in a paper trimmer or other paper tools. The movable pivot (i.e., the pivot that provides relative rotation and translation between the coupled members) in the linkage of the present invention could also be applied to more than one pivot, thereby simulating an additional movable link.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention provides a paper tool including a base member, a drive link member pivotably coupled to the base member at a first pivot, and an input member pivotably coupled to the drive link member at a second pivot and pivotably coupled to the base member at a third pivot. The third pivot provides for both rotational and translational movement between respective members connected by the at least one pivot.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Other features and aspects of the invention will become apparent by consideration of the following detailed description and accompanying drawings.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><heading id="h0005"><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a side view of a prior art paper punch utilizing a four bar linkage.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of a paper punch according to one embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a front view of the punch of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is a side view of the punch of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view of the punch of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> with a punch cover removed to reveal the punching units.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref> is a side view, with normally hidden portions shown for clarity, of the punch of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, illustrating a handle in an uppermost position and a punch pin in a retracted position.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> is an enlarged view of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8</figref> is a view similar to that of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref>, illustrating the handle pivoted downwardly and the punch pin partially extended.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 9</figref> is a view similar to that of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8</figref>, illustrating the handle pivoted further downwardly and the punch pin extended further.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 10</figref> is a view similar to that of <figref idrefs="f0006 f0007">FIGS. 7-9</figref>, illustrating the handle in a lowermost position and the punch pin fully extended.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 11</figref> is a schematic view of a linkage for driving a punch pin of the punch of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 12</figref> is a side view, with normally hidden portions shown for clarity, of a stapler according to another embodiment of the present invention, illustrating an stapler cover in an uppermost position and a staple driver in a retracted position.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 13</figref> is a view similar to that of <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 12</figref>, illustrating the stapler cover pivoted downwardly and the staple driver extended.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 14</figref> is a view similar to that of <figref idrefs="f0009">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, illustrating the stapler cover in a lowermost position.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 15</figref> is a schematic view of a linkage for driving the staple driver of the stapler of <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 12</figref>.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0006"><u>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</u></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008">FIGS. 2-11</figref>, a punch 10 embodying the present invention is shown. The punch 10 is preferably configured to perform a punching operation on a workpiece, such as displacing, preferably by shearing, a piece of a workpiece with respect to the remainder of the workpiece, punching a hole or stamping a depression or countersink in the workpiece, stamping to form a raised or depressed feature in a workpiece, or embossing the workpiece. Preferred workpieces for use with punches of the present invention include paper, cardboard, plastic, wood, or metal. Typically, the workpieces are in the form of one or more sheets such as a single sheet of paper or a stack of sheets of paper. In a preferred embodiment, the punch 10 is configured to punch at least one hole in a sheet of paper or stack of paper sheets, and can punch two, three, four, or more holes as desired. The punch 10 of the illustrated embodiment is configured to receive the paper within a slot 12 (see <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>) in a substantially vertical configuration, though it is understood that the punch can have other configurations, including configurations permitting generally horizontal insertion of the paper. The punch 10 also includes a paper support surface 13.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004 f0008">FIGS. 5-11</figref>, the punch 10 includes one or more punch heads 14 configured to perform the punching operation. The punch heads 14 are protected by a punch cover 16 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>). As each punch head 14 is substantially the same, only one punch head 14 will be described. The punch head 14 includes a punch pin 18 movable through a punch pin path, and a punch housing 20 that supports the punch pin 18 and through which the punch pin 18 moves (see <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008">FIGS. 5-11</figref>). Alternatively, the punch head 14 may include a die blade or plate with one or more punching elements, such as teeth or serrations, to punch the workpiece. The illustrated punch housing 20 includes an integrally formed hinge portion 21 (see <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 11</figref>). The punch 10 includes a base 22 (see <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">FIGS. 2-10</figref>) configured to stably support the punch 10 on a support surface, the base 22 supporting the punch housing 20 thereon. In the illustrated construction, the punch housing 20 is secured to the base 22. In an alternative construction of the base, the punch housing 20 and/or the hinge portion 21 may be integrally formed with the base 22 as one piece.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The punch 10 also includes a handle 26 that is configured to receive force input from a user of the punch 10 and is rotatable with respect to the base 22. Alternative arrangements, such as a button or the like, may also be employed to impart the actuation motion.

The linkage 64 includes a drive link or a lever 28 associated with each punch head 14 and pivotably coupled to the base 22 at a fixed pivot 30. In the illustrated construction, the fixed pivot 30 is defined in part by the hinge portion 21 of the punch housing 20, which, in turn, is secured to the base 22. As previously stated, the punch housing 20 and/or the hinge portion 21 may be integrally formed with the base 22 as one piece, such that the pivot 30 may be located directly on the base 22.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The lever 28 includes an upper collar 38 that is rotationally coupled to a shaft 42 that extends along the length of the punch 10.

A set screw or a connecting pin 56 is utilized to secure or rotationally fix the handle 26 to the shaft 42. Alternatively, the handle 26 may be coupled to the shaft 42 in any of a number of different ways, including, among others, integrally forming the handle 26 and the shaft 42. The shaft 42 is loosely supported within the collars 38 so as to form another pivot 58 (see <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006 f0007">FIGS. 6-10</figref>) of the linkage 64, via the shaft 42 being allowed to rotate freely within the collars 38.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">FIGS. 5-10</figref>, the punch 10 includes vertical uprights 46 (only one is shown) coupled to the base 22. The vertical uprights 46 define a portion of yet another pivot 48 of the linkage 64. In the illustrated embodiment, each pivot 48 includes an aperture in the form of a radial or an arcuate slot 60 defined in each vertical upright 46 on each side of the punch 10, and a projection or a pin 52 received within the slot and both rotatably and translationally movable relative to the slot 60. Alternative constructions of the linkage may include an aperture having any of a number of different configurations, provided that the projection or pin 52 be allowed to both rotate and translate relative to the aperture to define a generally arcuate path of relative movement between the components defining the pivot 48. Other geometries that provide relative rotation and translation without using apertures and projections can also be substituted (e.g., slider arrangements, channel arrangements, and the like). In yet other embodiments, the path of relative movement between the components defining the pivot need not be arcuate, yet will still allow the relative rotational and translational movement between the components defining the pivot, and ultimately between the links coupled together at the pivot.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the illustrated construction of the linkage 64, one of the pins 52 is coupled to a collar 50 (see <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>) mounted on one end of the shaft 42, and the other pin 52 is coupled to the integral hub 54 at the other end of the shaft 42. During operation of the punch 10, the handle 26 pivots about the pins 52, which move within their respective slots 60 along an arcuate path during rotation of the handle 26. Thus, the pivot 48 is not a typical pivot in which a pin rotates within an aperture configured to permit rotation but to generally prevent any other relative movement of the pin (like the pivots 30 and 58), but rather is a movable pivot or a pivot defined by components that undergo relative translational movement.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In an alternative construction of the punch 10, the slot 60 can be defined in structure associated with the handle 26 (e.g., in the hub 54 or collar 50) and the pins 52 can be on the vertical uprights 46 or other portions of the base 22. In other words, the components that define the pivot 48 can be reversed from the illustrated construction without changing the operation of the pivot 48 or the linkage 64.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In yet another alternative construction of the punch 10 and the linkage 64, the fixed pivot 30 and the moving pivot 48 could be reversed such that the pivot defined between the lever 28 and the base 22 (e.g., via the hinge portion 21 of the punch housing 20) could include an aperture and a projection movable relative to the aperture (e.g., in an arcuate path) in the manner discussed above for the pivot 48. In this case, the pivot 48 could remain as discussed above, or could be a typical pivot with the pins 52 pivoting within an aperture sized to allow substantially only rotation of the pins 52 therein. In yet other alternative applications of the linkage 64, the pivot 58 could define the movable pivot. Therefore, the illustrated punch 10 provides a linkage 64 for a paper punch including a base member 22 and a drive link member in the form of lever 28 pivotably coupled to the base 22 (e.g., via the hinge portion 21 of the punch housing 20) at a first pivot 30. An input member in the form of handle 26 is pivotably coupled to the drive link (e.g., via the collars 38) at a second pivot 58. The input member or handle 26 is also pivotably coupled to the base 22 (e.g., via vertical uprights 46) at a third pivot 48. At least one of the pivots provides both pivotal (i.e., rotational) and translational movement between the respective members upon movement of the input member. In other embodiments, there could be additional linkage members and additional pivots, however, at least one of the pivots would still provide both pivotal (i.e., rotational) and translational movement between the respective members.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">FIGS. 5-10</figref>, a connecting pin 34 may be used to connect the lever 28 to the punch head 14 such that action upon the lever 28 results in action upon the punch pin 18. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 11</figref>, the punch pin 18 includes an aperture 36 through which the connecting pin 34 is inserted to connect the lever 28 and the punch pin 18. The lever 28 includes a slot 33 in which the connecting pin 34 slides when the lever 28, is rocked or pivoted about pivot 30. The sliding contact between the connecting pin 34 and the slot 33 helps to maintain the application of force to the punch pin 18 at a known point and in the required direction. The purpose of such sliding contact is distinct from the sliding contact that may occur at the pivot 48 in the linkage 64, which is not to apply a consistently directed force to an output member, but rather is to create an improved linkage pivot that can eliminate a physical link and its associated physical pivot, while simulating the motion of the linkage as if that physical link and its associated physical pivot were not eliminated.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 11</figref> schematically illustrates the linkage 64 of the invention in terms of a force diagram that will be understood by one of skill in the art to represent a four bar linkage. Thus, the "bars" defined below do not necessarily relate to a physical structure, but rather refer to the "bars" of the linkage in the force diagram. The drive linkage 64 includes a first bar 68 that extends between the pivot 58 and the fixed pivot 30. In the illustrated punch 10, this first bar is the lever 28. A second bar 72 extends between the pivot 58 and the pivot 48. In the illustrated punch 10, this second bar 72 is defined by the hub 54 and collar 50. A fixed or ground bar 76 extends between the pivot 30 and a fixed point 80, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 11</figref>. This fixed point 80 defines the center of rotation of the arc defined by the arcuate slot 60. There is no physical link associated with the ground bar 76 except for the inherent structure and strength of the base 22. Furthermore, there is no physical link associated with a third bar 84 extending between the fixed point 80 and the pivot 48. Instead, the configuration of the pivot 48 (i.e., its ability to translate in addition to rotate), and the strong construction of the punch 10 components allows the linkage 64 to function in a similar manner to a four bar linkage, but allows eliminating a physical link and a physical pivot typically associated with a four bar linkage. By eliminating this physical link and physical pivot, there is greater flexibility in configuring the punch, but the mechanical advantage obtained with a four bar linkage is maintained.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0006 f0007">FIGS. 7-10</figref> illustrate the relative motion of the components discussed above as the punch is actuated.

The motion of the lever 28 due to rotation of the handle 26 and the fixed position of the pivot point 30 moves the connecting pin 34 and the punch pin 18 out of the punch housing 20 toward the slot 12. The pivot pin 52 begins to translate (i.e., slide) up the slot 60, while also rotating within the slot 60.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 9</figref>, continued rotation of the handle 26 moves the lever 28 such that the lever 28, and thus the first bar 68, are substantially vertical. The pivot pin 52 slides further in the slot 60, while also rotating, and the second bar 72 forms an acute angle with respect to the invisible bar 84. The punch pin 18 continues to move into the slot 12. As the handle 26 reaches the bottom of its rotational path, shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 10</figref>, the pivot pin 52 has reached the uppermost point of travel within the slot 60. The punch pin 18 is fully extended through the slot 12 and through apertures in the receiving member 24.

Alternatively, the bosses or pin 222 could be on the drive link 214 and the apertures could be formed in the base 208. The illustrated pivot 218 is a typical pivot in that the bosses or pin 222 are allowed to rotate in the aperture 226, but cannot substantially translate or otherwise move relative to the aperture 226. The drive link 214 supports a spring 230 that is deflected during stapler operation to store energy.
