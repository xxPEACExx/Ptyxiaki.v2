load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to screwdrivers for driving screws carried on a carrier. In this specification, a carrier having screws carried thereon will be hereinafter called "a screw strip."</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP5104456A"><text>5-104456</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP8155847A"><text>8-155847</text></patcit> teach known screwdrivers. The screwdriver disclosed in Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP5104456A"><text>5-104456</text></patcit> has a feeding device for feeding screws carried on a screw strip toward a driver bit, and an arc-shaped guide member positioned on the upstream side of the feeding device for guiding the screw strip. However, in order to guide a screw strip carrying long screws, it is necessary to increase the curvature of the guide member. Therefore, the size of the guide member is necessary to be increased.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The screwdriver disclosed in Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP8155847A"><text>8-155847</text></patcit> has an arc-shaped guide member in a twisted form, so that a screw strip carrying long screws can be smoothly guided without substantial increase of the curvature. However, the same guide member is used also for a screw strip carrying short screws, even though the length along the arc of the arc-shaped guide is unnecessarily, too long for the screw strip carrying short screws. Therefore, it is preferable that the length of the arc-shaped guide is short for the screw strip carrying short screws and is long for the screw strip carrying long screws. It is also preferable that the length of the arc-shaped guide is short for the purpose of storage or for the use within a narrow working space.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Therefore, there has been a need for a guide member that can change the length of a guide path for a screw strip. There has been also a need for a guide device or a screwdriver having such a guide member.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">According one aspect of the present invention, a screwdriver include a guide member for guiding a screw strip that carries a plurality of screws arranged at predetermined intervals along a length of the screw strip. The screwdriver also includes a feeding device for feeding the screw strip such that the screws of the screw strip are positioned one after another to a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> position for driving by a driver bit. The guide member defines an arc-shaped guide path having a length, so that the screw strip can move along the guide path. The guide member is configured such that the length of the guide path can be varied at least between a first length and a second length that is longer than the first length.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Therefore, the length of the guide path can be varied depending on needs. For example, if a screw strip carrying short screws is used, it is possible to provide a short guide path. On the other hand, if a screw carrying long screws is used, it is possible to provide a long guide path. In addition, a short guide path is advantageous when the screwdriver is stored or when a working space is narrow. As a result, it is possible to improve the operability of the screwdriver.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In one embodiment, the guide member has a first portion and a second portion. The first portion defines the first length of the guide path and is attached to the side of a tool body of the screwdriver. The second portion is pivotally connected to the first portion and can be moved between an operative position and a storage position. When the second portion is in the operative position, the first portion and the second portion together define the second length of the guide path. With this arrangement, it is possible to change the length of the guide path by simply pivoting the second portion relative to the first portion.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The second portion may includes a first half and a second half. The first half is configured to cover a first side edge of the screw strip from the outer side. The second half is configured to cover a second side edge opposite to the first side edge of the screw strip from the outer side. The first half and the second half are pivotally connected to the first portion independently of each other. With this arrangement, it is possible to pivot the second portion while the first portion can serve to guide the screw strip. Therefore, the length of the guide path can be changed without removing the screw strip from the first portion.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In another embodiment, the second portion is removaly attached to the first portion for defining the second length of the guide path together with the first portion. Therefore, it is possible to change the length of the guide path by simply attaching and removing the second<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> portion.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The second portion may include a first half and a second half. The first half is configured to cover a first side edge of the screw strip from the outer side. The second half is configured to cover a second side edge opposite to the first side edge of the screw strip from the outer side. The first half and the second half are respectively removably attached to the first portion independently of each other. With this arrangement, the length of the guide path can be changed without removing the screw strip from the first portion.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a further embodiment, the second portion is slidably mounted to the first portion and can slide between an operative position and a storage position on the side of the first portion. When the second portion is in the operative position, the second portion defines the second length of the guide path together with the first portion. With this arrangement, it is possible to change the length of the guide path by slidably moving the second portion toward or away from the first portion.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In another aspect of the present invention, a fastener guide device for a power tool is provided. The fastener guide device is operable to guide a fastener strip carrying a plurality of fasteners arranged at intervals along a lengthwise direction. For example, the fasteners may be screws, nails, or rivets. The fastener guide device includes a guide member defining a guide path for the fastener strip. The guide member is configured such that the length of the guide path can be varied. Therefore, it is possible to change the length of the guide path depending on needs.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In one embodiment, the guide member includes a first portion and a second portion. The first portion defines a first part of the guide path. The second portion defines a second part of the guide path. The second part extends in series with the first part.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The first portion and the second portion may be pivotally connected to each other or removably attached to each other. Otherwise, the first portion and the second portion may be slidably movable relative to each other.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Additional objects, features, and advantages, of the present invention will be readily understood after reading the following detailed description together with the claims and the accompanying drawings, in which:

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG 1</figref>, a screwdriver 1 of this embodiment generally includes a tool body 5, a guide member 2 and a feeding device 6 for feeding a screw strip 7 to a position opposing to a driver bit 5g.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG 1</figref>, the tool body 5 has a substantially D-shaped housing 5a that includes a grip portion 5b configured to be grasped by an operator. A trigger 5c is mounted to the grip portion 5b and can move into and out of the grip portion 5b. A battery 5d, a drive motor 5e and a power transmission mechanism 5f are disposed within the housing 5a. Pressing the trigger 5c into the grip portion 5b supplies a power from the battery 5d to the drive motor 5e, so that the motor 5e is driven. The driving force of the motor 5e is transmitted to the driver bit 5g via the power transmission mechanism 5f. The power transmission mechanism 5f may include a reduction gear train. The driver bit 5g extends forwardly (rightward as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) from the front end (right end as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) of the housing 5a.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the screw strip 7 includes a carrier 7a and a plurality of screws 7b held by the carrier 7a and positioned at regular intervals along a lengthwise direction of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> carrier 7a. In this embodiment, the carrier 7a is made of resin strip. However, wires or any other material can be used as the carrier 7a. The feeding device 6 serves to feed the screw strip 7 such that the screws 7b are positioned to oppose to the driver bit 5g one after another in response to the driving operations of the screws 7b. The feeding device 6 includes a base casing 6a, a feeder casing 6b and a feeder 6c.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the base casing 6a is attached to the front end of the tool body 5, so that the driver bit 5g is covered by the base casing 6a. The feeder casing 6b is movably attached to the front portion, so that the feeder casing 6b can move in forward and rearward directions (right and left directions as viewed in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>). A compression coil spring 6d is disposed within the base casing 6a and biases the feeder casing 6b in the forward direction. In order to drive screws 7b, the front portion of the feeder casing 6b is pressed against a workpiece (not shown), so that the feeder casing 6b moves into the base casing 6a against the biasing force of the compression coil spring 6d.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The feeder 6c serves to feed the screw strip 7 into the base casing 6a and includes a ratchet wheel 6cl, an intermediate gear 6c2 and an arm 6c3. The ratchet wheel 6c1 has a central shaft portion that is rotatably attached to the feeder casing 6b. A plurality of feeding teeth are formed on the outer circumference of the ratchet wheel 6c1 and are engageable with the carrier 7a. The intermediate gear 6c2 has a central shaft that is rotatably attached to the feeder casing 6b. Gear teeth are formed on the outer circumference of the intermediate gear 6c2 and are in engagement with corresponding gear teeth formed on the ratchet wheel 6c1.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG 1</figref>, the arm 6c3 is pivotally attached to the central shaft of the intermediate gear 6c2 and can pivot within a predetermined angular range about the central shaft. A one-way clutch (not shown) is provided between the arm 6c3 and the intermediate gear 6c2, so that the intermediate gear 6c2 rotates in response to the pivotal movement of the arm 6c2 in one direction. A roller pin 6c4 is mounted to one end of the arm 6c2 away from the pivotal axis and extends into an elongated hole 6c5 formed in the base casing 6a. Therefore, as the feeder casing 6b moves into the base casing 6a for the screw driving operation, the roller pin 6c4 moves along the elongated hole 6c5, so that the arm 6c3 pivots about it axis.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> As the arm 6c4 pivots, the intermediate gear 6c2 rotates to cause one revolution of the ratchet wheel 6c1. As the ratchet wheel 6c1 makes one revolution, the screw strip 7 is forced to move by a distance of one pitch between two adjacent screws 7b.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the guide member 2 defines an arc-shaped concave guide path, along which the screw strip 7 is guided.
