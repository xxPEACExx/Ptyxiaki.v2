longitudinally, those terminals are superposed, pressurized and bonded together in the direction the terminals come in contact with each other, thereby making a connection. In this manner, to make terminals securely come in contact with each other, a strong pressing force must be applied.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Accordingly, as shown in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPHEI10199864951B"><text>Hei 10(1998)-64951</text></patcit>, a technology has been presented wherein a hemispherically-shaped convex portion or a convex portion formed along the direction of the short side of the terminal is created on one elongated terminal, thereby securely bonding terminals.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, in order to create a hemispherical convex portion on a terminal, the length of the terminal in the direction of its short side must be long.

However, there are problems in that when a terminal is pressed onto the other terminal, the convex portion will be deformed in the direction the convex portion will be crushed.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to provide a connection structure of terminals.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In a connection structure of terminals according to the present invention a second terminal is connected to a first terminal which extends longitudinally, the first terminal is an elongated plate made of metal and has substantially rectangular shape having a short side and a long side.

At the bottom of the inside of the transmission 2, a hydraulic control device 3 is disposed to function as a control device; and the hydraulic control device 3 is used for hydraulically controlling the work of the clutch provided inside the transmission. Furthermore, on the hydraulic control device 3, there are immobilizedly provided a solenoid valve 4 for controlling hydraulic pressure and a control module 5 on which electronic components such as CPU for creating control signals are molded with resin. The solenoid valve 4 is connected to connectors 6c, 6d, 6e of the control module 5 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.2</figref>.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Next, the detail of the hydraulic control device 3 will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.2</figref>. The hydraulic control device 3 includes a rectangular base 7 made of metal (SPCC) immobilized in the housing of the transmission, and a plurality of bus bars 8 made of metal (copper alloy such as phosphor bronze) extend inwardly, facing one another, from both ends of the base 7 in the direction of the long side of the base 7. Furthermore, the edge portion of the bus bars 8 are inserted and molded with resin thereby creating an insulating mold 9 so as to prevent a short-circuit from<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> occurring between connectors. The insulating mold 9 is divided into four blocks: two on both sides. Moreover, an insulating mold 9a located at the upper right in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.2</figref> has a substantially rectangular through-hole 9b created on one end of the base 7 in the direction of its long side and close to the control module 5.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">On one end of the insulating mold 9 facing the long side of the base 7, connectors 6a, 6b to be connected to an automobile's harnesses are disposed; and on the other end of the insulating mold 9 facing the long side of the base 7, connectors 6c, 6d, 6e to be connected to the solenoid valves 4 are disposed.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Furthermore, between bus bars 8 disposed on both ends of the base 7 in the direction of the long side, a control module 10 on which electronic components such as CPU for creating control signals are molded with resin is disposed. On both sides of the control module 10, terminals 11 made of metal (pure copper) the quantity of which is the same as that of bus bars 8 are created so that those terminals protrude. Each of those terminals 11 is bonded to each of the bus bars 8 by laser welding.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Furthermore, in the through-hole 9b of the insulating mold 9a, a plurality of (four) bus bars 12 connected to the control module protrude toward one end<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> of the insulating mold 9a in the direction of its long side; and those bus bars 12 are located in a row in the direction substantially orthogonal to the direction along which bus bars 8 are disposed. The bus bar 12, which is an elongated plate made of metal (copper alloy such as phosphor bronze) and extends longitudinally, is substantially rectangular; however, the width of the tip area of the bus bar 12 in the direction of its short side is wider to create a connection, and the width of the root area of the bus bar 12 is smaller than that of the tip area. Moreover, the bus bar 12 constitutes a first terminal.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Each of connector leads 13 which functions as a lead that constitutes a second terminal is connected to each of the bus bars 12; and the connector leads 13 are flexibly deformable so as to allow the connector 14 to be connected to an external terminal located in a variety of locations. For this reason, the location of an automobile's connector that functions as an external terminal to which the connector 14 is connected is not limited, thereby complying with any types of cars. Moreover, the connector lead 13 is a round wire, made of metal (pure copper), which is entirely coated with insulating material and has a circular cross section; however, the insulating coating of the connection<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> portion to connect the bus bar 12 is removed.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Next, the detail of the connection structure between the bus bar 12 functioning as a first terminal and the connector lead 13 functioning as a second terminal will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs.3 and 4. Fig.3</figref> shows the wide tip area of a bus bar 12 and the connection portion between the bus bar 12 and the connector lead 13.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Although the length of the bus bar 12 in the direction of its short side is approximately 2 mm, it is preferable that the length be between 0.5 mm and 3 mm so as to easily connect the bus bar 12 to the connector lead 13 and reduce the size of the control device. Furthermore, although the thickness of the bus bar 12 is approximately 0.64 mm, it is preferable that the thickness be between 0.2 mm and 1.2 mm in the light of the strength of the connection with the connector lead 13. Furthermore, although the length of the wide portion of the bus bar 12 in the direction of the long side of the bus bar 12 is approximately 4 mm, it is preferable that the length be between 3 mm and 5 mm so as to easily connect the bus bar 12 to the connector lead 13 and reduce the size of the control device.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The bus bar 12 has a convex portion 15 created by press work along the short side of the bus bar 12 from<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> one end to the other end, and on the opposite side of the convex portion 15, a concave portion 16 is created which corresponds to the convex portion 15. The convex portion 15 is substantially straight and made oblique with an angle to both the direction of the short side and the direction of the long side of the bus bar 12 and intersects with the direction of the short side of the bus bar 12. That is, both the convex portion 15 and the concave portion 16 are longer than the length of the bus bar 12 in the direction of the short side of the bus bar 12. Furthermore, the length [c] from the tip [a] of the convex portion 15 in the direction of the long side of the bus bar 12 to the tip [b] of the bus bar 12 in the direction of its long side is greater than the height [d] of the convex portion.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.4</figref>, the convex portion 15 is substantially trapezoidal: the width of the cross section becomes smaller toward the top surface. Therefore, a substantially straight flat plane is created on the top surface along the direction in which the convex portion 15 extends. Since the convex portion 15 is created by press work as mentioned above, the cross section of the concave portion 16 is also substantially trapezoidal in the same manner as the convex portion 15.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Next, a method of bonding a connector lead 13 to a bus bar 12 will be described hereafter. Electric resistance welding is used to bond together the connector lead 13 and the bus bar 12.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">First of all, bus bars 12 are embedded in an insulating mold 9a by means of injection molding with resin so that only the connection portion of the bus bars protrudes from the through-hole 9b. Next, a connector lead 13 is disposed on the top surface of the convex portion 15 along the direction of the long side of the bus bar 12 and at a substantially middle position in the direction of the short side of the bus bar 12. At this time, the insulating mold 9a has not been mounted onto the base 7. In this condition, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.4</figref>, electrodes 17a, 17b are made contacted from the connector lead 13 side and the concave portion 16 side, then pressurized, and electrified. Consequently, resistance heat causes the bus bar 12 and the connector lead 13 to melt and be bonded together.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Herein, as shown in patent document 1 mentioned above, in the case in which a convex portion and a concave portion are created on a bus bar along the direction of its short side, when electrodes are made contacted with pressure, stress concentrates on the tip of the convex portion, thereby causing the bus bar to<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> be deformed resulting in crushing the convex portion. At this time, because the tip area of the bus bar extending from the convex portion is a free end, when the convex portion is crushed, the tip of the bus bar is simultaneously lifted toward the connector lead in some cases. Herein, because the length between the convex portion to the tip of the bus bar in the direction of the long side of the bus bar 12 is greater than the height of the convex portion, the lifted tip of the bus bar comes in contact with the connector lead. For this reason, there are problems in that the area of a contact of the convex portion at which the convex portion comes in contact with a connector lead decreases and electric current splits from the bus bar's tip, other than the convex portion, at which the bus bar has come in contact with the connector lead, thereby inhibiting secure welding. Furthermore, there are problems in that not only while the bus bar is pressurized, but also while the bus bar is pressurized, electrified, and welded, the portion around the top surface of the convex portion becomes softened due to heat, resulting in deformation. One of those factors is a decrease in rigidity of the terminal because the backside of the convex portion is concave.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">On the contrary, in this embodiment, the convex<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> portion 15 is not created along the direction of the short side of the bus bar 12, but is made oblique with an angle to the direction of the short side; therefore, the length of the entire convex portion 15 becomes greater, increasing the rigidity of the convex portion 15. Consequently, the convex portion 15 is not deformed when it is pressurized by means of electrodes. Furthermore, even if a bus bar 12 is softened due to heat generated during the welding process, deformation does not easily occur. As a result, it is possible to execute secure and reliable welding.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As stated above, the detail of the first embodiment was described. Hereafter, the effects of the first embodiment will be described.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A first embodiment is a connection structure of terminals in which a second terminal is connected to a first terminal which extends longitudinally. On the first terminal, a convex portion is created along the short side of the first terminal from one end to the other end, and a concave portion which corresponds to the convex portion is created on the opposite side of the convex portion. Both the convex portion and the concave portion are longer than the length of the first terminal in the direction of its short side, and the second terminal is connected at the convex portion.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> Therefore, even if the second terminal is connected to the first terminal while the second terminal is strongly pressed onto the first terminal, the convex portion is not deformed. For this reason, the area of the contact at which the first terminal comes in contact with the second terminal does not decrease, and a constant surface pressure can be ensured when the second terminal is strongly pressed onto the first terminal; therefore, secure and reliable connection can be ensured. Specifically, when the convex portion is welded to the second terminal, it is possible to securely weld together the first terminal and the second terminal while those terminals are securely coming contact with each other, thereby stabilizing the bonding condition.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Moreover, in order to make the convex portion and the concave portion longer than the length of the first terminal in direction of the short side of the first terminal, it is considered that a portion is provided which has an angle to the direction of the short side of the first terminal. Specifically, by making the convex portion and the concave portion substantially straight, it is easy to create a convex portion even on a very small terminal, made of copper alloy, with a thickness between 0.4 mm and 0.8 mm and a length<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> between 3 mm and 5 mm in the direction of the short side.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Furthermore, in the case of a first embodiment, since the second terminal is a wire, it must be bonded with pressure when bonded to the first terminal. Specifically, when the second terminal is bonded substantially along the direction of the long side of the first terminal, the second terminal easily comes in contact with the convex portion. In the first embodiment, because the convex portion is made substantially straight having an angle to the direction of the short side of the first terminal, it is possible to increase the area of the contact at which the convex portion comes in contact with the second terminal. Furthermore, by bonding the second terminal to the first terminal at a substantially middle position in the direction of the short side of the first terminal, it is possible to prevent the second terminal from being removed from the convex portion when pressure is applied.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Furthermore, another example useful for understanding the invention relates to a method of connecting terminals in which a second terminal is connected to a plate-like first terminal which extends longitudinally. On a metal plate which extends longitudinally, a substantially linear convex portion<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> which at least includes a portion that intersects with the direction of the short side of the metal plate is molded by press work, and a second terminal is bonded to the molded convex portion with pressure, thereby connecting the first terminal to the second terminal. Therefore, the convex portion is not deformed when the second terminal is strongly pressed onto the first terminal. For this reason, the area of the contact at which the first terminal comes in contact with the second terminal does not decrease, and a constant surface pressure can be ensured when the second terminal is strongly pressed onto the first terminal; therefore, secure and reliable connection can be ensured. Specifically, when the convex portion is welded to the second terminal, it is possible to securely weld together the first terminal and the second terminal while those terminals are securely coming contact with each other, thereby stabilizing the bonding condition.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Furthermore, in the case in which the first terminal and the second terminal are bonded together by electric resistance welding, the tip of the first terminal is not lifted toward the connector lead. Consequently, it is possible to prevent electric current from splitting as the result of the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> tip of the first terminal coming in contact with the connector lead. Specifically, this is effective in the case in which the length from the tip of the convex portion in the direction of the long side of the first terminal to the tip of the first terminal in the direction of its long side is greater than the height of the convex portion.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Furthermore, a control device having a bus bar to which a lead is connected on a substrate is shown as an example useful for understanding the invention. The bus bar is connected to a control module disposed on a substrate and is made up of an elongated metal plate on which a convex portion is created along the short side of the bus bar 12 from one end to the other end. The convex portion has a portion that does not extend in the direction of the short side. A lead is connected to another part other than the control module, and the bus bar is welded to the lead at the convex portion. Therefore, the convex portion is not deformed when the lead is strongly pressed onto the bus bar and welded together. For this reason, the area of the contact at which the bus bar comes in contact with the lead does not decrease, and a constant surface pressure can be ensured when the lead is strongly pressed onto the bus bar; therefore, secure and reliable connection can be ensured. Specifically, when<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> the convex portion is bonded to the lead by electric resistance welding, it is possible to weld together the bus bar and the lead while they are securely coming contact with each other, thereby stabilizing the bonding condition.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Furthermore, a control device is disposed in an automobile's automatic transmission. Herein, when the control device is simply installed in an automobile, vibration is transmitted to the control device; and in the case in which the control device is installed in an automatic transmission, greater vibration is transmitted to the control device. For this reason, in case the bus bar and the lead are not strictly bonded together, they are apart from each other due to the vibration. Therefore, it is inspected whether the bus bar and the lead are securely bonded or not. Results of the inspection verified that defect can be significantly reduced by the convex portion having a portion that does not extend in the direction of the short side of the bus bar, when compared to a conventional technology wherein the convex portion is created along the direction of the short side of the bus bar.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Furthermore, in order to install a control device<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> in an automatic transmission, the control device must be small. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the size of the area in which the bus bar is disposed by reducing the width of the bus bar specifically in the direction of its short side. Furthermore, when the width of the bus bar in the direction of its short side is reduced, the diameter of the lead to be used must be small as well. For this reason, the bus bar and the lead tend to be apart from each other due to vibration, and it is important to securely connect the bus bar to the lead from the aspect of manufacture. In the case in which a bus bar is made small so that it can be installed in an automatic transmission, it is possible to securely bond a lead with a small diameter to the bus bar.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Furthermore, a plurality of bus bars are disposed in a row on a substrate, and each lead is bonded to each of the bus bars; accordingly, it is possible to continuously bond together bus bars and leads. Depending on the shape of the electrodes, a plurality of bus bars can be bonded to leads simultaneously. Furthermore, the lead is a connector lead which is connected to a connector that bonds to an external terminal. Therefore, to bond a<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> lead to a bus bar, pressure must be applied during the bonding process.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">As state above, the first embodiment has been described; therein, the convex portion 15 can be inclined on either side. However, in the case in which a plurality of bus bars 12 are disposed in a row and each of them is connected to each connector lead 13, it is recommended that the direction of tilt of each convex portion 15 be identical. Furthermore, an angle of tilt of the convex portion 15 can be set arbitrarily by considering the length of the bus bar 12 in the direction of its long side and the pressure to be applied.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Furthermore, in the same manner as a bus bar 12 in the first embodiment, the root portion of the bus bar 12 can be narrow in the direction of the short side of the bus bar 12 as long as the bus bar 12 extends longitudinally. Therefore, it is not necessary for the bus bar 12 to be a perfect rectangular plate.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Furthermore, even if the thickness of the bus bar 12 is between 0.2 mm and 1.2 mm and the length in the direction of the short side is not between 0.5 mm and 3 mm, effects of the first embodiment can be ensured. Moreover, it is preferable that the thickness of the bus bar 12 be between 0.4 mm and 0.8 mm, and the length<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> in the direction of the short side be between 1 mm and 3 mm. Furthermore, even if the bus bar 12 and the connector lead 13 are not made of metal which contains copper, effects of the first embodiment can be ensured.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Furthermore, the second terminal does not have to be a wire such as a connector lead 13, and the second terminal can be a metal plate identical to the first terminal.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Furthermore, the connector lead 13 does not have to be bonded substantially along the direction of the long side of the bus bar 12, and the connector lead 13 can be connected diagonally or perpendicularly to the bus bar 12 so that the connector lead 13 intersects with the bus bar. Furthermore, the connector lead 13 does not have to be bonded at a substantially middle position in the direction of the short side of the bus bar 12, and the connector lead 13 can be bonded at a location on either one side.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Furthermore, in the first embodiment, the bus bar 12 and the connector lead 13 are bonded together by electric resistance welding. However, any application is possible in which bonding is executed while the bus bar 12 and the connector lead 13 securely come in contact with each other, and for example, adhesion by adhesives or brazing are applicable. Moreover, in the<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> case in which electric resistance welding is not used, even if the length from the tip of the convex portion in the direction of the long side of the bus bar 12 to the tip of the bus bar 12 in the direction of its long side is greater than the height of the convex portion 15, electric current does not split. However, it is sufficiently effective that the area of the contact can be ensured at the time of bonding and constant surface pressure can also be ensured when pressure is applied.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Furthermore, in the first embodiment, the cross section of the convex portion 15 and the concave portion 16 is substantially trapezoidal; however, it does not have to be substantially trapezoidal, and for example, it can be substantially rectangular, substantially square, substantially triangular, substantially semicircular or of a combination of those shapes. Alternatively, to make the length of the entire convex portion 15 longer than the width of the bus bar, for example, the convex portion 15 can be T-shaped. Additionally, instead of creating a convex portion 15 along the entire width of the terminal, the convex portion 15 can be substantially linear with a portion unmolded.</p><heading id="h0007">[Second embodiment]</heading><p id="p0042" num="0042">Next, a second embodiment will be described with<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.5.

Hereafter, parts in common with the parts shown in a first embodiment are indicated by the same name and symbols.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">As show in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.5</figref>, in the second embodiment, a convex portion 15 is created along the direction of the short side of the bus bar 12, which functions as a first terminal, halfway up the direction of the short side of the bus bar 12, and the convex portion 15 has a portion having an angle to the direction of the short side on one end of the bus bar 12 in the direction of its short side. For this reason, the convex portion 15 is longer than the length of the bus bar 12 in the direction of the short side of the bus bar 12 and is bent; accordingly, the convex portion 15 has a portion that does not extend in the direction of the short side and a portion that intersects with the direction of the short side. Other portions are the same as those in the first embodiment.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Thus, the convex portion 15 in the second embodiment is bent; therefore, the convex portion 15 is not so easily crushed as that in the first embodiment. Furthermore, by connecting a connector lead 13 to a portion of the convex portion 15 created along the direction of the short side, when the connector lead 13<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> is bonded to the bus bar 12 with pressure, the connector lead 13 and the convex portion 15 become orthogonal. Therefore, it is possible, to the maximum extent, to prevent the connector lead 13 from removing from the convex portion 15.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Moreover, in the second embodiment, a portion of the convex portion 15 having an angle to the direction of the short side of the bus bar 12 can be created on either end of the convex portion in the direction of the short side of the bus bar 12, and the direction of tilt and the length can be arbitrarily set. Furthermore, it is also acceptable not to provide a portion of the convex portion 15 created along the direction of the short side of the bus bar 12, and for example, the convex portion 15 can be V-shaped.</p><heading id="h0008">[Third embodiment]</heading><p id="p0046" num="0046">Next, a third embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.6.

For this reason, the convex portion 15 is longer than the length of the bus bar 12 in the direction of its short side and has a portion that does not extend in the direction of the short side and a portion that intersects with the direction of the short side.
