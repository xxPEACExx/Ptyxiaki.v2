load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to electronic devices, and more particularly to an amplifier system that operates in multiple modes.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">RF power amplifiers used for wireless communication transmitters, with spectrally efficient modulation formats, require high linearity to preserve modulation accuracy and to limit spectral regrowth. Typically, a linear amplifier, Class-A type, Class-AB type or Class-B is employed to faithfully reproduce inputs signals and to limit the amplifier output within a strict emissions mask. Linear amplifiers are capable of electrical (DC power in to RF power out or DC-RF) efficiencies greater than 50% when operated at saturation. However, they are generally not operated at high efficiency due to the need to provide high linearity. For constant envelope waveforms, linear amplifiers are often operated below saturation to provide for operation in their linear regime. Time varying envelopes present an additional challenge. The general solution is to amplify the peaks of the waveform near saturation, resulting in the average power of the waveform being amplified at a level well backed-off from saturation. The back-off level, also referred to as output power back-off (OPBO), determines the electrical efficiency of a linear amplifier.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, the efficiency of a Class-A type amplifier decreases with output power relative to its peak value (EFF = P<sub>OUT</sub>/P<sub>PEAK</sub>). The efficiency of Class-B type amplifiers also decreases with output power relative to its peak value (EFF = ( P<sub>OUT</sub>/P<sub>PEAK</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>). Class-AB type amplifiers have output power variations intermediate between these values. Thus, there is customarily an inherent tradeoff between linearity and efficiency in amplifier designs.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Modern transmitters for applications such as cellular, personal, and satellite communications employ digital modulation techniques such as quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) in combination with code division multiple access (CDMA) communication. Shaping of the data pulses mitigates out-of-band emissions from<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> occurring into adjacent channels but produces time-varying envelopes. In addition to amplifying individual waveforms with time varying envelopes, many transmitters (especially in base stations) are being configured to amplify multiple carriers. Multi-carrier signals have high a wide distribution of power levels resulting in a large peak-to-average ratio (PAR). Therefore, the operation of the linear amplifiers in these types of signals is very inefficient, since the amplifiers must have their supply voltage sized to handle the large peak voltages even though the signals are much smaller a substantial portion of the time. Additionally, the size and cost of the power amplifier is generally proportional to the required peak output power of the amplifier.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), and multi-carrier versions of Global Standard for Mobile Communication (GSM) and Code Division Multiple Access 2000 (CDMA 2000) are wireless standards and application growing in use. Each requires amplification of a waveform with high PAR levels, above 10 dB in some cases. The sparse amount of spectrum allocated to terrestrial wireless communication requires that transmissions minimize out-of-band (OOB) emissions to minimize the interference environment. A linear amplifier used to amplify a waveform with a PAR of 10 dB or more provides only 5-10% DC-RF efficiency. The peak output power for the amplifier is sized by the peak waveform. The cost of the amplifier scales with its, peak power. Several other circuit costs including heat sinks and DC-DC power supplies scale inversely to peak power and dissipated heat (which results from the electrical inefficiency). Related base station costs of AC-DC power supplies, back-up batteries, cooling, and circuit breakers also scale inversely with efficiency as does the electrical operating costs. Clearly, improving DC-RF efficiency is a major cost saver both for manufacture and operation. Non-linear classes (<i>e.g</i>., Class C, D, E and F type amplifiers) of RF power amplifiers switch the RF devices on and off in or near saturation, and are more efficient than linear classes of operation such as Class-A, Class-AB or Class-B type which conduct during at least half of the RF cycle and are significantly backed off from compression. However, non-linear amplifiers can only be employed with constant envelope signals, such as frequency modulations (FM) and certain forms of phase modulation (PM), signals with modulated amplitudes cause<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> severely distorted outputs from these classes of amplifiers. One efficiency enhancement technique that has been employed is known as the Kahn or Envelope Elimination and Restoration (EER) technique. The EER technique detects the envelope of the incoming signal to produce a baseband amplitude modulated (AM) signal. The EER technique limits the input signal to produce a phase modulated (PM) component with a constant envelope. The PM signal is provided to the input of the power amplifier along a PM path and the amplitude modulated component is employed to modulate the supply of the power amplifier along an AM path. Amplitude modulation of the final RF power amplifier restores the envelope to the phase-modulated carrier, creating an amplified version of the input signal. Since the signal input into the power amplifier has a constant envelope amplitude, a more efficient class of power amplifier (<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>., Class-C type amplifiers) can be employed to amplify the input signal. Additionally, since the supply signal is amplitude modulated, the amplifier is operating at compression enhancing the efficiency of the amplifier.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Amplifiers that employ the EER technique are referred to as polar amplifiers. Polar amplifiers have demonstrated very high efficiency but can distort signals and cause significant amounts of OOB emissions. Traditional implementations require the two signal paths (AM and PM) to be extremely well synchronized. The two paths may each require substantially wider bandwidth components than the original signal. If the signal crosses through a zero-amplitude point it may cause the polar amplifier to cut-off and/or require an extremely rapid and difficult phase change in the constant envelope, PM, path. If the signal varies over a large dynamic range it may cause the polar amplifier to operate with very low supply (e.g. drain) voltages resulting in additional signal distortion and can cause the amplifier to shutoff when the supply voltage becomes too low. As a result, the polar amplifier has only been employed with a limited range of waveforms. In traditional EER systems OOB emissions have been controlled by calibrating the delay along the two paths to synchronize the reconstitution of the signal and by detecting the envelope of the output and supplying feedback to the path amplifying the envelope (the AM path).<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6043707A"><text>US 6,043,707</text></patcit> discloses is a variable-class linear radio-frequency power amplifier, comprising a supply modulation element for applying an envelope supply type of modulation at highest envelope amplitudes to develop an output signal.

An envelope detector is coupled to the input of the power amplifier circuit and produces an envelope signal. An envelope amplifier has a signal input responsive to the envelope signal, an output coupled to the bias input, a control input driven by a control signal, which causes the envelope amplifier to operate in an on state, where the envelope signal is amplified by the envelope amplifier, and the bias input is driven by an amplified replica of the envelope signal, and in an off state, where the envelope amplifier produces a fixed bias which is independent of the envelope signal, and the bias input is driven by the fixed bias. Effectively, this is a Doherty amplifier configuration that has two modes of operation. At amplitude levels below a transition point, the input is amplified by a carrier amplifier with modulated bias. For amplitude levels above the transition point, the input signal is amplified by a combination of two amplifiers in a typical Doherty amplifier operation employing a fixed bias for both the carrier amplifier and the peak amplifier. In the low amplitude level operation, the carrier amplifier receives the entire input signal as input and not components of the input signal.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention.

The present invention relates to an amplification architecture or system according to claim 1 that switches between operation in a component mode and a composite mode.

In the component mode, an input signal is separated into two or more components and transmitted to one or more amplifiers. In the composite mode, a composite signal is amplified <i>via</i> an amplifier (<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>., a linear amplifier). A mode selector controls whether components ("component mode") of the signal are provided to the one or more amplifiers or whether the composite signal ("composite mode") is provided to the amplifier.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an amplification system or architecture 10 in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. The amplification system 10 switches operation between a component mode and a composite mode based on a characteristic of an input signal relative to a threshold level (<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>., envelope amplitude level, digital count representation of signal level, power amplifier power level). For example, the threshold level can be a selected envelope amplitude level or digital count corresponding to the signal envelope level. The amplification system 10 can then operate in a component mode for envelope amplitude levels between an envelope peak voltage and the threshold level, and in a composite mode for envelope amplitude levels at or below the threshold level.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the component mode, the input signal is separated into two or more components of the signal and the two or more components are transmitted over two or more paths to one or more amplifiers 22 in a multi-amplifier system 18. Polar mode is one possible component mode. One or more of these amplifiers can be operated at saturation for high efficiency. If there are two or more amplifiers one or more can be a higher efficiency class of amplifier (e.g. class B, class C, and with appropriately modified inputs class D, E, F, S, or other switching amplifier configurations). In the composite mode, the composite input signal is transmitted over a composite signal path to the multi-amplifier system 18. The composite input signal can then be amplified by an amplifier 20 (<i>e.g.</i>, linear amplifier) operative to amplified signals at or below the threshold level. This allows a smaller (<i>e.g</i>., lower power), less expensive, and more efficient amplifier to be selected for amplification of the composite input signal, such that the amplification system 10 operates with overall improved efficiency and linearity compared to typical amplification systems. It is to be appreciated that the amplifier 20 can be formed from one or more linear amplifiers.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The threshold level of the amplification system 10 can be one or more characteristics associated with the input signal based on a desired efficiency, linearity, distortion and acceptable out-of-band (OOB) emissions of the amplifier system 10. Additionally, the threshold level can be affected by one or more characteristics associated with amplifier system fabrication technology (<i>e.g.</i>, Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), Indium Phosphide (InP), Gallium Nitride (GaN), Silicon (Si), Laterally Diffused Metal Oxide Semiconductors (LDMOS)). Many exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described with respect to the threshold level being a selected envelope amplitude level for illustrative purposes. However, other characteristics (e.g., frequency, phase, or any other readily quantifiable characteristic) associated with the input signal, the multi-amplifier system 18 and/or the fabrication technology can be employed to control the switching of the amplification system 10 between a component mode and a composite mode of operation.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The amplification system 10 includes a digital component 12, such as a programmable logic device, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a digital signal processor (DSP) or a combination of digital hardware and/or software components. The<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> digital component 12 includes a mode selector 14 that continuously (<i>e.g.</i>, in real-time) switches the amplification system 10 between a component mode and a composite mode based on changes in one or more characteristics of an input signal relative to a threshold level. The mode selector 14 receives an input signal that is typically a phase and amplitude modulated signal. The input signal can be in a variety of different amplitude and/or phase modulated forms. For example, the signal can be a signal that conforms to WCDMA, multi-carrier GSM, OFDM or other signals having high peak-to-average power ratios (PAR).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The input signal can be provided to a component converter (not shown) that transforms the input signal into two or more components, such that the two or more components can be amplified and recombined to form an amplified representation of the composite input signal. Alternatively, the input signal can be provided in component form directly to the mode selector 14. The mode selector 14 also receives one or more threshold levels that can be one or more fixed, selectable or programmable characteristics (e.g., envelope amplitude level) associated with the input signal. Although, the mode selector 14 is illustrated as receiving one or more threshold levels, it is to be appreciated that the one or more threshold levels employed by the mode selector 14 can be preprogrammed or programmable, or based on knowledge associated with changes in characteristics associated with the input signal. Additionally, the one or more threshold levels can be fixed or variable.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">A plurality of outputs from the mode selector 14 are provided to a digital-to-analog conversion (DAC) system 16. The plurality of outputs include outputs that provide a set of components, in the component mode, labeled component #1 to component #N, such that recombination of the component #1 through component #N results in the composite signal, where N is an integer greater than or equal to two. The plurality of outputs also include a composite signal output that provides the composite signal to the DAC system 16 in the composite mode. The DAC system 16 converts the components or the composite signal from the digital domain to the analog domain. The analog component signals are provided to one or more amplifiers 22 in the multi-amplifier system 18 for amplification via one or more paths labeled path #1 to path #M,<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> where M is an integer greater than or equal to two. The one or more amplifiers may or may not include the amplifier 20.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The analog composite signal is provided to the amplifier 20 for amplification <i>via</i> a composite signal path in the composite mode.

The amplifier 20 can be selected to be a linear amplifier type (Class-A, Class-AB or Class-B type). The size of the linear amplifier 20 can be selected to handle signals below a predetermined threshold level.<br/>
Therefore, the linear amplifier 20 can be a substantially smaller amplifier than the one or more amplifiers 22 in the multi-amplifier system 18. Although the linear amplifier 20 is typically a single linear amplifier, a multiple amplifier system, including a polar amplifier, and or a combination of polar amplifier and smaller linear amplifier (that amplifies the smallest signals) can be employed to amplify the composite signal based on desired efficiency, cost and linearity. The amplifier 20 need not be composed of devices of the same material as the other amplifiers.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an amplifier system 30 that switches operation between a component mode and a composite mode in accordance with another aspect of the present invention.

The methodology begins at 300 where a threshold level is selected. The threshold level can be, for example, an envelope amplitude level in which the amplifier system operates in a component mode at envelope amplitude levels that are above the threshold level, and in a composite mode at envelope amplitude levels at or below the threshold level. At 310, the input signal is compared to the threshold level. This comparison can be done by monitoring a signal or employing an algorithm that switches mode operation by knowledge associated with the amplitude levels of the input signal. The input signal can be in a number of different single carrier or multi-carrier amplitude and phase modulated signal formats (<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>., WCDMA, GSM, OFDM).</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">At 320, the amplifier system determines if the input signal is above the threshold level. The threshold level can be a signal amplitude level and the component mode selected for envelope amplitudes of the input signal level being above, at or below a selected envelope amplitude threshold level. It is to be appreciated that other<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> signal characteristics can be employed to determine at which portion of the input signal that the amplifier system operates in a component mode and at which portion of the input signal that the amplifier system operates in a composite mode.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">If the input signal is above the threshold level (YES), the methodology proceeds to 330. At 330, predistortion is applied to the components of the input signal. Predistortion adds or removes portions of the input signal to remove anticipated unwanted distortion.

The methodology then proceeds to 340. At 340, the signal components are transmitted to one or more amplifiers for amplification.

The predistortion is applied to the composite input signal separately from the signal components. The methodology then proceeds to 370. At 370, the composite input signal is transmitted to a single amplifier for amplification. The output from the single amplifier is selected, for example, <i>via</i> a switch, at 380.
