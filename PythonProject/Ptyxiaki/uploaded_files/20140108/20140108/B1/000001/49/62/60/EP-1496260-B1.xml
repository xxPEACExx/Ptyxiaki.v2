More particularly, the present invention relates to plural compressors disposed within a single shell which are driven by the same motor and more particularly to a scroll machine as defined in the preamble of Claim 1. Such a machine is known e.g. from <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP11141483A"><text>JP-A-11141483</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Due to energy cost and conservation, there is a demand for refrigerant motor-compressor units which have an output which can be varied in accordance with demand. To satisfy this demand, many different systems have been proposed. One such system involves the unloading of one or more cylinders in a multi-cylinder compressor or the varying of re-expansion volume for the purpose of varying the output of the compressor system. These systems tend to be relatively complex and the efficiency of the compressor system in the unloaded state is not optimum. Variable speed compressors have also been used, but they require expensive controls and also the speed control and motor-compressor efficiency present some efficiency issues at least when operating in a reduced output condition.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Compressor systems have also been developed which, in place of a single compressor large enough to carry the maximum load, include a plurality of smaller motor-compressors having a combined output equal to the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> required maximum. These multi-compressor systems include means for controlling the total system in such a manner as to selectively activate and deactivate less than all of the compressors when it is desired to vary the output. These multi-compressor units have good efficiency but they require complex hook-up plumbing, including means for dealing with lubricating oil management in order to ensure that all the oil remains equally distributed between each of the compressors.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Further development of the multi-compressor systems has included the incorporation of a plurality of standard motor compressor units in a common shell. The common shell maximizes the compactness of the system and provides a common oil sump for equal oil distribution, a common suction gas inlet and a common discharge gas outlet. These single shell multi-compressor units have proved to be acceptable in the marketplace but they tend to be relatively large and the means for controlling the total system is still somewhat complex.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The continued development of multi-compressor systems has been directed towards reducing the overall costs and the overall size as well as simplifying the control systems which dictate the output quantity of these systems.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention provides a scroll machine according to claim 1. Thus, the art is provided with a dual compressor system with one compressor being located at opposite ends of a common drive shaft. A motor rotor is preferably press fit to the center portion of the drive shaft and the motor rotor is ideally disposed within a motor stator. Thus, both<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> compressors can be powered by the same motor. The control of the output of the embodied dual compressor system is accomplished by a variable speed motor or by a pulsed width modulation (PWM) capacity control system incorporated into one or both of the two compressors. When incorporating a variable speed motor for capacity control, the capacity can be varied from 0% to 100%. When incorporating the PWM capacity control system into one of the compressors, the capacity can be varied from 50% to 100%. When incorporating the PWM capacity control system into both compressors, the capacity can be varied from 0% to 100%. The capacity of one or both of the compressors can be increased to approximately 120% of capacity using vapor injection to increase the range of the dual compressor system if desired.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter.

Discharge fitting 114 is threadingly received or otherwise secured within open recess 78. Discharge fitting 114 defines an internal cavity 126 and a plurality of discharge passages 128. A discharge valve 130 is disposed below fitting 114 and below cavity 126. Thus, pressurized gas overcomes the biasing load of discharge valve 130 to open discharge valve 130 and allowing the pressurized gas to flow into cavity 126, through passages 128 and into discharge pressure chamber 80.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0003">3 and 4</figref>, the assembly of discharge fitting 114 and piston 116 is shown in greater detail. Discharge fitting 114 defines an annular flange 134. Seated against flange 134 is a lip seal 136 and a floating retainer 138. Piston 116 is press fit or otherwise secured to discharge fitting 114 and piston 116 defines an annular flange 140 which sandwiches seal 136 and retainer 138 between flange 140 and flange 134. Discharge fitting 114 defines a passageway 142 and an orifice 144 which extends through discharge fitting 114 to fluidically connect discharge pressure<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> chamber 80 with a pressure chamber 146 defined by discharge fitting 114, piston 116, seal 136, retainer 138 and end cap 14. Shell fitting 118 is secured within a bore defined by end cap 14 and slidingly receives the assembly of discharge fitting 114, piston 116, seal 136 and retainer 138. Pressure chamber 146 is fluidically connected to solenoid valve 120 by tube 150 and with suction fitting 18 and thus suction pressure chamber 90 through a tube 152. The combination of piston 116, seal 136 and floating retainer 138 provides a self-centering sealing system to provide accurate alignment with the internal bore of shell fitting 118. Seal 136 and floating retainer 138 include sufficient radial compliance such that any misalignment between the internal bore of shell fitting 118 and the internal bore of open recess 78 within which discharge fitting 114 is secured is accommodated by seal 136 and floating retainer 138.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In order to bias non-orbiting scroll member 70 into sealing engagement with orbiting scroll member 56 for normal full load operation, solenoid valve 120 is deactivated (or it is activated) by control module 122 in response to sensor array 124 to block fluid flow between tubes 150 and tube 152. In this position, chamber 146 is in communication with discharge pressure chamber 80 through passageway 142 and orifice 144. The pressurized fluid at discharge pressure within chambers 80 and 146 will act against opposite sides of piston 16 thus allowing for the normal biasing of non-orbiting scroll member 70 towards orbiting scroll member 56 to sealingly engage the axial ends of each scroll member with the respective end plate of the opposite scroll member. The<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> axial sealing of the two scroll members 56 and 70 causes compressor system 110 to operate at 100% capacity.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In order to unload compressor system 110, solenoid valve 120 will be actuated (or it will be deactuated) by control module 122 in response to sensor array 124. When solenoid valve 120 is actuated (or unactuated), suction pressure chamber 90 is in direct communication with chamber 146 through suction fitting 18, tube 152, solenoid valve 120 and tube 150. With the discharge pressure pressurized fluid released to suction from chamber 146, the pressure difference on opposite sides of piston 116 will move non-orbiting scroll member 70 to the right as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> to separate the axial end of the tips of each scroll member with its respective end plate and the higher pressurized pockets will bleed to the lower pressurized pockets and eventually to suction pressure chamber 90. Orifice 144 is incorporated to control the flow of discharge gas between discharge pressure chamber 80 and chamber 146. Thus, when chamber 146 is connected to the suction side of the compressor, the pressure difference on opposite sides of piston 116 will be created. A wave spring 160 is incorporated to maintain the sealing relationship between floating seal assembly 84 and partition 22 during modulation of non-orbiting scroll member 70. When a gap is created between the two scroll members 56 and 70, the continued compression of the suction gas will be eliminated. When this unloading occurs, discharge valve 130 will move to its closed position thereby preventing the backflow of high pressurized fluid from discharge pressure chamber 80 or the downstream refrigeration system. When compression of the suction gas is to be<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> resumed, solenoid valve 120 will be deactuated (or it will be actuated) to again block fluid flow between tubes 150 and 152 allowing chamber 146 to be pressurized by discharge pressure chamber 80 through passageway 142 and orifice 144.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Control module 122 is in communication with sensor array 124 to provide the required information for control module 122 to determine the degree of unloading required for the particular conditions of the refrigeration system including compressor system 110 existing at that time. Based upon this information, control module 122 will operate solenoid valve 120 in a pulsed width modulation mode to alternately place chamber 146 in communication with discharge pressure chamber 80 and suction pressure chamber 90. The frequency with which solenoid valve 120 is operated in the pulsed width modulated mode will determine the percent capacity of operation of one set of scrolls 56 and 70 of compressor system 110. As the sensed conditions change, control module 122 will vary the frequency of operation for solenoid valve 120 and thus the relative time periods at which one set of scrolls 56 and 70 of compressor system 110 is operated in a loaded and unloaded condition. The varying of the frequency of operation of solenoid valve 120 can cause the operation of one set of scrolls 58 and 70 between fully loaded or 100% capacity and completely unloaded or 0% capacity or at any of an infinite number of settings in between in response to system demands. This has the effect of varying the capacity of compressor system 110 between 50% and 100%.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 5</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0003">6</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">7</figref>, a fluid injection system 168 for compressor system 110 is shown in greater detail.
