load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">Technical Field</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for activating the surface of a base material and an apparatus thereof, which is suited to be utilized for pretreatment in electrochemical treatment such as, for example, electroplating and the like, in which the surface of a base material such as metal can be subjected to degreasing treatment and oxide film removing treatment simultaneously, efficiently and rationally, in which productivity can be enhanced and the equipment cost can be reduced, and in which a waste solution can be rationalized so that the solution can be reutilized and the environmental pollution can be prevented.</p><heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In electrochemical treatment such as, for example, electroplating or the like, oil and fat portion and oxide film on the surface of metal as substance to be treated are removed by degreasing cleaning and acid pickling in its pretreatment step. In doing so, the metal surface is activated so that a good metal film can be coated on the metal surface.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The degreasing and cleaning is executed in such a manner as to dip a substance to be treated in an aqueous alkali solution, while the acid<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> pickling is executed in such a manner as to dip a substance to be treated in an acidic aqueous solution which is prepared by diluting sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid. Thereafter, the substance to be treated is cleaned with water. Then, an acidic or alkaline chemical is put into the waste water to neutralize it and thereafter, the neutralized water is discharged from the factory.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Accordingly, the conventional pretreatment step requires a specific bath vessel and a specific water cleaning vessel. Thus, the equipment becomes large in scale, and various kinds of chemicals and a large quantity of water are required. Thus, the treatment cost is increased. Moreover, a water cleaning step is required between the degreasing treatment step and the acid pickling step, Thus, long time is required and productivity is lowered. In addition, heavy metal such as lead, zinc and the like cannot be removed in the neutralizing treatment. Thus, a water discharge equipment is required and so, the equipment cost is increased.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Moreover, in the conventional pretreatment step, work is forced to do under such inferior circumstances that the treatment solution is scattered and toxic gas is generated. In addition, there is such a problem that the substance to be treated is risked to get hydrogen brittleness by hydrogen gas which is generated in the acid pickling step. So, it is required another means for removing the hydrogen brittleness.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to solve those problems, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2000007319A"><text>2000-7319</text></patcit> discloses a method in which a solution containing phosphine as an organic solvent is utilized, a substance to be treated is dipped in this solution or this solution is coated on the substance<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> by a brush or spray, thereby removing oil and fat portion and oxide film without a need of dangerous and/or toxic chemicals such as strong acid, cyan, etc and without substantially collapsing a base material.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, the above-mentioned phosphine is expensive so that the production cost is increased and in addition, the oil and fat and the oxide film can not be removed to the satisfactory extent.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Incidentally, there are disclosed cleaning methods as a method for cleaning semiconductors, precision machine parts, etc., for example, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2000308862A"><text>2000-308862</text></patcit> and<patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JPH11207276B"><text> H11-207276</text></patcit> among others, in which a supercritical fluid and a subcritical high concentration fluid are utilized as a cleaning solvent.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The former method can cope with the removal of oil and fat stuck to machine parts, etc. but it can not cope with the removal of oxide film formed on the machine parts, etc. In that case, another step for removing the oxide film is required. Thus, productivity is decreased and the equipment cost is increased.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The latter method includes a compressor capable of generating supercritical carbon dioxide, a heater, a reaction container capable of receiving therein a substance to be treated and an oil and fat portion recovery tower for releasing the supercritical state and having an oil and fat recovery member filled therein, those components being connected to each other through a circulation pipe.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The supercritical carbon dioxide is fed into the reaction container to remove the oil and fat portion stuck to the substance to be treated. Thereafter, the supercritical carbon dioxide with the oil and fat portion<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> dissolved therein is fed into the oil and fat portion recovery tower where the pressure is reduced to release the supercritical state so that the oil and fat portion is recovered. On the other hand, the liquid-state or gas-state carbon dioxide, from which the oil and fat portion has been recovered, is fed into the compressor to generate, once again, the supercritical carbon dioxide and the supercritical carbon dioxide thus generated is reutilized.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">However, although the above-mentioned method can cope with the removal of oil and fat portion stuck to the machine parts, etc., it can not cope with the removal of oxide film formed on the machine parts, etc. In that case, another step for removing the oxide film is required. Thus, productivity is decreased and the equipment cost is increased. Moreover, the oil and fat portion recovery member of the oil and fat portion recovery tower is clogged with the passage of time and therefore, replacement is required.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Moreover, as another method, there is known a method in which carbon dioxide as a cleaning medium is pressurized and the pressurized carbon dioxide is jetted from a cleaning gun so as to be thermally expanded. Then, dry ice in the form of particle is sprayed to the surface of the member to be cleaned, so that the oil and fat portion stuck to the surface of the member is blown off.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">However, here again, this method can cope with the removal of oil and fat portion but it can not cope with the removal of oxide film. Moreover, there is such a problem that after the dry ice is sublimated, it is released to the air.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP6306655A"><text>JP 6306655 A</text></patcit> teaches that water is mixed with carbon dioxide to form carbonated water and that a workpiece may be washed by contacting with the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> carbonated water.

Owing to the above-mentioned construction, an oxide film removing solution can easily and inexpensively be prepared with an inexpensive material. Moreover, by properly adjusting the above-mentioned pressurizing state, an oxide film removing solution having a desired acidity concentration can easily be prepared.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Also, the present invention provides a method for activating a surface of a base material, wherein the oxide film removing solution is contacted with the member to be treated, thereby removing an oxide film from the member to be treated. Owing to this arrangement, the oxide film can easily and surely be removed.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Moreover, the present invention provides a method for activating a surface of a base material, wherein the carbon dioxide is finely particulated and the fine particulate carbon dioxide is contacted with the member to be treated, thereby separating or peeling off oil and stuck to the surface of the member. Owing to this arrangement, the precision for removing oil and fat stuck to the surface of the substance to be treated is enhanced in comparison with the oil and fat treatment according to the conventional dipping method.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The present invention provides a method for activating a surface of a base material, wherein the oxide film removing treatment and the degreasing treatment are simultaneously executed. Owing to this<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> arrangement, the treatments can effectively inexpensively and rationally be executed, the productivity can be enhanced and the equipment cost can be reduced in comparison with the conventional treatment method in which those treatments are executed separately.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Also, the present invention provides a method for activating a surface of a base material, wherein the member to be treated is received in a hermetically closed space or open space, and then subjected to oxide film removing treatment and degreasing treatment simultaneously. Owing to this arrangement, the method of the present invention can meet with various working conditions.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Moreover, the present invention provides a method for activating a surface of a base material, wherein the water and the carbon dioxide are stirred. Owing to this arrangement, the degreasing treatment and the oxide film removing treatment can efficiently be executed.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The present invention provides a method for activating a surface of a base material, wherein the water is sprayed and the carbon dioxide is supplied during the spraying operation. Owing to this arrangement, the contact surface between the water and the carbon dioxide can be enlarged and the dissolving degree of the carbon dioxide can be enhanced.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The present invention provides a method for activating a surface of a base material, wherein after the degreasing treatment or the oxide film removing treatment, the treatment solution is reduced in pressure and discharged. Owing to this arrangement, the dissolving degree of the carbon dioxide is lowered and the degree of acidity of the oxide film removing solution is lowered so that the utilized treatment solution can<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> rationally be processed and its safety is ensured thereby realizing its discharge into the drainage.

The inner surface of the bath vessel 1 is lined with a vinyl chloride or hard rubber.

Since the construction is simple, the apparatus ca an be manufactured easily and inexpensively.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Moreover, the treatment solution which has been subjected to the above-mentioned various treatments is decomposed into water and carbon dioxide by the storage tank 16 as later described. Then, after removing the trashes such as oxide film deposited in the treatment solution, the resultant can be reutilized. Accordingly, the effective utilization and the reduction of consumption can be achieved.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Next, in case the degreasing treatment and the oxide film removing treatment are executed by the activating apparatus, the member 3 to be treated is received in the bath vessel 1. After the lid 2 is attached to the bath vessel 1 to hermetically close the vessel 1, the water 5 is supplied from the water source 7 into the bath vessel 1 and the member 3 is dipped in the water 5.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">After a predetermined quantity of the water 5 is supplied into the bath vessel 1, carbon dioxide is supplied from the gas container 10 into the bath vessel 1 and pressurized by the compression pump 12 and then, the water 5 is heated through the heater 9. Before or after this operation, the stirring element 4 is actuated to stir the water 5.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Consequently, the carbon dioxide in the water 5 is finely particulated and moved at a high speed. A large quantity of the fine particulate carbon dioxide is collided with the member 3 to degrease the surface of the member 3 by peeling off the oil and fat stacked to the surface<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> of the member 3.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">In this case, the carbon dioxide is supplied into the bath vessel 1 through its lower part and ascended in the form of bubbling within the water 5. Thus, the carbon dioxide is rapidly dissolved in the water 5 and saturated, thereby enhancing the increase in dissolving degree. Moreover, with the help of the stirring element 4, a uniform and precision stirring effect can be obtained and the degreasing action is promoted.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Instead of the above-mentioned method, if the water is sprayed into the bath vessel 1 in a mist manner and at the same time, if the carbon dioxide is supplied thereto, the contact surface is more enlarged to enhance the increase of the dissolving degree and a precision stirring effect can be obtained. Thus, the above-mentioned degreasing action is further promoted.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">Simultaneous with the stirring, the carbon dioxide is dissolved in the water 5 to generate carbon (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>). Thus, the water 5 shows acidity.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">In this case, since the carbon dioxide is pressurized to a high pressure level, its dissolving in the water 5 is accelerated and its dissolving amount is in proportion to the pressure.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">Accordingly, the acidity of the water 5 is increased rapidly to the acidity level (PH3 to 4) which is large enough for acid pickling. Then, the water 5 having such a level of acidity as just mentioned contacts the oxide film formed on the surface of the member 3 to be treated, so that oxide film is decomposed and removed.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Moreover, since the water 5 is heated, dissolving of the carbon dioxide is accelerated to enhance the increase of the degree of acidity, and<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> the decomposing action of the oxide film is accelerated.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">In this way, the degreasing of the member 3 to be treated and the removing of the oxide film are simultaneously executed, and the oil and fat portion and the oxide film are precipitated on the bottom portion of the bath vessel 1.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">After the above-mentioned pretreatment is executed and a sufficient degreasing and oxide film removing effect is obtained, the supply of the carbon dioxide is stopped to stop the driving of the stirring element 4 and the stop valve 15 is opened.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">By doing so, the pressure within the bath vessel 1 is reduced to lower the dissolving degree of the carbon dioxide. Then, the treatment solution is pushed into the storage tank 5 guided by the communication tube 14. When the total quantity of the treatment solution has been shifted into the storage tank 5, the stop valve 15 is closed. This state is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Since the storing solution 18 in the storage tank 5 is reduced in pressure and the dissolving degree of the carbon dioxide is lowered, acidic concentration of the solution 18 is rapidly reduced and becomes to show weak acidity, which means the solution becomes practically harmless.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">So, the stop valve 25 can be opened and the storing solution 18 can be discharged directly to the drainage through the discharge tube 24.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">At that time, when a heavy metal is present within the storing solution 18, the heavy metal is separated from the carbonated water because the carbon dioxide disappears from the solution 18 and the separated heavy metal is precipitated within the tank 5.<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --></p><p id="p0083" num="0083">Accordingly, the heavy metal can be recovered through a filter (not shown) disposed at the discharge tube 24 together with other foreign matter and the oxide film. Thus, safety of the discharged water is ensured and the environmental pollution can be prevented. The recovered heavy metal, etc. can be treated just like the normal wastes.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">On the other hand, the present invention can reutilize the storing solution 18. In that event, the heater 17 is heated so that the temperature of the storing solution 18 in the storage tank 5 is raised to approximately 50 degrees C.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">By doing so, the carbonated water contained in the storing solution 18 is decomposed into carbon dioxide and water. The decomposed carbon dioxide and water are separated into gas-liquid two layers. That is, the carbon dioxide in a gas state is located at an upper position and the water is located at a lower position.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Thus, when the stop valves 21, 22 are opened, the decomposed carbon dioxide and water are moved respectively into the bath vessel 1 and the compression pump 12 through the return pipes 19, 20, so that they can be reutilized.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">At that time, heavy metal, oxide film and foreign matter are removed from the carbon dioxide and water through the filter 23 inserted in the return pipes 19, 20.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">In that event, since the carbon dioxide is completely removed from the storing solution 18 by the above-mentioned decomposition, the heavy metal, the oxide film, etc. are completely precipitated. Thus, the precipitated heavy metal, etc. can be recovered with precision.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --></p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Since the storage tank 16 and the bath vessel 1 are constructed substantially in the same manner, it is also accepted that, for example, another member to be treated is received in the storage tank 16, the storing solution 18 is introduced into the storage tank 16, a high pressure carbon dioxide is supplied into the tank 16 from the gas container 10, the water 5 is also supplied into the tank 16 from the water supply source 7, and the inside of the tank 16 is set to the above-mentioned pressure and temperature conditions. By doing so, the degreasing treatment and the oxide film removing treatment can be executed with respect to the member 3 to be treated also in the tank 16. Thus, the productivity is enhanced.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">After the above-mentioned treatment in the storage tank 16, the degree of contamination of the storing solution 18 is checked. If contamination is found as a result of checking, the pressure is lowered so that the storing solution 18 becomes to show weak acidity. Thereafter, the solution 18 is discharged into the drainage.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">On the other hand, if the degree of contamination of the storing solution 18 is not heavy, the tank 16 is reduced in pressure and the storing solution 18 is decomposed into water and carbon dioxide so that they can be reutilized.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">If the pressure of the carbon dioxide within the bath vessel 1 or storage tank 16 and the heating temperatures by the heaters 9, 17 are set as higher as possible, the degreasing treatment and the oxide film removing treatment can be executed with precision and in an efficient manner.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">Accordingly, if the carbon dioxide is made into a supercritical state, the degreasing treatment and the oxide film removing treatment can be<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> executed with increased precision and in a more efficient manner.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">In the present invention, since the degreasing treatment and the oxide film removing treatment are simultaneously executed with respect to the member 3 to be treated using such inexpensive materials as water and carbon dioxide and no complicated water cleaning treatment is required, this type of treatment work can be made easily and rapidly. Thus, the productivity is enhanced.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">Also, since toxic alkali and acidic chemicals, which have been conventionally required, are no more required as a medium for the degreasing treatment and the oxide film removing treatment, the inferior working conditions as under harmful gas generation can be improved and the treatments can be executed safely, rapidly and easily.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">Moreover, the treatment solution after being utilized for the degreasing and oxide film removing treatment can be treated safely and rapidly, and the rationalization and safety of the treatment solution are ensured.
