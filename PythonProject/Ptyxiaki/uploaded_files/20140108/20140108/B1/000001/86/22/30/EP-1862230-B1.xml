<ul><li>a frame;</li><li>a carrousel, rotating relative to said frame;</li><li>a plurality of nozzles associated with the carrousel, fed with a washing fluid and co-operating with means for gripping the containers to inject the fluid into the containers;</li><li>a plurality of valves associated with the carrousel and operatively connected to corresponding nozzles to enable them / disable them, each valve being provided with a control element movable between a first and a second operative position, corresponding to stable open / closed positions of the valve;</li><li>means for activating / deactivating the valves.</li></ul></p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Within the food industry, and in particular in the sector of bottling, i.e. filling containers, use is made of apparatuses dedicated to cleaning and/or conditioning (and possibly sterilising) containers to be filled.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It should be noted that, with regard to the treatment of containers, i.e. cleaning and/or conditioning containers, use of both liquid and gaseous fluids is known. If gaseous fluids are used to condition the containers, said apparatuses are also called "blowers" and the washing fluid is properly defined blowing fluid.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Said apparatuses generally comprise a carrousel, rotating relative to a frame. Operatively, the carrousel receives from a feeding star the containers to be treated and transfers them to an output star, at the end of the treatment, in a continuous process.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The carrousel comprises a plurality of nozzles, in order to enable a plurality of<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> containers to be treated simultaneously. To each nozzle corresponds a pincer, able to withdraw a container from the feeding star, actuate it to prepare it for washing and place it to be fed to the output star.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The actuation of the containers substantially consists of a 180 degree overturn, so that, in said overturned position, the opening of each container is aligned to a nozzle, so the nozzle itself can inject the washing or blowing fluid into the container.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">After the washing operation, each container is maintained in the overturned position, in a dripping step; subsequently, the pincers again overturn the containers, to then feed them to the output star. It should be noted that, if the treatment fluid is gaseous, said dripping step is omitted.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Since the nozzles and the pincers are integral with the carrousel and rotate therewith, the steps of withdrawing, washing, dripping (if provided) and transferring the containers to the output correspond to respective angles of rotation of the carrousel. In particular, for each nozzle, with regard to the washing of a container, i.e. the step during which the nozzle injects the washing fluid into the container, the corresponding wash angle (also called flux angle) is given by the position of the nozzle (rotating integrally with the carrousel) relative to the frame between the initial and final instants of the injection of the fluid. Therefore, the duration of the washing step is proportional to the wash angle and inversely proportional to the velocity of rotation of the carrousel relative to the frame. Similarly, the duration of each of said steps is proportional to the angle corresponding to that step and inversely proportional to the velocity of rotation of the carrousel relative to the frame.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">With regard to the need to enable / disable the nozzles, a plurality of valves<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> associated with the carrousel is generally used. Each valve is connected to a corresponding nozzle; consequently, an activation / deactivation of a valve entails the enabling / disabling of the corresponding nozzle.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">With regard to the manner of activation / deactivation of the vales, several solutions are known.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Some solutions provide for activating / deactivating the valves mechanically, e.g. using cams. While having the merit of being economical, such solutions are disadvantageous, because they require the use of members subject to wear (by rubbing), with the consequent reduction in the reliability of the apparatus; moreover, said solutions require the presence of lubricating means, which present problems also in terms of hygiene.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Other solutions allow, in effect, to avoid the presence of mechanical members. In particular, in the prior art (as described in the patent application PR2004C000048) use is known of a permanent magnet, fastened to the frame at the washing angle, said magnet being able to interact with a valve, when the valve transits above the magnet itself. The action of the magnet is to actuate the valve from a closed position to an open position, the valve being monostable and in particular of the normally closed type. In this way, when the valve, in its own rotation integral with the carrousel, is in position of non interference relative to the magnet, the action of the magnet itself ceases and the valve closes.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">However, said solution presents some drawbacks.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">First of all, it requires a magnet of considerable dimensions, because it has to cover the entire wash angle, with consequent increase in the costs and in the magnetic forces at play. Moreover, said solution does not allow to change the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> wash angle. It should be noted that the possibility of changing the wash angle is important for two reasons. The first reason is the need to vary the washing time according to the dimensions of the treated containers. The second reason is given by the need to maintain constant the washing time (for a certain type of treated containers) as the velocity of rotation of the carrousel changes (said velocity of rotation depends on the hourly rate requirements in the container treatment process), to optimise conditioning fluid consumption and reduce the operating costs of the plant.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Other solutions (e.g., the one described in the patent application PR2002A000066) provide for the use of solenoid valves, electrically actuated by receivers, associated with the carrousel, interacting with corresponding emitters, associated with the frame. While such solutions provide for a non continuous adjustment of the washing angle, they are complicated and costly, because of the use of solenoid valves and of electrical / electronic circuits for the control of the valves themselves.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Moreover, the use of electrical devices in the presence of free liquids or of damp environments is hazardous, because it can cause short circuits.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">An additional disadvantage is given by the presence of emitters and receivers, which considerably complicate the construction of the machine and its control during operation.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A further disadvantage is given by the fact that said emitters and receivers are subject to malfunctions caused by possible dirt deposits.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">An object of the present invention is to eliminate the aforesaid drawbacks and to make available an apparatus for washing / sterilising / blowing containers that is able to command the opening / closing of the valves without mechanical parts in<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> rubbing contact.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Another object of the present invention is to make available an apparatus for washing / sterilising / washing containers that enables to regulate the wash angle, i.e. the time during which the containers are subjected to washing, in continuous or discrete fashion, without stopping the apparatus.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Yet a further object of the present invention is to make available an apparatus for washing / sterilising / blowing containers that is simple, economical and reliable.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE4207346A1"><text>DE 42 07 346 A1</text></patcit> discloses an apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1.

It should be noted that what is described and illustrated below also applies for apparatuses for blowing containers, i.e. conditioning apparatuses that use gaseous fluids for washing containers. The characteristics and the technical problems described for washing or sterilising containers are the same, in the case of blowing the containers. Preferably, the blowing apparatuses are used in the cases in which no liquid residue in the container is tolerated, e.g. when bottling liquor or oil for<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> human consumption.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">With regard to the treatment fluid, it will indifferently be constituted:
<ul><li>by a cleaning / sterilising fluid (in particular a liquid);</li><li>by a gaseous fluid (for blowing), in particular air, steam, sterilising or inert gases.</li></ul></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The apparatus 1 comprises a frame 3, a carrousel 4 rotating relative to said frame 3, a plurality of nozzles (not shown because they are known in themselves) associated with the carrousel 4, fed with a washing or blowing fluid and co-operating with means (also not shown because they are known in themselves) for gripping the containers 2 to inject the fluid into the containers, washing them. The gripping means can be constituted for example by pincers.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The apparatus 1 operates continuously; in particular, the gripping means withdraw the containers 2 to be washed from a feeding star 5, moving each container 2 in such a way as to align it to a corresponding nozzle (in general, they overturn it); subsequently, the containers 2 are kept overturned for a certain distance, to enable their dripping; lastly, the gripping means transfer each container 2 to an output star 6, overturning the containers 2 again.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">It should be noted that the nozzles and the gripping means are integral with the carrousel 4 and rotate therewith; therefore, there are defined steps of withdrawing, washing, dripping and transferring the containers 2 to the output, which correspond to respective angles of rotation of the carrousel: angle of withdrawal / overturn α, wash angle β, drip angle γ and transfer / overturn angle δ , respectively.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">It should be noted that, in the case of a blowing apparatus, the dripping step is not generally included, whilst the other steps are provided. Alternatively, the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> drip step is replaced by a short dwell step, to promote the escape of the injected air and of the removed particles.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In particular, for each nozzle, with regard to the washing of a container 2, i.e. the step during which the nozzle injects the washing fluid into the container 2, the corresponding washing angle β is determined by the position of the nozzle relative to the frame 3 between the initial and final instants of the injection of the fluid. Therefore, the duration of the washing step is proportional to the wash angle β and inversely proportional to the velocity of rotation of the carrousel 4 relative to the frame 3. Similarly, the duration of each of said steps is proportional to the angle corresponding to that step and inversely proportional to the velocity of rotation of the carrousel 4 relative to the frame 3.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The apparatus 1 also comprises a plurality of valves 7 associated with the carrousel 4 and operatively connected to corresponding nozzles to enable them / disable them.

In particular, when the control element 8 is in the first operative open position on the membrane 9 the thruster does not act, this allowing the passage of wash liquid in the conduit 10; when the control element 8 is in the second operative closed position, the membrane 9 is deformed, in such a way as to close / shut off the conduit 10, preventing the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> passage of wash liquid in the conduit 10 itself.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">It should be noted that, in the apparatus 1, to each nozzle corresponds a gripping means and a valve 7, integral with the carrousel 4 and co-operating with each other, in order to perform, for each rotation of the carrousel 4, a treatment on a single corresponding container 2.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Moreover, the apparatus 1 comprises means for activating / deactivating the valves 7, the activation / deactivation of each valve 7 defining said initial and final instants of the injection of the wash fluid into the container 2 corresponding to the valve 7 itself.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Said means for activating / deactivating the valves 7 originally comprise:

When the valve 7 is in the inactive position, the washing liquid, because the conduit 10 is shut off, exercises a pressure on a reduced surface of the membrane 9, so the force that acts on the thruster 8 is relatively modest; in particular, said force is insufficient to overcome the action of the spring 14, therefore leaving the thruster 8 in the second operative position.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Thus, the valve 7 is bistable because it tends to remain in the active position or in the inactive position, in the absence of an intervention of forces from outside the valve itself.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">It should be noted that in the washing apparatus 1 according to the present<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> invention any type of bistable valve can be applied, not necessarily of the type comprising a membrane as described above.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">When a valve 7 is in proximity to the opening magnet 11, a magnetic force is established between the opening magnet 11 and the control element 8, so that the control element 8 is actuated towards the first operative position, whereto corresponds the active position of the valve 7.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In the illustrated embodiment, said magnetic force is established between the opening magnet 11 and the permanent magnet 13 comprised in the control element 8 (or associated to the control element 8).
