As image formation signals are sequentially given to a laser diode (unshown), the laser diode projects a beam of image formation light 51 (51Y, 51M, 51C, 51K) reflecting the image formation signals to the polygon mirror 52 (52YM, 52CK), which is being rotated at a high speed. The image formation light 51 is reflected (deflected) by the polygon mirror 52 (52YM, 52CK), and then, is reflected (deflected) by a reflective mirror 54 (54Y, 54M, 54C, 54K). Then, the image formation light 51 is guided through the focal lens 53 (53Y, 53M, 53C, 53K) onto the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 21, which is being rotated a predetermined peripheral velocity. As the image formation light 51 reaches the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 21, the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 21 are selectively exposed, forming thereby an electrostatic latent image on the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 21.</p><heading id="h0010">[Developing Means]</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --><p id="p0044" num="0044">The developing means 25 (25Y, 25M, 25C and 25K) contain, as described above, color developers (color toners) of yellow Y, magenta M, cyan C, and black K, respectively, for visualizing the electrostatic latent image, in an associated toner container 27b.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">During the development, the toner contained is conveyed to the toner supply roller 25b by the toner conveying member 28.
