The invention provides devices, systems, and methods for measurement and correction of optical errors of optical systems, and is particularly well suited for correcting refractive optical aberrations of the eye.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Known laser eye surgery procedures generally employ an ultraviolet or infrared laser to remove a microscopic layer of stromal tissue from the cornea of the eye. Examples of laser eye surgery procedures include photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), laser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK), and the like. A laser typically removes a selected shape of a corneal tissue, often to correct refractive errors of an eye. Ultraviolet laser ablation results in photodecomposition of a corneal tissue, but generally does not cause significant thermal damage to adjacent and underlying tissues of an eye. Irradiated molecules are broken into smaller volatile fragments photochemically, directly breaking intermolecular bonds.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Laser ablation procedures can remove a targeted amount stroma of a cornea to change a cornea's contour for varying purposes, such as for correcting myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and the like. Control over a distribution of ablation energy across a cornea may be provided by a variety of systems and methods, including use of ablatable masks, fixed and moveable apertures, controlled scanning systems, eye movement tracking mechanisms, and the like. In known systems, a laser beam often comprises a series of discrete pulses of laser light energy, with a total shape and amount of tissue removed being determined by a shape, size, location, and/or number of laser energy pulses impinging on a cornea. A variety of algorithms may be used to calculate the pattern of laser pulses used to reshape a cornea so as to correct a refractive error of an eye. Known systems make use of a variety of forms of lasers and laser energy to effect a correction, including infrared lasers, ultraviolet lasers, femtosecond lasers, wavelength multiplied solid-state lasers, and the like. Alternative vision correction techniques make use of radial incisions in a cornea, intraocular lenses, removable corneal support structures, and the like.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Known corneal correction treatment methods have generally been successful in correcting standard vision errors, such as myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and the like. By customizing an ablation pattern based on wavefront measurements, it may be possible to correct minor aberrations so as to reliably and repeatedly provide visual acuity greater than 20/20. Such detailed corrections will benefit from an extremely accurate ablation of tissue.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Known methods for calculation of a customized ablation pattern using wavefront sensor data generally involves mathematically modeling a surface of the cornea using expansion series techniques. More specifically, Zernike polynomials have been employed to model the corneal surface and refractive aberrations of the eye. Coefficients of a Zernike polynomial are derived through known fitting techniques, and an optical correction procedure is then determined using a shape indicated by a mathematical series expansion model.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Work in connection with the present invention suggests that the known methodology for determining laser ablation treatments based on wavefront sensor data and spectacles may be less than ideal. The known techniques typically do not take into account a detailed ablative interaction of a laser beam with a detailed anatomy of a tissue surface of an eye.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In light of the above, it would be desirable to provide improved ablation techniques, particularly for refractive correction purposes.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO0185075A"><text>WO 01/85075</text></patcit> describes a method for producing a control program for a device used for performing corneal eye surgery in which a laser beam spot is guided in a locally controlled and time controlled manner over a cornea to be photorefractively corrected in order to ablate a predetermined ablation profile on the cornea. During the production of the control program, the influence of the angle formed between the laser beam and the surface of the cornea on the energy density of the laser beam spot impinging upon the surface of the cornea and/or on the reflected-away portion of the laser beam impinging upon the surface of the eye is taken into consideration. Thus, the computer is programmed in such a way that it compensates for a reduced ablation depth resulting from oblique incidence by sending a correspondingly greater number of laser beam pulses to the relevant locations so as to achieve the desired photo ablation profile.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO0150945A"><text>WO 01/50945</text></patcit> describes a laser system and techniques which compensate for laser fluence drop off or losses of irradiation as an ablating laser is traversed on a curved surface, for example on corneal tissue. The ablating laser system compensates for fluence differentials from pulse-to-pulse by adjusting an appropriate parameter of a laser beam. The number of pulses imparted<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> in the periphery, the size or shape of the ablating laser beam is adjusted with, e.g., a variable aperture placed in the beam delivery path, by changing a magnification of relay optics in the beam delivery path, or by increasing a number of ablation spots in peripheral portions of an ablation zone as compared with the number of ablation spots in the central portion of the ablation zone.</p><heading id="h0002">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention is set out in the appended claims.

Preferably, the present invention can provide enhanced optical accuracy of refractive procedures by improving a corneal ablation of a refractive treatment program. Hence, while the system and methods described herein are described primarily in a context of a laser eye surgery system, it should be understood that the described techniques mary be adapted for use in alternative eye treatment procedures and systems such as spectacle lenses, intraocular lenses, contact lenses, corneal ring implants, collagenous corneal tissue thermal remodeling, and the like.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The described techniques can be readily adapted for use with existing laser systems, wavefront sensors, corneal topography systems, phoropters and other optical measurement devices. By providing a more detailed (and hence, less prone to alignment and other errors) methodology for determining a laser treatment plan, the present invention may facilitate sculpting of the cornea so that treated eyes regularly exceed a normal 20/20 threshold of desired vision.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As used herein an "optical tissue surface" may encompass a theoretical tissue surface derived from an optical measurement of light refraction of an eye (exemplified by wavefront sensor data and manifest refraction data), an actual tissue surface, and/or a tissue surface formed for purposes of treatment (for example, by incising corneal tissues so as to allow a flap of the corneal epithelium to be displaced and expose the underlying stroma during a LASIK procedure).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Systems and methods for measuring a refractive error of an eye such as spherical defocus and cylindrical astigmatism having an axis are well known in the optometric and ophthalmic fields.

An amount of light locally transmitted into a tissue is related to an angle of incidence of a laser beam. Several factors contribute to an amount of light transmitted into a tissue.

A change in an applied fluence with a change in an angle of incidence is referred to as a cosine effect. A beam incident on a surface illuminates an increased area as an angle of incidence increases. For a fixed amount of energy along a cross sectional dimension of a laser beam, an increase in an illuminated area will decrease an amount of energy per unit area applied to a tissue. An effective fluence applied to a surface changes as a cosine of an angle of incidence.
