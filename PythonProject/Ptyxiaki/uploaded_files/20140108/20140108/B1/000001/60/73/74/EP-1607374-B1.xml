Examples of main nitrogen components contained in sewage and industrial effluent include ammonium nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and organic nitrogen.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Conventionally, when nitrogen in such wastewater has a low concentration, ion exchange and oxidation by chlorine or ozone are used to remove nitrogen. When the nitrogen has a medium or high concentration, biological treatment is employed and usually operated in the following conditions.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the biological treatment, nitrification and denitrification treatment is performed by aerobic nitrification and anaerobic denitrification. In the aerobic nitrification, ammonium nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen are oxidized by ammonium oxidizing bacteria (Nitrosomonas, Nitrosococcus, Nitrosospira, Nitrosolobus, etc.)and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (Nitrobactor, Nitrospina, Nitrococcus, Nitrospina, etc.). On the other hand, in the anaerobic denitrification, denitrification is performed by heterotrophic bacteria (Pseudomonas denitrificans, etc.).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A nitrification vessel for aerobic nitrification is operated under a load of 0.2 to 0.3 kg-N/m<sup>3</sup>/day, and a denitrification vessel for anaerobic denitrification is operated<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> under a load of 0.2 to 0.4 kg-N/m<sup>3</sup>/day. To treat nitrogen contained in a total concentration of 30 to 40 mg/L in sewage, the sewage must be retained in a nitrification vessel for 6 to 8 hours and in a denitrification vessel for 5 to 8 hours, and large-scale treatment vessels are required. Further, a nitrification vessel and a denitrification vessel are designed to be operated under the loads as described above for industrial effluent containing only inorganic substances. However, denitrification of such wastewater requires organic substances, and thus methanol is added at a concentration three to four times of that of nitrogen. For this reason, not only an initial cost but also a large running cost are required.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In this situation, recently, a method for removing nitrogen comprising anaerobic ammonium oxidation has been attracted attention (for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2001037467A"><text>2001-37467</text></patcit>). This anaerobic ammonium oxidation is a method comprising simultaneously denitrifying ammonium as a hydrogen donor and nitrite as a hydrogen acceptor by anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria according to the following reaction formula:<br/>
<br/>
        (Formula 1)     1.0NH<sub>4</sub> + 1.32NO<sub>2</sub> + 0.066HCO<sub>3</sub> + 0.13H<sup>+</sup> → 1.02N<sub>2</sub> + 0.26NO<sub>3</sub> +0.066CH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>0</sub>.<sub>5</sub>N<sub>0.15</sub> + 2.03H<sub>2</sub>O<br/>
<br/>
</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">This method has advantages in that ammonium used as a hydrogen donor can considerably reduce the amount of methanol or the like used for denitrification and reduce the amount of a sludge produced, etc. Thus, the method is considered to be an effective method for removing nitrogen in the future.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, it is reported that anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria carrying out anaerobic ammonium oxidation are typified by Planctomycete, and have a very low specific growth rate of 0.001 h<sup>-1</sup> (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Strous, M. et al., Nature, 400, 446 (1999</text></nplcit>)).

On the other hand, in large-scale actual equipment, a culturing plant for culturing anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria is required for reducing the start-up period. However, the culturing plant has drawbacks when actually used in that the plant is huge, and thus not only are high equipment and operation management costs required for operation, but also a large amount of nitrogen wastewater must be controlled for culturing.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As described above, there are problems to be solved for actually operating an anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel utilizing anaerobic ammonium oxidation, and such an actual anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel has not been operated in Japan so far.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present invention has been achieved in view of such circumstances. An object of the present invention is to provide a method for operating an anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel that can reduce the period for acclimatizing anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria with a low growth rate, eliminates the necessity of providing a culturing plant, and does not reduce performance of one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel from which anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria have been withdrawn, and to provide anaerobic ammonium oxidation equipment in which the operation method is carried out.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to a first aspect of the present invention, to attain the aforementioned object, there is provided a method for operating an anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel in anaerobic ammonium oxidation in which ammonium and nitrite in water to be treated are simultaneously denitrified by anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria, the method comprising the steps of: withdrawing a part of the anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria from one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel in which the anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria have been acclimatized, and introducing the withdrawn anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria into another anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel in which acclimatization is to be carried out to perform start-up operation, wherein the anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria having been acclimatized<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> in the one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel are provided as microbe-immobilized materials in which the bacteria are attached to and immobilized on immobilizing materials or entrapped and immobilized in immobilizing materials.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Based on the concept that an anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel operated as actual equipment is also used for culturing anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria, and the cultured anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria are withdrawn and employed as seed bacteria for starting up another anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel, the present invention is constituted in order to reduce the acclimatization period in the other anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel and prevent reduction in performance of the one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel from which the bacteria have been withdrawn. At the same time, the present invention is constituted so that the anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria having been acclimatized in the one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel are provided as microbe-immobilized materials in which the bacteria are attached to and immobilized on immobilizing materials or entrapped and immobilized in immobilizing materials, in order to culture the bacteria efficiently and withdraw the bacteria accurately and easily, etc.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the first aspect of the present invention, since anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria having been acclimatized in one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel are utilized for acclimatization in another anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel, the period for acclimatizing anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria with a low growth rate can be reduced, and it is not necessary to provide a culturing plant. By treating anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria as microbe-immobilized materials in which the bacteria are immobilized in or on immobilizing materials, the anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria can be easily withdrawn from one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel and easily introduced into another anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel, and the amount of the bacteria withdrawn or introduced can be accurately controlled.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the present invention, the acclimatization period refers to a period required for reducing the ammonium nitrogen concentration and the nitrite nitrogen concentration by half at the same time, specifically, a period in which anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria are dominantly proliferated to exhibit anaerobic ammonium oxidation activity. The start-up operation includes, in addition to start-up of a newly provided anaerobic<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> ammonium oxidation vessel, restart-up of an anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel in which anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria are inactivated. One anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel and another anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel may be provided in the same wastewater treatment facility, or may be provided in different wastewater treatment facilities, respectively.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to this aspect of the present invention, there is provided the method for operating an anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel, wherein the microbe-immobilized materials are withdrawn at one time from the one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel in an amount of 25% or less of the total acclimatized microbe-immobilized materials. Here, the 25% may be wt% or vol%.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">This is because, if the amount of the microbe-immobilized materials withdrawn at one time from the one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel in which the bacteria have been acclimatized is 25% or less based on the total materials, denitrification performance of the one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel from which the materials have been withdrawn is not adversely affected. The amount of the microbe-immobilized materials withdrawn at one time is more preferably 10% or less based on the total materials.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided the method for operating an anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel according to the first aspect, further comprising: acclimatizing an excessive amount of the microbe-immobilized materials in the one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel, provided that the microbe-immobilized materials are to be withdrawn.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">When an excessive amount of the microbe-immobilized materials are acclimatized in the one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel, provided that the microbe-immobilized materials are to be withdrawn, and then the excess of the microbe-immobilized materials is withdrawn in this manner, the anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel can retain a necessary amount of the microbe-immobilized materials, and nitrification performance is not affected. Specifically, the anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel is used as a culturing vessel for the excess.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided the method for operating an anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel according to any one of the first to second aspects, further comprising: withdrawing the acclimatized<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> microbe-immobilized materials from the one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel, and substituting new unacclimatized microbe-immobilized materials therefor. Here, unacclimatized pellets refer to pellets having low anaerobic ammonium oxidation activity with a denitrification rate per pellet of 1 (kg-N/m<sup>3</sup>-pellet/day) or less, and do not necessarily refer to unused articles. Unless specified that the denitrification rate is "per pellet", the denitrification rate and the volume load are estimated "per reaction vessel volume", and are described in a unit (kg-N/m<sup>3</sup>/day) (hereinafter the same).</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">When the amount of the microbe-immobilized materials withdrawn is 25% or less of the total acclimatized microbe-immobilized materials, denitrification performance of the one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel from which the materials have been withdrawn is almost not affected. However, if the same amount is to be withdrawn in the next time, the amount may exceed 25% of the total remaining materials, meaning that the withdrawal can be carried out only once. However, by withdrawing the microbe-immobilized materials and substituting unacclimatized microbe-immobilized materials therefor at the same time as in the fourth aspect, the amount of the microbe-immobilized materials in the anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel is not reduced. Accordingly, when this procedure is repeated, the acclimatized microbe-immobilized materials can be withdrawn one after another from the one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel to the other anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel and used as seed bacteria for acclimatization.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided the method for operating an anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel according to any one of the first to third aspects, wherein the microbe-immobilized materials are withdrawn from the one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel in a plurality of times so that the total acclimatized microbe-immobilized materials are replaced by the new microbe-immobilized materials over one month or more.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">When the microbe-immobilized materials are withdrawn from the one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel many times in a short period, microbe-immobilized materials not sufficiently acclimatized exist at a large percentage in the anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel from which the materials have been withdrawn, and thus denitrification performance deteriorates. Accordingly, when adjusting the frequency of withdrawal so that the acclimatized microbe-immobilized materials are withdrawn in a<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> plurality of times to replace the total materials by new microbe-immobilized materials substituted therefor over one month or more, and preferably two months or more, there is a progress in the acclimatization of the new microbe-immobilized materials substituted therefor, and thus denitrification performance is less affected. The microbe-immobilized materials are preferably withdrawn uniformly. Specifically, the amount of the materials withdrawn in a plurality of times is preferably the same each time. This is because denitrification performance tends to vary if the amount of the materials withdrawn differs each time.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, there is provided the method for operating an anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel according to any one of the first to fourth aspects, further comprising: withdrawing the microbe-immobilized materials uniformly from an area parallel to the flow direction of water to be treated flowing in the one anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">This is because there is a denitrification rate distribution in the anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel in which the denitrification rate is high on the inlet side for water to be treated and the denitrification rate is low on the outlet side for treated water, and, when the microbe-immobilized materials are withdrawn from an area perpendicular to the flow direction of water to be treated, denitrification performance of the anaerobic ammonium oxidation vessel may significantly deteriorate if such an area is on the inlet side for water to be treated.

If the frequency of withdrawal is higher than above, many unacclimatized microbe-immobilized materials exist in the acclimatization-completed vessel 10, and denitrification performance of the acclimatization-completed vessel 10 is caused to deteriorate.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In the operation method of the present invention, the amount of the microbe-immobilized materials 14A withdrawn at one time from the acclimatization-completed vessel 10 is 25% or less of the total microbe-immobilized materials 14A in the acclimatization-completed vessel 10.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> shows the test results obtained by examining the relation between the amount of the microbe-immobilized materials 14A withdrawn at one time from the acclimatization-completed vessel 10 and denitrification performance in the acclimatization-completed vessel 10.

As the immobilizing material for the microbe-immobilized materials 14A, a nonwoven cloth was used.

When the amount of the withdrawn materials 14A was 15% or 25%, the denitrification rate was reduced a little in a period between the time immediately after the withdrawal and about 10 days after the withdrawal, and the denitrification rate was recovered to the original rate 10 days after the withdrawal. However, when the amount of the withdrawn materials 14A was 30%, the denitrification rate was rapidly reduced as days passed since the materials 14A had been withdrawn. The denitrification rate was rapidly reduced to about 1 (kg-N/ m<sup>3</sup>/day) when five days passed since the materials 14A had been withdrawn, and was not recovered to the original rate even when 30 days passed.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">The results in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> show that the amount of the acclimatized microbe-immobilized materials 14A to be withdrawn at one time from the acclimatization-completed vessel 10 is 25% or less, more preferably 10% or less, and particularly preferably 5% or less of the total microbe-immobilized materials 14A.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Accordingly, when the acclimatization-completed vessel 10 is also used as a vessel for culturing anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria, it is important to withdraw the microbe-immobilized materials 14A from the acclimatization-completed vessel 10 in an amount of 25% or less, and to replace the withdrawn materials A by the microbe-immobilized materials 14B substituted therefor over one to two months.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">In the operation method of the present invention, it is preferable to acclimatize an excessive amount of the microbe-immobilized materials 14A in the<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> acclimatization-completed vessel 10, provided that the microbe-immobilized materials 14A are to be withdrawn.

A withdrawal and substitution process comprising withdrawing the 5% excess of the microbe-immobilized materials 14A at one time and, at the same time, substituting the new microbe-immobilized materials 14B therefor was performed once a month to carry out continuous operation. As a result, even if the 5% excess of the microbe-immobilized materials 14A was withdrawn from the acclimatization-completed vessel 10, the denitrification rate was not reduced, and quality of treated water from the acclimatization-completed vessel 10 did not deteriorate. Thus, the acclimatization-completed vessel 10 could also be used as a culturing vessel to obtain the acclimatized microbe-immobilized materials 14A once a month, and the materials 14A could be utilized as seed bacteria for the other acclimatization-uncompleted vessel 12.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">The amount of the microbe-immobilized materials 14A withdrawn from the acclimatization-completed vessel 10, the frequency of withdrawing the materials 14A from the vessel 10, etc. in order to avoid deterioration of denitrification performance are as described above.

The microbe-immobilized materials 14A were provided in the acclimatization-completed vessel 10, in which a plurality of round<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> bar-like nonwoven clothes, each with a diameter of 100 mm and a length of 300 mm, were vertically immersed and located. As the water to be treated, inorganic synthetic wastewater having a composition shown in Table 2 was used. The operation was carried out by changing the nitrite nitrogen (NO<sub>2</sub>-N) concentration and the ammonium nitrogen (NH<sub>4</sub>-N) concentration. A continuous operation for one month was carried out at a water temperature of 36°C, at an HRT of six hours, and at a nitrogen load of about 1.8 to 2.2 (kg-N/m<sup>3</sup>/day).

No. 1 is the lowest rectangle of the nonwoven cloth, cut at a position 50 mm from the lower end of the nonwoven cloth. Similarly, No. 2 is the second lowest rectangle from the lower end, No. 3 is the third lowest rectangle from the lower end, No. 4 is the fourth lowest rectangle from the lower end, No. 5 is the fifth lowest rectangle from the lower end, and No. 6 is the sixth lowest rectangle from the lower end.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">As is clear from the results in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>, the rectangles Nos. 1 to 3 corresponding to the lower half of the microbe-immobilized material 14A had a high denitrification rate, while the rectangles Nos. 4 to 6 corresponding to the upper half of the microbe-immobilized material 14A had a low denitrification rate. This makes it clear that the denitrification rate in the vertical acclimatization-completed vessel 10 is not uniform, and that the denitrification rate is high on the inlet side for water to be treated (lower part of the vessel) and the denitrification rate is low on the outlet side for treated water (upper part of the vessel). In other words, anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria have high activity on the inlet side, and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria have low activity on the outlet side. Thus, if the microbe-immobilized materials 14A are withdrawn from an area perpendicular to the flow direction of water to be treated flowing in the acclimatization-completed vessel 10, there is a risk of adversely affecting denitrification performance of the acclimatization-completed vessel 10. Specifically,<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> when the area for the withdrawal perpendicular to the flow direction of water to be treated is on the inlet side, a large amount of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria with high activity are withdrawn, and thus denitrification performance of the acclimatization-completed vessel 10 remarkably deteriorates.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Accordingly, in the operation method of the present invention, when the microbe-immobilized materials 14A are withdrawn from the acclimatization-completed vessel 10, it is important to withdraw the microbe-immobilized materials 14A uniformly from an area parallel to the flow direction of water to be treated flowing in the acclimatization-completed vessel 10 in order not to adversely affect denitrification performance. A plurality of the fixed bed-type microbe-immobilized materials 14A in which cylindrical containers were packed with PVA gel beads were vertically immersed and located in the acclimatization-completed vessel 10, instead of the microbe-immobilized materials 14A using a nonwoven cloth as an immobilizing material, to carry out a withdrawal test in the same manner. Also in this case, when the microbe-immobilized material 14A were withdrawn uniformly from an area parallel to the flow direction of water to be treated flowing in the acclimatization-completed vessel 10, denitrification performance of the acclimatization-completed vessel 10 was almost not adversely affected. It is important to appropriately select the area from which the microbe-immobilized materials 14A are withdrawn, not only in the case where the materials 14A are microbe-immobilized materials with a fixed bed such as a nonwoven cloth or PVA gel beads with which a cylindrical container is packed.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">In order to determine the relation between the area from which the microbe-immobilized materials 14A are withdrawn and denitrification performance, as shown in the conceptual view of <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>, the acclimatization-completed vessel 10 was configured so that the acclimatized microbe-immobilized materials 14A could be withdrawn from both an area parallel to the flow direction of water to be treated and an area perpendicular to the flow direction of water to be treated. Specifically, in the acclimatization-completed vessel 10, ten microbe-immobilized materials 14A were vertically located, each of the microbe-immobilized materials 14A was cut into ten rectangles, and each of the rectangles was supported by a supporting member (not shown). Two sets of such vessels 10 were prepared. In an actual acclimatization-completed vessel 10, the microbe-immobilized materials 14A are located<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> also at the front and the back of <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>. Here, the microbe-immobilized materials 14A located on one flat plane shown in the figure will be described for ease of understanding. Thus, when an assembly of ten rectangles 13 surrounded by the dotted line of <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>, specifically, the microbe-immobilized material 14A before being cut into the rectangles 13, is withdrawn, the microbe-immobilized material 14A is withdrawn from an area parallel to the flow direction of water to be treated. When an assembly 15 of ten rectangles 13 surrounded by the two-dot chain line is withdrawn, the microbe-immobilized material 14A is withdrawn from an area perpendicular to the flow direction of water to be treated. The amount of the withdrawn material 14A is the same in both cases. The two acclimatization-completed vessels 10 were continuously operated using inorganic synthetic wastewater shown in Table 2 at a nitrogen load of about 1.8 to 2.2 (kg-N/m<sup>3</sup>/day). The denitrification rate was 1.3 to 1.62 (kg-N/m<sup>3</sup>/day) in this time. It was confirmed that the nitrite nitrogen concentration in the treated water discharged from the acclimatization-completed vessels 10 reached 5 mg/L and thus denitrification performance was made stable. Then, one nonwoven cloth was withdrawn from the one acclimatization-completed vessel 10, while the assembly 15 of ten rectangles perpendicular to the flow direction was withdrawn from the other acclimatization-completed vessel 10. The assembly 15 of ten rectangles was withdrawn on the inlet side at a position 50 to 75 mm from the lower end of the nonwoven cloth.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">As a result, when one nonwoven cloth was withdrawn from an area parallel to the flow direction of water to be treated, the nitrite nitrogen concentration in the treated water rose to 30 mg/L briefly. However, when about 10 days passed, the nitrite nitrogen concentration in the treated water fell to the original 5 mg/L. On the contrary, when the assembly 15 of ten rectangles was withdrawn from an area perpendicular to the flow direction of water to be treated, the denitrification rate in the acclimatization-completed vessel 10 was reduced, the nitrite nitrogen concentration in the treated water was above 100 mg/L, and the denitrification rate was not recovered to the original rate even when 30 days passed. Anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria in the acclimatization-completed vessel 10 were examined to find that the bacteria were inactivated.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">By withdrawing the microbe-immobilized materials 14A uniformly from an area parallel to the flow direction of water to be treated flowing in the<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> acclimatization-completed vessel 10, the microbe-immobilized materials 14A can be withdrawn without adversely affecting denitrification performance of the acclimatization-completed vessel 10.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082"><figref idrefs="f0008">Figs. 8A and 8B</figref> show nonwoven clothes as immobilization materials unitized so that the microbe-immobilized materials 14A can be withdrawn uniformly in a simple manner from an area parallel to the flow direction of water to be treated flowing in the vertical acclimatization-completed vessel 10. <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8A</figref> is a conceptual side view, and <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8B</figref> is a conceptual top view.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figs. 8A and 8B</figref>, in water to be treated in the vertical acclimatization-completed vessel 10, many microbe-immobilized materials 14A using a bar-like nonwoven cloth as an immobilizing material are vertically located in upper and lower rows, and the microbe-immobilized materials 14A are arranged with a predetermined gap (interval) between the adjacent two. The microbe-immobilized materials 14A of the upper row are located above the gaps of the lower row, and the microbe-immobilized materials 14A of the lower row are located below the gaps of the upper row. The upper ends and the lower ends of the nonwoven clothes are connected by a connection bar 17, respectively, in the microbe-immobilized materials 14A in the same row. Thus, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8B</figref>, square plate-like units 21, in which a plurality of the microbe-immobilized materials 14A with an interval between the adjacent two are supported by a pair of the upper and lower connection bars 17, are formed. In each of the upper and lower rows of the acclimatization-completed vessel, the plurality of units 21 are supported by a casing 23 with a framework open in four directions. In the casing 23, guide grooves 25 into which the units 21 are to be inserted are vertically formed at predetermined intervals.

Since the microbe-immobilized materials 14A in the upper row and the materials 14A in the lower row are alternately located in the acclimatization-completed vessel 10, and a baffle<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> 22A is located at the inlet for water to be treated, the flow of water to be treated can be dispersed inside the whole acclimatization-completed vessel 10. Thus, there is no local region with a high nitrite nitrogen concentration in the acclimatization-completed vessel 10. This is because, although anaerobic ammonium oxidation in which ammonium and nitrite are simultaneously denitrified requires nitrite, it is not preferable if there is a local region with a high nitrite nitrogen concentration in the acclimatization-completed vessel 10, since a nitrite nitrogen concentration of 80 mg/L or more inhibits activity of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085"><figref idrefs="f0008">Figs. 8A and 8B</figref> show an example of the vertical acclimatization-completed vessel 10, while <figref idrefs="f0009">Figs. 9A to 9C</figref> show a case of the horizontal acclimatization-completed vessel 10.
