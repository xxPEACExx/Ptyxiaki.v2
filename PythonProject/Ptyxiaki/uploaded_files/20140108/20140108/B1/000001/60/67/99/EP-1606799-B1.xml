mxw-id="PDES63961554" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>Field of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to the field of generating alert signals and alerting devices, and more particularly relates to increasing the audio perceptual loudness and generating alert signals based on psychoacoustic/audiometric data.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">There is a large world market for hand-held wireless communication devices, and it is always of concern to design these systems to operate with the lowest amount of power. Advances in miniaturization of hand held devices such as cell phones, pagers and PDAs are often limited by power source constraints, including battery sizes. Many cell phones and small consumer audio appliances with limited power configuration are equipped with transducers such as speakerphones that project the speech to the listener instead of being directly coupled to the ear. Much of the current focus in industry technology has been on better speaker design or more efficient resourcing of current drain in the power amplification stage. No energy conservation schemes directly operate on the audio alerts to generate alerts. Alerts are typically used to notify users of incoming calls, pages, text messages, calendar alarms and more.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Recent demands in today's market for increased quality in the production of audio alerts have led to deploying digital techniques. With reference to medical<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> alerting devices, the conventional embedded low-power medical device alerts must be sufficiently loud so as to draw the attention of the device-holder. Conventional on-the-body medical alert devices are used intermittently, since the device-holder may be performing other activities and needs to be notified only when a medical-alert is necessary. In most cases, the holder is not paying attention to the device.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In addition, conventional medical device alerts (such as those used on pagers) use a single tone to alarm the individual: for example, a runner's heart rate monitor or a wristwatch to measure speed. Typically, the tone is about 1KHz, since informal listening tests reveal that the frequency is annoying enough to draw the attention of the user and solicit a response. However, the tone is not optimal for loudness while maintaining a low power requirement.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Further, studies have shown that the psychoacoustic and audiometric data varies from listener to listener. Stated differently, a system optimized for loudness for a given listener often is not optimized for another listener. Accordingly, a need exists to supply a system which can be customized to a particular user.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4631517A"><text>US 4631517</text></patcit> discloses a tone generator which delivers at least two acoustic signals the frequency of which may be adjusted to those frequencies to which the eas of the person with impaired hearing are most sensitive.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention increases the audio perceptual loudness and generates the optimal tone sequence for achieving maximal loudness based on the device-speaker response, the listener's auditory profile, and the knowledge of sound in human hearing. The present invention utilizes psycho-acoustic knowledge of loudness to generate a tone sequence, which corresponds to maximal loudness<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> according to the listener's auditory profile, while maintaining a low power requirement.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">More specifically, the invention is characterized by what is stated in claims 1 and 10.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to one embodiment of the present invention, a method for increasing the audio perceptual loudness includes shifting at least one frequency of a first audio signal to create a second audio signal so as to increase the audio perceptual loudness, while maintaining a low power requirement. The method includes generating an audio speaker frequency response curve for a given volume setting and speaker; selecting an equal loudness reference curve; creating a loudness sensitivity curve for a given audio speaker response by subtracting the loudness reference curve from the audio speaker frequency response curve; acquiring a listener's threshold audio profile; adding the listener's audio profile to the loudness sensitivity curve for producing the listener's tonal sensitivity curve if an abnormal-hearing listener; determining a required dB scaling for critical band tones from the listener's tonal sensitivity curve; normalizing the tonal sensitivity curve for creating a decibel curve; selecting a frequency range of the tones by using the tonal sensitivity curve; and spacing the sequence of tones along a critical band scale.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>Brief Description of the Drawings</b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a graph illustrating loudness curves adapted from the ISO-226.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> is a graph illustrating a mapping of a linear frequency scale to a critical band scale given by equations (2) and (3).<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph illustrating simulated level-dependent roex auditory filter responses for input levels 50 to 90dB at center frequencies of fc = 100Hz, 1KHz, and 3KHz.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph illustrating narrowband pure tone masking threshold.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIGs. 5-6</figref> are graphs illustrating "notch noise" method to trace out auditory filter shapes.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIGs. 7-8</figref> are graphs illustrating generation of excitation function, with <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 7</figref> showing individual auditory filter shapes from a 1KHz sinusoid input, and <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 8</figref> showing resulting excitation pattern.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 9</figref> is a graph illustrating excitation level versus critical band pattern for a 1KHz tone generated by roex filters.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 10</figref> is a graph illustrating outer to middle ear filter given by Eq(19) for various values of R.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIGs. 11-13</figref> are graphs illustrating a relation between loudness and bandwidth, with <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 11</figref> showing input narrowband noise centered at 1KHz with bandwidths of 40, 80, 160, 320, 640 and 1280Hz (all at a constant level of 60dB SPL), <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 12</figref> showing corresponding excitation patterns, and <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 13</figref> showing resulting loudness pattern.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIGs. 14-15</figref> are graphs illustrating loudness of two tones of equal energy, with <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 7</figref> showing two tones separated by more than a critical band, and <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 8</figref> showing two tones of the same critical band.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIGs. 16</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">17</figref> are block diagrams of an end user device for implementing the method, according to the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIGs. 18</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">19</figref> are flow diagrams showing the method, operating on the end user of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 16</figref>, according to the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 20</figref> is a graph illustrating an audio speaker frequency response curve, according to the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 21</figref> is a graph illustrating ISO-226 equal loudness curve, according to the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 22</figref> is a graph illustrating a listener's audio profile, according to the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 23</figref> is a flow diagram showing the method of customizing the listener's profile of <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG.19</figref>, according to the present invention.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><heading id="h0005"><b>Detailed Description</b></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">As stated above, the present invention incorporates psychoacoustic knowledge with the listener's auditory hearing profile in the tone alert sequence to achieve the loudest,alert available while maintaining the power required.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention works with many currently available systems through a software or firmware update. In one embodiment, the present invention allows an user to optimize the tone alert for the user's audiometric profile.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The critical band concept of hearing is that when the energy remains constant in a critical band, loudness will increase (when a critical bandwidth is exceeded). Simply put, multiple tones on a frequency scale will be loudest when the tones are all separated in frequency by a certain bandwidth (called "critical bandwidth") as compared to being grouped together. In addition, the dB gain of each tone is selected as a function of the listener's auditory profile. The ISO-226 equal loudness contours provide the loudness levels at which tones sound equally loud across the frequency spectrum. The equal loudness tones concept states that tones between 1KHz to 4KHz are perceived louder than any other tones.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In addition, auditory profiles of hearing-impaired individuals with moderate hearing loss generally show high frequency loss of about -10dB at 2KHz. This.allows the narrowing of the range of tones necessary for optimal loudness. Upon applying the critical band concept to a tone sequence in the range 1KHz to 2KHz, one can see that 7 tones are necessary for critical band spacing to achieve optimal loudness:<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> namely, 1000,1170,1370,1600,1850,1720, and 2000 Hz. The auditory profile of the listener is included to optimize the loudness of the alert sequence.</p><heading id="h0006">Loudness in Human Perception</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">Loudness is the human perception of intensity and is a function of the sound intensity, frequency, and quality [for further information see <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>William Hartmann. Signals, Sound, and Sensation. Springer, New York, 1998</text></nplcit>.]. The sound energy level can be represented as a function of intensity, <i>I</i>, and as a function of acoustic pressure, <i>p</i>, since <i>I</i> α <i>p</i>2, as shown below. <maths id="math0001" num="(1)"><math display="block"><mi>L</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>10</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>log</mi><mn>10</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>I</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><msub><mi>I</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>20</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>log</mi><mn>10</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>p</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><msub><mi>p</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mfrac></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="65" he="15" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">When the denominator values are chosen as reference variables corresponding to the threshold of hearing, the decibel pressure ratio becomes the sound pressure level SPL and the decibel intensity ratio becomes the intensity level. Human sensations (such as hearing) increase logarithmically as the intensity of the stimulus increases [for further information see <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>S. Stevens. The direct estimation of sensory magnitudes: loudness. American Journal of Psychology. 69:1-25, 1956</text></nplcit>.]. To measure loudness it is necessary to establish a reference that relates the subjective sensation to the physical meaning. The loudness level was created to characterize the loudness sensation of any sound, since magnitude estimations do not provide an accurate representation. The loudness level of a sound is the sound pressure level of a 1-KHz tone that is as loud as the sound under test. The unit measure is the "phon" and it is an<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> objective value to relate the perception of loudness to the SPL. Any sounds with equal phon levels are at equal loudness levels. The continuous frequency spectrum can be assigned phon levels for a given SPL. The contours of these curves are known as the equal loudness curves [for further information see ISO-226. Acoustics - normal equal loudness contours. <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>ISO Geneva, Switzerland, 1987</text></nplcit>.].</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates equal loudness curves adapted from the ISO- 226. The set of the curves for the SPL values from the threshold of hearing to the ceiling of hearing defines a measure of equivalent loudness in phon at each frequency. The dotted line in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> represents the threshold of hearing where the limit of loudness sensation is reached. This occurs at the 3 phon level, since the threshold in quiet corresponds to 3dB at 1KHz [for further information see <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="b"><text>E. Zwicker and H. Fastl. Psychoacoustics. Springer Series, Berlin, 1998</text></nplcit>.].</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">However, the phon does not provide a measure for the scale of loudness. A loudness scale provides a unit of measure stating how much louder one sound is perceived in comparison to another. The phon level states the SPL level required to achieve the same loudness level. It does not establish a metric, or unit of loudness. The "sone" was introduced to define a subjective measure of loudness where a sone value of 1 corresponds to the loudness of a 1KHz tone at an intensity of 40dB SPL for reference [for further information see <nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>S. Stevens. The direct estimation of sensory magnitudes: loudness. American Journal of Psychology, 69:1-25, 1956</text></nplcit>.]. The sone scale defines a scale of loudness such that a quadrupling of the sone level quadruples the perceived loudness. An empirical relation between the sound pressure p and the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> loudness S in sones is typically given by <i>S</i> ∝ <i>I<sup>k</sup></i> where <i>k</i> ≈ 0.3. A ten-fold increase in intensity corresponds to a 10 phon increase in SPL. Since loudness is approximately proportional to the cube root of the intensity, a 10 phon increase roughly corresponds to a doubling of the sone value. The sound is perceived twice as loud.</p><heading id="h0007">Critical bands</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">The most dominant concept of auditory theory is the critical band concept [for further information see <nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>H.

Accordingly, <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> shows the critical band scale established by both of the equations (2) and (3). Fletcher's original experiments on masking phenomena revealed the characteristics of the critical band concept. In these experiments, the audibility of a pure tone is evaluated for different noise bandwidths. The experimental results demonstrate that audibility is affected only by<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the amount of noise in the critical band. As bandwidth decreases below a critical bandwidth, the detection threshold of the tone decreases. The experiments suggested the existence of an auditory filter. Since noise outside a certain bandwidth does not affect detection thresholds, an auditory mechanism (which suppresses these components) seemed likely. The auditory filter can be considered a physiological process, which suppresses components outside the filter region but does not adversely affect signals within the filter. The purpose of the auditory filter is to isolate signal components of interest and to attenuate the signal contributions outside this region. The region defined by this boundary is the critical bandwidth, and the experimental results show that this critical bandwidth increases with increasing frequency [for further information see<nplcit id="ncit0012" npl-type="b"><text> E.

Zwicker and H. Fastl. Psychoacoustics. Springer Series, Berlin, 1998</text></nplcit>.]. Once the bandwidth increases beyond a critical band, loudness will increase. When the bandwidth exceeds the critical bandwidth the loudness increases, although the energy remains constant. This is based on the fact that human hearing system analyzes a broad spectrum into parts that correspond to critical bands. It is also consistent with the auditory filter concept in which frequency is continuously encoded along the basilar membrane and in which loudness is linearly related to the area of excitation [for further information see <nplcit id="ncit0014" npl-type="s"><text>A.T.

A narrowband noise at a given frequency is the masker and the tone to detect is varied in frequency. The resulting threshold curve is the masking pattern. The masking effect refers to the phenomenon that certain sounds become inaudible in the vicinity of louder neighboring sounds.

The first stage of a loudness model is to include the transfer<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> characteristics of the outer to middle ear. The outer ear transmission includes the form of the head, the outer ear, and the outer canal which provides our high frequency sensitivity. The middle ear begins with the eardrum and acts as a pressure receiver to convert sound intensities to physical movements.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The intensity of sound is a small air force oscillation over a large displacement, and the required physical movements are large forces over small areas. The physical movements are conveyed to the inner ear where physical motion is converted to wave motions. This complete interaction defines an impedance-matched transformation which is extremely efficient in the human auditory system. This transmission is denoted the outer to middle ear transfer function, and is normally introduced as a logarithmic attenuation curve <i>A</i><sub>0</sub>. It represents the transmission characteristics the sound undergoes as it travels from the free field to that sound being active internally, as shown below. <maths id="math0024" num="Eq (19)"><math display="block"><mi>H</mi><mfenced><mi>z</mi></mfenced><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>H</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">LP</mi></msub><mfenced><mi>z</mi></mfenced><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>H</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">HP</mi></msub><mfenced><mi>z</mi></mfenced></math><img id="ib0024" file="imgb0024.tif" wi="93" he="9" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> <maths id="math0025" num=""><math display="block"><msub><mi>H</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">HP</mi></msub><mfenced><mi>z</mi></mfenced><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>z</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>z</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>R</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>z</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>R</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>z</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mfrac></math><img id="ib0025" file="imgb0025.tif" wi="49" he="13" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> <maths id="math0026" num=""><math display="block"><mtable><mtr><mtd><msub><mi>H</mi><mi mathvariant="italic">LP</mi></msub><mfenced><mi>z</mi></mfenced></mtd><mtd columnalign="left"><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>0.109</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mfenced separators=""><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>z</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mfenced></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>2.5359</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>z</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>+</mo><mn>3.9295</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>z</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mspace width="1em"/></mtd><mtd columnalign="left"><mo>-</mo><mn>4.7532</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>z</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup><mo>+</mo><mn>4.7251</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>z</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>4</mn></mrow></msup><mo>-</mo><mn>3.5548</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>z</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow></msup></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mspace width="1em"/></mtd><mtd columnalign="left"><mo>+</mo><mn>2.1396</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>z</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>6</mn></mrow></msup><mo>-</mo><mn>0.9879</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>z</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>7</mn></mrow></msup><mo>+</mo><mn>0.2836</mn><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>z</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>8</mn></mrow></msup></mtd></mtr></mtable></math><img id="ib0026" file="imgb0026.tif" wi="72" he="37" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --></p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The outer to middle transfer function has been modeled from experimental listening test results and measurements.

The transmission is characterized by the cascade of a low pass filter and a high pass filter. The 8th order IIR LPF determines the overall shape, and the high pass filter determines the low frequency attenuation.

Zwicker's model of loudness assumes an outer to middle ear transfer function which was flat below 2Khz, and followed the form of the inverted absolute threshold curve above 2Khz. This model assumes that the low frequency thresholds below 2Khz were the complete result of internal low-frequency noise, and therefore the attenuation should not reflect the elevated threshold in this region. In Moore and Glasberg's model, the assumed transmission function from the outer to the middle ear is based on the inverted 100phon equal-loudness contour for frequencies below 1Khz, and on the inverted absolute threshold curve for frequencies<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> above 1Khz. This is based on the assumption that the inner ear has an internal noise floor which rises with level in accord with the outer to middle ear transmission. This allows the internal noise floor to rise with level similarly to the inverted equal loudness levels.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Zwicker assumed no low frequency noise floor, and the low frequency threshold increase was strictly due to increasing internal noise with level. Like Zwicker, Moore and Glasberg also assume the inner ear is equally sensitive to frequencies above 1KHz. They propose a filter shape in this region as the inverted absolute threshold curve.

The excitation patterns were obtained from masking patterns of pure tones masked by narrowband noises. Moore and Glasberg's model derives excitation patterns from auditory filter responses whose shapes were derived from data obtained by noise notch experiments. Their description of the excitation pattern through auditory filter analysis provides an alternate view: loudness remains constant below a critical bandwidth not because the excitations are identical, but because the total specific loudness due to excitation is constant. When the bandwidth exceeds a critical band, the contribution of the specific loudness due to broadening of the excitation increases. The area increase from the broadening of the excitation is greater than the area decrease in effective amplitude. Thus, the contribution of the specific loudnesses is greater as compared to when the bandwidth was less than the critical band.<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --></p><p id="p0051" num="0051">For illustration, the simulation results [for further information see <nplcit id="ncit0043" npl-type="s"><text>B.C.

Further structural details of the units are foregone herewith for clarity.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The user input unit 1607 has several keys (including function keys) for performing various functions. The input unit 1607 outputs data (to the controller 1602) based on the keys depressed by the user. Accordingly, the controller 1602 fetches the program instructions stored in the program memory 1611 and executes the program instructions. The display unit 1609 is used for displaying the status of the<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> end user device and the progress of the program being executed by the controller 1602.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The user is presented with a pre-defined configuration routine (at step 2304) of tones by the controller 1602. When the first tone that is presented (via the audio output module 1603 and transducer 1605 is not satisfying to the user, the user informs the controller 1602 via the keyboard 1607 that the user needs more choice. Then, the controller 1602 again executes the program instructions stored in the program memory 1611. The next frequency stored in the configuration routine for the audio signal is processed by the frequency processor/shifter 1113, and the user is presented (via the audio output module 1603 and the transducer 1605) with the corresponding audio tone. Accordingly, the user is presented with the pre-defined configuration routine (at step 1604) of tones until the user selects the user's preferred tone or the configuration routine is exhausted. This procedure is performed iteratively according to the configuration routine. At step 1606, the controller 1102 receives the user's selection, thereby acquiring the user's profile (step 1608). This way, the power/energy of the power source required for generating a given tone is conserved.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 17</figref> shows the above-operation of the present invention in a simple manner.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063"><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 19</figref> is a flow diagram showing the method, operating on the end user of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 11</figref>, according to the present invention. Accordingly, <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates an operational flow chart according to one embodiment of the present invention. The<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> method involves, at step 1800, generating an audio speaker frequency response curve for a given volume setting and speaker (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 20</figref>). Different volume levels give slightly different frequency responses. They are dependent on the mechanical housing and speaker characteristics.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">At step 1802, an equal loudness (corresponding to the lowest frequency response dB level in the 3-dB bandwidth range of the frequency response curve) reference curve is selected (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 21</figref>). This is the loudness reference curve. In this embodiment, the 80 phon equal loudness curve of <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 21</figref> is used along with <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 20</figref>. At step 1804, the loudness reference curve from the audio speaker frequency response curve is subtracted.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">At step 1806, a loudness sensitivity curve for a given audio speaker response is created. At step 1808, the method entails acquiring a listener's threshold audio profile (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 22</figref>). The step of acquiring the listener's threshold audio profile involves playing a pre-defined configuration routine (at step 2304), and receiving the listener's selection (at step 2306). This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 23</figref>.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The listener's threshold audio profile indicates the listener's hearing acuity in terms of tone thresholds and further indicates the dB gain necessary for the listener for hearing certain tones. A ceiling profile can also be used which states the dB differences for loud tones. A normal hearing listener has a flat 0dB response.<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --></p><p id="p0067" num="0067">At step 1810, the listener's audio profile to the loudness sensitivity curve is added. The audio profile contains all positive values (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 22</figref>). If it is a normal hearing listener, this step is not required. The resulting curve specifies the listener's tonal sensitivity (Accordingly, at step 1812, the method entails generating the listener's tonal sensitivity curve--if an abnormal-hearing listener).</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">At step 1814, the method includes determining a required dB scaling for critical band tones from the listener's tonal sensitivity curve. <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 19</figref> is a flow diagram that continues the method, operating on the end user of <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 18</figref>, according to the present invention. At step 1916, the tonal sensitivity curve is normalized. At step 1918, a dB (decibel) curve is created. The resulting dB curve specifies how much attenuation or amplification is necessary to balance the loudness of the tones in the tone alert sequence.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">At step 1920, a frequency range of the tones (by using the tonal sensitivity curve) is selected. At step 1922, the method involves spacing the sequence of tones along a critical band scale. This is how optimal loudness is achieved. Table 2 illustrates this clearly..For example, if the range 1KHz to 2KHz is selected, which corresponds to critical bands 9 through 13, then 5 tones are required at 1000,1170,1370, 1600, and 1850 HZ. The relative amplitudes are based on the dB scaling from the listener's tonal sensitivity curve.<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> -->
