load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to a battery device having a chargeable secondary cell or a primary cell such as a dry cell in its housing member, and an electronic equipment such as a video camera or a video tape recorder employing the battery device as a power source.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In a portable electronic equipment, such as a video camera, video tape recorder, tape player or a disc player, a dc power source such as a rechargeable battery or a dry cell is adapted to be used in addition to a commercial power source supplied via a dc adapter.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">With the battery device, a battery loading unit is mounted at a portion of a main body of the equipment, and a battery device housing a rechargeable cell or a dry cell is loaded on the battery loading unit. The battery device having the rechargeable cell enclosed therein is loaded on a charger having a dc adapter for charging.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The battery device employed in an electronic equipment such as a video camera or a video tape recorder has a housing unit for housing plural batteries in order to procure a voltage sufficient to drive the electronic equipment or a capacity sufficient to drive the electronic equipment for longer than a preset time period. This type of the battery device has a housing unit having two rechargeable cells arrayed side-by-side therein.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The battery device 2, having two cylindrically-shaped rechargeable cells 1, 1, has a housing unit 4 having a cell housing section 3 having a size sufficient to hold two rechargeable cells 1, 1 side-by-side therein, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0014">Fig.26</figref>. The housing unit 4 is molded of synthetic resin and is adapted to hold cells 1, 1 arranged side-by-side in the cell housing unit 3 in a hermetically sealed condition, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig.27</figref>. The two cells 1, 1, housed within the housing unit 4, are connected in series with each other via an electrode plate, not shown, in the cell housing unit 3.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The bottom side of the housing unit 4, housing the two cells 1 in a side-by-side relation in the cell housing unit 3, is integrally formed with a terminal connecting plate 7 having embedded therein a positive terminal plate 5 and a negative terminal plate 6 for electrical connection to a connection terminal of an electronic equipment on which the battery device 2 may be loaded, and having a connection line, not shown, electrically connecting the positive and negative<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> terminals 5 and 6 to the electrode plate 7. The positive terminal 5 and the negative terminal 6, provided on the terminal mounting plate 7, are adapted to be electrically connected to pin-shaped connection terminals provided on the electronic equipment on which the battery device 2 is to be loaded. The tubular-shaped positive and negative terminals 5, 6 are mounted on both sides of the terminal mounting plate 7 for facing an end face 8 which is the loading side of the battery device 2 into the electronic device, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig.29</figref>.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The tubular-shaped positive and negative terminals 5 and 6 are mounted at both sides of the terminal mounting plate 7 with opening ends 5a, 6a thereof facing the end face of the battery device 2 along the loading direction of the electronic equipment.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The above-described battery device 2 is substantially rectangular in shape in keeping with the outer shape of the two cells 1, 1 arranged side-by-side. Both sides of an upper surface 9 of the housing unit 4 opposite to its bottom surface formed as one with the terminal mounting plate 7, are formed as arcuate portions 10, 10 conforming to the outer peripheral surface of the cells 1, 1. The battery device 2 thus formed with the arcuate portions 10, 10 on its upper surface is vertically nonsymmetrical in shape so that its vertical direction can be discerned easily.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The above-described battery device 2 may be loaded so as to be housed within a battery loading unit 14 formed in a portion of an outer casing 13 of a video camera 12, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig.29</figref>. That is, the battery housing unit 14 having a size sufficient to hold the battery device 2 in its entirety is formed at a portion of an outer casing 13. The battery loading section 14 is formed by partitioning a portion of the outer casing 13 and has a pair of connecting pins 17, 18 on its inner wall surface facing an entrance/ exit opening 15 for the insertion or removal of the battery device 2. The connecting pins 17, 18 are adapted to be respectively connected to the positive terminal 5 and the negative terminal 6 provided on the battery device 2.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The battery device 2 is loaded on the battery loading section 14 by being inserted in a direction shown by arrow A in <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig.29</figref> via an entrance/exit opening 15, as indicated by arrow A in <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig.29</figref>, with the end face 8, on which the opening ends 5a, 6a of the positive terminal 5 and the negative terminal 6 are opened, foremost. At this time, the positive terminal 5 and the negative terminal 6 are connected to the connecting pins 17, 18 and the battery device 2 is electrically<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> connected to the video camera 12 so that the power of the cells 1, 1 may be fed to the video camera 12.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The housing unit 4 of the battery device 2 has a mistaken-insertion inhibiting groove 11 in its upper surface 9 for prohibiting mistaken insertion into the battery housing unit 14, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0014">Figs.26</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0015">27</figref>. The mistaken-insertion inhibiting groove 11 is opened at 11a in the inserting side end face 8 of the battery device 2 into the battery loading section 14 and is formed parallel to the loading direction with respect to the battery loading section 14. On the inner lateral surface of the battery loading section 14 is formed a rib 19 for extending from the entrance/exit opening 15 as far as its mid portion so as to be engaged in the mistaken-insertion inhibiting groove 11. By providing the mistaken-insertion inhibiting groove 11 at the battery device 2 and by providing the rib 19 engaged in the mistaken-insertion inhibiting groove 11 at the battery loading device 14, the battery device 2 can be loaded on the battery loading section 14 only when the battery device is loaded with the rib 19 in registration correctly with the mistaken-insertion inhibiting groove 11, thus inhibiting mistaken insertion of the battery device into the battery loading section 14.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">There is also proposed a second battery device 22 having a housing unit 4 further housing a second row of two series-connected cells 1 and thus housing four cells 1, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0016">Fig.30</figref>. With the second battery device 22, the first row of two juxtaposed cells 1, 1 stacked on the second row of two juxtaposed cells 1, 1, are housed in their entirety in the housing unit 24, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0016">Fig.31</figref>. The second battery device 22 having the two by two cells arranged side-by-side in the housing unit 4 has the constitution of the terminal mounting plate 7 in common with the first battery device 2 housing the two cells 1, 1, in which the positive terminal 5 and the negative terminal 6 are embedded in the terminal mounting plate 7 and are connectable to the connecting pins 17, 18 provided on the video camera 12. Since the second battery device 22 shown in <figref idrefs="f0016">Figs.30 and 31</figref> has the first row of two juxtaposed cells 1, 1 stacked on the second row of two juxtaposed cells 1, 1, the second battery device differs from the first battery device 2 only with respect to the height H<sub>1</sub> and has the width W <sub>1</sub> in common with the first battery device, with the two battery devices being substantially similar in shape to each other. Since the two battery devices are substantially similar in shape to each other in this manner, the mistaken-insertion inhibiting groove 11 for preventing mistaken insertion into the battery loading section may be of the similar constitution for both the first and second battery devices 2 and 22.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In addition, since the second battery device 22 is housed within the housing unit 24 with two cells 1, 1 arranged in two rows, the cell housing efficiency may be improved to reduce the size of the device 22 so that the battery loading section of the electronic equipment on which the battery device 22 is loaded may also be reduced in size.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Meanwhile, it is desirable that the first battery device 2 housing two cells 1 and the second battery device 22 housing the four cells be selectively loadable on a common electronic equipment. For example, if the video camera 12 is employed for a prolonged time or a shorter time, it is desirable to load the second battery device 22 housing the four cells and to load the first battery device 2 housing two cells, respectively, in view of operability of the video camera 12.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">For such selective loading of the first battery device 2 housing the two cells I or the second battery device 2 housing the four cells 1, it is necessary to design the battery loading section having a size sufficient to hold the large-sized second battery device 22 in its entirety, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0017">Fig.32</figref>.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The second battery device 22 houses the two juxtaposed cells stacked on two juxtaposed cells, with the four cells being cylindrical in shape and of the same size and with an end face 28 thereof being substantially square, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0016">Fig.31</figref>. Thus a diagonal line S <sub>1</sub> of the end face 28 is substantially equal to a width W<sub>1</sub> of the first battery device 2. Thus, if it is attempted to load the small-sized first battery device 2 into a battery loading section 25 capable of loading the large-sized second battery device 22, the first battery device 2 can be loaded not only in the normal loading position in which it is inserted with the terminal mounting plate 7 in contact with the bottom surface 25a of the battery loading section 25 and with the positive terminal 5 and the negative terminal 6 being connected to the connection pins 17, 18 within the battery loading section 25, but also in the inclined position along the diagonal direction of the battery loading section 25, as shown with a chain-dotted line and double-dotted chain line in <figref idrefs="f0017">Fig.33</figref>. In addition, the first battery section 2 can be loaded with its upper surface 9 extending along the upper surface 25b of the battery loading section 25, as indicated by a broken line in <figref idrefs="f0017">Fig.33</figref>. If the first battery device 2 is loaded with a tilt relative to the battery loading section 25 or with an offset towards the upper surface 25b, the positive and negative terminals 5, 6 cannot be connected to the connecting pins 17, 18 of the battery loading section 25, as a result of which the first battery device 2 is in the mistaken loading state in which electrical connection cannot be established with the video camera.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">On the other hand, since the cell is heavier than the components making up the electrical equipment, the battery device housing the cells is increased in weight. Above all, the battery device having plural cells housed within a housing unit is increased in weight depending on the number of the cells housed therein. It becomes difficult to load the battery device housing plural cells, and having an increased weight, onto the battery loading section with correct positioning and orientation. If the battery device having a large weight is loaded onto the battery loading section without correct positioning and is oscillated in the electronic equipment on which it is loaded, a large impact is applied to the electronic equipment on which the battery device is loaded, thus causing the risk that the electronic equipment is occasionally damaged. Above all, the connection terminals interconnecting the battery device and the electronic equipment may be easily damaged by such impact.</p><heading id="h0002">OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a battery device capable of protecting connection terminals for interconnection and assuring safe and reliable interconnection of the connection terminals.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The present invention provides a battery device which is defined in the appended claims.

Since the hole engaged by the engagement boss acts as an insertion guide during loading of the battery device on the battery loading section, there is no necessity that the outer surface of the housing unit act as an insertion guide so that there is no risk of scratches being formed on the outer surface of the housing unit.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">When the four-cell battery device is loaded, the groove formed in the battery device is engaged by a rib of the battery loading section. If it is attempted to insert the four-cell battery device in a vertically topsy-turvied state, the rib is abutted against a portion of the forward end face of the housing unit for prohibiting mistaken insertion.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">If the four-cell battery device is inserted into the battery loading section of the electronic equipment so that the forward end face having the hole is foremost, the connection terminals on the battery device are engaged with the connection terminals on the electronic equipment for establishing electrical connection. With the electronic equipment, since the engagement boss engaged in the hole formed in the battery device is longer in length than the connection pins or the tubular connection terminals provided in the battery device or in the battery loading section, the connection pins and the connection terminals are interconnected after the engagement boss is engaged in the hole for positioning the battery device with respect to the battery loading section.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In addition, if the battery device is inserted into the battery loading section so that the planar end face thereof,

OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0035" num="0035">Referring to the drawings, illustrative embodiments of a battery device according to the present invention and an electronic equipment on which the battery device may be loaded will be explained in detail.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">A battery device 31 of the present embodiment houses four cylindrically-shaped rechargeable cells 1. The battery device 31 includes a housing unit 33 constituting a cell housing section 32 having a size sufficient to accommodate four cells 1 in vertically and transversely juxtaposed state therein as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1, 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">3</figref>. The housing unit 33 is made up of an upper casing half 34, a mid casing half 35 and a terminal mounting plate 36. The terminal mounting plate 36 constitutes a bottom plate of the housing unit 33 and has embedded therein a positive terminal 37 and a negative electrode terminal 38 for electrical connection to connection terminals of an electronic equipment on which the battery device 2<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> may be loaded. The upper casing half 34, mid casing half 35 and the terminal mounting plate 36 are molded separately from an electrically insulating synthetic resin and abutted and coupled to one another. The cell housing section 32 of the housing unit 33 defining therein a space sufficient to hold the four cells 1 is constituted by the upper casing half 34, the mid casing half 35 and the terminal mounting plate 36 being abutted and coupled to one another.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The four cells 1 are housed within the cell housing section 32 by being arrayed in juxtaposition to each other in the vertical and transverse directions, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs.2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">3</figref>. In this preferred embodiment, the upper casing half 34, mid casing half 35 and the terminal mounting plate 36 have respective abutment surfaces thereof bonded or fused to one another, with the four cells 1 contained therein, for making up the housing unit 33.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The terminal mounting plate 36 constituting the bottom plate of the housing unit 33 has embedded therein the positive terminal 37 and the negative terminal 38 for electrical connection to the connection terminals of the electronic equipment on which the battery device 31 of the present embodiment is to be loaded. The terminal mounting plate also has a jumper wire, not shown, for electrically connecting the positive and negative terminals 37, 38, and electrode plates. The positive terminal 37 and the negative terminal 38 provided on the terminal mounting plate 36 are formed as tubes so that pin-shaped connection terminals provided on the electronic equipment on which the battery device 31 is loaded may be inserted therein so as to be electrically connected thereto, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs.1 and 2</figref>. The positive terminal 37 and the negative terminal 38 in the form of tubes are mounted on both sides of an end face of the terminal mounting plate 36 with opening ends 37a, 38a being opened in an end face 41 of the battery device 31 along the direction of inserting the battery device 31 into the electronic equipment.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The above-described battery device 31 is formed so as to be substantially parallelepipedic in conformity to the outer shape of the four cells 1 arranged in juxtaposition to each other in two rows in the vertical and transverse directions. Both sides of the upper casing half 34 constituting the upper side 39 of the housing unit 33 opposite to the bottom side integrally formed with the terminal mounting plate 36 are arcuate in profile in conformity to the outer periphery of the cells 1 contained in the cell housing unit 32. By the arcuate portions 40, 40 being formed on both sides of the upper surface 39, the battery device 31 is nonsymmetrical<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> in shape in the vertical direction to permit facilitated discrimination of the up-and-down direction.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The battery device 31 of the embodiment illustrated has on its both lateral sides 42, 43 first and second grooves 44, 45 for engagement by first and second ribs provided on the battery mounting section of an electronic equipment on which the battery device 31 is to be loaded, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 and 2</figref>. The lateral sides 42, 43 extend at right angles to the end face 41 on the side of insertion into the electronic equipment on which the opening ends 37a, 38a of the positive terminal 37 and the negative terminal 38 are opened. These first and second grooves 44, 45 are formed parallel to the direction of insertion of the battery device 31 into the electronic equipment at a mid position in the vertical direction at right angles to the inserting direction of the housing unit 33 into the electronic equipment. Further, the first and second grooves 44, 45 are formed so as to extend from the forward end face 41 in the inserting direction to a mid portion of the housing unit 33 so that opening ends 44a, 45a thereof are opened on the forward end face 41. That is, the first and second grooves 44, 45 are formed in parallel with the inserting direction of the battery device 31 so that the opposite ends thereof towards a rear end face 46 opposite to the forward end face 41 are closed.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Specifically, the first and second grooves 44, 45 are formed so that portions of the mid casing 35 constituting the housing unit 33 are extended towards a space defined between the set of cells 1<sub>1</sub>, 1<sub>3</sub> and 1<sub>2</sub>, 1<sub>4</sub> arranged vertically in juxtaposition in the cell housing section 32, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.3</figref>. Since the first and second grooves 44, 45 are formed in this manner between the cells 1<sub>1</sub>, 1<sub>3</sub> and 1<sub>2</sub>, 1<sub>4</sub> arranged vertically in juxtaposition to each other, the grooves 44, 45 are positioned at a mid position along the height of the housing unit 33 housing the four cells 1 arranged in juxtaposition and parallel to each other in the vertical and transverse directions.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In an upper wall section of the upper casing half 34 constituting the upper surface 39 of the housing unit 33 extending at right angles to the lateral surfaces 42, 43 and the forward end face 41 of the housing unit 33 is formed a third groove 51 for engagement by a third rib provided on the battery loading section of the electronic equipment on which the battery device 31 is to be loaded, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. The third groove 51 is formed at a mid position along the width of the housing unit 33 parallel to the inserting direction from the forward end face 41 as far as a mid position of the housing unit 33 so that its opening end 51a is opened in the forward end face 41. That is, the third groove 51 has its end towards the rear<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> end face of the housing unit 33 closed and is formed parallel to the inserting direction of the battery device 31 into the electronic equipment. The third groove 51 plays the role of inhibiting mistaken insertion of the battery device 31 into the battery loading section.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The forward end face 41 in the inserting direction of the housing unit 33 is formed with a hole 52 for engagement by an engagement boss provided on the battery loading section of the electronic equipment on which the battery device 31 is loaded, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. The hole 52 is formed in the space not opposed by any end faces of the four cells 1<sub>1</sub> to 1<sub>4</sub> arranged in juxtaposition to each other in the vertical and transverse directions in the cell housing section 32, that is in the space defined between the four cells 1<sub>1</sub> to 1<sub>4</sub> arranged in juxtaposition to each other in the vertical and transverse directions in the cell housing section 32. The hole 52 is formed for extending from the forward end face 41 of the housing unit 33 inwardly into the interior of the battery loading section 32.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The hole 52 is of a substantially triangular cross-section, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.3</figref>. The hole 52 is formed so that its lower side 52a is substantially coincident with a line P<sub>1</sub> interconnecting upper edges of the cells 1<sub>1</sub>, 1<sub>2</sub> arranged on the bottom surface of the housing unit 33 and its apex 52b is intruded into a space between the cells 1<sub>3</sub>, 1<sub>4</sub> arranged on the upper surfaces of the cells 1<sub>1</sub>, 1<sub>2</sub> arranged on the bottom surface of the housing unit 33, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.4</figref>. The hole 52 is formed in order to permit the engagement boss engageable in the hole 52 to be engaged in the mistaken-insertion inhibiting groove 11 on the upper surface of the first battery device 2 holding two cells 1 when the battery device 2 is loaded on the battery loading section.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The hole 52 has its maximum diameter R<sub>1</sub> in the cross-sectional direction shallower than its depth D<sub>1</sub>, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs.2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">4</figref>. That is, the hole 52 has it depth D <sub>1</sub> deeper than the radius R<sub>1</sub> of the opening end 52a. The reason therefor is that the engagement boss provided on the battery loading section for engagement in the hole 52 is of an elongated length in order to play the role of a guide for loading the battery device 31 on the battery loading section.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In addition, the hole 52 has its depth D <sub>1</sub> deeper than the length L <sub>1</sub> of the cylindrical positive and negative terminals 37 and 38 provided on the terminal mounting plate 36. The reason therefor is to enable the length of the engagement boss provided on the battery loading section for engagement in the hole 52 to be longer than the length of the connecting pins engaged with the positive and negative terminals 37, 38 as connecting terminals, so that the positive and<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> negative terminals 37, 38 are engaged with the connecting pins after positioning the battery device 31 with respect to the battery loading section.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The battery device 31 of the illustrated embodiment has, on both lateral sides of the terminal mounting plate 36 constituting the bottom plate of the housing unit 33, sets of engagement grooves 54, 55, engaged by engagement pieces, not shown, provided on the externally mounted type battery loading section, in order to permit the battery device 31 to be loaded not only on the battery loading section provided within the electronic equipment but also on the externally mounted type battery loading section provided on the outer surface of the electronic equipment, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1, 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">5</figref>. These engagement grooves 54, 55 are partially opened in the bottom surface of the housing unit 33 in the shape of a letter U, in order to be engaged by a sliding movement by L-shaped engagement pieces provided on the externally mounted battery loading unit, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">5</figref>. In the bottom surface 59 of the housing unit 33 are formed plural positioning holes 56, 57 engaged by elastically deformable engagement pieces and positioning protrusions provided on the bottom surface of the externally mounted battery loading section, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.5</figref>. In the bottom surface of the housing unit 33 is formed a use state display window 58 which is moved by a movement member on the battery loading section when the battery device is loaded thereon for indicating that the housing unit has once been loaded and used on the battery loading section, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.5</figref>.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Turning to a video camera 61 as an electronic equipment on which the battery device 31 of the embodiment illustrated may be used, there is mounted a battery loading section 63 in a portion of an outer casing 62 constituting a main body of the video camera, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.6</figref>. The battery loading section 63 is delimited by partitioning a portion of an outer casing 62 by a casing member 64. The casing member 64 constituting the battery loading section 63 has an entrance/exit opening 65 for association with the forward end face 41 in which the positive terminal 37 and the negative terminal 38 of the battery device 31 are accessible at 37a, 38a, respectively, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs.7</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">8</figref>. The entrance/ exit opening 65 is contoured in conformity to the forward end face 41 of the battery device 31.

Similarly to the first and second ribs 68, 69, the third rib 71 is formed parallel to the loading direction of the battery device 31, with the end thereof disposed in the vicinity of the entrance/ exit opening 65, and has a length sufficient to be engaged in the third groove 51 over substantially the entire length thereof.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">On an inner end face 72 of the battery loading section 63 facing the inserting direction of the battery device 31 is formed an engagement boss 73 adapted to be engaged in the hole 52 formed in the forward end face 41 of the battery device 31. The engagement boss 73 is of a cross-sectional shape corresponding to that of the hole 52 of the battery device 31. That is, the engagement boss 73 is formed to have a substantially triangular cross-section, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig.9</figref>. In addition, on the inner end face 72 of the battery loading section 63 facing the battery device 31 being inserted are formed connection pins 74, 75 constituting connection terminals adapted to be engaged by and electrically connected to the tubular positive and negative terminals 37, 38 of the battery device 31 opened at 37a, 38a in the forward end face 41 of the battery device 31.

The elastic member 77 is constituted by a coil spring in which the force biasing the battery device 31 out of the battery loading section 63 is stored. On the entrance/ exit opening 65 of the casing 64, there is provided a lock member 78 partially protruded into the entrance/ exit opening 65 for holding the battery device 31 loaded on the battery loading section 63 in the battery loading section 63 against the bias of the elastic member 77.
