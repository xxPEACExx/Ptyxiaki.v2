As such, these devices are becoming increasingly competitive with light sources such as incandescent, fluorescent, and high-intensity discharge lamps.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A property used to characterize a light source is the correlated colour temperature (CCT) and there are a number of methods of controlling the CCT of an LED light source. For example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6411046B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,411,046</text></patcit> discloses the calculation of colour temperature of light emitted by a luminaire with an array of multicoloured LEDs with at least one LED in each of a plurality of colours. The colour temperature is calculated based on ambient temperatures and preset values, and each set of coloured LEDs is driven to produce a desired colour temperature. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6495964B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,495,964</text></patcit> describes a method for controlling the colour temperature of white light through optical feedback. Measured light outputs are compared to desired outputs and each LED colour is driven accordingly to reach the desired output. This drive method illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, includes a DC-to-DC fly-back converter along with a filtering capacitor and inductor. This configuration can be an efficient drive method, however it involves a large number of parts per LED.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US20040036418A"><text>U.S. Patent Application No. 2004/0036418</text></patcit>, which provides the basis for the preamble portion of the independent Claims, also discloses a drive method where a DC-to-DC converter is used to vary the current through several LED paths. A current switch and sensor is implemented to provide feedback and control to limit the current to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> defined levels as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>. This method can be considered to be similar to a standard buck converter and provides an efficient way for controlling the current through a given LED string. This drive method however, does not provide effective drive control when multiple LED paths are employed to facilitate colour control. When two LED paths with different forward voltages are used, high side switches are used as current limiting devices. The function of current limiting using transistors as variable resistors can result in large losses which decreases the overall efficiency of the circuit.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In addition, shunting techniques can be used to provide variable current flow through the LEDs. For example, if the forward voltage across an LED within a string of LEDs changes, then the total forward voltage across the string will change by the forward voltage across that specific LED. Switching in this manner requires large inductors to smooth the large changes in forward voltage and current flow. In the absence of large inductors, power losses of significant magnitude will occur in the supply or in the drive circuitry. Drive methods that require large components due to heavy switching, which induces large power losses on the supply or drive circuitry, further do not lend themselves to miniaturization due to the size of these components.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In addition, light sources that use a phosphor coating to produce visible light are typically very sensitive to changes in their junction temperature. Changes in this junction temperature can cause shifts in the center wavelength of blue light, for example. Unfortunately, the excitation spectra of phosphors is typically configured such that the peak excitation wavelengths do not coincide with the center wavelength emitted by the LED, and therefore only minor shifts in the LED emission spectra can cause significant changes in the conversion efficiency of the phosphors. This configuration can produce significant changes in the CCT of the phosphor coated LEDs as they are dimmed or as the ambient temperature changes. These devices thus require additional methods of controlling their CCT. For example, International Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO03024269A"><text>WO 03/024269</text></patcit> discloses a method of using amber LEDs in combination with "warm white" (low CCT) and "cool white" (high CCT) phosphor-coated LEDs to dynamically change the CCT of the white light they generate. This method however is limited to adjusting the colour temperature of phosphor coated white LEDs.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Furthermore, as an LED's junction temperature increases the relative luminous flux decreases as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> (Luxeon™ Emitter Technical Data Sheet DS25).<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> If LEDs are driven at their rated power and the light output of a specific colour in the spectrum decreases, that colour of LED may have to be driven harder to compensate for this decrease. The increased current results in more heat, which may lead to an avalanche effect and permanent damage to the LEDs.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Therefore, there is a need for an apparatus and method of controlling the colour and colour temperature of light produced by a digitally controlled light source without significant power losses as well as circuits that have a small part count that can further enhance the efficiency of the circuit while maintaining a low overall system cost.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">This background information is provided for the purpose of making known information believed by the applicant to be of possible relevance to the present invention.

Examples of light-emitting elements include semiconductor, organic, polymer, phosphor coated light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and other similar devices as would be readily understood.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The term "power source" is used to define a means for providing power to an electronic device, for example a light-emitting element and may include various types of power supplies and/or driving circuitry.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As used herein, the term "about" refers to a +/-10% variation from the nominal value. It is to be understood that such a variation is always included in any given value provided herein, whether or not it is specifically identified.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The present invention provides a method and apparatus for controlling the correlated colour temperature (CCT) or colour of light produced by an array of light-emitting elements by providing multiple selectable paths for the flow of drive current. The apparatus includes a <i>primary path</i> comprising primary light-emitting elements, and<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> one or more <i>secondary paths</i> comprising secondary light-emitting elements that are used for compensation or correction of the colour of light emitted by the primary light-emitting elements. A plurality of <i>control means,</i> for example switches are used to direct current through particular paths. During operation, the drive current primarily flows through the primary light-emitting elements and is redirected, periodically for example, to a secondary path comprising light-emitting elements of a particular colour that is desired in addition to the colour produced by the primary light-emitting elements. The rate at which the current is switched between the two or more paths is provided in such a manner that the overall effect obtained is the addition of the colour of light produced by the primary light-emitting elements and the colour of light produced by the particular secondary light-emitting elements. This can result in a different overall CCT or colour of light when compared to the CCT or colour of light produced by the primary light-emitting elements only. Additional colours can similarly be effectively added to the colour of the primary light-emitting elements.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In one embodiment, when perceived flicker by a human observer is not desired, the switching rate at which the path of the current is changed can typically be greater than about 60 Hz and in one embodiment greater than about 100 Hz. Under these conditions, a human observer will typically be unable to perceive any illumination flicker due to colour adjustment for example.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The present invention can provide colour correction to light emitted by light-emitting elements by effectively adding light from light-emitting elements of other colours, while keeping the amount of current drawn from the power supply essentially constant. Thus, various colour temperatures or colours of light from an array of light-emitting elements can be achieved without a substantial change in supply voltage or current as is commonly associated with switching style voltage converters which are commonly used in the art.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> illustrates an apparatus for controlling colour temperature or light colour according to one embodiment of the present invention apparatus. Each of light-emitting element units <b>811</b> to <b>819</b> comprises a plurality of light-emitting elements in a series and/or parallel configuration. Typically, one path comprises the light-emitting elements to be controlled and forms the primary path, with the remaining light-emitting element units forming parts of alternate secondary paths, through which current can be<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> directed for CCT or light colour correction. Control means <b>821</b> to <b>829</b> determine which path current from the power source <b>80</b> flows. Any number of desired colours of light-emitting elements may be present as well as any number of nodes, each node having associated therewith a control means for determining the path of current flow.

The LEDs are arranged in a series-parallel configuration with transistor control at each of nodes <b>401, 402</b> and <b>403.</b> The current flowing through the primary path comprising LED strings <b>411, 412</b> and <b>413</b> is controlled by transistors <b>421, 422</b> and <b>423,</b> respectively.

Depending on which transistors are turned ON and which transistors are turned OFF, the drive current through the LEDs can flow through various paths.

In addition, the number of light emitting elements in the secondary path need not necessarily be the same as the number of light emitting elements in the primary path, however may be desirable to ensure that the voltage drop of each parallel path is approximately the same, in order to reduce step changes in the load as seen by the power source when switching between the primary path and one or more of the secondary paths.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the present invention.
