load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a data processing system, a data processing method, and a data processing program product, and more specifically to a data processing system, a data processing method, and a data processing program product suited for transmitting and receiving data among a plurality of image processing apparatuses connected to a network.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally, when data is to be transmitted, the sender is required to set a variety of information related to the receiver and the destination of the transmission. For instance, when a document is to be transmitted by facsimile, the sender is required to set the facsimile number of the receiver, and when an image scanned by a copying machine is to be transmitted by an electronic mail, the sender is required to set the electronic mail address of the receiver. Moreover, with regard to an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) transmission function and an SMB (Server Message Block) transmission function provided in recent copying machines, the setting of information (FTP server address, name of personal computer, etc.) of the receiver by the sender is required. Although, upon the actual transmission, the information of the receiver need not be set every time if the information of the receiver is registered in advance, the information of the receiver is required upon the registration nonetheless.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Thus, when such information of the receiver as a facsimile number, an electronic mail address, an FTP server address, and a name of the personal computer is unknown, data cannot be transmitted to the receiver. Therefore, advance confirmation of the information of the receiver will be required, which<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> is rather a troublesome task for the sender.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In addition, since the sender basically selects as a transmission method one of a facsimile transmission, an electronic mail transmission, an FTP transmission, an SMB transmission, and the like at his convenience, the transmitted data is not in a form that takes the convenience of the receiver into consideration. Sometimes, after receiving the data, the receiver is forced to process the received data in some way later on in order to make the data easier to utilize, and at other times, the receiver may not even be able to perform such processing and thus feel inconvenienced. In order to resolve such inconvenience, the sender must confirm the transmission method desired by the receiver before the transmission.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">On the other hand, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2005020223A"><text>JP-A- 2005-20223</text></patcit> describes an image processing apparatus including a transmission means that transmits image information and an image information accumulating means that accumulates at a registered address the image information received by the transmission means, wherein the image processing apparatus is characterized in that it includes a registered address information transmission means that, upon reception of a request from the other end of the communication or upon reception of an address designation command that designates an unregistered address, transmits the information related to the registered address to the other end of the communication according to the request or the address designation command. The image processing apparatus according to <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2005020223A"><text>JP-A- 2005-20223</text></patcit> is a facsimile machine.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">With the image processing apparatus according to <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2005020223A"><text>JP-A- 2005-20223</text></patcit>, upon a facsimile transmission, the facsimile transmission can be performed without the sender making an inquiry to the receiver even when the sender has forgotten the information related to the address registered in the facsimile on the receiver side; however, the sender needs to know the facsimile number of the facsimile on the receiver side. Moreover, since the receiver can only receive the data through a facsimile, the demand of the receiver will not be met when, for instance, the receiver desires an image of a resolution higher than that of an image received by a facsimile.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the prior art, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP0929023A"><text>EP-A-0 929 023</text></patcit> discloses apparatus for secure printing. According to this apparatus, when a user specifies that a document is to be printed securely, a special print job is created in which the document is encrypted using a session key. The session key is encrypted using the intended recipient's public key. The encrypted session key, the encrypted document, and an indication of the intended recipient identity is transmitted to a print server where the print job is held. A smart card is then used to identity the intended recipient. The secure printer can then receive and use the session key to decrypt and print the document.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention is made to solve the above-described problems, and the object of the present invention is to facilitate the designation of a destination of data while allowing the data to be delivered in a processing method desired by a user at the designated destination.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">To achieve this object a data processing system is proposed comprising the features of claim 1.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Improvements and further features of this system are subject matter of the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The data processing system of the present invention enables to be used also by registered users who mainly use own image processing apparatus as home terminal.

Moreover, when data whose destination is the user has been delivered, the data is processed by the processing method registered for that user so that the sender can deliver the data without confirming the processing method desired by the user who is set as the destination, and the user at the destination can obtain data processed<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> by the desired processing method. As result, the data processing system facilitates the designation of a destination of data while the data is delivered in a processing method desired by the user at the destination.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to another aspect of the present invention, the data processing method includes the steps of registering for each user a processing method for processing data, displaying a user for whom the processing method is registered in such a manner that the user can be designated as destination and accepting designation of the destination, designating data to be delivered to the destination designated, and processing data by the processing method registered for the user if data has been delivered whose destination is the user for whom the processing method is registered.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the present invention, a data processing method can be provided which facilitates the designation of a destination of data while allowing the data to be delivered in a processing method desired by the user at the destination.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to a further aspect of the present invention, a data processing program product stores a data processing program that causes a computer to execute the steps of registering for each user a processing method for processing data, and upon setting output of data, displaying a user for whom the processing method is registered in such a manner that the user can be designated as destination and accepting designation of the destination, and designating data to be delivered to the destination designated, and upon outputting of data, processing data by the processing method registered for the user if data has been delivered whose destination is the user for whom the processing method is registered.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the present invention, a data processing program product can be provided which facilitates the designation of a destination of data while allowing the data to be delivered in a processing method desired by a user at the destination.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is an overall schematic diagram of a data processing system according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing a hardware arrangement of an MFP according to the present embodiment.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is a flow chart showing a flow of a main process executed by the MFP.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> is a flow chart showing a flow of a user registration process executed in step S104 of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref> is a diagram showing an example of a user registration window.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 6A</figref> to 6D are diagrams showing an example of user information.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 7</figref> is a flow chart showing a flow of a user list creation process executed in step S106 of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 8</figref> is a diagram showing an example of a user list.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 9</figref> is a flow chart showing a flow of an output process executed in step S110 of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 10</figref> is a diagram showing an example of a job setting window.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 11</figref> is a diagram showing an example of a user list window.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 12</figref> is a flow chart showing a flow of a reception process executed in step S114 of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 13</figref> is a diagram showing an example of a job setting window displayed on a display when the output process is executed in a PC.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">With reference<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a data processing system 1 includes multi function peripherals (referred to as "MFP" below) 100, 100A, 100B, and 100C, personal computers (hereinafter referred to as "PC") 200 and 200A, a printer 201, and a server 300, respectively connected to a network 2. PCs 200 and 200A, and server 300 are conventional computers. Their arrangement and function are well known so that the description thereof will not be repeated. The arrangement and the function of MFP 100, 100A, 100B, and 100C are the same so that MFP 100 will be described here as an example unless otherwise noted.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">MFP (Multi Function Peripheral) 100 includes a scanner for scanning a sheet of original manuscript, an image forming portion for forming an image on recording media such as a sheet of paper based on image data, and a facsimile, and has an image scanning function, a copying function, and a facsimile transmission and reception function. Moreover, although MFP 100 is described as an example in the this embodiment, MFP 100 can be replaced by an apparatus having a function for processing an image, for instance, a scanner, an image forming apparatus, a facsimile, a personal computer for generating image data, and the like.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Network 2 is a local area network (LAN) and is connected to the Internet 3 via a gateway. Network 2 can be fixed-line or wireless. In addition, network 2 is not limited to a LAN and can be a wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet, a network using general public lines, and so on.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing a hardware arrangement of MFP 100 according to this embodiment. With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, MFP 100 includes, respectively connected to a bus 120, a central processing unit (CPU) 101, a ROM (Read Only Memory) 103 that stores a program or the like to be executed by CPU 101, a RAM (Random Access Memory) 105 for loading a program to be executed and for storing data during execution of the program, a hard disk drive (HDD) 107 for storing data in a nonvolatile manner, a card interface (I/F) 109 to which a flash ROM 108 is attached, a communication I/F 111 for connecting MFP 100 to network 2, a scanner 113, an image forming portion 115, a facsimile (FAX) 117, and an operation panel 119 as an interface with a user.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">CPU 101 loads into RAM 105 and executes a data processing<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> program stored in flash ROM 108 attached to card I/F 109. Moreover, the program executed by CPU 101 is not limited to the data processing program stored in flash ROM 108, and a program stored in an EEPROM (Electrically Erasable/Programmable Read Only Memory) connected additionally to CPU 101 can be loaded into RAM 105 and be executed. The use of an EEPROM makes it possible to rewrite or additionally write a data processing program. Thus, PCs 200, 200A, or server 300 connected to network 2 can rewrite the data processing program stored in the EEPROM of MFP 100 or additionally write a new data processing program into the EEPROM. Furthermore, MFP 100 can download a data processing program from another computer connected to Internet 3 and store the data processing program in an EEPROM. Moreover, CPU 101 may load into RAM 105 and execute a data processing program which is saved in HDD 107.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The program referred to here not only includes a program directly executable by CPU 101, but also a program in a source program format, a compressed program, an encrypted program, and the like.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Image forming portion 115 is a laser printer, an ink jet printer, or the like, and makes image data visible on recording media such as a sheet of paper. Scanner 113 includes a photoelectric transducer such as a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) and the like, and optically reads a sheet of original manuscript and outputs electronic data that is the image data.

The external storage device needs only to be a device that can be connected to PCs 200 and 200A, such as an IC card or a flash memory. Further, the data stored in the storage device of PC 200A may be designated from PC 200. In this case, the designated data is transmitted from PC 200A to PC 200 so that the processing object data is received by PC 200. Furthermore, when PC 200 is connected to a scanner, the image data scanned by that scanner may be designated.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">In addition, although the output process and the reception process are executed by MFPs 100, 100A, 100B, and 100C in this embodiment, server 300 alone may execute the reception process. In such a case, user information registering the processing methods of all users is stored in server 300. As a result, the user registration process shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> is executed in server 300 alone. Thus, the user information including the processing methods and registered user information of all users is stored in server 300. When the output process shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 9</figref> is executed, MFPs 100, 100A, 100B, and 100C will be receiving the user list from server 300 at a stage prior to displaying the user list window in step S412. Furthermore, steps S424, S426, and S428 are unnecessary, and in the case where it is determined in step S422 that the data outputting end is a "person," the data will be transmitted to server 300 along with the user identification information.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">As described above, when the user registration process is executed in MFP 100 according to this embodiment, registered user information and a processing method for processing data are inputted, and user information is stored. Thus, the registered user information and the data processing method is registered for each user. Then, the user list is generated when the user list creation process is executed in MFP 100. The user list associates apparatus identification information of a home terminal with user identification information of a user registered in MFPs 100, 100A, 100B, and 100C. When the output process is executed in MFP 100 and button 171 for designating a<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> "person" as the outputting end in area 152 of job setting window 150 is instructed, the BOX transmission is set. Then, the user list window for specifying the user identification information is displayed, and when a face image displayed in the user list window is instructed, the user identification information corresponding to the image data of that face image is obtained from the user list. In the BOX transmission, the data is transmitted to a home terminal of the user of the user identification information. Therefore, simply by designating a face image (person) in the user list window, the destination for the BOX transmission would be designated. In other words, the user list window is a window for displaying a registered user in such a manner that the user can be designated as a destination. Thus, in the BOX transmission, there is no need to input the information of a destination, and it is only required to designate the user as the destination. Moreover, when one of button 161 for instructing an input of data from scanner 113, button 162 for designating an area of HDD 107, and button 163 for instructing reading of data from storage media such as flash ROM 108 is instructed in area 151 for accepting an instruction of the selection of the data inputting end in job setting window 150, the data to be the object of the BOX transmission is designated. The designated data is transmitted to a home terminal of the user by the BOX transmission.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">On the other hand, when the reception process is executed in MFP 100, and the data transmitted by the BOX transmission by one of other MFPs 100A, 100B, and 100C is received by MFP 100, user information stored in HDD 107 is searched using the user identification information of the user who is set as the destination received along with the data. By this search, the processing method of the user information matching the received user identification information is extracted. Then, the received data is processed by the extracted processing method. Thus, the sender can deliver the data without confirming the processing method desired by the user who is set as the destination, and the user at the destination can obtain data processed by a desired processing method.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56987138" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Datenverarbeitungssystem (1) mit einem Netzwerk, einer Vielzahl von Bildverarbeitungsgeräten (100, 100A, 100B, 100C) einschließlich Heimterminals, die jeweils mit dem Netzwerk (2) verbunden sind und jeweils eine Bildabtastfunktion, eine Kopierfunktion und eine Faxübermittlungs- und Faxempfangsfunktion aufweisen, wobei jedes Bildverarbeitungsgerät aufweist:
