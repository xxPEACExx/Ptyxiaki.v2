Field of the invention:</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure describes a system using the intensity of the diaphragm electromyogram (EMG) at a given lung volume or the lung volume at a given EMG intensity to automatically or manually adjust the level of inspiratory support in proportion to changes in the neuro-ventilatory efficiency.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">The present invention relates to a system responsive to the intensity of the diaphragm electromyogram (EMG) measured immediately before the onset of inspiratory flow to automatically or manually control and maintain an optimum level of extrinsic positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) applied to a patient, and to automatically or manually control a duration from the onset of EMG to onset of respiratory flow.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Brief description of the prior art:</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">Prior art algorithms used to create closed-loop ventilator systems are based on variables such as tidal volume, respiratory rate,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> inspiratory flow, end-tidal carbon dioxide levels and/or rate of rise in pressure. However, none of these parameters can provide a reliable measure of the respiratory neural drive because they are affected by changes in neuro-mechanical or neuro-ventilatory efficiency.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO9611717A"><text>WO 96/11717</text></patcit> discloses a prior art closed-loop system which is not based on diaphragm EMG signals.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Neuro-ventilatory efficiency is a term used to express the amount of neural drive (breathing effort) needed to obtain a given tidal lung volume. In brief, neural drive is converted into mechanical tension, a process which is influenced by the muscle length, temperature, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The role of inspiratory flow in the link between neural drive and mechanical tension has previously been suggested; however the proposed influence could not be demonstrated for mean inspiratory flow rates up to 1.4 liters/second. The mechanical tension is then translated into pressure, a process which is affected by the shape of the diaphragm dome. Finally the pressure expands the alveoli and causes air to flow, and the translation of pressure to volume depends on the elasto-viscous behaviour of the respiratory system. Consequently, there are many factors that may influence the tidal volume output obtained for a given increase in neural drive (inspiratory effort).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Evaluation of respiratory drive by measurements such as the rate of rise in pressure or lung volume is not reliable when, for example, the muscle length or the respiratory system impedance are affected by changes in the neuro-ventilatory efficiency. In a patient, airway resistance and elastance can change from one minute to another and muscle length is continuously altered.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0004">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">An object of the present invention is therefore to eliminate the drawbacks of the prior art.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a closed-loop system, as defined in claim 1, responsive to the intensity of the diaphragm EMG measured immediately before the onset of inspiratory flow to quantify pre-inspiratory breathing effort in view of automatically or manually adjusting<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> a level of extrinsic positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) applied to a patient in proportion to changes in EMG intensity of pre-inspiratory efforts. In this manner, the pre-ventilatory intensity of the diaphragm EMG can be maintained at a desired, minimum level such that the pre-inspiratory neural drive remains stable at a desired target minimal level. Determination of the duration from the onset of EMG to the onset of respiratory flow is also used for quantitative evaluation of the intrinsic PEEP, and to guide adjustment of the trigger sensitivity of the ventilator systems.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Different from pressure and ventilatory related indexes, the intensity of the EMG represents the temporal (mean MU (motor unit) rate coding) and spatial (MU recruitment) summation of action potentials and is obtained at the level of the sarcolemma muscle. The intensity of the EMG is therefore not affected by changes in the muscle's neuro-ventilatory coupling. In the present invention, the use of crural diaphragm EMG rests on the assumption that neural drive to the crural diaphragm is representative for the total respiratory drive. It is also based on the condition that neuromuscular transmission and innervation of the crural diaphragm are normal. For breathing with increased demand this assumption is well founded. Hence, the intensity of the EMG needed to produce a given inspiratory volume should express the efficiency relation between neural drive and volume output.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The objects, advantages and other features of the present invention will become more apparent upon reading of the following non restrictive description of a preferred embodiment thereof,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> given by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the appended drawings:

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the catheter 13 is introduced into the patient's oesophagus through one nostril or the mouth until the array of electrodes 12 is situated at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. The diaphragm 11 and/or the oesophagus slightly move during breathing of the patient 14 whereby the array of electrodes 12 also slightly moves about the diaphragm 11. As will be explained in the following description, automatic compensation for this displacement is provided for.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to a preferred embodiment, an electrode 12 is mounted on the free end section 15 of the catheter 13 by winding stainless steel wire (not shown) around that catheter 13. The wound stainless steel wire presents a rough surface smoothed out by solder, which in turn is electroplated with nickel, copper and then gold or silver. Of course, it is within the scope of the present invention to use other electrode structures. Also, the electrodes 12 can possibly be applied to a nasogastric feeding tube (not shown) which is routinely introduced in intensive-care unit (ICU) patients.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Electric wires (not shown) interconnect each pair of successive electrodes such as 1-7 (<figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>) with a respective one of a group of differential amplifiers 16. Obviously, these electric wires follow the catheter 13 from the respective electrodes 12 to the corresponding amplifiers 16, and are preferably integrated to the catheter 13. Preferably, the electric wires transmitting the EMGdi signals collected by<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the various pairs 1-7 of electrodes 12 are shielded to reduce the influence of external noise, in particular disturbance from the 50 or 60 Hz current and voltage of the electrical mains.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The group of differential amplifiers 16 amplifies (first subtraction step of a so-called double subtraction technique) and bandpass filters each EMGdi signal. This first subtraction step may also be carried out in the personnel computer 19 when the amplifiers 16 are single-ended or equivalently designed amplifiers (monopolar readings).</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1 and 2</figref>, the free end section 15 of the catheter 13 is provided with an array of eight electrodes 12 defining seven pairs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of successive electrodes 12 respectively collecting seven different EMGdi signals. Although it has been found that EMG activity of the diaphragm (EMGdi) can be measured accurately with an oesophageal catheter 13 provided on the free end section 15 thereof with an array of eight electrodes 12, a different number and/or configuration of pairs of electrodes 12 can be contemplated depending on the patient's anatomy and movement of the diaphragm. Also, the pairs 1-7 do not need to be pairs of successive electrodes; as an example <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> illustrates an array of nine electrodes to form seven overlapping pairs of electrodes 1-7.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A major problem in recording EMGdi signals is to maintain the noise level as low and as constant as possible. Since the electric wires transmitting the EMGdi signals from the electrodes 12 to the differential amplifiers 16 act as an antenna, it is crucial, as indicated in the foregoing description, to shield these electric wires to thereby protect the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> EMGdi signals from additional artifactual noise. Also, the package enclosing the differential amplifiers 16 is preferably made as small as possible (miniaturized) and is positioned in close proximity to the patient to decrease as much as possible the distance between the electrodes 12 and the amplifiers 16.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The amplified EMGdi signals are sampled by a personal computer 19 through respective isolation amplifiers of a unit 18, to form signal segments of fixed duration. Unit 18 supplies electric power to the various electronic components of the differential and isolation amplifiers while ensuring adequate isolation of the patient's body from such power supply. The unit 18 also incorporates bandpass filters included in the respective EMGdi signal channels to eliminate the effects of aliasing. The successive EMGdi signal segments are then digitally processed into the personal computer 19 after analog-to-digital conversion thereof. This analog-to-digital conversion is conveniently carried out by an analog-to-digital converter implemented in the personal computer 19. The personal computer 19 includes a monitor 40 and a keyboard 31.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">It is believed to be within the capacity of those of ordinary skill in the art to construct suitable differential amplifiers 16 and an adequate isolation amplifiers and power supply unit 18. Accordingly, the amplifiers 16 and the unit 18 will not be further described in the present specification.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">An example of the seven EMGdi signals collected by the pairs 1-7 of successive electrodes 12 (<figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1 and 2</figref>) and supplied to the computer 19 is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As the diaphragm is generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the oesophageal catheter 13 equipped with an array of electrodes 12, only a portion of the electrodes 12 are situated in the vicinity of the diaphragm. It is therefore important to determine the position of the diaphragm with respect to the oesophageal electrode array.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The portion of the crural diaphragm 11 which forms the muscular tunnel through which the oesophageal catheter 13 is passed is referred to the "diaphragm depolarizing region" (DDR). The thickness of the DDR is 20-30 mm. It can be assumed that, within the DDR, the distribution of active muscle fibers has a center from which the majority of the EMGdi signals originate, i.e. the "diaphragm depolarizing region center" (DDR center). Therefore, EMGdi signals detected on opposite sides of the DDR center will be reversed in polarity with no phase shift; in other words, EMGdi signals obtained along the electrode array are reversing in polarity at the DDR center.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Moving centrally from the boundaries of the DDR, EMGdi power spectrums progressively attenuate and enhance in frequency. Reversal of signal polarity on either side of the electrode pair 4 with the most attenuated power spectrum confirms the position from which the EMGdi signals originate, the DDR center.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref>, the first task of the computer 19 is to determine the position of the center of the DDR along the array of electrodes 12. The center of the DDR is repeatedly determined at predetermined time intervals.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">For that purpose, filtering step 505 removes from each EMGdi signal the motion artifacts, the electrocardiogram (ECG) component, and the disturbance from the electrical mains. Motion artifacts are induced by motion of the electrodes 12. More generally, motion artifacts are defined as a low frequency fluctuation of the EMGdi signals' DC level induced by mechanical alterations of the electrode metal to electrolyte interface i.e. changes in electrode contact area and/or changes in pressure that the tissue exerts on the electrode.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In step 501, the filtered EMGdi signals from step 505 are cross-correlated in pairs. As well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, cross-correlation is a statistical determination of the phase relationship between two signals and essentially calculates the similarity between two signals in terms of a correlation coefficient r (step 502). A negative correlation coefficient r indicates that the cross-correlated signals are of opposite polarities.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref> shows curves of the value of the correlation coefficient r versus the midpoint between the pairs of electrodes from which the correlated EMGdi signals originate. In this example, the inter-electrode distance is 10 mm. Curves are drawn for distances between the correlated pairs of electrodes 12 of 5 mm (curve 20), 10 mm (curve 21), 15 mm (curve 22) and 20 mm (curve 23). One can appreciate from <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref> that negative correlation coefficients r are obtained when EMGdi signals from respective electrode pairs situated on opposite sides of the electrode pair 4 are cross-correlated. It therefore appears that the change in polarity occurs in the region of electrode pair 4, which is confirmed by the curves of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref>. Accordingly, it can be assumed that<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the center of the DDR is situated substantially midway between the electrodes 12 forming pair 4.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">For example, the center of the DDR can be precisely determined by interpolation (step 503 of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref>) using a square law based fit of the three most negative correlation coefficients of curve 21 obtained by successive cross-correlation of the EMGdi signal segments from each electrode pair to the EMGdi signal segments from the second next electrode pair.

Although EMGdi signals obtained from these positions offers a clear improvement in acceptance rate, the signal-to-noise ratio during quiet breathing still tends to remain unsatisfactorily low. The EMGdi signal obtained from one electrode pair (for example channel 0 in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 7</figref>) situated in between the two electrode pairs used to produce the double subtracted signal, can be added to this double subtracted signal either before as a raw signal or after when RMS or equivalent EMGdi signal measure has been computed, in order to minimize loss of signal.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">For example, in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref>, the EMGdi signals originating from the electrode pairs 3 and 5 situated respectively 10 mm below and 10 mm above the DDR are strongly inversely correlated at zero time delay.

Hence, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 7</figref>, subtraction of the EMGdi signals 24 and 25 from electrode pairs 3 and 5 will result into an addition of the corresponding EMGdi signals (signal 26 of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref>) and into a subtraction, that is an elimination of the common noise components.
