mxw-id="PDES63961653" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b><i>Background of the Invention</i></b></heading><heading id="h0002"><b><i>Field of the Invention</i></b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to television tuner circuits, and more specifically to a direct conversion television tuner for processing broadcast, cable, and satellite television signals.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><i>Related Art</i></b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Television signals are transmitted at radio frequencies (RF) using terrestrial, cable, or satellite transmission schemes. Terrestrial and cable TV signals are typically transmitted at frequencies of approximately 57 to 860 MHZ, with 6 MHZ channel spacings. Satellite TV signals are typically transmitted at frequencies of approximately 980 to 2180 MHz.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Regardless of the transmission scheme, a tuner is utilized to down-convert the received RF signal to an intermediate frequency (IF) signal or a baseband signal, which is suitable for processing and display on a TV or computer screen. The tuner should provide sufficient image rejection during down-conversion as is necessary for the specific application. The National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) sets standards for television signal transmission, reception, and display. To process a NTSC signal, it is preferable that the tuner have a high-level of image rejection. However, less image rejection is acceptable depending on the specific application and the corresponding display requirements.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">To achieve a high level of image rejection, traditional TV tuners utilize a dual-conversion architecture having two mixers and a surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter. The first mixer up-converts the received RF signal to a first IF frequency (e.g. 1200 MHZ) that is fixed above the RF signal band, using a variable local oscillator (LO) signal. A SAW filter, centered at the first IF, selects the channel of interest and provides the necessary image rejection to prevent<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> signal interference. The second mixer then down-converts the first IF to a lower frequency second IF, using a second fixed frequency LO signal. The second IF output is at baseband for a NTSC compatible signal. Alternatively, the second IF is at 36 or 44 MHZ for a cable system output that is fed into a set-top box or a cable modem. Channel selection is realized by adjusting the first LO signal so that the desired down-converted channel(s) falls in the narrow passband of the SAW filter. The remaining channels are rejected by the SAW filter.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Due to advances in silicon integrated circuit (IC) technology, most of the tuner components (i.e. mixers, local oscillators, etc.) can be fabricated on a single silicon IC, with the exception of the SAW filter. The SAW filter is a mechanically resonant device that is typically fabricated on a ceramic substrate, and therefore cannot be integrated on-chip with the other tuner components. As such, the SAW device remains a discrete component in the TV tuner design, which prevents the TV tuner from being fabricated on a single silicon substrate.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A single chip solution is highly desirable for TV tuners and cable modems. The single chip solution will reduce or eliminate component adjustment during manufacturing, and therefore lead to a reduction in manufacturing time and cost. The single chip solution will likely improve electrical performance of the tuner because there are parasitics associated with driving a signal off-chip for processing. Additionally, the single chip solution will reduce the size of the tuners, which becomes more critical for non-TV set applications. Therefore, what is required is a TV tuner architecture that can be implemented on a single semiconductor substrate.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Furthermore, a TV tuner with low power requirements is also desired. Cable TV operators plan to offer voice telephone service and/or Internet access to their customers over currently installed cable lines. The telephone traffic will be transmitted over the cable lines at RF frequencies, along with the TV programming. As such, the TV tuner will likely be utilized to down-convert the telephone traffic to baseband for user consumption. In the current POTS (plain old telephone service) system, government regulations require that the phone companies supply sufficient power over telephone lines to operate the customer's<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> telephone. This allows the customer to utilize the telephone during a power outage, to call the electric company for example. If a similar requirement were placed on voice-over-cable service, then the cable company would have to supply enough power over the cable lines to operate the TV tuner.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The conventional dual conversion tuner architecture requires a few watts of power for operation, which is a relatively high power requirement. The high power drain occurs because the dual conversion scheme requires two mixers that are driven by two local oscillators operating at RF frequencies. If voice-over-cable is to be realizable, then the tuner power requirements should be reduced to approximately 0.5 watt of power dissipation.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Therefore, what is needed is a tuner architecture that has good electrical characteristics ( e.g. high image rejection, and good linearity), low power requirements, and which can be implemented on a single semiconductor substrate.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP0473373A"><text>EP 0 473 373</text></patcit> describes a calibration system for use in a direct conversion receiver having a plurality of single channels which is operative for detecting and correcting for gain, DC offset and phase errors associated with the signal channels. A built-in test function is provided which may be used on a discontinuance basis to calibrate the receiver so as to correct for the inevitable variation between the amplifiers, filters and other equipment which make up the signal channels in the receiver and result in hardware-induced errors in the baseband components produced on these channels and distortion in the output of the receiver. The calibration system includes a system generator for providing a calibration signal, a control unit for regulating the overall operation of the system, a synthesizer for use in providing injection signals to the mixer in the receiver and a signal processing unit for use in determining errors and implementing appropriate corrections.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the invention, there are provided a tuner as defined by independent claim 1 and a method of calibrating a tuner for a selected channel as defined by independent claim 19.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Further advantageous features of the invention are defined by the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present invention is directed to a direct conversion television tuner for processing television or cable signals. The direct conversion television tuner down-converts a selected channel directly from an RF frequency to an IF frequency and/or baseband, without performing an intermediate up-conversion frequency translation as in conventional tuners.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The direct conversion TV tuner includes a pre-select filter, an amplifier, an image reject mixer, and an IF filter. The pre-select filter receives an RF signal having multiple TV channels. The image reject mixer down-converts a selected channel to an IF frequency that is within the passband of the IF filter. Channel selection is performed by tuning the frequency of a local oscillator signal that drives the image reject mixer, and thereby tuning the channel that is translated into the passband of the IF filter. The frequency of the IF output signal is flexible, and can be set so it is compatible with conventional set-top box and cable modem applications. Additionally, the IF output signal can be converted to a digital<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> format using an A/D converter. In embodiments, the IF output signal is further processed to generate a NTSC compatible signal that can directly drive a television set without any further processing.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In embodiments, the pre-select filter, amplifier, and the image reject mixer are individually calibrated to improve image rejection at the selected channel frequency. The calibration is performed by injecting a test signal into the tuner input, where the frequency of the test signal is at the selected channel frequency. After which, the I/Q balance of the pre-filter is separately determined based on the test signal, bypassing the effects of the amplifier and the image reject mixer. Any I/Q imbalance in the pre-select filter is corrected by adjusting filter parameters. Once the filter is calibrated, the I/Q balance of the amplifier is determined based on the test signal input, bypassing the effects of the image reject mixer. Any I/Q imbalance in the amplifier is corrected by adjusting the amplifier parameters. Once the amplifier is calibrated, the I/Q balance of the image reject mixer is determined based on the test signal input. Any I/Q imbalance in the image reject mixer is corrected by adjusting parameters of the image reject mixer, and/or by adjusting the I/Q balance of the local oscillator that drives the image reject mixer.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The calibration procedure can be repeated for each new channel selection to compensate for I/Q imbalances that vary over frequency. Additionally, the calibration procedure can be repeated for the same channel after a defined time delay to compensate for temperature effects or other miscellaneous time sensitive effects. The result of the calibration procedure is that tuner image rejection preferably meets or exceeds corresponding requirements over the input frequency band of interest.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">An advantage of the present invention is that the direct conversion tuner has a single conversion architecture. More specifically, the selected TV channel is directly down-converted to an IF frequency in a single frequency translation by the image reject mixer. In contrast, conventional tuners have a dual conversion architecture, which performs two frequency translations (one up-conversion and one down-conversion), along with off-chip filtering. The direct conversion tuner<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> has lower power requirements because the single frequency conversion only requires one high frequency local oscillator and one mixer, compared with two of each for the conventional dual conversion tuner.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Additionally, the direct conversion tuner can be fabricated on a single semiconductor substrate, which does not require any off-chip filtering. This is possible because the calibrated image reject mixer provides high image rejection, without using an off-chip SAW filter. As a result, the direct conversion tuner enables a single-chip solution for TV tuner and cable modem applications.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Further features and advantages of the present invention, as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments of the present invention, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><i>Brief Description of the Drawings</i></b></heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">The present invention is described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

More specifically, the spectrum 608 illustrates an exemplary RF input 602 having a RF carrier 610 at 800 MHZ, and two RF channels 612, 614 at 794 MHZ and 806 MHZ, respectively. For purposes of illustration, the LO input 606 is set to 800 MHZ so that the RF input 602 is frequency translated to 0 Hz by the tuner 600. More specifically, the RF carrier 602 is translated to 0 Hz to create a DC signal 618. The RF channels 612, 614 are translated to -6 MHZ and +6 MHZ, respectively, resulting in IF signals 616 and 620 as shown. However, negative frequencies are a mathematical convenience, and fold over into the positive frequency domain. Assuming no image rejection, the signal 616 folds on top of the signal 620 as shown. Therefore, without image rejection, channels 612 and 614 interfere with each other during down-conversion, and neither channel is recoverable. Image rejection is calculated as the relative amplitude of the desired image compared to the undesired image. For example, if the channel 614 is the desired channel, then the image rejection of the tuner 600 is the ratio of the signal 620 amplitude compared to the signal 616 amplitude. If tuner 600 had perfect image rejection, then the amplitude of the signal 616 would be zero.</p><heading id="h0008"><b><i>3. Conventional Tuner</i></b></heading><p id="p0035" num="0035">Before describing the invention in detail, it is useful to describe a conventional tuner for purposes of comparison. <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a conventional tuner 700 that is a dual conversion tuner. The tuner 700 performs two frequency translations (one up-conversion, one down-conversion) to meet the high image rejection requirement. The tuner 700 receives a RF signal 701 having multiple<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> TV channels that each have a 6 MHZ bandwidth, and collectively occupy a frequency range of 57-860 MHZ. The tuner 700 down-converts a selected channel from the RF signal 701, and outputs the selected channel as an IF signal 724. In embodiments, the frequency of the IF signal 724 is 36 MHZ, or 44 MHZ, or some other desired IF frequency.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The detailed operation of the conventional tuner 700 is as follows. An RF amplifier 704 amplifies the RF input signal 701 prior to frequency translation. A first mixer 706 mixes the RF input signal 701 with a variable LO signal 708. The LO 710 varies the frequency of the LO signal 708 from 1200 to 2100 MHZ. Therefore, the RF input signal 701 is up-converted to a frequency above the 57-860 MHZ band, resulting in an up-converted signal 707. The up-converted signal 707 is sent off-chip to a SAW filter 712, which has a narrow passband at 1200 MHz. The SAW filter 712 selects a desired channel 713 that falls within its narrow passband, and substantially rejects all of the remaining channels. Therefore, a particular channel is selected by varying the frequency of the LO signal 708 so that the desired channel is up-converted into the passband of the SAW filter 712.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Still referring to <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 7</figref>, the desired channel 713 is sent back on-chip to a second mixer 714, which is driven by a fixed local oscillator 718. The mixer 714 down-converts the desired channel using a fixed local oscillator signal 716, resulting in an IF signal 715. Given that the SAW filter is centered at 1200 MHZ, the frequency of the LO signal 716 is appropriately selected to provide an IF at 36 MHZ, 44 MHZ, or some other desired IF frequency. The off-chip IF filter 720 further removes any unwanted harmonics and images from the IF signal 715, resulting in the IF signal 721. The IF signal 721 is amplified by the IF amplifier 722, to produce the IF output 724.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The dual conversion architecture of the conventional tuner 700 has several disadvantages. For instance, there are two of each component including two mixers, two high frequency local oscillators, and two off-chip filters. This results in a high DC power requirement (about 3 watts) because each of the two mixers is driven by a separate high frequency local oscillator, where each local oscillator<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> (LO) must generate sufficient power at high frequencies to operate its corresponding mixer. A second disadvantage is that the SAW filter is an off-chip component that prevents a single chip tuner solution, which has inherent manufacturing advantages. Additionally, electrical performance is degraded by taking a high frequency signal off-chip (and back on-chip) because of the inherent parasitics that are involved.</p><heading id="h0009"><b><i>4.

Therefore, it is desirable for the tuner to output a baseband NTSC signal, which can drive a TV monitor without the need for a set-top box.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081"><figref idrefs="f0019">FIG.16</figref> illustrates a post processing module 1600 that converts the analog IF signal 1320 to a baseband NTSC output signal 1608. The post processing module 1600 includes an A/D converter 1602, a digital signal processor 1604, and a D/A converter 1606. During operation, the A/D converter 1602 samples and down-converts the analog IF signal 1320 according to a clock signal 1609, to generate a digital signal 1603. In embodiments, the clock signal 1609 is a subharmonic clock signal so that the A/D converter 1602 sub-samples the analog IF signal 1320. The DSP 1604 processes the digital signal 1603 to produce a NTSC digital signal 1605. In other words, the NTSC signal 1605 contains the NTSC information at baseband, but in a digital format, instead of the desired analog format. Finally, the D/A converter 1606 converts the digital signal 1605 to an analog NTSC signal 1608, which can drive a TV monitor.</p><heading id="h0016"><b><i>5.
