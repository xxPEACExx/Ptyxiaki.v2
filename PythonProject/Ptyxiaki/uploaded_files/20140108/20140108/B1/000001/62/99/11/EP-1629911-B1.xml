load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a cutting tool for dressing electrode tips according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a cutting tool is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5401127A"><text>US 5 401 127</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">The useful life and/or usefulness of a cutting tool can often be improved by providing it with replaceable cutting inserts on which cutting edges for cutting a workpiece are provided. Instead of, for example, disposing of the cutting tool when a cutting edge breaks or becomes worn, the cutting insert can be replaced and the cutting tool can be used again. Also, the cutting inserts can be made of material that is better adapted to perform a cutting operation on a workpiece than the material from which the remainder of the cutting tool, often called a toolholder, is formed.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Such cutting tools with replaceable inserts are used in a variety of applications. For example, it is known to dress the opposing tips of welding electrodes using cutting tools with replaceable cutting inserts such as is disclosed in, for example, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5401127A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,401,127</text></patcit>. This patent describes a cutting tool that uses a Y-shaped and/or triangular cutting inserts arranged around a central opening through which the axis of rotation of the cutting tool passes to simultaneously dress a top and a bottom electrode extending into the central opening from opposite ends of the central opening. Though the inserts in the cutting tool are replaceable, they are usable in only a single orientation relative to the cutting tool and the costs of operating the tool may be high.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The present invention solves the above mentioned problem by providing a tool for dressing electrode tips according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Certain replaceable cutting inserts are indexable, i.e., can be oriented in plural different ways on the cutting tool to expose one or more of plural useable cutting edges to a workpiece. Many cutting tools, however, do not readily lend themselves to being provided with an indexable<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> cutting insert. The cutting inserts used in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5401127A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,401,127</text></patcit>, for example, cannot be indexed.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A common technique of securing an indexable cutting insert to a toolholder is to use a screw that passes through a hole in a central region of the cutting insert and has threads that engage with threads in a hole formed in a pocket for the insert in the toolholder. The insert is typically indexed to one of two or more positions by being rotated around the screw. In some toolholders, however, it is difficult to provide a suitable threaded hole in the pocket of the toolholder. For example, it may be necessary to form the pocket on a relatively thin or fragile portion of the toolholder, and providing the threaded hole risks damage to the toolholder or insufficient support for the insert.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In accordance with an aspect of the invention, a tool for dressing electrode tips includes a toolholder having an opening extending through the toolholder from a top of the toolholder to a bottom of the toolholder along a central axis of the toolholder, and a plurality of insert mounting pockets disposed around the opening for mounting replaceable cutting inserts, the plurality of insert mounting pockets including a center pocket, a top pocket, and a bottom pocket. The tool also includes a center insert removably disposed in the center pocket, a top insert removably disposed in the top pocket, and a bottom insert removably disposed in the bottom pocket. When a top electrode tip and a bottom electrode tip are disposed in a dressing position relative to a top and a bottom of the opening in the toolholder and the tool is rotated, the center insert and the top insert dress the top electrode tip, and the center insert and the bottom insert dress the bottom electrode tip.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In accordance with another example, a cutting tool includes a toolholder having an insert mounting pocket for mounting a replaceable cutting insert, a securing screw, and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> an insert disposed in the pocket, the insert including an insert body including a plurality of cutting edge portions and an insert hole arrangement for permitting the insert to be secured to a toolholder in the pocket by the securing screw, the insert hole arrangement including at least one securing screw-receiving hole, the insert hole arrangement being configured to permit the securing screw to extend through the insert body along any one of at least two different axes of the insert hole arrangement, the insert hole arrangement including a screw abutment surface for abutting against the securing screw.</p><heading id="h0001"><u>Brief Description of the Drawings</u></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The features and advantages of the present invention are well understood by reading the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings in which like numerals indicate similar elements and in which:</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">FIGS. 1A-1E</figref> are side cross-sectional, top perspective, bottom perspective, bottom plan, and top plan views of a cutting tool according to an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIGS. 2A-2F</figref> are top, rear perspective, bottom rear perspective, top plan, side cross-sectional, bottom plan, and side plan views of a cutting insert according to an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0008">FIGS. 3A-3F</figref> are top, rear perspective, bottom rear perspective, top plan, side cross-sectional, bottom plan, and side plan views of a cutting insert according to another embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0010 f0011">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref> are, respectively, a side cross-sectional and a broken perspective view of a portion of a cutting tool according to an embodiment of the present invention;<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 5</figref> is a side cross-sectional view of a cutting tool according to an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0013 f0014">FIGS. 6A-6B</figref> are top and side views showing relative positions of inserts for use in a cutting tool according to an embodiment of the present invention</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0015">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref> are top views of inserts according to embodiments of the present invention;</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 8</figref> is a perspective view of a guide plate according to an embodiment of the present invention; and</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0018">FIG. 9</figref> is a perspective view of a cutting tool including a guide plate according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Detailed Description</u></heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">An embodiment of a tool 21 for dressing electrode tips is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">FIGS. 1A-1E</figref>. The present invention is not limited to tools for dressing electrode tips. However, for purposes of discussion the present invention will generally be described in connection with a tool for dressing electrode tips.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref>, the tool 21 includes a toolholder 23 having an opening 25 extending through the toolholder from a top 27 of the toolholder to a bottom 29 of the toolholder along a central axis C of the toolholder. A plurality of insert mounting pockets are disposed around the opening 25 for mounting replaceable cutting inserts. The plurality of insert mounting pockets include a center pocket 31, a top pocket 33, and a bottom pocket 35.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Some types of tools, such as turning, boring, drilling, or<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> milling tools, may have only one insert mounting pocket for mounting a single insert, while other versions of such tools may have dozens or hundreds of insert mounting pockets.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The tool 21 also includes a center insert 41 disposed in the center pocket 31, a top chamfer 43 insert disposed in the top pocket 33, and a bottom chamfer insert 45 disposed in the bottom pocket 35. When a top electrode tip and a bottom electrode tip (shown in phantom in <figref idrefs="f0013 f0014">FIGS. 6A-6B</figref>) are disposed in a dressing position relative to a top and a bottom of the opening 25 in the toolholder and the tool 21 is rotated, the center insert 41 and the top chamfer insert 43 dress the top electrode tip, and the center insert 41 and the bottom chamfer insert 45 dress the bottom electrode tip.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As seen in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIGS. 2A-2F</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008 f0009">3A-3F,</figref> the inserts 41, 43, and 45 may have a plurality of cutting edge portions. It is desirable that the top chamfer insert 43 and the bottom chamfer insert 45 be identical and the illustrations of the top chamfer insert in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIGS. 3A-3F</figref> and the corresponding description shall be understood to apply to the bottom chamfer insert, as well, except where otherwise noted. For the inserts 41, 43, and 45, designations of "left" and "right" are substantially arbitrary and for purposes of discussion as the inserts will ordinarily be formed to be indexable such that left can become right and vice versa.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Cutting edge portions are defined for purposes of the present application as portions of a cutting edge that are intended to be exposed to and contact a workpiece such as an electrode tip. Exposed, in the sense used here, means that the cutting edge portion is in a position where it is adapted to contact a workpiece, instead of merely being visible but not adapted to contact a workpiece in any meaningful fashion. A cutting edge portion may comprise all or, more typically, part of a cutting edge.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">It is desirable that at least one of the center insert 41, the top chamfer insert 43, and the bottom chamfer insert 45 is indexable to permit at least one of two or more cutting edge portions to be exposed. Ordinarily, all of the inserts will be indexable to multiple positions to permit multiple cutting edge portions to be exposed. In this way, it is not necessary to dispose of a cutting insert every time a cutting edge portion is worn or broken. If the cutting edge portion is worn or broken, the insert can simply be indexed to expose a different cutting edge portion.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">For example, as seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1A</figref>, in the tool 21, at any given time, two cutting edge portions 41<sup>1</sup> and 41<sup>2</sup> of the center insert 41 are exposed, one portion 41<sup>1</sup> being closer to a top of the opening 25 and one portion 41<sup>2</sup> being closer to the bottom of the opening, and two cutting edge portions 41<sup>3</sup> and 41<sup>4</sup> are not exposed. As seen in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS. 1D</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">1E</figref>, corners of the center insert by the exposed cutting edge portions can be disposed at or near the central axis C of the toolholder 23.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">By turning the center insert 41 through 180°, the two cutting edge portions 41<sup>1</sup> and 41<sup>2</sup> that were exposed are moved to a position where they are not exposed, and the two cutting edge portions 41<sup>3</sup> and 41<sup>4</sup> that were not exposed are moved to a position where they are exposed. Thus, the center insert 41 is indexable to two different positions to expose four cutting edge portions 41<sup>1</sup>, 41<sup>2</sup>, 41<sup>3</sup>, and 41<sup>4</sup>. In the tool 21, at least one, ordinarily two, of the cutting edge portions 41<sup>1</sup>, 41<sup>2</sup>, 41<sup>3</sup>, and 41<sup>4</sup> of the center insert is disposed at or near a center axis C of the opening.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Also, in the tool 21, at any given time, one cutting edge portion of the top chamfer insert 43 and one cutting edge portion of the bottom chamfer insert 45 is exposed. Corners of the top chamfer insert 43 and the bottom chamfer insert 45 by the exposed cutting edge portions can be disposed at approximately the same radius from the central axis C of the toolholder 23, albeit<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> usually at different radial positions, and at approximately the same axial positions as ends of the exposed cutting edge portions of the center insert 41. In this way, when the toolholder rotates relative to electrode tips, the exposed cutting edge portions of the top and bottom inserts and the center insert do not fail to contact any portion of the electrode tips that one desires to dress. It may, in fact, be desirable for there to be some overlap of the rotational paths of the cutting edge portions of the various inserts when the toolholder rotates 23 to ensure that each electrode tip is entirely dressed.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The top chamfer insert 43 and the bottom chamfer insert 45 may each be indexable to four different positions to expose four different cutting edge portions, such as the cutting edge portions 43<sup>1</sup>, 43<sup>2</sup> 43<sup>3</sup>, and 43<sup>4</sup> for the top chamfer insert. In the tool 21, the top chamfer insert 43 and the bottom chamfer insert 45 can be identical and, in two of the index positions for the top chamfer insert and the bottom chamfer insert, the top chamfer insert and the bottom chamfer insert are seated in the top pocket 31 and the bottom pocket 45, respectively, while, in the other two index positions, the top chamfer insert and the bottom chamfer insert are seated in the bottom pocket and the top pocket respectively, i.e., the top insert becomes the bottom insert and vice versa. The number of index positions to which a particular insert is indexable and the number of cutting edge portions of an insert that are adapted to be exposed will, of course, depend upon the insert and the toolholder.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0007">FIGS. 2A-2F</figref>, the center insert 41 may include what shall be denominated for purposes of discussion a top surface 41t, a bottom surface 41b, a right surface 41r, a left surface 411, a front surface 41x, and a rear surface 41y. As seen in <figref idrefs="f0010 f0011">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>, in the tool 21, the center pocket 31 includes a bottom supporting surface 31 b and a left side supporting surface 311 (<figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">FIG. 1C-1D</figref>) and a right side supporting surfaces 31r. Supporting<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> surface portions of the center insert 41 are supported against the bottom surface 31b and the two side (or left and right) supporting surfaces 31l and 31r. More specifically, in the illustrated embodiment, when the center insert 41 is oriented so that the cutting edge portions 41<sup>1</sup> and 41<sup>2</sup> are exposed, a supporting surface portion of the bottom surface 41b abuts the bottom surface 31b, a supporting surface portion of the rear surface 41y abuts the left surface 31l (<figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">FIGS. 1C-1D</figref>), and a supporting surface portion of the left surface 411 abuts the right supporting surface 31r. When the center insert is oriented so that the cutting edge portions 41<sup>3</sup> and 41<sup>4</sup> are exposed, a supporting surface portion of the top (now bottom) surface 41t will abut the bottom surface 31b, a supporting surface portion of the rear surface 41y will abut the left surface 311, and a supporting surface portion of the right surface 41r will abut the right supporting surface 31r.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As seen in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIGS. 3A-3F</figref>, the top chamfer insert 43 may also have a top surface 43t, bottom surface 43b, right surface 43r, left surface 431, front surface 43x, and rear surface 43y.

It may, therefore, be desirable to offset the axis of the holes 41h, 43h, and 45h relative to the line of reflective symmetry because, when the inserts 41, 43, and 45 are mounted relative to the pockets 31, 33, and 35, the holes 41h, 43h, and 45h can align with holes in the toolholder 23 e.g., hole 31h (<figref idrefs="f0010 f0011">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>), formed in portions of the toolholder that are thicker, i.e., further from the tip of the triangle. This may permit more threads of the securing screws 47 to engage with threads in the holes in the toolholder than if the holes 41h, 43h, and 45h were located along a line of reflective symmetry.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">It has also been found to be desirable to form the holes 41h, 43h, and 45h as elongated or plural holes, or what shall be referred to here as a hole arrangement, so that, when the inserts 41, 43, and 45 are indexed, an axis of a securing screw can pass through the inserts along what shall be referred to here as different axes X and Y of the hole arrangements.

For example, the hole arrangements may simply be elongated, i.e., oval, so that the axis of a screw can pass through a hole at a plurality of different hole axes. Also, instead of having a single hole, the hole arrangements may be made up of a plurality of discrete holes as seen in <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 7A</figref> so that the axis of the screw can pass through the insert along a plurality of different hole axes. The hole<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> arrangements can be formed, as well, in shapes such as "tri-star" shapes as seen in <figref idrefs="f0016">FIG. 7B</figref> and "X" shapes as seen in <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 7C</figref>, which may be appropriate depending upon factors such as the number of ways that the insert can be indexed. For example, an insert with a tri-star shaped hole arrangement might be indexed three ways, six ways, or some other multiple of three, an insert with an X-shaped hole arrangement might be indexed four ways, eight ways, or some other multiple of four. For example, if the insert of <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 7C</figref> were octagonal instead of square, it may be possible to index the insert to sixteen (or more) different positions.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Whatever the shape of the hole arrangements 410 and 430 is when viewed in a direction of the axis or axes through the hole arrangements, the hole arrangements may be formed to be narrower toward a center of the inserts 41, 43, and 45 along the axes through the hole arrangements, i.e., viewing the insert in cross-section, so that the hole arrangements taper from wider openings at the top and bottom of the insert to relatively narrower "waists" at the center. <figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 5</figref> shows an illustrative insert 100 in cross-section.

One benefit is that a smaller portion of the rear surface of an insert, i.e., the portion not including the recess, needs to meet precise dimensional tolerances desired in cutting inserts.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Another benefit is that the provision of the recess facilitates precisely and stably mounting the inserts relative to their pockets by ensuring desirable three-point contact between an insert and its pocket.

In the case of a top insert 43 (or bottom insert 45) to be mounted in a top or bottom pocket 33 or 35 having no right surface, three point contact can be achieved by contact between two points on the rear surface 43y on opposite sides of the recess 43z and the left surface 331 or 351 of the pocket, and contact between the bottom 43b (or top 43t) of the insert and the bottom 33b or 35b of the pocket.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">With reference generally to <figref idrefs="f0007">FIGS. 2A-2F</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008 f0009">3A-3F</figref>, the inserts 41, 43, and 45 are ordinarily symmetrical about at least one axis A and the insert hole arrangements 410 and 430 are ordinarily configured such that at least two of the at least two different axes X and Y are offset from the at least one axis of symmetry.
