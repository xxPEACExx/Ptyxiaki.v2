load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to a process for the airless spray-coating of a surface with a viscous aqueous architectural coating composition (such as a woodstain, paint, lacquer or varnish) being a process able to cope with non-Newtonian flow if necessary at pressures of up to 5 bar, these being pressures achievable from simple hand pumps. The significance of non-Newtonian flow is that it complicates low pressure spraying. The significance of hand pumps (or more correctly "hand-operated compressors") is that they are suitable for use by amateur (ie. do-it-yourself) users who are usually unsophisticated and therefore unlikely to have the skill or will to invest in the sophisticated types of expensive high pressure spraying apparatus currently used to spray viscous aqueous compositions in industry. An "airless" spray-coating process is a process which does not require an accompanying stream of air to assist its atomisation during spraying.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Architectural coating compositions are designed for application to surfaces found in or as part of buildings such as walls, ceilings, window frames, doors and door frames, radiators and customised furniture. They can also be supplied for application to surfaces related to buildings which surfaces are found in land (eg. gardens and yards) surrounding buildings. Such related surfaces include the stone or concrete surfaces of walls and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the planed or rough cut wooden surfaces of fences, gates and sheds. Architectural coatings are intended to be applied on site at ambient temperatures and humidity by either amateur and/or professional painters. Ambient temperatures are typically from 5 to 45°C. Aqueous architectural coating compositions are often called "latex" or "emulsion" paints if they contain significant amounts (eg. more than 7 wt %) of solid materials.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Aqueous architectural coating compositions comprise an organic film-forming binder polymer which firstly serves to bind a dried coat of the composition to a surface to which it has been applied and secondly serves to bind any other ingredients of the composition such as pigments, dyes, opacifiers, extenders and biocides into the dried coat. The binder polymer is a significant cause of non-Newtonian flow.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A wide variety of conventional film-forming binder polymers are available for use in architectural coating compositions, but those most commonly used are of three broad types obtained from mono-ethylenically unsaturated monomers and known colloquially as "acrylics", "vinyls" or "styrenics". The "acrylics" are usually copolymers of at least two alkyl esters of one or more mono-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids (e.g. methyl methacrylate/butyl acrylate copolymer) whilst the "vinyls" usually comprise copolymers of a mono-vinyl ester of a saturated carboxylic acid such as vinyl acetate and at least one of either an acrylic monomer or a different mono-vinyl ester, often the vinyl ester of a carboxylic acid containing 10 to 12 carbon atoms such as those sold under the trade name "Versatate" by Resolution Europe BV of Rotterdam. The "styrenics" are copolymers containing styrene (or a similar mono-vinyl aromatic monomer) together with a copolymerisable monomer which is usually an acrylic. A fuller description of suitable aqueous binder polymers is given in the <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>third edition of an "Introduction to Paint<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> Chemistry" by G P A Turner, published in 1967 by Chapman and Hall of London</text></nplcit>, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Architectural coating compositions need a viscosity at low sheer (ie. a Brookfield viscosity) of at least 0.5 pa.sec (pascal.second) so that if they are applied to a vertical surface, the applied coating will generally resist "sagging", ie. running down the surface before the coating has had time to dry enough to lose fluidity. "Sagging" is illustrated in Plate 14 of the "<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="b"><text>Handbook of Painting and Decorating Products" by A H Beckly published in 1983 by Granada of Lond</text></nplcit>on, the contents of Plate 14 are herein incorporated by reference. In aqueous coating compositions, much of the viscosity is often imparted by the inclusion cellulosic thickeners of long or medium chain lengths and these too contribute to non-Newtonian flow. A fuller description of thickeners suitable for use in aqueous architectural coating compositions is given by <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="b"><text>E J Schaller and P R Sperry in Chapter 4 of Volume 2 of "The handbook of Coatings Additives" edited by L J Calbo, the contents of which Chapter 2</text></nplcit> are herein incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Schaller and Sperry explain that there is a need for thickeners in latex paints to adjust viscosity in order to control various properties of the paints including sagging and also film build and levelling. They list the various ways in which viscosity can be increased, but conclude that thickeners (which they alternatively call "water-soluble polymers") afford a much more efficient and controllable means of adjusting viscosity. Schaller and Sperry continue by distinguishing between two types of thickeners known as "non-associative thickeners" and "associative thickeners". Non-associative thickeners are water soluble (or at least water-swellable) polymers which increase viscosity mainly by overlap and/or entanglement of their polymer chains and/or by their occupation of<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> large volumes of space within the coating composition. These affects are promoted by the molecular weight, stiffness and straightness of their polymer chains. Associative thickeners are also water-soluble (or at least water-swellable) polymers. They have chemically attached hydrophobic groups that are capable of self-association into micellar-like assemblies as well as non-specific adsorption onto all colloidal surfaces present. This behaviour is similar to that of conventional surfactants. It results in a transient network of polymer chains which increase the Brookfield viscosity of coating compositions.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">By far the most important non-associative thickeners are the long, medium or short chain cellulose ethers known as "cellulosics" which comprise straight and stiff polymeric backbones making cellulosics exceptionally effective in increasing the viscosity of aqueous systems. Chain length is defined in terms of weight average molecular weights as derived from viscosity measurements. Examples of cellulosics include hydroxyethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and ethylhydroxyethyl cellulose.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Long chain (eg. molecular weights above 250 000 Da) and medium chain (eg. 100 000 to 250 000 Da) cellulosics increase viscosity by chain entanglement which enables high Brookfield viscosities to be achieved at low concentrations. However if the concentrations of cellulosics have to be increased to achieve the high shear viscosities needed for high film build, they will also impart unwanted high elasticity to the coating composition contributing to poor atomisation during spraying and a subsequent inhibition of the levelling of the freshly applied coating.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Short chain cellulosics (eg. molecular weights below 100 000 Da) increase viscosity mainly by concentration affects (eg. occupation of volume) and so they are less likely to produce unwanted increases in<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> elasticity. However, higher concentrations are needed to achieve the required Brookfield viscosities. Such high concentrations are expensive to use and they significantly harm the water-resistance of the applied coating when dry.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Associative thickeners overcome the shortcomings of cellulosics. The transient networks they create produce increases in Brookfield viscosity comparable with those achievable with high molecular weight cellulosics. This allows them to be used in relatively small concentrations which do not seriously detract from the water-resistance of the dried coating. Also associative thickeners are relatively low in molecular weight and so they do not form the entanglements which give the unwanted high elasticity which hinders spraying and levelling.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Schaller and Sperry report that four main types of broadly hydrophobicly modified equivalent performances have found extensive commercial use in aqueous coating compositions. The first main type is the hydrophobically modified alkali soluble emulsion or "HASE" type. Commercial examples of HASEs have hydrophilic backbones comprising salts of polymerised or copolymerised unsaturated carboxylic acids or acid anhydrides such as acrylic or methacrylic acids or maleic anhydride. Hydrophilic moieties such as polyalkylene glycols (eg. polyethylene glycol) are attached to the hydrophilic backbones and hydrophobic groups are in turn are attached to the hydrophilic moieties. In use, solutions of these HASEs are added as free-flowing liquids to a coating composition at neutral or slightly acidic pH. An increase in Brookfield viscosity is then caused by raising the pH to mildly alkaline conditions whereupon carboxylate anions are formed.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The second type of associative thickener is the hydrophobicly modified hydroxy alkyl (especially ethyl) cellulosic or "HMHEC" type<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> conveniently made by the addition of long chain alkyl epoxides to hydroxyalkyl celluloses of the type used as non-associative thickeners.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The third type of associative thickener is the block/condensation copolymer "HEUR" type comprising hydrophilic blocks and hydrophobic blocks usually terminating in hydrophobic groups. The hydrophilic blocks may be provided by polyalkylene oxide (especially polyethylene oxide) moieties of relatively low molecular weight of say below 10 000 Da, preferably 3 400 to 8 000 Da. The hydrophilic blocks are condensed with for example hydrophobic urethane-forming di-isocyanates such as toluene di-isocyanate.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The fourth type of associative thickener is the hydrophobicly modified polyacrylamide type in which the hydrophobic groups are incorporated as free radical copolymers with N-alkyl acrylamides. These are most useful in acidic coating compositions.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A fifth major type of associative thickener has been introduced since Schaller and Sperry's review. This is the hydrophobicly modified ethoxylated oxide urethane alkali-swellable emulsion or "HEURASE" type. This type combines the functionality of the HASE and HEUR types.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Many surfaces, especially the surfaces of rough cut (ie. unplaned) wood, are left uncoated even in circumstances where they would benefit from the decorative or protective results achievable using architectural coatings. It is estimated that in Britain, two thirds of surfaces which could benefit from aqueous coatings are nevertheless left uncoated because coating by brush or roller is too time consuming. For example when the coating composition is aqueous and viscous, a standard size fence panel of rough cut wood takes about 9 to 10 minutes to coat by brush or 4 to 5 minutes to coat by roller. A professional painter using an electrically powered airless high pressure spraying apparatus operating at pressures of<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> over 50 bar can coat the same panel in 30 to 60 seconds. Unfortunately, few amateur users would want to purchase such electrically powered apparatus nor would they be comfortable using such high pressures.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Inexpensive low pressure spraying apparatus which can be pressurised up to about 3 bar using a hand-operated compressor is widely used by amateurs (especially gardeners) for spraying organic solvent-based liquids such as woodstains, fungicides and insecticides. These compositions are simple to spray because they have negligible Brookfield viscosity and contain low or zero contents of solid material. Often a low Brookfield viscosity is essential if these liquids are required to soak into wood or flow into inaccessible parts of vegetation. Attempts to use the same apparatus to spray aqueous architectural coating compositions (particularly aqueous woodstains) having a Brookfield viscosity at 22° C of at least 0.5 (but generally not over 50 and usually 1 to 12) pa.sec and solid contents of above 7 wt % have resulted in the production of approximately cylindrical jets of small radii which impact onto no more than a tiny and approximately circular area of a target surface. The small size of this area makes the coating process very time consuming.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">For quick coating, it is also desirable that the spraying apparatus be capable of spraying large volumes per minute of the aqueous architectural coating composition. It is preferred that a volume velocity of at least 0.2 (preferably 0.3 to 0.7) litre/minute of composition be delivered to a target surface at the preferred distance of about 300mm otherwise the target surface can only be traversed slowly.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As a result of the discovery which lead to this invention, it has now been found possible to devise a quick process for the airless spray-coating of a surface with a viscous aqueous non-Newtonian architectural coating composition even when containing dispersed solid matter. Moreover, the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> process employs inexpensive spraying apparatus operating at pressures low enough to be used comfortably by an amateur and to be easily generated using a hand- operated compressor.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Accordingly, this invention provides a process for the airless spray-coating of a surface with a viscous aqueous non-Newtonian architectural coating composition comprising a binder polymer and ingredients chosen from pigments, dyes, opacifiers and extenders which composition is suitable for coating vertical surfaces wherein
<ol><li>a) the composition contains a thickener and</li><li>b) the composition is subjected to a pressure of from 2.5 to 5 bar (preferably 3 to 4.3) and then sprayed from a nozzle to produce an outflow of the coating composition, which outflow has non-convergent boundaries at least until it has formed a front of at least 30 mm in width.</li></ol></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">This invention also provides a process for the airless spray-coating of a surface with a viscous aqueous non-Newtonian architectural coating composition comprising a binder polymer and ingredients chosen from pigments, dyes, opacifiers and extenders which composition is suitable for coating vertical surfaces wherein
<ol><li>a) the composition contains an associative thickener and</li><li>b) the composition is subjected to a pressure of from 2 to 5 bar and then sprayed from an outlet orifice (52) in a nozzle (50) to produce an essentially flat outflow (31) of the coating composition.</li></ol></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Preferably the nozzle defines an outlet orifice in the form of a slot where the slot extends transversely of the flow of the composition through the nozzle. More specifically, the outlet orifice comprises an elongated exit having a first or "major" dimension which extends transversely of the general flow of the composition through the nozzle. The exit has a second<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> or "minor" dimension orthogonal to the major dimension and it too extends transversely of the flow of the composition through the nozzle. In short, the major and minor dimensions define a slot transverse to the general flow of the composition through the nozzle. Preferably the minor dimension has a maximum size of 0.25 to 0.45 mm (preferably 0.3 to 0.4 mm) and the major dimension has a size of from 0.5 to 1.5 mm.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">It has been discovered that when viscous aqueous non-Newtonian architectural coating compositions are delivered to the nozzle at a pressure of below 2.5 bar, the outflow of the composition from the outlet orifice is initially divergent, but its boundaries soon converge to form an approximately cylindrical jet which quickly breaks up into a stream of large drops of irregular size. When aimed at a target surface, the stream of large drops coats only a tiny area of the surface and so coating the whole surface would be a very slow process. Also, this tiny target area receives a heavy delivery of coating composition (especially at delivery rates of 0.2 litres/minute or more) and this leads to a surfeit of composition which will dribble down a target surface if it is vertical. This sequence of events is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> of the drawings. The true nature of the flows associated with the spraying apparatus is not properly understood, but it is supposed that at pressures below 2.5 bar, the surface tension of the composition is quite large relative to the inertial forces present in the composition as it leaves the exit from the outlet orifice and so surface tension quickly draws in the boundaries of the flow to form the approximately cylindrical jet followed by the large irregular drops.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Increasing the delivery pressure accelerates the flow through the outlet orifice and it is supposed that this brings the inertial forces more into balance with the surface tension and so produces a longer, wider and more planar, (ie flat) flow as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>. Once again the flow<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> has initially divergent boundaries which are subsequently caused to converge presumably by surface tension before the flow again disintegrates into large drops. The disintegration only occurs after the flow has presented the relatively planar flow having a wider front spaced at a greater and therefore more convenient distance from the outlet. This wider front can be traversed across a target surface whereupon it applies bands of coating composition of widths similar to those obtained using a typical small paint brush of say 30 mm width. Therefore it provides a usable but relatively slow coating process.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">If the delivery pressure is increased to over 3 bar, it is supposed that the inertial forces and surface tension come into closer balance with the result that the planar flow widens to give an approximately parabolic fantail as illustrated by <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>. Using pressures above 3.5 bar, this fantail can reach widths of over 100 mm before it to breaks up into large drops. Such widths correspond to quite wide brushes, so provided the composition is being sprayed at a useful volume per minute, the composition can be applied very quickly across a target surface. As it leaves the outlet orifice, the fantail comprises a homogenous distribution of the composition which is important for acceptably uniform coating, but it not known whether the fantail comprises an integral sheet of liquid or an atomised mist of closely spaced fine droplets or possibly a combination of both.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Finally, increasing the pressure to somewhere between 4.5 and 5 bar causes the flow to break up close to the outlet orifice. This causes the expelled composition to form very large drops very quickly as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref>. Such large drops give very inhomogeneous coatings often characterised by the appearance of streaks. It is supposed that the inertial forces now greatly exceed the ability of surface tension to control the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> shape of the flow. Accordingly, it would appear that there is an unexpected window of conditions between 2.5 and 5 bar which permit the spraying of viscous non-Newtonian aqueous architectural coating compositions using pressures low enough to be comfortably generated using a hand-operated compressor. The preferred range of pressures forming an optimum fantail is 3.5 to 4.5 bar, though a range of 3.2 to 3.6 bar may be better suited for use by less physically strong female amateurs.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Selecting an optimum nozzle geometry is a simple matter. It is suggested that to begin, a nozzle should be chosen whose outlet exit has major and minor dimensions in about the middle of the preferred ranges, say 0.33 mm and 0.75 mm respectively and then the delivery pressure can be varied stepwise from 3.2 to 4.5 bar to investigate how the flow varies with pressure in this range. If a flow of greater width is preferred, the nozzle should be replaced by one having an outlet exit whose minor dimension is less than 0.33 mm so as to increase sheer and consequently reduce the viscosity of the composition being expelled. This increases the speed of expulsion and the width of the flow presumably because the inertial forces in the system increase with the velocity and so surface tension is more easily overcome to yield a wider flow.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Conversely, if a narrower flow is preferred for say coating narrower items such as door or window frames, the minor dimension of the outlet exit should increased to more than 0.33 mm thereby reducing shear and retaining more of the viscosity. This decreases the speed of expulsion and the inertial forces and so presumably surface tension is better able to draw in the width of the flow.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">For ease of spraying, it is preferred that the viscosities at 22° C of the compositions should reduce to 0.015 to 0.5 pa.sec under high shear,<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> say a shear rate of 10 000/sec as measured by an ICI Cone and Plate viscometer as described in ASTM Test D4827- 88. It is also preferred that the composition should have an extensional viscosity of below 0.4 pa.sec and especially below 0.2 pa.sec when measured according to the procedure described in the Haake Caber 1 Instruction Manual available from Thermo Haake (International) of Karsruhe, Germany when using 6mm plates having an initial separation of 3mm.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Delivery of the composition via a plenum upstream of and leading to the outlet orifice may also be usefully employed to govern the viscosity of the composition in the region of the outlet. Preferably the plenum should have a dimension transverse to the flow through the nozzle of from 0.5 to 3 (especially 1.3 to 2.7) mm and a length of 0.2 to 4 (especially 0.2 to 3) mm. Most conveniently it should be cylindrical and of about the same transverse dimension (ie. radius) as the major dimension of the outlet exit. Increasing the transverse dimensions and/or decreasing the longitudinal dimension of the plenum decreases the shear and loss of viscosity leading to a slower speed of expulsion from the outlet orifice and a narrower flow. Conversely, decreasing the transverse dimensions and/or increasing the longitudinal dimension increases the shear and the loss of viscosity leading to a faster speed of expulsion from the outlet orifice and a wider flow.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">A preferred outlet nozzle geometry comprises a plenum terminating with a hemispherical end which is blind except for the outlet orifice. The orifice is preferably defined by the notional intrusion into the hemisphere of a wedge shape consisting of two opposed mutually inclined planes which meet to define a notional leading edge inside the plenum. The leading edge in effect defines the major dimension of the exit from the outlet orifice. The maximum minor dimension of the outlet exit is defined<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> by the maximum distance between the inclined planes as they enter the hemispherical end of the plenum.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The planes are preferably inclined at into the plenum an angle of from 25° to 55° (especially 35° to 45°). Preferably, the leading edge intrudes to a point either lying on the "terminal plane" of the hemisphere or lying on a parallel plane either just upstream or just downstream of the terminal plane. The "terminal plane" of the hemisphere is the circular plane of radius equal to the radius of the sphere of which the hemisphere forms half</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Where the wedge shape penetrates no further than the terminal plane of the hemisphere, the outlet exit has a projected shape which is elliptical. If the wedge penetrates further, the projected shape is that of a curtailed ellipse whose ends are defined by the cylindrical part of the plenum and so are curtailed and have a smaller curvature than would be the case if the shape were truly elliptical. The smaller curvature is more likely to give an even coating and in particular, the coating is less likely to contain streaks. Preferably, the parallel planes should be no more than 0.8 mm upstream or downstream of the terminal plane.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The portions of the mutually inclined planes of the wedge shape which are within the hemisphere together define two opposed mutually inclined surfaces which are essentially semi-circular. This means that composition flowing in the central regions of the outlet orifice will be in closer proximity to a surface of the outlet orifice for a longer period of time than composition flowing in the lateral regions of the outlet. Composition in the central region will therefore receive more shear in the outlet orifice than composition in the lateral regions which may compensate for the fact that composition in the central region may have<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> received less shear elsewhere. It is possible that this compensation assists in creating a more homogenous coating of a target surface.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In order to minimise any pressure pulses which might arise from irregular hand compression, the nozzle can usefully also comprise a large chamber upstream of, and in communication with its plenum. Provided that the chamber is large relative to the plenum, its precise dimensions are not critical but for guidance, it is proposed that its transverse dimensions be about 5 to 10 times the transverse dimensions of the plenum and its length be 5 to 20 (preferably 6 to 8) mm.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The nozzle is additionally provided with an auxiliary (preferably circular) orifice upstream of the plenum which receives composition under the delivery pressure of from 2.5 to 5 bar and directs it towards the plenum. The preferred transverse dimension of the auxiliary orifice is from 0.8 to 1.5 mm, its preferred length is from 1.7 to 2.3 mm and the pressure drop across the orifice is preferably from 0.5 to 2 bar. Preferably composition flows from the auxiliary orifice into a chamber of large transverse dimension as described above and then into the plenum. The use of this auxiliary orifice and large chamber can increase the width of the laminar flow expelled from the main outlet to well over 120 mm, often reaching over 400 mm. This provides an extremely quick coating process.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">An unexpected advantage of the nozzle provided with an auxiliary orifice is its resistance to blockages. Most aqueous paints are at risk of containing a small concentration of unwanted agglomerates of pigment or opacifier particles, usually agglomerates of 200 µm or greater where µm equals 10<sup>-6</sup> m. Agglomerates can accumulate in a nozzle and block its outlet orifice. It is supposed that the conditions of shear in the refined nozzle are sufficient to break down the agglomerates.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Other factors which might affect the balance between the inertial forces and surface tension and therefore the width and stability of the expelled flow are of course the size of the surface tension itself and the density of the composition. Both are determined by the complex formulations used to make modem architectural coating compositions and so it is not easy to vary either. In theory, surface tension can be reduced by adding detergents to a composition, but this often increases the sensitivity of the composition to water, eg. the sensitivity of a paint to rain. Hence, variation of surface tension is seldom a practical option. Most architectural paints will have a surface tension at 22° C in the range of 23 to 45 N.10<sup>-3</sup>/m.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Density is strongly influenced in the architectural coating compositions by the concentration of heavy inorganic opacifiers such as rutile titanium dioxide (which also serves as a white pigment) or of coloured pigments or extenders such as chalk or clays. Pigment and extender concentrations are carefully chosen to give a colour of precise hue, chroma or lightness, so varying their concentration merely to adjust density is seldom practical. In short, density cannot be significantly varied without unacceptable consequences for opacity and colour. Generally the density of an architectural coating composition is from 1.01 to 1.6 kg/litre and is usually 1.01 to 1.2 kg/litre for woodstains and fungicides and 1.2 to 1.6 kg/litre for paints if dense pigments or opacifiers such as rutile are needed. Solid contents of the coating compositions can therefore be from 7 to 12 wt % for woodstains and fungicides and up to 70 wt % or more for paints.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">This invention also provides apparatus for the airless spray-coating of a surface with a viscous non-Newtonian aqueous architectural coating composition, wherein the apparatus comprises<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> -->
