load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">Technical Field</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention concerns a liquid reagent of a methylene blue-based color former and a method of stabilizing the same.</p><heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">As a substrate that develops color by being oxidized, a methylene blue-based color former such as, for example, 10-(carboxymethylamino carbonyl)-3,7-bis (dimethylamino)phenothiazine has been known. Methylene blue that is a chromophore in the methylene blue-based color former hardly fades in color, thereby allowing highly sensitive detection to be performed, and thus it is expected that the methylene blue-based color former will be used in various analyses.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Such a color former can be used, for example, in the case of determining the amount of an oxidizing substance such as hydrogen peroxide generated using an oxidoreductase by causing a reaction between the color former and the oxidizing substance and then measuring the amount of a color developed by measuring an absorbance. When a color former is to be used in such an enzyme reaction, generally, a solution prepared by dissolving the color former in water is used as a liquid reagent.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, a methylene blue-based color former as described above has presented a problem of being so unstable as to develop color spontaneously when in a solvent such as water. Because of this, the use of a color former that has been stored in a liquid state may cause an increase in background absorbance in a measurement of an absorbance, thus degrading the accuracy of the measurement. In particular, although it is advantageous that, as described above, methylene blue that is a chromophore in a methylene<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> blue-based color former has a property of hardly fading in color and thus achieves high sensitivity, methylene blue has presented a problem that part of the chromophore (methylene blue) that has been freed by natural oxidation also hardly fades in color compared with other chromophores, thus exerting an influence that hardly can be avoided. For example, when stored in an aqueous solution state, 10-(carboxymethylaminocarbonyl)-3,7-bis (dimethylamino)phenothiazine develops enough color spontaneously to exert an influence on a measurement within about one day, and deteriorates to such an extent that it hardly can be used as a reagent for an analysis any more within about three days (see Patent Document 1 or <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4916058A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,916,058</text></patcit> corresponding thereto).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In order to prevent such an influence of spontaneous color development, it is required to prepare a liquid reagent every time a measurement is performed. This, however, leads to a complicated operation and also to a cost increase. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO0196596A"><text>WO01/96596</text></patcit> discloses compositions which have a positively charged porous matrix and a urea derivative dye on at least one surface of the matrix. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP0049833A"><text>EP0049833</text></patcit> discloses a stabilised Romanowsky type stain solution which comprises azures, Methylene Blue and an eosin dye in methanol.

This enables the color former to be stored in a liquid state, and thus, for example, it is no longer necessary to prepare a liquid reagent of a color former every time a measurement is performed, thereby facilitating an operation such as a measurement and also achieving a cost reduction. Moreover, even in the case where the liquid reagent of a color former according to the present invention after having been stored is used as a color-developing reagent causing a color-developing reaction, an increase in background absorbance in a measurement of an absorbance is suppressed, and thus the accuracy of the measurement also can be improved.

On the other hand, even when stored at 10°C and even after having been stored for at least 3 days, for example, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 days, the liquid reagent according to the present invention allows spontaneous color development of the methylene blue-based color former to be prevented and/or suppressed and can be used adequately as a reagent of a color former for about 20 to 300 days.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The liquid reagent of a methylene blue-based color former according to the present invention is useful as, for example, a liquid reagent such as of a color-developing substrate in a redox reaction as described above, though there is no particular limitation on its applications.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the present invention, a methylene blue-based color former refers to a methylene blue-based substrate that develops color by oxidation and specifically refers to a compound that frees methylene blue that is a chromophore by oxidation.

One or two or more types among these substances may be allowed to be present in the liquid reagent.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Furthermore, the liquid reagent according to the present invention suitably may contain, for example, an additive required for a redox reaction depending on the intended use of the liquid reagent.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Next, the stabilization method is a method of stabilizing a liquid reagent containing at least a methylene blue-based color former and is characterized by allowing the color former and quaternary ammonium as described above to be present together in a liquid medium as described above. Unless otherwise specified, the respective types, addition ratios and the like of the color former, the quaternary ammonium and a solvent are the same as described earlier. In the present invention, "stabilizing a liquid reagent of a color former" refers to a function or a state of maintaining suppression of self-color development of a methylene blue-based color former in a liquid medium, and encompasses, for example, "storing the color former in a liquid medium and/or the liquid reagent" and "preserving the color former in a liquid medium and/or the liquid reagent." The<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> stabilization method according to the present invention makes it possible to stabilize, store, and/or preserve a methylene blue-based color former in a liquid reagent for at least 3 days, for example, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 days or more, or about 20 to 300 days while preventing and/or suppressing spontaneous color development of the color former.

Preferably, the instruction manual explains, for example, that performing the stabilization method according to the present invention using the kit makes it possible to stabilize, store, and/or preserve the methylene blue-based color former for at least 3 days, for example, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 days or more, or about 20 to 300 days while preventing and/or suppressing spontaneous color development, thereby allowing a reagent thus obtained to be used as a reagent causing a color-developing reaction.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In still another aspect, the present invention provides a kit for detection and/or measurement, and the kit includes a methylene blue-based color former, quaternary ammonium as described above, a reagent used for a reaction in which the methylene blue-based color former is allowed to develop color, and an instruction manual for performing the stabilization method according to the present invention. Preferably, as required, the kit further<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> includes a liquid medium as described above. In this aspect, the "detection and/or measurement" is not particularly limited and encompasses, for example, detection and/or measurement of hydrogen peroxide or detection and/or measurement of a conventionally known chemical substance through the generation of hydrogen peroxide. In this aspect, the "reagent used for a reaction in which a methylene blue-based color former is allowed to develop color" is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include various types of peroxidases (POD). The reagent may further contain an oxidoreductase that reacts with a substrate to generate hydrogen peroxide such as, for example, oxidases of various types or a dehydrogenase, a protease that acts on a substrate, or the like. Therefore, specific examples in this aspect include a kit for detection/measurement of glycated protein that includes a methylene blue-based color former, quaternary ammonium as described above, POD, fructosyl amino acid oxidase (FAOD), and the instruction manual, and when required, further includes various types of proteases.

Generally, a color former or the like exhibiting low stability possibly is allowed to be present together with a stabilizer such as a polymer, and in Comparative Examples 1-2 to 1-27, various types of polymers further were allowed to be present.
