In particular, the present invention relates to two voltage level shifter circuits.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Voltage level shifting circuits are well known in the art for translating, or converting, digital signals driven with a first set of voltage supplies to a signal driven with a second set of voltage supplies, where the high (or low) voltage output is higher (or lower) than that in the first set of voltage supplies. Voltage level shifting is used in systems where circuits operating with different voltage supplies must communicate with each other.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Those of skill in the art will understand that dynamic random access memory (DRAM) conventionally employs level shifters in the wordline driver circuits of a memory array. The wordline driver circuits in a memory with n-channel cell transistors preferably drive wordlines with a voltage above the logic '1' power supply voltage (typically VDD) to maximize the charge written into and read out from accessed DRAM cells. The wordlines can further be driven to a voltage level below VSS to minimize leakage current from the DRAM cells.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a circuit schematic including a level shifter circuit of the prior art that is used to drive wordlines in a DRAM to voltage levels above VDD and below VSS. <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> includes a logic circuit 12, and a level shifter circuit 10 comprised of n-channel pass transistor 14, p-channel pass transistor 16, cross-coupled p-channel transistors 18 and 20, and cross-coupled n-channel transistors 22 and 24.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Logic circuit 12 is shown as an NAND gate for receiving any number and combination of address signals and control signals, and for providing a single decoded output. Logic circuit 12 is powered by VDD and VSS voltage supplies, and can have any known circuit configuration. The output of logic circuit 12 is split in parallel and passed through n-channel pass transistor 14 and p-channel pass transistor 16. Pass transistor 14 has its gate tied to VDD to isolate logic circuit 12 from voltage VPP (above VDD), while pass transistor 16 has its gate tied to VSS to isolate logic circuit 12 from the negative voltage VBB (below VSS). The drain of transistor 16 is connected to the gate of transistor<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> 24 and the drain of transistor 22. The drain of transistor 14 is connected to the gate of transistor 20 and the drain of transistor 18.Thus when the output of the logic circuit 12 is VDD, that VDD level is passed through transistor 16 to the cross-coupled transistors 22 and 24 such that transistor 24 is on and transistor 22 is off. In parallel, transistor 20 is off and transistor 18 is on and the wordline is at VBB.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">When the output of the logic circuit 12 changes from VDD to VSS, that VSS level is passed through transistor 14 to the cross-coupled transistors 18 and 20 such that transistor 20 begins to turn on and transistor 18 begins to turn off. In parallel, the rising wordline voltage turns on transistor 22, which causes cross-coupled transistor 24 to be turned off. The size of the pull down logic of gate 12 and the size of transistor 14 must be large enough to provide enough current to counteract the pull-up current of transistor 18 on the gate of transistor 20. Similarly, the size of the pull up logic of gate 12 and the size of transistor 16 must be large enough to provide enough current to counteract the pull-down of transistor 22 on the gate of transistor 24 when the output of logic gate 12 changes from VSS to VDD. As transistors 20 and 24 are connected directly to the wordline, their sizes must be large enough to drive the wordline in a timely manner. The other transistors in the level shift circuit 10 and the logic gate 12 must also be sized large enough so that the level shift circuit 10 operates correctly. Thus logic gate 12 and level shift circuit 10 may require a relatively large area.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Furthermore, when the wordline voltage is switching from VBB to VPP or from VPP to VBB, crowbar current will occur in transistors 20 and 24 as there is a direct current path from VPP to VBB for a brief period of time.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The operation of the level shifter 10 can be enhanced if pass transistors 14 and 16 are fabricated with low threshold voltages. However, since current leakage is a growing problem in small geometry semiconductor processes, this solution may not be available for low power processes where only high Vt devices can be fabricated.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A second prior art circuit for translating a VDDNSS logic signal to a VPP/VBB level wordline signal is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>. The circuit in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> includes a logic circuit 32, a level shift circuit 30 to shift the VDDNSS level output of logic circuit 32 to VPPNSS, a level shift circuit 31 to shift the VDDNSS level output of logic circuit 32 to VDD/VBB, and wordline drive transistors 42 and 50. This circuit differs from the circuit in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> in that the wordline drive transistors 42 and 50 are not part of the level shift circuitry, and that there are two separate, independent level shifters used to control the gates of wordline drive transistors 42 and 50. Since an extra stage is included in the circuit in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the level shift circuitry 31 and 30 and logic circuitry 32 can use smaller device<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> sizes than the logic gate circuit 12 and level shift circuit 10 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. However, the size of the series connection of the pull-down in logic gate 32 and the pass device 34 must be large enough to overcome the pull-up current of transistor 38. Similarly, the size of the series connection of the pull-up in logic gate 32 and the pass device 36 must be large enough to overcome the pull-down current of transistor 52.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Crowbar current is also a concern in level shift circuits. Smaller device sizes in level shift circuitry also result in lower crowbar current consumption. The device sizes of the level shift circuits 30 and 31 in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> can be smaller than the device sizes in the level shifter in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, and thus contribute smaller crowbar current; however there are two level shift circuits. In addition, crowbar current will occur between devices 42 and 50.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20050212557A"><text>US 2005/0212557 (Nagata</text></patcit>) discloses a level conversion circuit in which a control signal is transmitted to each of a driver control unit and an output transistor. The circuit proposed by Nagata is intended to prevent the driver control unit and output transistor from operating at the same time with the aim of reducing through-current flows. However, crow-bar currents still exist in circuits taught by Nagata during the transition states of the output signal.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As can be understood by any person skilled in the art, the loading of the logic circuit responsible for changing the state of the level shift circuit can affect wordline activation performance. Preferably, the wordlines are activated quickly in response to a decoded row address and/or control signal. Additionally, a larger load on that same logic circuit can require the use of larger device sizes in both the logic circuit and level shifter, increasing the area required. The additional cost of a multiple Vt fabrication process which might enable smaller device sizes may not be acceptable either. Minimizing crowbar current is also a concern in level shift circuits.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Accordingly, there is a need for a circuit to level shift a VDD/VSS logic signal to a VPP/VBB signal, where the level shift circuitry places minimal loading on the preceding logic circuit, occupies a small area and minimizes the crowbar currents.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP59175218A"><text>JP-A-59175218</text></patcit> relates to a CMOS inverter adapted to eliminate the through current of a CMOS inverter which consists of two P and N channel MOS transistors (TR) and to reduce its current consumption by driving a couple of TRs through a delay circuit.

The output VOUT enters a floating state during a transient period t<sub>3</sub> and a transient current is eliminated.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5136190A"><text>US-A-5136190</text></patcit> discloses an improved CMOS voltage level translator circuit having an interface stage, an intermediate stage and an output stage is presented.

Crowbar current limiting circuit 206 is connected to node OUT, between circuits 202 and 204.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The logic circuit 100 provides one or more control signals to the level shift circuit 200 in response to an address and/or control signal. The logic circuit 100 can include any combination of known logic elements, preferably powered by first logic supply voltages VDD and VSS. One embodiment of the logic circuit 100 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> and includes NAND gate 102 and inverter 104. NAND gate 102 provides a control signal en* in response to a combination of address and enable signals. The en* signal is inverted by inverter 104 to generate signal en. Both en and en* are provided to the level shift circuit 200. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, the en* signal is used to control the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> state of the level shift circuit 200 and the en signal is used to control crowbar current limiting circuit 206 in the level shift circuit 200.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, the inputs to the level shifter circuit 200 are the signals en* and en from the logic circuit 100 and the output signal is labeled OUT.

Transistor 220 is connected between the drain of transistor 212 and node OUT, which is connected to the gate of transistor 210.

When the state of the logic circuit 100 changes such that the output of the level shifter is to be changed to VPP, the pull-down circuit 208 is enabled, connecting the rst* node to VSS.

When the state of the logic circuit 100 changes such that the output of the level shifter is to be changed to VBB, the pull-up circuit 214 is enabled, connecting the set node to VDD. Pull-up circuit 214 provides a direct connection between the set node and VDD, unlike prior art circuits in which the connection was provided through a pass device and the pull-up circuitry of the logic circuit.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As the pull-down current of node rst* and the pull-up of node set is not provided from the logic circuit 100, the device sizes in logic circuit 100 can be made smaller than<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> those in logic circuits 12 and 32 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref> respectively.

Transistor 218 is off and transistor 222 is partially on. When the output of logic circuit 100 causes the level shifter output to change to VBB, the current capability of transistor 220 is reduced by changing its gate voltage from VSS to VDD. At the same time, transistors 222 and 218 are turned fully on.

In describing the operation of the circuitry in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, it is assumed that the wordline voltage should be at VPP to access the memory cell and that it should be at VBB when the memory cell is not being accessed.

Thus pull-down 208 is on, rst* is at VSS and transistor 212 is on. Transistor 220 is also on, so that node OUT is at VPP. This ensures that transistor 210 is off. It also ensures that transistor 216 is on so that the node set is at VBB and transistor 218 is off. As the signal en* is at VDD, transistor 214 is off. Transistor 222 will be partially on as its gate is at VSS, which is higher than its source voltage, which will be between VBB and VSS-Vtn of transistor 222.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">When all of the inputs to NAND gate 102 are at VDD, node en* changes to VSS and node en changes to VDD.

This causes transistor 218 to start to turn on. At the same time, the VDD level en signal turns transistor 222 fully on and reduces the current capability of transistor 220 allowing the series connection of transistor 218 and 222 to pull the node OUT from<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> VPP to VBB easily, with limited crowbar current consumption. As node OUT is pulled toward VBB, transistor 210 is turned on, and charges node rst* to VPP. This turns off transistor 212, allowing node OUT to be fully charged to VBB. This causes the wordline voltage to rise to VPP.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The state of the level shifter circuit 200 changes when at least one of the inputs to NAND gate 102 falls to VSS, causing node en* to change to VDD and node en to change to VSS. This causes pull-up 214 to turn off, allowing node set to float at VDD. The high en* signal also enables pull-down 208 causing node rst* to fall toward VSS. This causes transistor 212 to start to turn on. At the same time, the VSS level en signal turns transistor 220 fully on and reduces the current capability of transistor 222 allowing the series connection of transistor 212 and 220 to pull the node OUT from VBB to VPP easily, with limited crowbar current consumption. As node OUT is pulled toward VPP, transistor 216 is turned on, and charges node set to VBB. This disables transistor 218, allowing node OUT to be fully charged to VPP.
