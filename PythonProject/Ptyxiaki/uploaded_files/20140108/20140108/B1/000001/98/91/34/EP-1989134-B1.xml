mxw-id="PDES63961157" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to a transfer station for packing of products combined to portions, comprising a conveyor belt structure with an edge defined as one end of the conveyor, said conveyor belt structure displaying oblong segments, in which the products are combined to portions, in order to pack the content of each segment into packs at said edge by means of a packing device. Such transfer stations are known for packing weighed products. The collection frequency occurs on the basis of combined weight, but a transfer station of the above kind may also be used with products that are combined for a total count, based on size or any other property.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In the retail trade use is made of packs that contain a number of units of the same type but of unequal weight, as they are composed in such a way that the combined weight of the pack exceeds the target weight as little as possible. For the preparation of a pack scales are used that are capable of choosing the necessary candidates for inclusion in the pack after weighing of each unit during its passage trough the weighing system. They appear at a number of discharges that are opened individually when the foremost unit is the next in line to be used. In most cases the discharges of known constructions of scales are disposed on a straight line, but certain constructions of scales have a circular disposition.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">On a conveyor the content for a pack is carried ahead in a segment as a group of units, in order that this segment of the conveyor only needs to be emptied into the pack, which may typically be a bag or a tray or the similar. This pack may for example be sealed or closed in other ways after being filled and be conveyed further by means of other conveyors. Concurrently the next pack is filled with the next portion. A number of machine installations are known that are capable of performing these basic operations. However, they generally have the disadvantage that the weighing system with the conventional transfer to conveyors constitutes both a buffer that operates very unevenly over time and a time delay, and this reduces the capacity of such an installation with respect to similar installations that handle units of the same weight. The capacity of pack filling machines, such as bag filling<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> machines or tray wrapping machines are in this case not the limiting factor. There is hence a need for a transfer station that is capable of utilizing a possible increase in the capacity in a weighing or other sorting system as such.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In German Gebrauchsmuster 202005017295.2 an installation is known that works with a particular gentleness, in which a combined portion of parts or units is collected on a gutter-like trough. The trough has a length equal to the total width of the weighing system, and in a part operation the whole content of a trough is discharged as a portion onto a conveyor that is moved parallel to the trough and the weighing system. At the end of the conveyor is placed a collecting station that transfers the portion to a pack. However, a new portion can only be transferred to the conveyor when the whole length of the prior portion has passed the transferring troughs.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A transfer station according to the invention solves this problem of capacity by means of a construction according to the features mentioned in the introduction that is particular in that the segments have an oblique relationship to the edge of the conveyor belt structure, and that the transfer station for use with conveyor means for transporting packs along said edge is constituted such that the content in each segment is dynamically emptied into a predetermined pack during the time in which the pack is moved by said conveyor means along said edge, synchronously with the consecutive arrival of the products to said edge. The segments obtain a particular angular relationship to the direction of movement of the conveyor belt structure. Several packs may be filled at the same time, when they are moved parallel to the end of the conveyor belt structure, synchronously with the consecutive arrival of products to said end. This means that with a given translational speed of the conveyor belt, the content of a segment may be delivered faster, because it is delivering along a moving point on a line, instead of in one location, as long as the pack follows this point synchronously. This has advantageously been combined with the normal requirement that packs are also transported to and from the packing station.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Specifically relating to automatic weighing systems, in an advantageous embodiment the transfer station consists of a conveyor belt structure that is divided into segments<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> by means of walls, said structure being filled with the desired total weight of products during the time that is available between the passage of two subsequent walls, that the content between two walls is emptied in the time during which a pack is conveyed synchronously with the conveyor belt structure with its opening along that part of the conveyor belt structure where products are currently delivered. Hereby it is obtained that the transfer from the scales to the pack is performed faster, because the portion is distributed partially across the width of the conveyor belt instead of along its length, as in the prior art, and the receiving open packs are conveyed synchronously across the end of the conveyor belt during the complete emptying of a portion. Dependent on the weighing system used and the individual scales, advantageous embodiments may use discharge unit openings that are disposed on a straight line or a part of a circle, as the case may be.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The division of the conveyor belt structure into segments by means of walls is advantageous. In a further advantageous embodiment the walls are provided at right angles to the discharge direction of the discharge units.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">An advantageous embodiment is particular in that the conveyor belt structure is provided in the form of one wide belt, on which the walls have a particular angle to the direction of movement of the belt.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A further advantageous embodiment is particular in that the conveyor belt structure is provided in the form of a number of parallel conveyor belts that are moved forward synchronously, and on which the walls have a particular angle to the direction of movement of the belts and are disposed end-to-end on neighbouring conveyor belts. This embodiment entails that even though the geometry is the same as above, the conveyor belt structure consists of several conveyor belts, each of which being easier to manipulate.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A further advantageous embodiment is particular in that the particular angle of the walls to the direction of movement of the conveyor belt structure is a right angle. This embodiment may entail that the manufacture of the conveyor belt is simpler than when the placement of the walls is oblique.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A further advantageous embodiment is particular in that the transfer station is constituted such that the total weight of products is distributed in segments on individual conveyor belts, said total weight arriving in sequence but time-shifted along the end of the conveyor belt structure. Hereby the logical space that contains the products, respectively the total weight of weighed products is combined from a number of segments, the walls of which do not define straight but rather staircase-shaped delimitations.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">For collecting the products a further embodiment is particular in a transfer station is provided, in which a pack is brought forward on a chain to open at the first arriving part of a segment, whereupon it is moved linearly, open, and synchronously with the arrival of products, until the segment has been emptied, whereupon the pack is closed and carried off for further processing. Thereafter the process is repeated with respect to the next segment. The geometry and the time sequence is independent of whether a bag or e.g. a tray is used for collecting the products.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The invention will be described further with reference to the drawing, in which

The upper side of the conveyor belt moves to the right in the drawing, as shown by the arrow<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> M. The discharge occurs exclusively to a segment 8 that is delimited by walls W1 and W2. As may be seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, there are corresponding walls W3, W4, etc. distributed evenly on the whole conveyor belt 3. This means that segment 7 is delimited by walls W2 and W3, and so on. As the conveyor belt moves towards the right the discharge of the product occurs as long as a part of a given segment 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 is present below the discharge device units. The discharge briefly stops while a wall passes below the discharge units along with the movement of the conveyor belt 3, and is resumed for the next segment Simultaneously the product is conveyed towards the end of the conveyor belt 3, which is shown as the edge E, along which a row of bags B4, B5, B6, B7, B8 are moved to the left, as shown by the arrow, by means of an endless chain C-C and synchronously with the segments between the walls W1, W2, W3, W4. As may be seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> the parallel segments 4-8 are obliquely directed with respect to the conveyor edge E. Thereby a packing device is obtained, by which the content of the segment 4 (and the other segments 5,6,7 in their turn) is gradually emptied into the bags B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, which are shown schematically. For instance, the amount of product that is shown while being delivered to the segment 8 will be collected by the bag B8.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> the bags B4-B7 have varying degrees of fullness; the bag B4 is almost filled with its portion that has come from segment 4. The bags are conveyed away by means which are not shown, while being closed and/or sealed and liberated from the chain C-C. Correspondingly it is also not shown how the bags arrive to the beginning of the chain. In describing the present embodiment bags have been used as an example of packs, but the function of the transfer station will be precisely the same if trays are used, being conveyed synchronously on a separate conveyor belt at the end of and perpendicular to the conveyor belt structure.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is seen a conveyor belt structure 13 that at first looks similar to the conveyor belt structure 3 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. The outline of the discharge units 12 in a discharge device is shown. However, the conveyor belt structure 13 is split into a number (n) parallel conveyor belts 13a, 13b,....., 13n. All these conveyor belts are moved synchronously, so that e.g. the segment 17 is composed as en end-to-end disposition of shorter oblique part segments 17a, 17b, ....., 17n, that are each created between shorter walls W11a, W11b, W12a, W12b, ....., W11n, W12n. At the edge E<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the delivery of the products occurs in precisely the same manner as explained with respect to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, i.e. the packs are transported along the end or "edge" E in the direction C synchronously with the gradual emptying of a particular segment. In the embodiment shown the conveyor belts have been shown having equal length, which simplifies the stocking of spare belts, but dependent on the space available they may have different lengths, dependent of the placement below the discharge units 12.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is shown an embodiment of the invention, in which the distribution of the product on the conveyor belt system along a transport segment 28 is oblique with respect to the direction of transport M by means of a corresponding oblique placement of the discharge units 22a, 22b, ....., 22n of the weighing, respecively discharge system 22, in order that the delivery to the packs occurs in correct time and place perpendicular to the conveyor belt structure 23 at its end or edge E. The parallel conveyor belts 23a, 23b, 23c,....., 23n themselves have walls that are perpendicular to the direction of travel M and hence parallel to the edge or end E of the conveyor belt structure 23. The part segments 28a, 28b, ... between walls on the conveyor belts 23a, 23b, ... that each carries a part of the total weighed portion will be shifted stepwise with respect to the neighbouring conveyor belt, so that a "logical" or "virtual" segment 28 is built of part segments 28a, 28b, ... shown hatched in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>. It is seen in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> that this segment 28 and corresponding segments that are parallel to it proceed obliquely to the edge E of the conveyor. By the sequential emptying of each conveyor 23a, 23b, ... the combined weight of the product is delivered part-portionwise to a particular pack during its passage from right to left (shown by the arrow C) in the figure. It may be seen in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> that the walls of the segments are made to be essentially perpendicular to the opening/discharge direction 20 of the discharge units 22a, 22b, ....</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the embodiment shown the conveyor belts 23a, 23b, ... have different lengths, but dependent on the space available they may be of equal lenght, which simplifies the stocking of belts. Also, it must be brought into consideration that a shorter conveyor belt will see more wear, because it is used many more times to carry a given part portion than a longer belt<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is shown a conveyor belt structure that is similar to the structure in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, but in this case n parallel conveyor belts 39a, 39b, ....., 39n are moved perpendicular to the discharge units 38, the outline of which is shown, i.e. moved perpendicular to the longitudinal extent of the discharge device. Walls W31a, W31b ....., W31n; W32a, W32b, ....., W32n, and similar walls constitute by synchronous motion of the conveyor belts end-to-end walls W31, W32 and corresponding further walls, that in the present case are perpendicular to direction of movement M of the conveyor belts. The conveyor belts arrive respectively to an edge E'a, E'b, ... E'n, where each has a triangular transfer element T1, T2, T, ..., Tn that permits a product that arrives to the edge to slide to the bags to be filled, that are moved along the combined edge E in the direction shown by the arrow C. In the embodiment shown the conveyor belts have different lengths, but dependent on the space available they may be of equal lenght, which simplifies the stocking of belts. Segments 31-37 that are perpendicular to conveyor belts 39a, 39b, ..., respectively perpendicular to the direction of transport M are created by synchronously moved part segments 31a, 31b, ...; 32a, 32b, ...; 33a, 33b, ...; 34a, 34b, ...; 35a, 35b, ...; 36a, 36b, ...;37a, 37b, ...that are separated by the walls.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In all the embodiments, there are rollers and drive means provided for the endless conveyor belts as well as means for controlling the relative speeds of the various conveyor belts and chains, these have however not been shown and their construction is considered to fall within the normal tasks of the skilled person. Such means comprise apparatus for synchronising the movements of the conveyor belt structure (3, 13, 23, 39) and the pack transport means (C-C), based on any one of position, velocity, and acceleration inputs or a combination of inputs from the moving parts as well as on the operating status of a weighing, sorting, or similar apparatus (2, 12, 22, 38).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The walls on the conveyor belts for defining the segments may be manufactured by any suitable process. Walls perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the belts, where applicable, do not need the same flexibility as walls with a different angle to the longitudinal direction, because they will not be subjected to stretching when passing around rollers.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the description synchronous movements between the conveyor belt structure and the conveying mechanism for the packs have been described. These movements are performed with minimum acceleration if they are continuous. However, there is nothing that prevents that they may be performed with shorter or longer periods of deviating velocities, even complete standstill, however at all times synchronously, in order to adapt to the requirements of special products handled by the transfer station.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The fundamental transport principle of the invention is not dependent on the presence of the above-mentioned walls, because they may not be required if the goods does not have a propensity to roll from one segment into a neighbouring segment When products are combined by weighing in order to obtain a given portion, use is made of scales with several discharge units, and the portion may be placed along a length of conveyor belt A pack at the end of the conveyor belt is not filled until the whole portion has been conveyed.
