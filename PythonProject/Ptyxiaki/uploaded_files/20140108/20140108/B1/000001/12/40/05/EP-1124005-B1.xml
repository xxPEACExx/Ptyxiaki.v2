load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method of preventing contamination of a canvas used in conjunction with dryers of a paper machine.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Paper has recently been put to numerous applications in an extensive range, and paper stock having functions never heard before has been developed up to date.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As a result, paper produced by a paper machine has come to be diversified, and is numerous in type. As paper produced by a paper machine has to go through a drying process before turned into a product, the drying process occupies a very important position from the technical viewpoint.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The paper machine is equipped with a plurality of dryers used for drying, and the dryers have a construction such that a heating medium such as steam and the like are contained therein for heating from inside of the dryers.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Moist paper undried as yet is fed continuously to the dryers of the paper machine.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is a canvas as it is called that plays a role of pressing hard wet paper into contact with the surface of the dryers.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The wet paper gives off moisture contained therein by absorbing heat from the surface of the dryers when pressed by the canvas.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">For this reason, the canvas is normally formed of material flexible and porous, for example, woven fabric, felt (unwoven fabric), knitted fabric, and the like.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">An enlarged view of the surface of the canvas shows that a multitude of fine pores (so-called eyes of the canvas) are formed on the surface thereof between threads making up the canvas.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Moisture contained in the wet paper is heated by the dryers at high temperatures, and dispersed through the eyes of the canvas.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Incidentally, paper contains various substances, for example, pitch / tar component contained in pulp stock itself, hotmelt, ink and microfibers originating from waste paper stock, various additive chemicals for reinforcing strength and whiteness of paper, and inclusions (foreign matter) such as paint, and so forth. Such inclusions having tackiness will be deposited on the surface of the canvas when the wet paper is pressed hard against the surface of the dryers by the canvas, turning into contaminant (the source of contamination).</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">That is, the inclusions contained in paper undergo denaturization due to the effect of pressure and heat, and adhere to the surface of the canvas, causing the eyes of the canvas to be clogged.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">There has since been a shift in raw material for the canvas from natural fiber to synthetic fiber with the result that the canvas has come to have a longer service life due to longer durability thereof.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The longer service life means that there will be an increase in accumulation of the contaminant to that extent.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Accordingly, after the operation of the paper machine for a long duration, there will occur fairly often a phenomenon wherein the eyes of the canvas get clogged with the contaminant.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In recent times, addition of, for example, polyacrylic resin to paper has been in practice during a paper making process in order to reinforce paper strength and to improve a product yield, and particularly, in the case of an additive of a cation type being used, the additive is easily transferred to the canvas, and adheres thereto, causing the eyes of the canvas to be clogged.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Once the clogging of the eyes of the canvas occurs, air permeability of the canvas deteriorates drastically, resulting in poor drying efficiency of paper.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">More specifically, sufficient moisture is normally emitted from the wet<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> paper through the eyes of the canvas when the wet paper is pressed hard between the dryers and the canvas, however, once the clogging of the eyes of the canvas occurs, emitted moisture can not find its way out. In such a state, the drying efficiency deteriorates significantly.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Parts of the contaminant accumulated on the canvas are then transferred from the surface of the canvas to a portion of a paper strip, newly fed, resulting in contamination of product paper.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The contaminant having strong tackiness is also accumulated on an out-roll serving as a guide-roll for the canvas and turned into large lumps.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">When parts of such lumps are peeled off, and adhere to the surface of the wet paper, the wet paper will be provided with additional tensile force due to the effect of the tackiness of the contaminant at the time of the dryers coming in contact with the wet paper, creating a cause for breaks of the wet paper.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">For solving such problems as described above, countermeasures have been adopted wherein periodical cleanups of the canvas are carried out frequently or an interval between replacements of the canvas is rendered shorter. These countermeasures, however, have turned out to be expensive in terms of time and cost.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Accordingly, there has been developed a method of preventing contamination of the canvas by applying surface treatment to the canvas.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">That is, it is a method whereby the surface of the canvas is treated with a water-repellent or oil-repellent resin, for example, ethylene resin tetrafluoride.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Such treatment, however, will result in formation of regions where the eyes of the canvas are partially clogged, causing the drying efficiency to be deteriorated.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Furthermore, such an anti-fouling treatment will be effective only in the initial stage of operation of the paper machine, and the effect of the treatment will decrease in several days (for example, in 5 to 6 days after the treatment is applied), so that a treated canvas then will not be different at all from the canvas untreated.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As described in the foregoing, the paper machine has been faced with<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> major technical problems in that various inclusions contained in the wet paper are adhered to the canvas, and accumulated thereon along with the operation of the paper machine, whereupon the eyes of the canvas are clogged, thereby inhibiting evaporation of moisture, and resulting in poor drying efficiency, and also in that the contaminant accumulated on the canvas as well as the out-roll causes parts of the paper strip, newly fed, to be contaminated as well or create a cause for breaks of the paper strip being processed.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP7292382A"><text>JP-A-07-292 382</text></patcit> discloses a stain-proofing agent containing silicone oil for paper-making drier process in which the stain-proofing agent is sprayed on a canvas endless loop which supports paper as it dries;

2) a silicone oil shifting step for shifting the silicone oil from the surface of the out-roll to the canvas outer surface; 3) a silicone oil permeation and adhesion step for causing the silicone oil to permeate through the canvas and adhere to the outer surface thereof under heat and pressure; 4) a silicone oil transfer step for pressing the paper strip against the canvas outer surface, causing the silicone oil to be transferred to the paper strip; and 5) a silicone oil replenishment step for replenishing the silicone oil on the canvas outer surface depleted by said transfer.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a method of preventing contamination of a canvas used in a paper machine, capable of not only maintaining the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> antifouling effect thereof at all times but also ensuring precise drying efficiency thereof.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In this respect, the inventors have carried out intense studies on the subjects described, and discovered as a result that silicone can be caused to adhere to the surface of the canvas to an extent not to cause the eyes of the canvas to be clogged by continuously supplying silicone oil to the canvas without interruption. The inventors have succeeded in the development of the present invention on the basis of this fact.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">By continuously supplying the silicone oil by a predetermined amount onto the surface of the canvas, the silicone oil is adhered to the surface of the canvas.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">As the canvas and the paper strip are pressed into contact with each other, and subjected to heating by the dryers, the silicone oil permeates through the canvas and is adhered thereto.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">On one hand, the silicone oil is gradually transferred to the paper strip and depleted but, on the other hand, since the canvas is continuously supplied with the silicone oil without interruption, the canvas remains in a condition with newly supplied silicone adhered thereto after depleted portions of the silicone oil is replenished.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Accordingly, various inclusions contained in the paper strip are prevented from adhering to the surface of the canvas.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0041" num="0041">To enable a better understanding of the present invention, and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example only, to the accompanying drawings, in which:-<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> -->

id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> shows a paper machine equipped with multiple drum-dryers,<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> comprising broadly a wire part A, a press part B, and a dry part C.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Operation of the paper machine is briefly described as follows.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In the wire part A, feed stock (pulp and so forth) is fed from a flow spreader head box onto a Fourdrinier wire table A1 evenly so as to be formed into a sheet-like shape.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">A paper strip W formed in a sheet-like shape will have the moisture thereof reduced to the order of 80% while passing on the Fourdrinier wire table A1, and then be transferred to the press part B.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In the press part B, the paper strip W is squeezed from both above and below by a pressing roller B1, an endless belt B2, and so forth.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The paper strip W will have the moisture thereof reduced to the order of 50% while passing through the press part B, and thereafter, be transferred to the dry part (drying area) C.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In the dry part C, the greater part of humidity of the paper strip W will be given off, and the moisture thereof will be reduced to the order of 10%.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">More specifically, the dry part C is provided with heated drum-dryers C1, canvases C2, C3 for pressing the paper strip against the drum-dryers, and canvas rollers C4 and so forth for guiding the canvases, so as to cause the paper strip W to give off the moisture thereof by the effect of heat.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The paper machine shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> comprises two dry parts, each consisting of a group of drum-dryers, and <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is an enlarged view of one of the dry parts.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The dry part C has a construction such that the canvases C2, C3, disposed on the upper level and the lower level, respectively, are caused to run by a plurality of the canvas rollers along paths in a given closed loop, respectively, so as to be pressed into contact with a plurality of the drum-dryers C1.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The drum-dryers C1 in use are of a multiple type, and the plurality thereof are juxtaposed on the upper level as well as the lower level, respectively.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">As described above, the canvases C2 and C3 act to press the paper strip into contact with the respective drum-dryers, and run between the respective canvas rolls C4 in sequence.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0055" num="0055">As is evident from the figure, the inner canvas rolls C4 are disposed on the inner side of the canvases C2, C3, and out-rolls C5 are disposed on the outer side thereof.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The out-rolls are normally set so as to be freely movable, enabling tension of the respective canvases in whole to be adjusted.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Now, in the dry part C of the paper machine described above, the paper strip W (in fact, wet paper) is fed and transferred along a given path, while being pressed in contact with both the canvases and the drum-dryers.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Drying of the paper strip W gradually proceeds as the paper strip W is pressed between the canvas and the drum-dryers at the upper level, and between the canvas and drum-dryers at the lower level, respectively.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Now, for guidance, a chemical spray unit used for spraying a chemical, that is,

occur.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">While the paper machine is in continuous operation, the silicone oil makes ingress into the interior of the canvases from the surface thereof, and is closely adhered thereto.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Meanwhile, the silicone oil adhered to the surface of the canvases is continuously transferred by a predetermined amount to the paper strip as the canvases continue to be pressed against the paper strip (a silicone oil transfer step).</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Consequently, the silicone oil adhered to the canvases will be gradually depleted (wasted).</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">On the other hand, as constant supply of the silicone oil to the canvases still continues, any depleted portion of the silicone oil can be replenished quickly (a

num="0084">Accordingly, the surface of the canvases is always in a condition where a suitable amount of the silicone oil contained in the surface treatment agent is present, enabling the canvases to withstand continuous operation satisfactorily.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 7</figref> is a schematic illustration showing how the surface of the canvases is treated with the surface treatment agent containing the silicone oil. The process of such treatment comprises the following steps.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">That is, in the silicone oil supply step 1), the silicone oil P is adhered to the surface of the canvas C2 (A).</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">Next, in the silicone oil permeation and adhesion step 2), the silicone oil<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> P is heated up by the drum-dryers, and makes ingress into the interior of the canvas C2 (B).</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">In the subsequent step 3), as supply of the silicone oil continues, the silicone oil P makes further ingress deeper into the interior of the canvas C2 (C).</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">In the silicone oil transfer step 4), the silicone oil P is transferred to the paper strip W, undergoing natural depletion on the surface of the canvas C2 (D).</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">Then, in the silicone oil replenishment step 5), a portion of the silicone oil, depleted due to transfer thereof to the paper strip W, is replenished quickly as necessary by supply of a new batch of the silicone oil (E).</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">As described in the foregoing, in the initial stage of the operation of the paper machine, the steps 1) to 3) described above are carried out by continuously supplying a new region of the surface of the canvas in motion with the surface treatment agent containing the silicone oil.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">Subsequently, the steps 4) to 5) described above are carried out by continuing supply of the silicone oil.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">But, in fact, the steps 4) and 5) are indistinguishable from each other as described in the foregoing, and implemented simultaneously.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">Thus, respective operations described above are caused to come into play when the process of treatment goes through each of the four steps, that is, the silicone oil supply step, the silicone oil permeation and adhesion step, the silicone oil transfer step, and the silicone oil replenishment step, thereby developing antifouling effects on the canvases.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">Now, an important point in carrying out the invention is an amount of the silicone oil to be supplied to the canvases at a time.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">The reason for this is that an excessive supply rate of the silicone oil will result in clogging of the eyes of the canvases, deteriorating drying efficiency. On the other hand, with an insufficient supply rate of the silicone oil, a depleted amount of the silicone oil on the canvases can not be replenished constantly.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">Accordingly, the supply (spraying) of the silicone oil needs to be made so as to meet these two requirements.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0098" num="0098">A supply rate of the silicone oil somewhat varies depending on the type of the canvas and quality of the paper strip, however, it is normally 0.1 to 200 mg / m<sup>2</sup> per min, preferably 1 to 100 mg / m<sup>2</sup> per min.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">If the supply rate is less than 0.1 mg / m<sup>2</sup> per min, sufficient permeation of the silicone oil into the canvases does not occur while if the supply rate exceeds 200 mg / m<sup>2</sup> per min, dripping of the surface treatment agent containing the silicone oil occurs, causing clogging of the eyes of the canvases, oil stain on paper, or contamination of peripheral equipment.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">Next, tests (embodiment 1 through embodiment 3) on the method of preventing contamination of the canvas were conducted by varying the supply rate of the silicone oil, and the results thereof are described hereinafter.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">Other tests (comparative examples) were also conducted using a canvas with pretreatment applied thereto, and the result thereof are described as well.</p><heading id="h0006">[Embodiment 1]</heading><p id="p0102" num="0102">With the multiple drum-dryer type paper machine (manufactured by K.
