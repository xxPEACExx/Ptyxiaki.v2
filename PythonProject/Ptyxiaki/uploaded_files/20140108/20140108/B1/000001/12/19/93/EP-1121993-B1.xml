claim 1 of forming a metal pipe body and to a metal pipe body according to the preamble of claim 14. An exemplary method and metal pipe body are known from <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US1016584A"><text>US-A-1016 584</text></patcit>.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally, a technique forming a pipe body, for example, a prism pipe body by means of a bending process of a metal plate is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JPHEI11290940B"><text>Hei 11-290940</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">According to the description disclosed in the gazette, a prism pipe body is formed of a metal plate of a rectangular shape by means of as press processing consisting of a plurality of processes.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">That is, the processing method of the prism pipe body comprises a first bending step of bending end parts of width direction of the metal plate along a length direction at the right angle to form a first processed piece having a bottom part connecting the opposite flange parts to each other, a second bending step of forming a recessed curve surface of a predetermined width along the length direction at the bottom part of the first processed piece, and at the same time, bending both ends of the recessed curve surface toward the inside at the almost right angle to form a second processed piece of a U shape having a pair of sidewall parts facing each other, and a re-striking step of pressing the pair of sidewall parts of the second processed piece toward each other to make the end surfaces of a pair of flange parts contact with each other.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">According to the processing method of the prism pipe body, the recessed<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> curve surface formed at the bottom part of the second processed piece plays a role of suppressing spring back force generated by pressing the pair of sidewall parts toward each other in forming the second processed piece, and therefore, the prism pipe body of which a cross-section is a square shape and in which both end surfaces of the flange parts are closed to each other can be manufactured by means of only the press forming, without welding both end surfaces of the flange parts.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, in the conventional processing method of the prism pipe body, even if the recessed curve surface formed at the bottom part of the second processed piece plays a role of suppressing spring back force generated by pressing the pair of sidewall parts toward each other in forming the second processed piece, the spring back force which serves to unfold the pair of sidewall parts remains in the pair of sidewall parts, and thus, it was difficult to manufacture the prism pipe body in which both end surfaces of the flange parts are closed to each other, stably without deviation in mass-producing.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">That is, when inspecting whether both end surfaces of the flange parts in the prism pipe body manufactured by the processing method are closed to each other, there are pipe bodies in which both end surfaces of the flange parts are closed to each other, while there are pipe bodies in which a gap is generated between both end surfaces of the flange parts by the spring back force. Also, the gaps are not constant.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention is made in order to solve the aforementioned problems.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide a pipe body in which both edge sections to be in close contact with each other are closed stably to each other by means of only a press forming without welding in mass-producing, a metal<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> plate for the pipe body and a forming method of the pipe body using the sheet metal for the pipe body.<br/>
The present invention provides a method of forming a metal pipe body by way of bending a flat metal plate having first and second edge sections parallel to each other, the method comprising the steps of:

the male section has a pair of divided pieces and the female section has a space broadened toward the back portion from an open end of said space, a projection adapted to project toward said open end from the centre of the back portion and a pair of engaging walls formed on said open end for engaging said pair of divided pieces and wherein a pair of divided pieces are inserted in said space through said open end and are deformed in a mutually spaced direction by insertion of the projection between said divided pieces, at least one clearance being present between said pair of divided pieces and said projection and with said pair of engaging walls engaging said pair of divided pieces.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the methods of forming a metal pipe according to the above aspects of the present invention, both edge sections can be in close contact with each other stably with only a press forming without welding in mass-producing, by means of separation-prevented engagement due to deformation of at least one of said female engagement section and said male engagement section.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> -->
