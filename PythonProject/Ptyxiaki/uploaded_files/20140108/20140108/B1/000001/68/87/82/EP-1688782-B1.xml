Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a Faraday rotator constituting an optical isolator used as an optical countermeasure against the reflection return beam from a high output laser used for optical communication and processing.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">When a beam reflected on an optical surface and a processing surface of an outer portion of a laser resonator returns to a laser element in a semiconductor laser utilized for optical communication, a solid laser utilized for laser processing, and the like, the laser oscillation becomes unstable. When the laser oscillation becomes unstable, signal noise occurs in the case of the optical communication, and the breakage of the laser element in the case of the processing laser in some cases. Therefore, in order to intercept such a reflection return beam so that such a beam does not return to the laser element, an optical isolator is used. The optical isolator is usually made of a Faraday rotator, a polarizer, an analyzer and a permanent magnet.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The terbium gallium garnet crystals (which will hereinafter be referred to as TGG) and terbium aluminum garnet crystals (which will hereinafter be referred to as TAG) have<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> been used as related art Faraday rotators for an optical isolator for a high output laser.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, TGG and TAG have a small Faraday rotation coefficient per unit length. Therefore, in order to obtain a 45 degree angle of polarization for the purpose of functioning these crystals as optical isolators, it is necessary that an optical path length be increased. In practice, crystals having a length of as large as around 6 cm had to be used. In order to obtain a high optical isolation, a uniformly large magnetic field has to be exerted on the crystals, so that a strong and large magnet was used. This caused the dimensions of the optical isolator to increase. Since the optical path length is large, the shape of a laser beam is deteriorated in the crystals in some cases, so that some kind of optics is needed for correcting the beam. Furthermore, since TGG is expensive, a small-sized inexpensive Faraday rotator was demanded.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The Faraday rotation coefficient per unit length of a bismuth substituted type rare earth metal iron garnet crystal film (which will hereinafter be referred to as RIG film) used exclusively in the field of optical communication is noticeably large as compared with those of TGG and TAG, so that the optical isolator can be miniaturized greatly. However, it is known that, when the wavelength of light used by RIG becomes short to a level in the vicinity of 1.1 µm used for a processing laser, the light absorption of iron ions becomes high, and that the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> performance of the optical isolator is deteriorated due to a temperature rise caused by this optical absorption.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As a method of solving the problem of the temperature rise of the RIG film, the invention disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2000066160A"><text>JP-A-2000-66160</text></patcit> is proposed. The techniques disclosed in this Patent Document are the techniques for rendering it easy to radiate the heat occurring in a (GdCa)<sub>3</sub> (GaMgZr) <sub>5</sub>0<sub>12</sub> substrate (which will hereinafter be referred to as GGG substrate) which is used as a crystal growth substrate usually removed rather than polished left as it is. Also, a method of holding both surfaces of a RIG film by transparent garnet substrates and radiating the heat of the RIG film via the garnet substrates of a high thermal conductivity is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP7281129A"><text>JP-A-7-281129</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the method disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2000066160A"><text>JP-A-2000-66160</text></patcit>, the generation of heat due to the optical absorption in the RIG film becomes not lost, strain caused by the different thermal expansion coefficients of RIG film and GGG substrate combined with each other directly in one body occurs. As a result, birefringence occurs both in the RIG film and GGG substrate, so that, when the RIG film and GGG substrate are used for an optical isolator, the isolation function is deteriorated.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Unless the RIG film is polished by controlling the thickness thereof so that the Faraday rotation angle of the RIG film becomes accurately 45 degrees, the reflected light on an interface between the RIG film and GGG substrate cannot<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> be removed completely by an incident side polarizer, and this reflected light returns to the laser element.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the invention disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP7281129A"><text>JP-A-7-281129</text></patcit>, a method is introduced of bringing a transparent substrate, such as a garnet substrate or a glass substrate into contact with one side or both sides of a RIG film or bonding the same transparent substrate thereto with an optical bonding glue. In the method of merely bringing the RIG film and transparent film into contact with each other, it is difficult to bring the RIG film and transparent film with each other uniformly in the whole of the region of the diameter of the incident laser beam, and an air layer necessarily exists on a non-contacting portion. In this case, an anti-reflection coating formed on the premise that the RIG film and transparent substrate contact each other does not function due to the air layer penetrating therebetween. As a result, large reflected light is made to occur to cause the reflected light to return to the laser element. Moreover, the heat radiating function lower.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">When a laser beam the level of output of which exceeds 1W is put into the RIG film even in the method of boding the RIG film and transparent substrate with an optical bonding glue, the temperature of the RIG film increases, and the Faraday rotation angle of the RIG film deviates from 45 degrees due to the temperature coefficient thereof, and the isolation function is deteriorated.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US6128423A"><text>US 6 128 423</text></patcit> relates to a reflection type magneto-optic sensor which includes a light path assembly, a lens, a polarizer, a bismuth-substituted rare earth iron garnet single crystal film (BIG film), a non-magnetic garnet substrate, and a mirror, all being aligned in this order along the optical axis of the lens. The BIG film is grown on the non-magnetic garnet substrate by a liquid epitaxial method and the polarizer is bonded on the BIG film, so that the BIG film is held between the polarizer and the non-magnetic garnet substrate in a sandwiched relation. The polarizer used may be in the form of a double refraction polarizer made of rutile or calcite, or a dichroic glass polarizer.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US2002149832A"><text>US 2002 149 832</text></patcit> discloses a Faraday rotator of multilayer film type in which satisfactory optical characteristics are obtained with a small number of layers.

In order to maintain the isolation function of the optical isolator at not smaller than 30 dB, it is necessary that a temperature rise of the RIG film be held down to around 20°C to 30°C. Therefore, it is necessary that the calorific power of the RIG film be reduced, and that the heat generated be radiated quickly.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The garnet crystal is represented by a molecular formula of A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>. In the RIG film, Bi enters an A site, and iron enters a B site. Although it is possible to reduce the absorption coefficient by substituting the iron ions, which constitute a cause of optical absorption at a wavelength of not larger than 1.1 µm, with non-magnetic ions, such as Ga, not only the absorption coefficient but also the Faraday rotation coefficient (degree/cm) decreases. Even when the absorption coefficient of the RIG film decreases by substituting iron with Ga and the like, the Faraday rotation coefficient decreases,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> so that the thickness of the RIG film necessary to attain the Faraday rotation angle of 45 degrees has to be increased. Therefore, it is difficult to reduce the calorific value greatly by substituting iron with Ga and the like with the optical absorption of the RIG film not varied much.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">When the iron is substituted with Ga and the like, the curie point lowers gradually on the contrary. When the curie point becomes lower than 200°C, the temperature coefficient of the Faraday rotation angle becomes low. Assuming that the iron content is reduced by substituting the iron with Ga and the like so as to solve the above problems, it was proven that lowering the iron content per molecular formula of 5 to around 0.6 is limitative.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">When bismuth is added to the RIG film, the Faraday rotation coefficient increases. Therefore, an attempt to increase the quantity of bismuth is often made. However, when the quantity of bismuth of substitution in the A site of bismuth exceeds 1.2 per molecular formula in a RIG film grown by using a generally used GGG substrate the number of lattices of which is from 1.2490 nm to 1.2515 nm, the crystallinity is deteriorated, and the thickness of the RIG film necessary to attain the Faraday rotation angle of 45 degrees becomes excessively small. This makes it difficult to obtain a RIG film of a high flatness not having uneven thickness by polishing. Therefore, in order to hold down the calorific value, and not<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> to cause the unevenness inside the surface of the Faraday rotation angle, it was proven that the thickness of the RIG film be set to from 130 µm to 200 µm.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Using a garnet substrate and a glass substrate in a related art Faraday rotator as a radiation substrate so as to radiate the generated heat quickly, a sufficient thermal conductivity is not obtained (the thermal conductivity of the garnet substrate is around 7W/m·K at highest, and that of a general glass substrate 1W/m·K), so that a transparent substrate of a higher thermal conductivity is needed. Concerning the characteristics of the substrate, such as the thermal conductivity and transparency, the crystals of diamond and SiC come to be preferable. However, in view of the process ability, easiness of obtainment, price and the like, it became clear that sapphire crystals and rutile crystals with heat conductance of 40 W/m·K or more were optimum.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In view of the above, sapphire crystals or rutile crystals are bonded as a radiation substrate to the incident side and outgoing side of the RIG film, and the thickness of the RIG film is set to not smaller than 130 µm and not larger than 200 µm in the present invention. As a result, the invention succeeded owing to the cooperation of such bonded crystals and thickness-increased RIG film in providing an object Faraday rotator for high output lasers for an optical isolator of an excellent isolation function.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As described above, it becomes possible to provide when the present invention is used as described above for a miniaturized inexpensive Faraday rotator capable of maintaining a high isolation effect when the invention is used for an optical isolator even though a laser of a high output of not lower than 1W is used for the isolator.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0023" num="0023"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a sectional view of the Faraday rotator according to the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2A</figref> is a sectional view of an example of an isolator used in the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2B</figref> is a front view of an example of the isolator used in the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is a drawing showing an optical system by which the variation of the Faraday rotation angle based on a temperature rise.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0006"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0024" num="0024">The invention is defined in claim 1.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As described above, the Faraday rotator according to the present invention has sapphire crystals or rutile crystals bonded as a radiation substrate to the incident side and outgoing side of the RIG film, wherein the thickness of the RIG film is not smaller than 130 µm, and not larger than 200 µm, which constitutes the features of the present invention. The thickness of the radiation substrate is preferably not smaller than 0.2 mm and smaller than 1 mm since, when this<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> thickness is smaller than 0.2 mm, it is difficult to display a satisfactory radiation effect; and when the thickness is not smaller than 1 mm, the processability lowers. The thickness of the radiation substrate is preferably not smaller than 0.2 mm and smaller than 0.5 mm.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">When the RIG film and radiation substrate are bonded to each other in the present invention, a bonding reflection preventing film for the bonding glue is applied in advance to the surfaces to be bonded of the RIG film and radiation substrate. The bonding glue is preferably made of an epoxy resin having an absorption coefficient of not larger than 0.1 cm<sup>-1</sup> at a wavelength in use. A bonding glue in use made of a bonding glue absorbing an incident laser beam encounters the generation of heat therein and not preferable. When the absorption coefficient is not higher than 0.1 cm<sup>-1</sup>, the optical absorption in the bonding glue layer is negligibly low, and this bonding glue does not become an issue.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">When the RIG film and two radiation substrate substrates are bonded together with an epoxy bonding glue, it is preferable to apply a pressure from the above so that the thickness of the bonding glue layer becomes not larger than 10 µm. The reason resides in that, when the thickness of the bonding glue layer is small, the heat occurring in the RIG film is easily transmitted to the radiation substrates.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">When the RIG film and radiation substrates are bonded<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> together, they may be bonded together after they are cut into chip type pieces. When the radiation substrates are made of parallel flat plates, the RIG film and radiation substrates in a large-area state may be bonded together and then cut into chips of a necessary sizes by a dicing saw and the like. The reason resides in that the bonding operation for preparing a plurality of Faraday rotator chips may be carried once. When the radiation substrates are made of rutile crystals and have wedge type shapes, a method may be carried out of cutting RIG film into strip type pieces, pasting the cut pieces on the wedge type and strip type rutile crystals, and then cutting the resultant products into chips.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">When the Faraday rotator thus prepared is incorporated into an optical isolator, the Faraday rotator is preferably covered with a heat sink so as to promote the radiation of heat. When the outer circumference only of the Faraday rotator is covered with the heat sink with a laser output becoming near 2W, the radiation ability becomes unsatisfactory, so that it is more preferable to bring the portion as well of the incident surface of the Faraday rotator which does not receive the laser beam into thermal contact with the heat sink. It is effective to bring the heat sink and Faraday rotator into contact with each other if possible. When thermally conductive grease is used in the clearance between the heat sink and Faraday rotator, a thermal transfer effect becomes large. The heat sink may<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> be made of a magnet magnetically saturating the RIG film.</p><heading id="h0007"><b>EXAMPLE</b></heading><heading id="h0008">(Manufacturing of Faraday Rotator)</heading><p id="p0030" num="0030">The assembling of the Faraday rotator in the embodiment will now be described by using <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">A RIG film 1 of 11 mm ×11 mm polished to a thickness of 140 µm so that a Faraday rotation angle becomes 45° with respect to the light of 1064 nm which is the oscillation wavelength of YAG laser, and thereafter applying an anti-reflection coating (not shown) against the bonding glue to both surfaces of the RIG film is prepared.
