mxw-id="PDES63961506" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention pertains to an epicyclic gear transmission that is primarily intended for use in rotary wing aircraft, i.e., helicopters. More specifically, the present invention pertains to a high ratio, double helical epicyclic gear transmission that employs double helical planet gears to obtain a reduction in size of the transmission, to improve the safety of the transmission, and to reduce the noise created by the operation of the transmission.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In rotary wing aircraft, the main rotor gear transmission is the most critical and usually the heaviest single subsystem in the drive system of the aircraft. This is true for a single or tandem rotor helicopter, or a tilt rotor aircraft.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Currently, the final transmission stage in virtually all main rotor drives is an epicyclic transmission system that typically consist of one or two simple, spur gear planetary stages. These planetary gear stages are composed of a sun gear that is driven by the input shaft of the transmission, multiple planet gears (typically between three and six) that intermesh with the sun gear and are spacially arranged around the periphery of the sun gear, and an orbit gear or internal ring gear that intermeshes with and surrounds the multiple planet gears. The orbit or internal ring gear is generally the fixed member of the epicyclic transmission system. The multiple planet gears are mounted to a carrier which in turn is operatively connected to the output shaft of the transmission. While this basic epicyclic gear transmission provides relatively good power efficiency, it has a tendency to generate high noise levels in operation due to the limited contact ratio of the sun gear and the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> internal ring gear with the multiple planet gears.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In addition to the undesirable high noise levels generated by the basic epicyclic gear transmission, the load capacity of the epicyclic gear transmission is limited by it being a function of the number of planet gears that can be accommodated inside the internal ring gear. The size of the internal ring gear itself is dependent on the combination of gear ratio requirements and the allowable stress limits of the transmission system. The planet gear bearings, which are typically mounted inside the center bore of each planet gear, must be sized to carry the loads applied to the planet gears and also to allow a minimum thickness of the planet gear rim inside the planet gear teeth that surrounds the planet gear bearings. This requires that the size of the planet gear and the size of the planet gear bearings be optimized as a unit.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Because the gears of the basic epicyclic gear transmission are densely packed to reduce the size of the transmission, a gear tooth failure of one of the gears can generally be very destructive. The high power density provided by an epicyclic gear transmission and the very limited space among the gears of the transmission causes a great deal of consequential damage from a fractured tooth in the transmission. While it would appear that the construction of the epicyclic gear transmission with its multiple planet gears meshing between the sun gear and internal ring gear would provide parallel load paths, which might offer some redundancy in transmission paths through the transmission, the opposite is true. It has been observed that the planet gears themselves provide little in the way of fail safety. The dense positioning of the multiple planet gears between the sun gear and internal ring gear almost assures consequential damage will occur in the transmission<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> due to a gear tooth failure. This is especially true when one considers that once a planet gear loses its load-transmitting capability, the internal load balance between the multiple planet gears is compromised so that the planet gears no longer balance their own radial loads on the sun gear and the internal ring gear.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Despite the limitations of epicyclic gear transmissions cited above, the use of epicyclic gear transmissions in rotary wing aircraft is still desirable for their ability to provide relatively large reduction ratios in a compact package., What is needed to overcome the disadvantages associated with the basic epicyclic gear transmission are design enhancements to the basic design of the transmission that will reduce the weight of the transmission, provide a smaller footprint of the transmission, improve transmission safety and the ability to withstand single gear tooth failures, while decreasing the generated noise level of the transmission, all of which are required for rotary wing aircraft applications.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5472386A"><text>US-A-5 472 386</text></patcit> discloses an epicyclic gear transmission comprising a sun gear with a center axis, a ring gear having a center axis, the ring gear center axis being coaxial with the sun gear center axis and a plurality of planet gears having center axes that are parallel with the center axis of the sun gear and the ring gear, the plurality of planet gears being spatially arranged around the sun gear, at least some of the plurality of planet gears meshing with the sun gear and the planet gears meshing with the sun gear having peripheries that are disposed in a staggered biplanar relationship.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The embodiments of the present invention have as object to improve upon prior art. The present invention provides in the preferred embodiment an epicyclic gear transmission<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> comprising a sun gear having a center axis; a ring gear having a center axis; the ring gear center axis being coaxial with the sun gear center axis and a plurality of planet gears having center axes that are parallel with the center axis of the sun gear and the ring gear; the plurality of planet gears being spacially arranged around the sun gear, at least some of the plurality of planet gears meshing with the sun gear, and the planet gears meshing with the sun gear having peripheries that are interleaved; an input shaft connected to the sun gear for rotating the sun gear and the ring gear being fixed, the ring gear being one of a pair of fixed ring gears; and, at least two planet gears on each planet gear shaft meshing with the pair of ring gears, the two planet gears on each planet gear shaft that mesh with the pair of ring gears being helical gears with opposite hand helical gear teeth.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0001"><u>Summary of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The epicyclic gear transmission of the present invention brings together a large number of individual planetary gear system innovations which, taken together, provide improvements in noise reduction and performance of the transmission combined with improved reliability and fail safety of the transmission. The epicyclic gear transmission of the invention makes use of a compound epicyclic gear system with as many as double the number of planet gears sharing the load of the transmission without an increase in the overall diameter of the basic epicyclic gear drive. This reduces the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> weight of the transmission and provides the transmission with a smaller footprint. The compound epicyclic gear transmission also provides a more fail-safe, quieter gear drive for rotary wing applications.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The epicyclic gear transmission of the invention is provided in several embodiments. Each of the embodiments makes use of interleaved planet gear clusters with there being two or three planet gears on each planet gear shaft. Interleaving the planet gear clusters enables doubling of the number of planet gears in the transmission system. This increases the load capacity of the transmission (almost doubling the load capacity) without decreasing the reduction ratio obtained through the gear transmission and without increasing the diameter of the overall gear transmission. Some axial length is added to the transmission, however, this adds minimal weight and a minimal increase in size.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Using double helical planet gears that are axially staggered in their positions on their planet gear shafts enables doubling the number of planet gears in the epicyclic gear transmission. Because double helical gears require a gap at the apex of their gear teeth to permit the teeth to be ground, they are normally heavier than single helical gears. By staggering the planet gears axially on the planet gear shafts in the transmission, the apex gap between the double helical planet gears on each planet shaft becomes an axial space between the planet gears that can be occupied by an interleaving planet gear of the adjacent planet gear shaft. This enables doubling the number of planet gears that can be used at any gear ratio. Doubling the planet gears significantly increases the load capacity of the transmission. Employing double helical planet gears also results in noise reduction. Employing double helical planet gears on each planet shaft basically creates a dual path transmission system that significantly enhances the survivability and fault tolerance of the gear transmission. The usual<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> detrimental need for providing a large apex gap on a double helical gear is turned into an advantage by providing an axial space between double helical planet gears on each planet shaft that can be occupied by an interleaving planet gear of an adjacent planet gear shaft. The axial spacing between the double helical planet gears on each planet shaft also allows easy manufacturing of the gears while minimizing the weight penalty associated with the need for the axial gap between double helical gears to allow for the cutting tool and grinding wheel runout in manufacturing the gears.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A first embodiment of the epicyclic gear transmission has the basic form of an epicyclic gear system with a sun gear input, a fixed ring gear or internal gear, and a planet gear carrier output. However, each planet gear of the basic epicyclic gear system is replaced by a planet gear cluster that includes double helical planet gears that are axially spaced on each planet gear shaft. The double planet gears on adjacent planet gear shafts are axially staggered and are interleaved, providing two load transmission paths through the transmission without appreciably increasing the footprint or size of the transmission. The sun gear input is provided by four sun gears that mesh with the interleaved double planet gears. The fixed ring gear has four sets of internal teeth that mesh with the interleaved double planet gears. By using this epicyclic gear transmission configuration, a single compound epicyclic stage can be substituted for two simple planetary gear stages, thus providing a reduction in parts count and weight. The double helical gears provide lower noise and improved safety.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">A second embodiment of the epicyclic gear transmission is similar to the first embodiment in that it also employs the concept of axially staggered planet gears on each planet gear shaft. However, the second embodiment uses three helical planet gears clustered on each planet gear shaft. Again, the sun gear of the epicyclic gear transmission is the input gear and the ring gear or internal gear is fixed. The sun gear<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> input is provided by a pair of axially spaced sun gears and the ring gear has a pair of axially spaced internal gear teeth.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Two of the three helical planet gears on each planet gear shaft have helical teeth of opposite hands and different helix angles. These two planet gears mesh with the two axially spaced sets of internal helical gear teeth on the ring gear. Providing the two planet gears of each planet gear shaft with gear teeth of opposite hands and different helix angles enables the axially directed thrust load of the three planet gears on each planet gear shaft to be partially or fully balanced. The planet gear of each planet gear shaft that meshes with the sun gear is larger than the two planet gears on each planet gear shaft that mesh with the ring gear. The relative positions of the larger planet gears that mesh with the sun gear are axially staggered on the planet gear shaft from the two planet gears that mesh with the ring gear. This enables the planet gears that mesh with the sun gear to be interleaved as in the first described embodiment, doubling the number of planet gear clusters. The larger planet gear on each planet gear shaft meshing with the sun gear, and the smaller planet gears on each planet gear shaft meshing with the ring gear significantly increases the reduction ratio of the transmission. As in the first embodiment, this epicyclic gear transmission configuration results in a net weight reduction while providing lower noise and improved safety.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A third embodiment of the epicyclic gearing transmission is similar to the second described embodiment in that it employs three helical planet gears on each planet gear shaft. A larger of the three planet gears on each shaft meshes with the input sun gear and a pair of smaller planet gears on each planet gear shaft mesh with the fixed ring gear. However, this embodiment differs from the previously described embodiment in that it requires only one bearing assembly on each planet gear shaft. The previously<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> described embodiments required two bearing assemblies positioned at the opposite ends of each planet gear shaft.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the third embodiment of the transmission, the planet gears are constructed with helix angles and with axial positions on their planet gear shafts where the planet gears on each shaft become completely self load balancing so that only the one planet bearing on each planet gear shaft is required. This embodiment allows a further reduction in parts count by halving the number of individual planet gear shaft bearing assemblies needed. The larger planet gear on each planet gear shaft is driven by the sun gear. The relative positions of the larger planet gears on adjacent planet gear shafts are axially staggered, enabling the larger planet gears to be interleaved. The smaller pair of planet gears on each planet gear shaft are positioned on axially opposite sides of the larger planet gear. The pair of smaller planet gears mesh with internal gear teeth of the stationary ring gear. The positioning of the smaller planet gear pair on each planet gear shaft on axially opposite sides of the larger planet gear enables the self load balancing of each planet gear shaft and the use of only one bearing assembly on each planet gear shaft.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">A fourth embodiment of the epicyclic gear transmission is similar to the second described embodiment except that high profile contact ratio (HCR) spur gears are used as the planet gears that mesh with the sun gear, rather than the single helical gears of the previous embodiment. This configuration of the epicyclic gear transmission simplifies assembly and allows the double helical planet gears that mesh with the ring gear to be true double helicals (helix angles of the pair of helical planet gears on each planet gear shaft are equal but of opposite hand). This configuration eliminates any axial thrust loads on the stationary internal ring gear. HCR gears also provide noise reduction without the additional thrust load that results from helical gears.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The use of the double helical planet gears on each planet gear shaft that mesh with the internal ring gear improves the safety of each of the embodiments of the epicyclic gearing transmission. The double helical gears meshing with the internal ring gear separates the gears into two parts that creates a dual path transmission system that provides some redundancy. If a gear tooth failure occurs, the gear transmission can continue to operate. A gear tooth failure overloads the remaining gear teeth while the bearings of the planet gear shaft take an increased thrust load. This creates an increase in vibration and noise level in the transmission.

The invention to be described is provided in several embodiments of epicyclic gear transmissions that drive the main rotors 12 of the rotary wing aircraft. Although a dual rotor aircraft is illustrated as an example in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, it should be understood that the epicyclic gear transmission of the invention may be employed as the main rotor drive of single rotor aircraft or tilt rotor aircraft. As explained earlier, the gear transmission of the invention is particularly well suited for use in rotary wing aircraft in that it provides improvements in noise reduction and in the performance of the transmission, combined with improved reliability and fail-safety of the transmission. The gear transmission of the invention makes use of a compound epicyclic gear system with as many as double the number of planet gears sharing the load of the transmission without an increase in the overall diameter of the basic epicyclic gear drive. This reduces the weight of the transmission and provides the transmission with a smaller footprint, two features of the invention that are particularly well suited for use of the transmission in rotary wing<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> aircraft. The compound epicyclic gear transmission also provides a more fail-safe, quieter gear drive for rotary wing applications.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">Figures 2-5</figref> show a first embodiment of the epicyclic gear transmission of the present invention. The input drive of the transmission is from a motive source 14 of the aircraft that drives an input shaft 16 having a center axis that is also the center axis of the transmission. A sun gear cluster comprised of four sun gears 18, 20, 22, 24 is provided on the input shaft 16. The four sun gears are axially arranged in two pairs. A first pair of the sun gears 18, 22 are double helical gears having opposite hand gear teeth of equal helix angles. The second pair of the sun gears 20, 24 are also double helical gears with opposite hand gear teeth with the same helix angles as the first pair of sun gears.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Each of the sun gears 18, 20, 22, 24 meshes with clusters of planet gears mounted on planet gear shafts 26, 28 of a planet gear carrier 30. The planet gear shafts 26, 28 have center axes that are parallel with the center axis of the input shaft 16. The planet gear carrier 30 is formed integrally with an output shaft 32 of the transmission. In the illustrative embodiment of the invention, there are six planet gear shafts mounted on the carrier 30, with the six planet gear shafts being divided into a first group of three planet gear shafts 26 and a second group of three planet gear shafts 28.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">First pairs of planet gears 34, 36 are mounted by bearing assemblies on the planet gear shafts 26 of the first group and second pairs of planet gears 38, 40 are mounted by bearing assemblies on the planet gear shafts 28 of the second group. The pairs of planet gears 34, 36 of the first group are each double helical gears of opposite hand teeth of equal helix angles. The pairs of planet gears 38, 40 of the second group are also each double helical gears of opposite hand teeth having equal helix angles. The planet gears 34, 36 of the first group have an axial spacing between the gears that<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> is dimensioned to receive one of the planet gears 38 of the second group in the axial spacing, and the planet gears 38, 40 of the second group have an axial spacing between the gears that is dimensioned to receive one of the planet gears 36 of the first group in the axial spacing. As best seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the pairs of planet gears 34, 36 of the first group are axially positioned on their planet gear shafts 26 in axially staggered positions relative to the pairs of planet gears 38, 40 of the second group mounted on the second planet gear shafts 28. This enables the pairs of planet gears 34, 36 mounted on the first planet gear shafts 26 and the pairs of planet gears 38, 40 mounted on the second planet gear shafts 28 to be arranged in an interleaved relationship shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>. The interleaved relationship of the planet gears enables the use of twice the number of planetary gears in the transmission of <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">Figures 2-5</figref> than would be used in a basic epicyclic gear transmission having the same sun gear diameter and planet gear diameter as the transmission shown in <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">Figures 2-5</figref>.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The pairs of planet gears mesh with four ring gears or internal gears 42, 44, 46, 48. The ring gears 42, 44, 46, 48 are fixed to the transmission housing and are coaxial with the center axis of the input shaft 16. A first pair of ring gears 42, 44 mesh with the planet gears 34, 36 of the first group of planet gears, and a second pair of ring gears 46, 48 mesh with the planet gears 38, 40 of the second group of planet gears. The ring gears of the first pair 42, 44 and the second pair 46, 48 are double helical gears of opposite hand teeth having equal helix angles.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">By using the double helical planet gears 34, 36, 38, 40 that are staggered in their axial positions and interleaved with each other, the number of planet gears in the transmission can be doubled. Because double helical gears require an axial gap at the apex of the gear teeth to permit the teeth to be ground, they are normally heavier than single helical gears. By axially staggering and interleaving the planet gears, the axial<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> apex gap between each double helical planet gear is almost completely filled with the gear teeth of an adjacent planet gear, enabling doubling of the number of planet gears that can be used at any transmission ratio. This greatly increases the load capacity of the epicyclic gear transmission while providing a large noise reduction combined with improved safety characteristics. The epicyclic gear transmission of <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">Figures 2-5</figref> becomes basically a completely dual path system, thus dramatically enhancing survivability and fault tolerance. In addition, the usual detrimental need for a large apex gap on a double helical gear is turned into an advantage by allowing easy manufacturing while minimizing the weight penalty associated with the need for the apex gap in the double helical gears to allow for cutting tool and grinding wheel runout. The use of helical gears in the transmission also reduces the noise of the transmission's operation</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0006 f0007 f0008 f0009">Figures 6-9</figref> show a variation of the epicyclic gear transmission embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">Figures 2-5</figref> that provides an epicyclic gear transmission with an increased reduction ratio.
