load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to the genetic control of growth and/or development of plants and the cloning and expression of genes involved therein. More particularly, the invention relates to the cloning and expression of the <i>Rht</i> gene from species, according to the claims and use of the genes in plants.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">An understanding of the genetic mechanisms which influence growth and development of plants, including flowering, provides a means for altering the characteristics of a target plant. Species for which manipulation of growth and/or development characteristics may be advantageous includes all crops, with important examples being the cereals, rice and maize, probably the most agronomically important in warmer climatic zones, and wheat, barley, oats and rye in more temperate climates. Important crops for seed products are oil seed rape and canola, maize, sunflower, soyabean and sorghum. Many crops which are harvested for their roots are, of course, grown annually from seed and the production of seed of any kind is very dependent upon the ability of the plant to flower, to be pollinated and to set seed. In horticulture, control of the timing of growth and development, including flowering, is important. Horticultural plants whose flowering may be controlled include lettuce, endive and vegetable brassicas including cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower, and carnations and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> geraniums. Dwarf plants on the one hand and over-size, taller plants on the other may be advantageous and/or desirable in various horticultural and agricultural contexts, further including trees, plantation crops and grasses.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Troung et al (1997) describes the sequence and characterization of two Arabidopsis thaliana cDNAs isolated by functional complementation of a yeast gln3 gdh1 mutant (FEBS Letters, Vol. 410, pp213-218</text></nplcit>). EMBL Accession No.s D39460 and C27475 are rice partial cDNAs.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Recent decades have seen huge increases in wheat grain yields due to the incorporation of semi-dwarfing Rht homeoalleles into breeding programmes. These increases have enabled wheat productivity to keep pace with the demands of the rising world population. Previously, we described the cloning of the <i>Arabidopsis gai</i> alleles (International patent application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="GB9700390W"><text>PCT/GB97/00390 filed 12 February 1997</text></patcit> and published as <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO9729123A"><text>WO97/29123 on 14 August 1998</text></patcit>, John Innes Centre Innovations Limited), which, like <i>Rht</i> mutant alleles in wheat (a monocot), confers a semi-dominant dwarf phenotype in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (a dicot) and a reduction in responsiveness to the plant growth hormone gibberellin (GA). gai encodes a mutant protein (gai) which lacks a 17 amino acid residue segment found near the <i>N</i>-terminus of the wild-type (GAI) protein. The sequence of this segment is highly conserved in a rice cDNA sequence (EST). Here we show that this cDNA maps to a short section of the overlapping cereal genome maps known to contain the <i>Rht</i> loci, and that we have used the cDNA to isolate the <i>Rht</i> genes of wheat. That genomes as widely diverged as those of <i>Arabidopsis</i> and <i>Triticum</i> should carry a conserved sequence which, when mutated, affects GA responsiveness, indicates a role for that sequence in GA<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> signalling that is conserved throughout the plant kingdom. Furthermore, cloning of <i>Rht</i> permits its transfer to many different crop species, with the aim of yield enhancement as great as that obtained previously with wheat.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The introduction of semi-dwarfing <i>Rht</i> homeoalleles (originally known as Norin 10 genes, derived from a Japanese variety, Norin 10) into elite bread-wheat breeding lines was one of the most significant contributors to the so-called "green revolution" (<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="b"><text>Gale et al, 1985. Dwarfing genes in wheat. In: Progress in Plant Breeding, G.E. Russell (ed) Butterworths, London pp 1-35</text></nplcit>). Wheat containing these homeoalleles consistently out-yield wheats lacking them, and now comprise around 80% of the world's wheat crop. The biological basis of this yield-enhancement appears to be two-fold. Firstly, the semi-dwarf phenotype conferred by the <i>Rht</i> alleles causes an increased resistance to lodging (flattening of plants by wind/rain with consequent loss of yield). Secondly, these alleles cause a reallocation of photoassimilate, with more being directed towards the grain, and less towards the stem (Gale <i>et al,</i> 1985). These properties have major effects on wheat yields, as demonstrated by the fact that UK wheat yields increased by over 20% during the years that <i>Rht</i>-containing lines were taken up by farmers.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The rht mutants are dwarfed because they contain a genetically dominant, mutant <i>rht</i> allele which compromises<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> their responses to gibberellin (GA, an endogenous plant growth regulator) (<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Gale et al, 1976. Heredity 37; 283-289</text></nplcit>). Thus the coleoptiles of <i>rht</i> mutants, unlike those of wild-type wheat plants, do not respond to GA applications. In addition, <i>rht</i> mutants accumulate biologically active GAs to higher levels than found in wild-type controls (<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="b"><text>Lenton et al, 1987. Gibberellin insensitivity and depletion in wheat - consequences for development. In: Hormone action in Plant Development - a critical appraisal. GV Haod, JR Lenton, MB Jackson and RK Atkin (eds) Butterworths, London pp 145-160</text></nplcit>). These properties (genetic dominance, reduced GA-responses, and high endogenous GA levels) are common to the phenotypes conferred by mutations in other species (<i>D8</i>/<i>D9</i> in maize; <i>gai</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i>), indicating that these mutant alleles define orthologous genes in these different species, supported further by the observation that <i>D8</i>/<i>D9</i> and <i>Rht</i> are syntenous loci in the genomes of maize and wheat.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an isolated polynucleotide as set out in claim 1, the polynucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide with Rht function. The term "Rht function" indicates ability to influence the phenotype of a plant like the <i>Rht</i> gene of <i>Triticum.</i> "<i>Rht function</i>" may be observed phenotypically in a plant as inhibition, suppression, repression or reduction of plant growth which inhibition, suppression, repression or reduction is antagonised by GA. <i>Rht</i> expression tends to confer a dwarf phenotype on a plant which is antagonised by GA.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Overexpression in a plant from a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide with <i>Rht</i> function may be used to confer a dwarf phenotype on a plant which is correctable by treatment with GA.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Also according to an aspect of the present invention there is provided a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide with ability to confer a <i>rht</i> mutant phenotype upon expression. <i>rht</i> mutant plants are dwarfed compared with wild-type, the dwarfing being GA-insensitive.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Herein, "Rht" (capitalised) is used to refer to the wild-type function, while "rht" (uncapitalised) is used to refer to mutant function.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Many plant growth and developmental processes are regulated by specific members of a family of tetracyclic diterpenoid growth factors known as gibberellins (GA) (<nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>Hooley, Plant Mol. Biol. 26, 1529-1555 (1994</text></nplcit>)). By gibberellin or GA is meant a diterpenoid molecule with the basic carbon-ring structure shown in <figref idrefs="f0013">Figure 5</figref> and possessing biological activity, i.e. we refer to biologically active gibberellins.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Biological activity may be defined by one or more of stimulation of cell elongation, leaf senescence or elicitation of the cereal aleurone α-amylase response. There are many standard assays available in the art, a positive<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> result in any one or more of which signals a test gibberellin as biologically active (<nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>Hoad et al., Phytochemistry 20, 703-713 (1981</text></nplcit>);<nplcit id="ncit0007" npl-type="s"><text> Serebryakov et al., Phytochemistry 23, 1847-1854 (1984</text></nplcit>); <nplcit id="ncit0008" npl-type="s"><text>Smith et al., Phytochemistry 33, 17-20 (1993</text></nplcit>)).</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Assays available in the art include the lettuce hypocotyl assay, cucumber hypocotyl assay, and oat first leaf assay, all of which determine biological activity on the basis of ability of an applied gibberellin to cause elongation of the respective tissue. Preferred assays are those in which the test composition is applied to a gibberellin-deficient plant. Such preferred assays include treatment of dwarf GA-deficient <i>Arrabidopsis</i> to determine growth, the dwarf pea assay, in which internode elongation is determined, the Tan-ginbozu dwarf rice assay, in which elongation of leaf sheath is determined, and the <i>d5</i>-maize assay, also in which elongation of leaf sheath is determined. The elongation bioassays measure the effects of general cell elongation in the respective organs and are not restricted to particular cell types.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Further available assays include the dock (<i>Rumex</i>) leaf senescence assay and the cereal aleurone α-amylase assay. Aleurone cells which surround the endosperm in grain secrete α-amylase on germination, which digests starch to produce sugars then used by the growing plant. The enzyme production is controlled by GA. Isolated aleurone cells given biologically active GA secrete α-amylase whose activity can<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> inactivity (exhibited by GA<sub>8</sub>, GA<sub>29</sub>, GA<sub>34</sub> and GA<sub>51</sub>). rht mutants do not respond to GA treatment, e.g. treatment with GA<sub>1</sub>, GA<sub>3</sub> or GA<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Treatment with GA is preferably by spraying with aqueous solution, for example spraying with 10<sup>-4</sup>M GA<sub>3</sub> or GA<sub>4</sub> in aqueous solution, perhaps weekly or more frequently, and may be by placing droplets on plants rather than spraying. GA may be applied dissolved in an organic solvent such as ethanol or acetone, because it is more soluble in these than in water, but this is not preferred because these solvents have a tendency to damage plants. If an organic solvent is to be used, suitable formulations include 24<i>η</i>l of 0.6, 4.0 or 300mM GA<sub>3</sub> or GA<sub>4</sub> dissolved in 80% ethanol. Plants, e.g. <i>Arabidopsis</i>, may be grown on a medium containing GA, such as tissue culture medium (GM) solidified with agar and containing supplementary GA.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The present invention also provides a nucleic acid construct or vector which comprises a polynucleotide of the invention, preferably a construct or vector from which polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid sequence can be expressed.

A further aspect of the present invention provides a method of making such a plant cell involving introduction of a vector comprising the sequence of nucleotides into a plant cell and causing or allowing recombination between the vector and the plant cell genome to introduce the sequence of nucleotides into the genome.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">A plant according to the present invention may be one which does not breed true in one or more properties. Plant varieties may be excluded, particularly registrable plant varieties according to Plant Breeders' Rights. It is noted that a plant need not be considered a "plant variety" simply because it contains stably within its genome a transgene, introduced into a cell of the plant or an ancestor thereof.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In addition to a plant, the present invention provides any clone of such a plant, seed, selfed or hybrid progeny and descendants, and any part of any of these, such as cuttings, seed. The invention provides any plant propagule, that is any part which may be used in reproduction or propagation, sexual or asexual, including cuttings, seed and so on. Also encompassed by the invention is a plant which is a sexually<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> or asexually propagated off-spring, clone or descendant of such a plant, or any part or propagule of said plant, off-spring, clone or descendant.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The invention further provides a method of influencing the characteristics of a plant comprising expression of a heterologous Rht or rht gene sequence (or mutant, allele, derivative or homologue thereof, as discussed) within cells of the plant. The term "heterologous" indicates that the gene/sequence of nucleotides in question have been introduced into said cells of the plant, or an ancestor thereof, using genetic engineering, that is to say by human intervention, which may comprise transformation. The gene may be on an extra-genomic vector or incorporated, preferably stably, into the genome. The heterologous gene may replace an endogenous equivalent gene, ie one which normally performs the same or a similar function in control of growth and/or development, or the inserted sequence may be additional to an endogenous gene. An advantage of introduction of a heterologous gene is the ability to place expression of the gene under the control of a promoter of choice, in order to be able to influence gene expression, and therefore growth and/or development of the plant according to preference. Furthermore, mutants and derivatives of the wild-type gene may be used in place of the endogenous gene. The inserted gene may be foreign or exogenous to the host cell, e.g. of another plant species.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The principal characteristic which may be altered using the<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> present invention is growth.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">According to the model of the <i>Rht</i> gene as a growth repressor, under-expression of the gene may be used to promote growth, at least in plants which have only one endogenous gene conferring <i>Rht</i> function (not for example <i>Arabidopsis</i> which has endogenous homologues which would compensate). This may involve use of anti-sense or sense regulation. Taller plants may be made by knocking out <i>Rht</i> or the relevant homologous gene in the plant of interest. Plants may be made which are resistant to compounds which inhibit GA biosynthesis, such as paclobutrazol, for instance to allow use of a GA biosynthesis inhibitor to keep weeds dwarf but let crop plants grow tall.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Over-expression of a <i>Rht</i> gene may lead to a dwarf plant which is correctable by treatment with GA, as predicted by the Rht repression model.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Since rht mutant genes are dominant on phenotype, they may be used to make GA-insensitive dwarf plants. This may be applied for example to any transformable crop-plant, tree or fruit-tree species. It may provide higher yield/reduced lodging like Rht wheat. In rice this may provide GA-insensitive rice resistant to the Bakane disease, which is a problem in Japan and elsewhere. Dwarf ornamentals may be of value for the horticulture and cut-flower markets. Sequence manipulation may provide for varying degrees of severity of dwarfing, GA-insensitive phenotype, allowing tailoring of the<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> degree of severity to the needs of each crop-plant or the wishes of the manipulator. Over-expression of <i>rht</i>-mutant sequences is potentially the most useful.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">A second characteristic that may be altered is plant development, for instance flowering. In some plants, and in certain environmental conditions, a GA signal is required for floral induction. For example, GA-deficient mutant <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants grown under short day conditions will not flower unless treated with GA: these plants do flower normally when grown under long day conditions. <i>Arabidopsis gai</i> mutant plants show delayed flowering under short day conditions: severe mutants may not flower at all. Thus, for instance by <i>Rht</i> or <i>rht</i> gene expression or over-expression, plants may be produced which remain vegetative until given GA treatment to induce flowering. This may be useful in horticultural contexts or for spinach, lettuce and other crops where suppression of bolting is desirable.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The nucleic acid according to the invention may be placed under the control of an externally inducible gene promoter to place the <i>Rht</i> or <i>rht</i> coding sequence under the control of the user.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The term "inducible" as applied to a promoter is well understood by those skilled in the art. In essence, expression under the control of an inducible promoter is "switched on" or increased in response to an applied<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> stimulus. The nature of the stimulus varies between promoters. Some inducible promoters cause little or undetectable levels of expression (or no expression) in the absence of the appropriate stimulus. Other inducible promoters cause detectable constitutive expression in the absence of the stimulus. Whatever the level of expression is in the absence of the stimulus, expression from any inducible promoter is increased in the presence of the correct stimulus. The preferable situation is where the level of expression increases upon application of the relevant stimulus by an amount effective to alter a phenotypic characteristic. Thus an inducible (or "switchable") promoter may be used which causes a basic level of expression in the absence of the stimulus which level is too low to bring about a desired phenotype (and may in fact be zero). Upon application of the stimulus, expression is increased (or switched on) to a level which brings about the desired phenotype.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Suitable promoters include the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S (CaMV 35S) gene promoter that is expressed at a high level in virtually all plant tissues (Benfey et al, 1990a and 1990b); the maize glutathione-S-transferase isoform II (GST-II-27) gene promoter which is activated in response to application of exogenous safener (<patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO9301294A"><text>WO93/01294</text></patcit>, ICI Ltd); the cauliflower meri 5 promoter that is expressed in the vegetative apical meristem as well as several well localised positions in the plant body, eg inner phloem, flower primordia, branching<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> points in root and shoot (Medford, 1992; Medford et al, 1991) and the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana LEAFY</i> promoter that is expressed very early in flower development (Weigel et al, 1992).</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The GST-II-27 gene promoter has been shown to be induced by certain chemical compounds which can be applied to growing plants. The promoter is functional in both monocotyledons and dicotyledons. It can therefore be used to control gene expression in a variety of genetically modified plants, including field crops such as canola, sunflower, tobacco, sugarbeet, cotton; cereals such as wheat, barley, rice, maize, sorghum; fruit such as tomatoes, mangoes, peaches, apples, pears, strawberries, bananas, and melons; and vegetables such as carrot, lettuce, cabbage and onion. The GST-II-27 promoter is also suitable for use in a variety of tissues, including roots, leaves, stems and reproductive tissues.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Accordingly, the present invention provides in a further aspect a gene construct comprising an inducible promoter operatively linked to a nucleotide sequence provided by the present invention. This enables control of expression of the gene. The invention also provides plants transformed with said gene construct and methods comprising introduction of such a construct into a plant cell and/or induction of expression of a construct within a plant cell,<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> by application of a suitable stimulus, an effective exogenous inducer. The promoter may be the GST-II-27 gene promoter or any other inducible plant promoter.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">When introducing a chosen gene construct into a cell, certain considerations must be taken into account, well known to those skilled in the art. The nucleic acid to be inserted should be assembled within a construct which contains effective regulatory elements which will drive transcription. There must be available a method of transporting the construct into the cell. Once the construct is within the cell membrane, integration into the endogenous chromosomal material either will or will not occur. Finally, as far as plants are concerned the target cell type must be such that cells can be regenerated into whole plants.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Selectable genetic markers may be used consisting of chimaeric genes that confer selectable phenotypes such as resistance to antibiotics such as kanamycin, hygromycin, phosphinotricin, chlorsulfuron, methotrexate, gentamycin, spectinomycin, imidazolinones and glyphosate.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">An aspect of the present invention is the use of nucleic acid according to the invention in the production of a transgenic plant.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">A further aspect provides a method including introducing the nucleic acid into a plant cell and causing or allowing<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> incorporation of the nucleic acid into the genome of the cell.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Any appropriate method of plant transformation may be used to generate plant cells comprising nucleic acid in accordance with the present invention.

The use of anti-sense genes or partial gene sequences to down-regulate gene expression is now well-established. DNA is placed under the control of a promoter such that transcription of the "anti-sense" strand of the DNA yields<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> RNA which is complementary to normal mRNA transcribed from the "sense" strand of the target gene. For double-stranded DNA this is achieved by placing a coding sequence or a fragment thereof in a "reverse orientation" under the control of a promoter. The complementary anti-sense RNA sequence is thought then to bind with mRNA to form a duplex, inhibiting translation of the endogenous mRNA from the target gene into protein. Whether or not this is the actual mode of action is still uncertain. However, it is established fact that the technique works.

It may be advantageous to include the initiating methionine ATG codon, and perhaps one or more nucleotides upstream of the initiating codon. A further possibility is to target a regulatory sequence of a gene, e.g. a sequence that is characteristic of one or more genes in one or more pathogens against which resistance is desired. A suitable fragment<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> may have at least about 14-23 nucleotides, e.g. about 15, 16 or 17, or more, at least about 25, at least about 30, at least about 40, at least about 50, or more. Other fragments may be at least about 300 nucleotides, at least about 400 nucleotides, at least about 500 nucleotides, at least about 600 nucleotides, at least about 700 nucleotides or more. Such fragments in the sense orientation may be used in co-suppression (see below).</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Total complementarity of sequence is not essential, though may be preferred. One or more nucleotides may differ in the anti-sense construct from the target gene. It may be preferred for there to be sufficient homology for the respective anti-sense and sense RNA molecules to hybridise, particularly under the conditions existing in a plant cell.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Thus, the present invention also provides a method of influencing a characteristic of a plant, the method comprising causing or allowing anti-sense transcription from nucleic acid according to the invention within cells of the plant.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">When additional copies of the target gene are inserted in sense, that is the same, orientation as the target gene, a range of phenotypes is produced which includes individuals where over-expression occurs and some where under-expression of protein from the target gene occurs. When the inserted gene is only part of the endogenous gene the number of<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> under-expressing individuals in the transgenic population increases. The mechanism by which sense regulation occurs, particularly down-regulation, is not well-understood. However, this technique is also well-reported in scientific and patent literature and is used routinely for gene control.

Comparison of the DNA sequences of the wild-type (<i>GAI</i>) and mutant (<i>gai</i>) alleles showed that gai encodes a mutant predicted protein product (gai) which lacks a segment of 17 amino acids from close to the N-terminus of the protein. Screening of the DNA sequence databases with the <i>GAI</i> sequence revealed the existence of a rice EST (D39460) which contains a region of sequence very closely related to that of the segment that is deleted from GAI in the gai protein. A comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences from the region DELLA to EQLE are identical in both sequences. The two differences (V/A; E/D) are conservative substitutions, in which one amino acid residue is replaced by another having very similar chemical properties. In addition, the region of identity extends beyond the boundary of the deletion region<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> in the gai protein. The sequence DVAQKLEQLE is not affected by the deletion in gai, and yet is perfectly conserved between the GAI and D39460 sequences (<figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>).</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">An approximately 700 bp <i>SalI-NotI</i> subfragment of D39460 was used in low-stringency hybridization experiments to isolate hybridizing clones from wheat cDNA and genomic libraries (made from DNA from the variety Chinese Spring) and from a maize genomic library (made from line B73N). Several wheat clones were isolated, including C15-1 and C15-10 (cDNAs), and 5a1 and 14a1 (genomic clones). Clone C15-1 has been used in gene mapping experiments. Nullisomic-tetrasomic analysis showed that clone C15-1 hybridizes to genomic DNA fragments derived from wheat chromosomes 4A, 4B and 4D. This is consistent with clone C15-1 containing <i>Rht</i> sequence, since the <i>Rht</i> loci map to the group 4 chromosomes. Furthermore, recombinant analysis using a population segregating for the <i>Rht-D1b</i> (formerly <i>Rht2</i>) allele identified a hybridizing fragment that displayed perfect co-segregation with the mutant allele. This placed the genomic location of the gene encoding the mRNA sequence in cDNA C15-1 within a 2 cM segment (that was already known to contain <i>Rht</i>) of the group 4 chromosomes, and provides strong evidence that the cDNA and genomic clones do indeed contain the <i>Rht</i> gene. The maize <i>D8</i> DNA sequence disclosed herein is from subcloned contiguous 1.8 kb and 3.0 kb <i>SalI</i> fragments (cloned into Bluescript™ SK<sup>+</sup>) from 1a1. The wheat <i>Rht</i> sequence disclosed herein is from a 5.7 kb <i>DraI</i> subfragment cloned into Bluescript™ SK<sup>+</sup>)<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> from clone Sa1.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2a</figref> gives the complete (single-pass) DNA sequence of cDNA C15-1.

This sequence displays strong homology with that of <i>Arabidopsis GAI,</i> as revealed by a comparison of the amino acid sequence of a predicted translational product of the wheat sequence (Rht) with that of <i>GAI</i> (GAI), shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Figure 3b</figref>. In particular, the predicted amino acid sequence of the presumptive <i>Rht</i> reveals a region of near-identity with GAI over the region that is missing in gai (<figref idrefs="f0011 f0012">Figure 4). Figure 4</figref> reveals that the homology that extends beyond the gai deletion region in the rice EST is also conserved in Rht (DVAQKLEQLE), thus indicating that this region, in addition to that found in the gai deletion, is involved in GA signal-transduction. This region is not found in SCR, another protein that is related in sequence to GAI but which is not involved in GA signalling. The primers used in the above sequencing experiments are shown in Table 1.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">Further confirmation that these sequences are indeed the wheat <i>Rht</i> and maize <i>D8</i> loci has been obtained by analysis of gene sequences from various mutant alleles, as follows.<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --></p><p id="p0074" num="0074">The present inventors obtained and sequenced the clone identified on the database as the rice EST D39460, and the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences resulting from that work are shown in <figref idrefs="f0014">Figure 6a and Figure 6b</figref> respectively.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">Previous work on the GAI gene of <i>Arabidopsis</i> showed that the GAI protein consists of two sections, an N-terminal half displaying no homology with any protein of known function, and a C-terminal half displaying extensive homology with the <i>Arabidopsis</i> SCR candidate transcription factor (<nplcit id="ncit0054" npl-type="s"><text>Peng et al.

The <i>D</i>8-1 mutation is an in-frame deletion which removes amino acids VAQK (55-59) and adds a G (see sequence in <figref idrefs="f0021">Figure 11a and Figure 11b</figref>). This deletion overlaps with the conserved DVAQKLEQLE homology block described above. <i>D</i>8-2023 is another in-frame deletion mutation that removes amino acids LATDTVHYNPSD (87-98) from the N-terminus of the D8 protein (see <figref idrefs="f0021">Figure 11c and Figure 11d</figref>). This deletion does not overlap with the deletion in<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> gai or D8-1, but covers another region that is highly conserved-between GAI, D8 and Rht (see <figref idrefs="f0019 f0020">Figure 10</figref>). Finally, <i>Rht-D1c</i> contains another small in-frame deletion that removes amino acids LNAPPPPLPPAPQ (109-121) in the N-terminal region of the mutant Rht protein that it encodes (see <figref idrefs="f0022">Figure 12a and Figure 12b</figref>) (LN-P is conserved netween GAI, D8 and Rht, see <figref idrefs="f0019 f0020">Figure 10</figref>).</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Thus all of the above described mutant alleles are dominant, and confer dwarfism associated with reduced GA-response. All three of these alleles contain deletion mutations which remove a portion of the N-terminal half of the protein that they encode.
