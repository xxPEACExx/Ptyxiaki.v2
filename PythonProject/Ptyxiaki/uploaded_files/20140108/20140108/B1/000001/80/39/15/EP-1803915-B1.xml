and a combustion controller for the vehicle.</p><heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Typically, the combustion condition of an engine is controlled such that the engine can rotate in the most possible stable and smooth manner. For example, for controlling the fuel injection amount such that the engine revolution speed becomes a target idling revolution speed at the time of start-up of the engine, such a method has been used in which the target idling revolution speed is accurately established in accordance with the progress of the warm-up condition of the engine (see Patent Reference No. 1, for example).<br/>
Patent Reference No. 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2002364433A"><text>JP-A-2002-364433</text></patcit></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is also known to control fuel injection on the basis of combustion noise, as for example in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP1219805A"><text>EP 1 219 805</text></patcit>.</p><heading id="h0003">Disclosure of the Invention</heading><heading id="h0004">Problems that the Invention is to Solve</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, when the engine rotates in an extremely stable and smooth manner, some users cannot feel that the engine is operating though the engine is actually rotating depending on the vehicle types and applications on which the engine is mounted. Particularly for motorcycles, some riders wish to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> feel that the engine is dynamically operating, i.e., the engine is actually existing rather than desire stable and smooth rotation of the engine. It is therefore possible that the users who have such demands are not satisfied with the vehicle which only controls the combustion condition of the engine such that the engine can rotate stably and smoothly.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The invention has been thus developed to overcome the above problems. It is an object of the invention to provide a straddle-type vehicle from which a person sitting on the vehicle or a person around the vehicle can obtain the actual feeling that the engine is existing, i.e., the engine is actually operating.</p><heading id="h0005">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The problem is solved by a straddle-type vehicle according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The straddle-type vehicle includes: a vehicle body frame; an engine mounted on the vehicle body frame; a combustion adjusting device for adjusting the combustion condition of the engine; and a combustion controller for controlling the combustion adjusting device.

Examples of the straddle-type vehicle according to the invention also include a scooter-type vehicle having a foot board on which legs of a person can be placed side by side.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Apparently, the shift of the sound pressure level at least in a part of the idling condition according to the invention includes not only such a case where the sound pressure level is always varied in the idling condition but also such a case where the sound pressure level is varied in a range other than a predetermined range in the idling condition. More specifically, the change mode is not always required to be selected for the combustion condition of the engine in the idling condition according to the invention, but the standard mode may be selected for the combustion condition of the engine in lieu of the change mode in the idling condition at the time of warm-up start or extremely unstable engine revolution or in other cases.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Apparently, stabilizing the sound pressure level at least in a part of the constant speed running condition according to the invention includes not only such a case where the sound pressure level is always stabilized in the constant speed running condition but also such a case where the sound pressure level is stabilized in a range other than a<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> predetermined range in the constant speed running condition.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Apparently, stabilizing the sound pressure level at least in a part of the acceleration condition according to the invention includes not only such a case where the sound pressure level is always stabilized in the acceleration condition but also such a case where the sound pressure level is stabilized in a range other than a predetermined range in the acceleration condition. It is also possible to combine the respective control in the idling condition, in the low speed running condition, and in the acceleration condition.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The shift of the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform according to the invention refers to the shift of the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform produced during one cycle (one cycle combustion) of the engine by one cycle, a predetermined plurality of cycles, or random plural cycles (random cycles) of the engine. This shift includes not only the shift of the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform by a predetermined amount or larger in comparison with the same cylinder but also the shift of the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform by a predetermined amount or larger in comparison with a different cylinder. The shift of the maximum point by a predetermined amount or larger within a predetermined period refers to the shift of the maximum point which can be felt. The shift of the maximum point by random cycles according to the invention<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> means the shift of the maximum point caused by intentionally varying the fuel supply amount by random cycles, for example.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The audible sound wave according to the invention refers to a sound in a frequency easily recognizable to the human ears (20Hz to 20KHz). More specifically, sounds in 5KHz to 20KHz fall within the audible sound wave according to the invention.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In the standard mode in which the combustion adjusting device is controlled such that the combustion condition of the engine becomes the combustion condition corresponding to a target operation condition of the engine according to the invention, the combustion condition of the engine is controlled such that the engine can rotate in a most possible stable and smooth manner. For example, the combustion condition of the engine is controlled such that the engine can stably rotate at the idle revolution speed in the idling condition, and such that sufficient acceleration can be obtained in the acceleration condition. Thus, the engine setting in the standard mode is similar to the engine setting in the conventional structure. While the shift amount of the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform of the audible sound wave generated from the engine or the vehicle body frame is the predetermined value or larger within the predetermined period in the change mode as described above, the shift amount of the maximum point in the standard mode is smaller than the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> predetermined value.</p><heading id="h0006">Advantage of the Invention</heading><p id="p0048" num="0048">According to the first and second aspects of the invention, the combustion adjusting device is controlled such that the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform of the audible sound wave generated from the engine or the vehicle body frame is shifted by a predetermined amount or larger within a predetermined period at least in some of the operation conditions. Thus, the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform varies by one cycle, a plurality of cycles, or random cycles. Accordingly, the rider can more easily feel that the engine is rotating than in the case where the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform does not greatly change, and thus a person sitting on the vehicle or a person around the vehicle can positively feel the operation of the engine.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In an example according to the invention, a person sitting on the straddle-type vehicle or positioned adjacent to the straddle-type vehicle can recognize the shift of the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform. In another example, the predetermined period is in the range from 40 milliseconds to 4,000 milliseconds and the predetermined amount is 1dB or larger. Thus, the rider or the person around the vehicle can feel the operation of the engine.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In still another example according to the invention,<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> the combustion adjusting device includes any one of a fuel supply device, an ignition device, an intake valve or exhaust valve opening/closing timing adjusting device, an equivalent pipe length adjusting device for intake pipe or exhaust pipe, an electrically powered throttle control device, and an idling speed adjusting device, or combinations of a plurality of those. Thus, the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform described above can be shifted using conventional devices equipped in the vehicle.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In still another example according to the invention, the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform is shifted at least in some of the operation conditions of the engine in accordance with signals of the sensor for detecting the operation conditions of the engine. It is therefore possible to selectively shift the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform in particular operation conditions such as the idling operation condition and not to shift in other operation conditions.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Since the shift amount of the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform is controlled to be shifted by a predetermined amount or larger during the idling condition, the rider can clearly feel that the engine is dynamically operating in the idling condition. In the idling condition, the rider not sitting on the vehicle can feel the operation of the engine at the time of vehicle stop.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Since the rider can easily feel the operation of the engine in the idling condition, such an erroneous operation that the rider pushes the engine start switch even in the idling operation can be prevented. More specifically, when the idling revolution is extremely stable and smooth as in the conventional structure, the start switch may be pushed through erroneous recognition that the engine has been stopped. However, this problem can be solved according to the invention.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In still another example according to the invention, it is possible to switch between the change mode in which the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform is shifted by a predetermined amount or larger within a predetermined period and the standard mode in which the combustion condition becomes a combustion condition corresponding to a target operation condition. Thus, the rider can feel the operation of the engine only when he or she desires to feel it according to the preference of the rider. For example, the rider can freely select the change mode in the idling condition and the standard mode in the constant speed running condition and acceleration condition, or other selections.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">More specifically, when the change mode is selected in the idling condition of the engine, the rider can feel the dynamic operation of the engine. When the standard mode is selected in the constant running condition, the problem that the rider rather feels tired with useless change of sound and<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> vibration at the time of constant speed successive running or other occasions can be solved. When the standard mode is selected in the acceleration running range, lowering of start acceleration and overtaking acceleration can be prevented. More specifically, in some cases the fuel injection amount is decreased by a predetermined cycle in the change mode as will be described later, for example, and in this case the output of the engine is lowered accordingly. Thus, there is a possibility of lowering of acceleration when the change mode is selected in the acceleration running range. However, according to this example, this possibility can be eliminated.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In still another example according to the invention, the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform in the high frequency band of the audible sound wave is shifted or the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform in the low frequency band of the audible sound wave is shifted. Thus, the rider can more positively feel the change of the sound pressure level or the like.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In still another example according to the invention, the shift of the maximum point is periodically caused or randomly caused. Thus, the shift of the maximum point of the sound pressure level can be widened without increasing the entire sound pressure level.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The sound pressure level is varied by altering the amount of fuel supplied to a specific cylinder by 10% or larger<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> according to the third and fourth aspects of the invention, by altering the ignition timing of a specific cylinder by 10° or larger according to the fifth and sixth aspects of the invention, and by altering the intake air amount to a specific cylinder by 10% or larger according to the seventh and eighth aspects of the invention. Thus, the rider or the person around the vehicle can feel the rotation of the engine by the simple and specific structure.</p><heading id="h0007">Brief Description of the Drawings</heading><p id="p0059" num="0059"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1] Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)</figref> schematically illustrate a motorcycle on which an engine in an embodiment according to the invention is mounted.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2] Fig. 2</figref> schematically shows a structure of the engine.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3] Fig. 3</figref> is a block diagram schematically showing a combustion controller of the engine.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4] Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)</figref> are flowcharts showing processes performed by the controller.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5] Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)</figref> are waveform charts of control performed by the controller.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6] Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)</figref> show results of experiments executed in the embodiment.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7] Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)</figref> show results of experiments executed in the embodiment.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 8] Figs. 8(a) and 8(b)</figref> show results of experiments executed in the embodiment.<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --></li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 9] Figs. 9(a) and 9(b)</figref> show results of experiments executed in the embodiment.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 10] Figs. 10(a) and 10(b)</figref> show results of experiments executed in the embodiment.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 11] Figs. 11(a) and 11(b)</figref> show results of experiments executed in the embodiment.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 12] Figs. 12(a) and 12(b)</figref> show results of experiments executed in the embodiment.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 13] Figs. 13(a) and 13(b)</figref> show results of experiments executed in the embodiment.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 14] Fig. 14</figref> is an explanatory view showing another embodiment according to the invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0013">Fig. 15] Fig. 15</figref> is an explanatory view showing still another embodiment according to the invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0014">Fig. 16] Fig. 16</figref> is an explanatory view showing still another embodiment according to the invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 17] Figs. 17(a) through 17(d)</figref> are explanatory views showing methods for obtaining sound pressure level waveforms according to the invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0016">Fig. 18] Figs. 18(a) through 18(i)</figref> are explanatory views showing shift patterns of maximum points of sound pressure level waveforms and the like according to the invention.

For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5(b)</figref>, the ignition timing of the second cylinder 4 is kept constant at the standard ignition timing at 10° before the top dead center when the change mode requirements are satisfied in the idling operation condition. On the other hand, the ignition timing of the first cylinder 3 is controlled such that the timing alternately changes between the standard ignition timing (10° before the top dead center) and 5° after the top dead center. Apparently, there are various other change patterns of the ignition timing.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">Additionally, there are various patterns for determining operation ranges for which the change mode is selected. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4 (a)</figref>, the change mode is not selected (OFF) at the time of the first idling immediately after the cold start of the engine (S1), and the change mode is selected (ON) when it is determined that the stable idling condition is achieved based on the engine temperature, engine revolution speed, the commanded fuel injection time, or other conditions (S2). The change mode is OFF when the throttle is opened by racing (S3). The change mode is kept at ON when the first gear of the variable transmission is selected (S4), and is switched to OFF when the throttle is opened and the vehicle starts (S5). When the vehicle stops (vehicle speed: zero) (S6) or when the variable<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> transmission is set at neutral (S7) or returns to idling (S8), the change mode is switched to ON.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">The change mode is not always required to be selected in the idling operation range (S2). It is therefore possible to select the standard mode in stead of the change mode for the engine combustion condition even in the idling operation range when the revolution of the engine is unstable, for example.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">Also, the standard mode may be selected when the engine revolution speed is constant regarding as the low speed running condition and when the engine revolution speed increases regarding as the acceleration condition. Alternatively, it is possible to determine whether the vehicle is in the constant speed running condition or the acceleration condition from the detection results of the throttle opening and select the standard mode based on the determination.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4 (b)</figref> shows another example of the operation ranges for which the change mode is selected. In this example, the standard mode is selected (step S14) when the engine operation is in the first idling condition (step S11) or when the vehicle speed is a predetermined vehicle speed or higher (step S12) or in the acceleration condition in which the acceleration is a predetermined value or higher (step S13). On the other hand, in such a case where the engine operation is not in the first idling condition and the vehicle speed is lower than the<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> predetermined vehicle speed in the non-acceleration condition (steps S11 through S13), the change mode is selected (step S15) .</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">When the change mode is selected for the combustion condition of the engine, the shift amount of the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform is controlled to be the predetermined amount or larger by one cycle, a plurality of cycles, or random cycles of the engine. Thus, the rider can feel the rotation of the engine more easily than in the case where the maximum value of the sound pressure level waveform is not varied. Accordingly, the rider can positively feel that the engine is operating. Moreover, since the sound pressure level changes in the change mode, the operating condition of the engine can be felt by the rider through the changes in sound even when the rider does not sit on the vehicle in the vehicle stop condition.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">At the time of idling, the change mode is selected so that the rider can positively feel the operation of the engine through the shift of the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform. Thus, erroneous operations in such a case as the rider pushes the engine start switch even in the idling condition of the engine can be prevented.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">In this example, the change mode is selected only at the idling condition and then is switched to the standard mode after the vehicle start. Therefore, when variations in sound and vibration become burden for the rider at the time of<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> constant speed running such as touring, the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform is stabilized so as to solve the problem that the rider is rather tired with the useless variations in sound and vibration.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">Since the standard mode is selected for the combustion condition of the engine in the acceleration running operation range such as starting acceleration and overtaking acceleration, lowering of acceleration can be prevented. When the fuel supply amount is decreased by a predetermined cycle to execute the change mode, the output of the engine lowers accordingly. As a result, lowering of acceleration occurs when the change mode is selected in the acceleration running operation range. However, since the standard mode is selected in the acceleration running operation range in this embodiment, this problem does not occur. Moreover, in this embodiment, the combustion condition of the first cylinder 3 remains unchanged in the change mode while the combustion condition of the second cylinder 4 is changed. Accordingly, such a condition where the overall operation of the engine becomes extremely unstable can be prevented, and thus the possibility that the rider erroneously recognizes the unstable condition as an abnormal condition of the engine can be eliminated.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">The combustion condition of the engine may be switched between the change mode and the standard mode using a manual changeover switch. In this case, the rider can feel the<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> operation of the engine only when he or she desires to feel the operation of the engine in accordance with his or her preference.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">Furthermore, since either the change mode or the standard mode is selected for the combustion condition of the engine by controlling the amount of fuel to be supplied to the engine, the combustion condition can be stably altered and thus the sound pressure level can be easily and securely varied.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">Next, the results of experiments conducted to confirm the advantages of the invention are shown. <figref idrefs="f0015">Figs. 17 (a)</figref> through 17 (d) are explanatory views showing methods for obtaining sound pressure level waveforms according to the experiments. In these experiments, practical sound pressure waveforms (practical data) obtained by a microphone located at a predetermined measurement position were analyzed using various unit analysis data lengths to acquire various types of sound pressure level waveforms (weighted data). Then, the sound pressure level waveform closest to the impression of sound (sound impression) obtained when a person stands by the microphone and actually hears the sound was selected to analyze the shift amount of the sound pressure level. Thus, the sound pressure level waveform in these experiments is intended to be used for visualizing the change conditions of sounds actually heard by a person.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096"><figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 17 (a)</figref> shows a practically measured sound pressure<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> waveform (practical data). <figref idrefs="f0015">Figs. 17(b), 17(c), and 17(d)</figref> show sound pressure level waveforms (weighted data) obtained by analyzing the overall frequency bands (overall) of sound pressure waveforms measured using the unit analysis data lengths of 5 msec, 40 msec, and 160 msec, respectively, and then weighting the analyzed sound pressure waveforms (A characteristic).</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">The process of weighting herein refers to compensation such as multiplying the waveforms by coefficients for emphasizing the sound pressure at frequencies easily audible to the human ears. For obtaining the sound pressure level waveforms, specific frequency bands (pitch of sounds) may be extracted. However, this method is not used but the overall frequency band analysis was adopted in these experiments.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">Considerably different sound pressure level waveforms are produced when the unit analysis data lengths for the sound pressure level waveforms are varied. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 17(b)</figref>, the number of the maximum points of the sound pressure level waveform, i.e., points to be felt as individual sounds by sound impression is at least 18 within 600 msec. In <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 17(c)</figref>, there are about 7 maximum points as indicated by arrows.

Thus, in these experiments, the sound pressure level waveform whose unit analysis data length is 40 msec. shown in <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 17 (c)</figref> was selected as the waveform closest to the sound impression.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">Obviously, the unit analysis data lengths used for obtaining sound pressure level waveforms are not limited to 5, 40, 160 msec. determined as above, but may be established as appropriate lengths for obtaining sound pressure level waveforms as close to the human sound impressions as possible.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">In these experiments, the change condition of the sound pressure level waveform obtained in the standard mode where both the combustion conditions of the first cylinder 3 and the second cylinder 4 are stabilized was compared with the change condition of the sound pressure level waveform obtained in the change mode where the combustion of the first cylinder 3 is stabilized and the combustion of the second cylinder 4 is varied. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)</figref>, the microphone M for measuring the sound pressure waveforms are disposed approximately at the center of the muffler 40b in the front-to-rear direction of the vehicle, at a position 500 millimeters shifted to the muffler 40a side from a vehicle center line L in the vehicle width direction, and at a height of 1,400 millimeters from the road surface in the height direction.<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --></p><p id="p0102" num="0102">In the standard mode (see std. <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>), the fuel injection amounts for the first and second cylinders 3 and 4 were both kept constant as the standard amount (100%).

In the standard (std) mode (see <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6(b)</figref>), the shift amounts of the maximum points of the sound pressure level waveforms are substantially constant approximately in the range from 49 to 52dB at the explosion timing of both the first cylinder and the second cylinder.

More specifically, the maximum points of the sound pressure level waveforms vary approximately in the range from 50 to 55dB in both the cases of 100-80% (<figref idrefs="f0006">Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)</figref>) and 100-170% (<figref idrefs="f0007">Figs. 8 (a) and 8 (b)</figref>), and vary approximately in the range from 48 to 55dB for the cases of 100-200% (<figref idrefs="f0008">Figs. 9(a) and 9(b)</figref>) and random supplies of the fuel injection (<figref idrefs="f0009">Figs. 10 (a) and 10(b)</figref>). Thus, the shift amounts of the maximum points of the sound pressure level waveforms are in the range of the predetermined amount or larger, i.e., approximately 5 to 7dB, which is a sound sufficiently large to such an extent that the rider, the co-passenger, or the person around the vehicle can recognize or larger.</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">Apparent from the results of these experiments, the maximum point of the sound pressure level waveform greatly shifts by keeping either the first cylinder or the second cylinder constant and varying the fuel supply amount for the other cylinder by one cycle or by random cycles.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108"><figref idrefs="f0010">Figs. 11(a)</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0010 f0012">11(b) through 13(a)</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0012">13(b)</figref> show measurement results of the exhaust gas components (CO, HC, CO<sub>2</sub>)<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> in the standard mode and change mode.
