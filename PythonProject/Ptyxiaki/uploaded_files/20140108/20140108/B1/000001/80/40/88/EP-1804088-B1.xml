Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to functioning optical lenses having optical functions such as an antiglare function, a dimming function, and a polarizing function. It also relates to methods of producing the functioning optical lenses. Such functioning optical lenses may be used, for example, antiglare lenses, photochromic lenses, and polarizing lenses, for example, in goggles and sunglasses.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Functioning optical lenses are currently widely used and have the function of, for example, absorbing light at specific wavelengths or preventing glare caused typically by reflected light. Of these functioning optical lenses, polarizing lenses have polarizing functions and are used as sunglass lenses for preventing diffuse reflection. Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (JP-A) No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2002090529A"><text>2002-90529</text></patcit>, for example, discloses a polarizing composite lens. This lens is prepared by laminating an optically transparent nylon (polyamide) sheet onto one side of a polarizer plate with the interposition of an acrylic adhesive to yield an intermediate composite, curving the intermediate composite, and thermally fusing the optically transparent nylon (polyamide) sheet with a resin of the same composition, in<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> which the polarizer plate includes a polarizing sheet sandwiched between two triacetyl cellulose (cellulose triacetate; TAC) layers. This technique, however, is disadvantageous in production efficiency, because such a nylon resin may not be thermally fused with TAC, and an extra nylon sheet should be arranged between the two layers.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (JP-A) No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2002258220A"><text>2002-258220</text></patcit> discloses a composite molded article. This composite molded article includes a sheet polarizer, an adhesive, and a polycarbonate layer arranged in this order. The polycarbonate layer is prepared by injection molding. The sheet polarizer includes a polycarbonate (PC) protective layer, a polarizing film, and a polycarbonate stretched film. This composite molded article can be produced by a process including less steps and can be used as a polarizing lens for spectacle glasses as a result of polishing. The composite molded article is, however, poor in processability. This is because, when such a polarizing lens including a polycarbonate is processed into frame-less spectacle glasses by forming holes directly in the lens, the lens is susceptible to cracking or breaking. Polycarbonates may often undergo deformation upon injection molding. The resulting lenses containing a polycarbonate may be corroded when they are processed into spectacle glasses, because plasticizers, such as diethyl phthalate, bleed out and corrode the polycarbonate. In addition, more light-weight<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> optical lenses are demanded.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Documents <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US2002044352A"><text>US2002044352</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP1193044A"><text>EP1193044</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="EP1217397A"><text>EP1217397</text></patcit> disclose optical lenses comprising polyamide layers.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Under these circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide a functioning optical lens which is excellent in processability and chemical resistance, is resistant to distortion and color irregularity, and is light-weight, and a producing method thereof.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Another object of the present invention is to provide such a functioning optical lens further being resistant to blooming (whitening) and to provide a method of producing this functioning optical lens.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">After intensive investigations, the present inventors have found that a functioning optical lens may be easily and conveniently obtained by molding a polyamide layer onto a polyamide sheet layer constituting an optical sheet, and that the resulting functioning optical lens has excellent optical functions, improved processability and solvent resistance, and is light-weight.

With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a functioning optical lens includes an optical sheet A and a molded polyamide layer 3. The optical sheet A includes an optical film layer 1 and a polyamide sheet layer 2 arranged on or above one side of the optical film layer 1. The molded polyamide layer 3 is integrated with the polyamide sheet layer 2 constituting the optical sheet A as a result of thermal fusion.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The optical film layer 1 may be optionally selected from among films having a desired optical function. Examples of such films are antiglare films, dimming films, polarizing films, phase-contrast films, optical compensation films, brightness-improving films, optical waveguides, prism sheets, reflective sheets, and antireflection sheets. Preferred optical films herein are polarizing films and other optical films. Of such other optical films, antiglare films and dimming films are more preferred.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Materials for the optical film are not specifically limited, as long as they are thermally stable and chemically<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> resistant resins. Among them, optically transparent resins are preferred. Such resins include thermoplastic resins, thermosetting resins, and photo-curable resins, of which thermoplastic resins are often used. Among them, preferred are optically transparent thermoplastic resins such as poly(vinyl alcohol)s, acrylic resins, ester resins, styrenic resins, poly(vinyl chloride)s, polyamides, and polycarbonates, of which polyamides are more preferred. When an optical film mainly contains a polyamide, the resulting lens may be excellent in processability and chemical resistance and be light-weight. Of polyamides, those excellent in optical transparency, such as alicyclic polyamides, are preferably used so as to have further improved optical functions. The optical film may further include additives such as dimming materials, light absorbers such as ultraviolet absorbers, blue-light absorbers, and infrared absorbers, colorants, thermal stabilizers, photostabilizers, antioxidants, plasticizers, flame-retarders, antistatics, and viscosity modifiers. The optical film layer 1 may contain a single layer or plural layers including films having the same or different functions.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The optical film may be prepared by molding materials into a film typically by extrusion molding or casting, and, where necessary, subjecting the film to an appropriate treatment to impart or improve optical properties. The<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> treatment includes, for example, stretching, heating, coating, and embossing.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The antiglare films each include, for example, a base film of an optically transparent thermoplastic resin, and an antiglare layer. The antiglare layer serves to impart the function of preventing glare and structurally has convexes and concaves. Such a convex-concave structure may be formed typically by spraying of fine particles, embossing, or transferring. The antiglare layer can be formed as a layer having fine convexes and concaves, for example, by spraying droplets of an ink containing a thermosetting or photocurable resin.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The dimming films can be, for example, films molded by kneading optically transparent thermoplastic resins with dimming materials. Such dimming materials may be appropriately selected from among inorganic substances and organic substances known as materials for absorbing light at a specific wavelength. The dimming materials may also be, for example, after-mentioned substances showing photoreversibility.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The polarizing films can be prepared, for example, by doping uniaxially or biaxially stretched films with iodine or dichromatic dyes. Materials for the stretched films herein may include poly(vinyl alcohol)s (PVAs), poly(vinyl acetal)s, and poly(vinyl butyral)s. Of such stretched films, uniaxially stretched films are preferably used. The<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> stretched films may be oriented films.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The thickness of the optical film layer 1 is, for example, about 200 µm or less, generally about 5 to about 200 µm, and preferably about 10 to about 100 µm. If the thickness is less than 5 µm, desired optical properties may not be sufficiently obtained. If it exceeds 200 µm, the resulting lens may become difficult to handle and be disadvantages in weight and cost.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The polyamide sheet layer 2 and the molded polyamide layer 3 each mainly contain a polyamide. Examples of such polyamides include polycondensed products between diamine components and dicarboxylic acid components; and polycondensed products of lactams such as caprolactam. The diamine components include, for example, aliphatic diamines such as hexamethylenediamine and trimethylhexamethylenediamine; alicyclic diamines such as bis(p-aminocyclohexyl)methane, 3,3-dimethyl-4,4-diaminodicyclohexylmethane, and 3,3-dimethyl-4,4-diaminodicyclohexylmethane; and aromatic diamines such as m-xylyleneamine. The dicarboxylic acid components include, for example, aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as adipic acid and dodecanedioic acid; alicyclic dicarboxylic acids such as cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid; and aromatic dicarboxylic acids such as isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid. Each of materials for constituting the polyamide sheet layer can be used alone or in combination according to<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the type of the optical film layer. The materials may be optically transparent or opaque, but polyamides having excellent optical transparency are preferably used.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Highly optically transparent polyamides may be obtained using, for example, alicyclic polyamides. The term "alicyclic polyamides" herein means polyamides containing at least one of an alicyclic diamine and an alicyclic dicarboxylic acid as a main component. More preferred are alicyclic polyamides each containing an alicyclic diamine and an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid as main components. Representative examples of alicyclic polyamides are alicyclic polyamides represented by Formula (1).</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Such alicyclic polyamides may be commercially available as, for example, the product of Daicel-Degussa Ltd. under the trade name of "Trogamid CX7323", and the product of EMS-CHEMIE INC. under the trade name of "Grilamid TR-90".</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Polyamides for use herein may be either of crystalline polyamides and non-crystalline (amorphous) polyamides. Of polyamides, preferred are polyamides having a low crystallinity as well as microcrystalline polyamides with crystal size of smaller than the wavelength of light. Amorphous polyamides including amorphous polyamides and microcrystalline polyamides are preferably used in an embodiment of the present invention for their higher optical transparency. However, crystalline polyamides being slightly opaque, such as nylon 12 (polyamide 12), can also<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> be used.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Polyamides may each have a melting temperature of, for example, about 100°C to about 350°C, and preferably about 100°C to about 320°C. Among them, polyamides having crystallinity may have a melting temperature of, for example, about 150°C to about 300°C, preferably about 150°C to about 300°C, and more preferably about 180°C to about 280°C.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Polyamide resins generally have high Abbe numbers and are suitable as optical materials. The Abbe number of such a polyamide for use in an embodiment of the present invention is, for example, about 35 or more, e.g., about 35 to about 65, preferably about 40 or more, e.g., about 40 to about 65, more preferably about 45 or more, e.g., about 40 to about 60, and particularly preferably about 50 or more, e.g., about 50 to about 60. The refractive index of a polyamide can be appropriately selected according to the use of the optical lens and is, for example, about 1.1 to about 2.0, preferably about 1.2 to about 1.9, and more preferably about 1.3 to about 1.8. Materials having high Abbe numbers tend to have low refractive indexes. Polyamides, however, are high both in Abbe number and in refractive index and have desirable optical functions in good balance. A functioning optical lens according to an embodiment of the present invention includes the polyamide sheet layer 2 and molded resin layer 3 each including a polyamide having the above-mentioned properties and thereby has very excellent<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> optical properties.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Each of polyamides can be used alone or in combination in the polyamide sheet layer 2 and the molded polyamide layer 3. The two layers may include partially or fully identical polyamides or different polyamides. The polyamide sheet layer 2 and the molded polyamide layer 3 preferably each contain an alicyclic polyamide. The resulting optical lens may be excellent in optical transparency, in which the two layers can be directly fused with high adhesion.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The polyamide sheet layer 2 and the molded polyamide layer 3 may further include additives and other resin components such as thermoplastic resins within ranges not adversely affecting, for example, target optical properties and handleability of the resulting lens.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A polyamide sheet for constituting the polyamide sheet layer 2 may be formed, for example, by extrusion molding or casting. The polyamide sheet layer 2 comprises a uniaxially stretched polyamide sheet. By satisfying this, the resulting functioning optical lens may be prevented or suppressed from blooming (whitening). The blooming herein is a phenomenon that an optical sheet including a specific optical film undergoes blooming (or cross blooming, a cross opaque mark) after<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> bending.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The stretching is carried out, for example, by a roll technique, a tenter technique, or a tube technique.

In other words, the molded polyamide layer 3 is an unstretched resinous molded article. The polyamide composition has only to include a polyamide as a main component. The polyamide composition may include a polyamide or polyamides alone or may include a mixture of a polyamide or polyamides with other resins than polyamides, such as thermoplastic resins, and additives, within ranges not deteriorating advantages according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The molded polyamide layer 3 can be arranged according<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> to any procedure. For example, it may be directly fused with the optical film layer 1 or with the polyamide sheet layer 2. It is also acceptable that a molded polyamide layer 3 is previously molded and the resulting molded polyamide layer 3 is arranged over the optical film layer 1 or the polyamide sheet layer 2 with the interposition of, for example, an adhesive layer. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the molded polyamide layer 3 is preferably arranged on or over the polyamide sheet layer 2 and is more preferably directly fused with the polyamide sheet layer 2. According to this technique, the polyamide sheet layer 2 and the molded polyamide layer 3 can be directly fused with each other. In this case an extra resin sheet layer or an adhesive layer may not be used. This is because the sheet layer 2 and the molded layer 3 each include a polyamide as a main component and thereby have good affinity for each other. Accordingly, functioning optical lenses can be efficiently produced at low cost, because they can be produced through less steps. They are prevented, for example, from deterioration in optical functions due to an extra adhesive layer. The polyamide sheet layer 2 and the molded polyamide layer 3 can be integrated with high adhesion. Thus, the lenses may have excellent optical functions.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The molded polyamide layer 3 can be formed according to any forming or molding process. Examples of such molding<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> procedures are compression molding, transfer molding, extrusion molding, injection molding, and injection-compression molding. The molding or forming process may include the step of heating and melting a polyamide composition. The polyamide composition may be melted at temperatures of, for example, about 180°C to about 350°C, preferably about 200°C to about 330°C, and more preferably about 230°C to about 320°C. If the polyamide composition is melted at excessively low temperatures, it is difficult for the resulting melt to have such flowability as to be satisfactorily placed in a mold. In contrast, if the polyamide composition is melted at excessively high temperatures, the resin may deteriorate.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The thickness of the molded polyamide layer 3 may be selected within ranges not adversely affecting, for example, the handleability and optical functions.

If the content of the polyamide is less than 70 percent by weight, the lens may have insufficient processability and<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> chemical resistance and may not have a sufficiently light weight. The content of the polyamide to the total of the functioning optical lens means the ratio of the weight of polyamides contained in the polyamide sheet layer 2 and the molded polyamide layer 3 to the total weight of the functioning optical lens.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">A functioning optical lens according to an embodiment of the present invention is resistant to cracking, even when an opening or hole is directly formed therein, and is excellent in processability. This is because the sheet layer 2 and the molded resin layer 3 each contain a polyamide as a main component. A functioning optical lens according to an embodiment of the present invention is excellent in chemical resistance. This functioning optical lens is avoided from problems caused by contact with chemical substances, such as plasticizers. Such chemical substances are contained in other members used in combination with the functioning optical lens for constituting, for example, spectacle glasses. Such functioning optical lenses according to an embodiment of the present invention can be subjected to a variety of processing. In addition, they are excellent in chemical resistance and can be used in combination with other materials containing, for example, plasticizers. Consequently, they can be applied to a wide variety of uses and may have a sufficiently small weight.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Respective layers constituting functioning optical lenses may further contain additives according to necessity.

These optical functions may be imparted to functioning optical lenses, for example, by using optical sheets having corresponding optical functions. For example, a functioning optical lens can have an antiglare function by using an antiglare sheet, and can have a dimming function by using a dimming sheet. Functioning optical lenses having a dimming function include, for example, functioning optical lenses having photoreversibility.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Specifically, such photoreversible functioning optical lenses each contain a photoreversible compound added to at least one of respective layers constituting the functioning optical lenses. The photoreversible compound is not specifically limited and can be any one, as long as it is a substance having a structure varying depending on the wavelength of light and having a varying absorption spectrum.<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> Such photoreversible compounds include, for example, organic substances including photochromic compounds; inorganic substances such as rare-earth elements; and inorganic-organic composites such as organic complexes of inorganic substances.

A flat optical sheet C is heated to such a temperature that the optical sheet C can be molded. For example, the optical sheet C is heated to a temperature of about 130°C. The heated optical sheet C is placed in a bending mold X, and evacuation is carried out through a vacuum port P in the mold X to thereby mold the optical sheet C to be in accordance with the concave shape of the mold X. The bending may be carried out according to a conventional procedure for molding with heating, such as vacuum molding or compression molding. The bending is preferably carried out by vacuum molding.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The injection molding may be carried out by placing the optical sheet C after the bending step (I) in an injection-molding mold Y (Step (II)); placing a mold Z on the mold Y; heating and melting a resin composition for constituting a<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> molded polyamide layer 3 at temperatures of, for example, around 280°C; and injecting the molten resin composition into the mold Z through an injection port Q. By these steps, a polyamide composition can be integrally thermally fused with a polyamide sheet layer constituting an optical sheet, and a good molded article can be obtained even without using an adhesive. The molded polyamide layer 3 is arranged on a concave side (inner side) of the curved or bent optical sheet in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>. The layer configuration is, however, not limited to this, and the molded polyamide layer 3 may be arranged on a convex side (outer side) or on both sides of the optical sheet. The molded polyamide layer is preferably arranged on a concave side (inner side) of the optical sheet. Injection molding using a polycarbonate according to a technique in the related art, often invites distortion, and the distortion may lead to color irregularities such as interference fringe patterns. In contrast, according to an embodiment of the present invention using a polyamide composition, functioning optical lenses having excellent optical properties can be obtained while suppressing distortion caused as a result of injection molding and inhibiting color irregularities caused by distortion. Such an embodiment according to the present invention is advantageous particularly when a bent optical sheet C is used, because lenses having excellent optical functions can be obtained while suppressing distortion and<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> color irregularities according to this technique.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">According to a method of an embodiment of the present invention, a polyamide sheet layer of an optical sheet after bending can be easily, conveniently, and stably fused with a molded polyamide layer.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The resulting multilayer molded article may be subjected to processing on at least one of its sides.

The antifogging processing may be carried out typically by applying a hydrophilic resin. The soil resistant finish may be carried out typically by applying an organofluorine compound according to vacuum vapor deposition.
