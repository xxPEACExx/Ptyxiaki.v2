method, and, more particularly, a communication apparatus, a communication terminal apparatus and a scheduling method that are applied to a communication scheme using frequency scheduling.</p><heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In high-speed wireless transmission, it is important to improve efficiency of signal transmission using flexible transmission control that can accommodate various traffic. Traffic control techniques include time scheduling and frequency scheduling, and, for example, frequency scheduling in MC-CDMA (multi-carrier CDMA) is being studied.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In MC-CDMA, a base station selects subcarriers that have good channels based on channel quality information such as SINR (signal-to-interference plus noise ratio) which is reported from a plurality of communication terminal apparatuses and transmits data. Users use the subcarriers that have good channel states, and therefore communication at a low PER (packet error rate) is possible.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Methods for controlling resources taking into consideration a requirement for delay have also been proposed (for example, Patent Document 1). In such control methods, circuit-switching connections that accompany bandwidths capable of dynamic control are allocated to connections having strict requirements for a transmission delay. After resources are allocated to circuit-switching connections, resources are allocated from the unassigned resource pool to connections that have a high degree of allowance for a transmission delay.

A subset of M subcarriers is chosen from a larger set of N subcarriers available for communications on a link. As communications take place on the link, signal quality measurements on the subcarriers of the subset of M subcarriers and interference measurements on the subcarriers of the group of N subcarriers are periodically performed. These measurements are then used to reconfigure the subset of M subcarriers to reduce co-channel interference on the link.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO0249306A2"><text>WO 02/49306 A2</text></patcit> describes a method and apparatus for subcarrier selection for systems. According to this document, a method<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> for subcarrier for a system employing orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) comprises partitioning subcarriers into groups of at least one cluster of subcarriers, receiving an indication of a selection by the subscriber of one or more groups in the groups, and allocating at least one cluster in the one or more groups of clusters selected by the subcarrier for use in communication with the subscriber.</p><heading id="h0003">Disclosure of Invention</heading><heading id="h0004">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">In conventional apparatuses, however, the communication terminal apparatuses must report the channel quality information of all subcarriers to the base station apparatus during frequency scheduling, and therefore there is a problem that the amount of uplink control information increases and interference with other traffic increases. Conventional communication terminal apparatuses must also measure the channel quality for all subcarriers, and therefore there is a problem that current consumption increases due to signal processing for monitoring the channel. When conventional<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> apparatuses are assumed to apply resource control that takes into consideration a requirement for delay, users to which data allowing a delay is transmitted must continue to transmit control information just like users to which data not allowing a delay is transmitted, regardless of the lowered priority level of transmission allocation. Therefore, there is a problem that interference due to the transmission of control information increases and current consumption also increases due to the channel quality measurement.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a communication apparatus and a scheduling method that can reduce the amount of control information, minimize interference with other traffic, and also prevent increases in current consumption.</p><heading id="h0005">Means for Solving the Problem</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The communication apparatus of the present invention has a configuration including: a subcarrier selection section that selects subcarriers from a plurality of subcarriers within predetermined communication band; a channel quality measurement section that measures channel quality for the subcarriers selected by the subcarrier selection section; and a report section that reports channel quality information to a communicating party, the channel quality information being information of the channel quality for the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> subcarriers measured by the channel quality measurement section.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The scheduling method of the present invention includes the steps of: selecting subcarriers from a plurality of subcarriers within predetermined communication band; measuring channel quality for the selected subcarriers; reporting channel quality information to a communicating party, the channel quality information being information of the channel quality for the measured subcarriers; and selecting at the communicating party, subcarriers to which a transmission signal is allocated, based on the channel quality information.</p><heading id="h0006">Advantageous Effect of the Invention</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the present invention, it is possible to reduce the amount of control information, minimize interference with other traffic, and prevent increases in current consumption.</p><heading id="h0007">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG.1</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of a communication apparatus according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG.2</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of a base station apparatus according to Embodiment 1<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a sequence diagram showing the operation of the communication apparatus and the base station apparatus according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG.4</figref> shows the relationship between frequency and channel quality according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG.5</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of a communication apparatus according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG.6</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of a base station apparatus according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG.7</figref> is a sequence diagram showing the operation of the communication apparatus and the base station apparatus according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG.8</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of a communication apparatus according to Embodiment 3 of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG.9</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of a base station apparatus according to Embodiment 3 of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG.10</figref> is a sequence diagram showing the operation of the communication apparatus and the base station apparatus according to Embodiment 3 of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">FIG.11</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of a communication apparatus according to Embodiment 4 of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0012">FIG.12</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of a base station apparatus according to Embodiment 4 of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0013">FIG.13</figref> shows the relationship between frequency and channel quality according to Embodiment 4 of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0014">FIG.14</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of a communication apparatus according to Embodiment 5 of the present invention;
