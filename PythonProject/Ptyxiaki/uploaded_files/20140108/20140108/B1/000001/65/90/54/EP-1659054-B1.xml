Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a motorcycle fuel tank and more particularly relates to a motorcycle fuel tank made of aluminum or an aluminum alloy. A motorcycle fuel tank according to the preamble of claim 1 and the preamble of claim 2 is known from <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4449723A"><text>US 4 449 723 A</text></patcit>.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">To decrease the fuel consumption of a motorcycle or an automobile while improving its running performance, it is important to reduce the weight of its body as much as possible. The weight of a motorcycle or an automobile may be reduced by using a lighter weight material for its components. In the prior art, the majority of those components, including a frame, a chassis and so on, have been made of either iron or a steel containing iron. Recently, however, it was proposed that aluminum, having a smaller specific gravity than iron, be<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> used as a material for those components. The density of aluminum is about one-third of that of iron. Thus, if aluminum or an aluminum alloy were used as a material for the components, then the weight of a motorcycle or an automobile could be reduced significantly.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP8232789A"><text>8-232789</text></patcit> discloses a fuel tank made of aluminum or an aluminum alloy for use in cars. This fuel tank includes an upper casing and a lower casing, which are made by a drawing process and which are brazed together, thereby defining a box-shaped closed space.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, nobody has ever proposed a motorcycle fuel tank made of aluminum or an aluminum alloy. This is probably because a motorcycle fuel tank needs to meet a greater number of requirements than a car fuel tank and because it is not easy to obtain a fuel tank satisfying all of those requirements.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">More specifically, as to motorcycles, the fuel tank forms an integral part of the vehicle's appearance, and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> therefore, needs to have a beautiful shape of good design. Also, in assembling the components on the body, the motorcycle fuel tank has to be arranged within a limited space. For that reason, a motorcycle fuel tank normally has a complex shape and it is difficult to make a tank of such a complex shape of an aluminum alloy, which is a metal that is hard to form in a desired shape and bond together. Furthermore, a motorcycle is easily subject to the vibrations of the wheels on the road, the vibrations of the engine, and the heat of the engine, and therefore, its fuel tank should be sufficiently durable so as to be protected from those vibrations and the heat. Furthermore, to fix a fuel tank of such a complex shape onto the frame of a motorcycle, it is necessary to provide a fixing portion for the fuel tank. However, the motorcycle fuel tank has such a complex shape that it is usually hard to provide a fixing portion for the motorcycle fuel tank with high positioning accuracy. Besides, this fixing portion also needs to be durable so as to be protected from the vibrations and heat from the motorcycle.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to overcome the problems described above, preferred embodiments of the present invention provide a fuel tank that is made of either aluminum or an aluminum alloy and satisfies the requirements imposed on motorcycles.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Specifically, the present invention provides a fuel tank according to claim 1, a fuel tank according to claim 2 and a method according to claim 13.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A motorcycle fuel tank according to the present invention, as in claim 1, includes an upper shell and a lower shell including fixing portions.

It should be noted that the fitting portions of the fixing portions do not have to be through holes to pass the bolts. Alternatively, the fitting portions may also be pins, hooks or any other type of member that can be used to fix the fuel tank 200 onto the motorcycle body. Also, the fitting portions of the fixing portions may engage with the rear frame 104 or the main frame 102 directly or with any other member fixed on the motorcycle body.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Hereinafter, the structure of the fuel tank 200 will be described in detail. <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the fuel tank 200 as viewed from above the first set of fixing portions 208a and 208b (i.e., from the direction indicated by the arrow A in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>). <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the bottom of the fuel tank 200 (i.e., as viewed from the direction indicated by the arrow B in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>).<br/>

Thus, the upper and lower shells 202 and 204 may be made of metals with mutually different compositions which are carefully selected to fulfill their<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> specific functions and be shaped by their best possible forming methods.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">6</figref>, the upper shell 202 preferably has a partially notched dome shape, which is roughly obtained by dividing a spheroid into two along its major axis. The space S1 defined inside of the upper shell 202 preferably forms a majority of the inner space defined by the fuel tank 200. To reduce the weight of the fuel tank 200, the upper shell 202 is preferably made of either aluminum or an aluminum alloy. Also, the upper shell 202 is distinctly visible on the outside of the motorcycle as a part of its design and therefore is preferably painted. For that reason, the outer surface of the upper shell 202 is preferably smooth. As long as these requirements are satisfied, the upper shell 202 may be made by any method. However, the upper shell 202 is preferably formed by subjecting a plate material to a press forming process because a smooth outer surface can be obtained easily by such a method. Nevertheless, in making the upper shell 202 by a press forming process, it might be difficult to make the upper shell 202 out of a single aluminum or aluminum<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> alloy plate depending on the intended shape of the upper shell 202. In that case, a plurality of aluminum or aluminum alloy plates may be formed into their respective predetermined shapes by a press forming process and then welded or brazed together to make the upper shell 202. In this preferred embodiment, the upper sub-portions 202a and 202b, which are obtained by dividing the upper shell 202 in two on the plane of symmetry as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">6</figref>, are preferably formed by subjecting aluminum or aluminum alloy plates to a press forming process. Thereafter, the upper sub-portions 202a and 202b are preferably welded together at the bonding portion 242, thereby forming the upper shell 202. The aluminum or aluminum alloy plates may be welded together by an electric arc-welding process such as an MIG or TIG process, a laser welding process, an electron beam welding process, or any other suitable process. If the upper sub-portions 202a and 202b are brazed together, then an A1-Si based alloy may be used as a brazing alloy. To achieve an even higher bond strength, the upper sub-portions 202a and 202b are preferably welded together.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0053" num="0053">If the upper shell 202 is formed by bonding together the upper sub-portions 202a and 202b that are made of two aluminum or aluminum alloy plates by a press forming process, then the upper shell 202 may have an even more complex shape and the profile of the upper shell 202 may be designed even more freely. In addition, compared to a situation where the upper sub-portions 202a and 202b are made of a single plate, the magnitude of deformation during the press forming process can be reduced and the production yield can be increased. For example, an upper shell 202, of which the dome has recessed portions 202s and 202t as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">6</figref>, can be formed easily. In this shape, the rider of the motorcycle 100 can sandwich the fuel tank 200 between his or her legs more firmly by putting his or her thighs onto the recessed portions 202s and 202t. As a result, the rider can maintain a better posture while riding the motorcycle 100. The upper shell 202 may be composed of three or more sub-portions in view of these advantages.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">As described above, the upper shell 202 is preferably made of aluminum or an aluminum alloy to reduce the<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> weight of the fuel tank 200. When formed by a press forming process, the upper shell 202 is preferably made of Al (i.e., pure aluminum), an Al-Mg based alloy or an Al-Si-Mg based alloy considering the mechanical strength and processibility. Among other things, the larger the content of Si, the more easily the aluminum alloy cracks during the press forming process. Thus, an aluminum alloy with a small Si content is preferably used. More specifically, an Al-Mg based alloy including about 4 wt% to about 5 wt% of Mg or an Al-Si-Mg based alloy including at most about 1.2 wt% of Si and about 0.3 wt% to about 1.2 wt% of Mg is preferably used in one example of preferred embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Also, to further reduce the weight of the fuel tank 200, the upper shell 202 preferably has as small a thickness as possible. And the optimum thickness of the upper shell 202 is determined by taking the processibility and the mechanical strength required for the fuel tank into consideration. Specifically, the upper shell 202 preferably has a thickness of about 0.8 mm to about 2.4 mm. The reasons are as follows. If the upper shell 202 were thinner than about 0.8 mm, then<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> the upper shell 202 would not have sufficient mechanical strength. However, if the upper shell 202 were thicker than about 2.4 mm, then the weight of the aluminum fuel tank would not be significantly lighter than that of a conventional iron fuel tank.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Next, the lower shell 204 will be described. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>, the lower shell 204 preferably includes a lower shell body 203, the first set of fixing portions 208a, 208b and the second set of fixing portions 206a, 206b.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The lower shell 204 is bonded to the upper shell 202 preferably by welding or brazing, and defines a fuel storage space in cooperation with the upper shell 202. More specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, the lower shell body 203 preferably includes a bottom 203b and a rear side surface 203r, a right side surface 203s and a left side surface 203t that extend upward from around the bottom 203b as indicated by an arrow A and are continuous with each other so as to form a curve. Also, the bottom 203b is preferably raised gently at the front portion 203b' so as to face the rear side surface<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> 203r. The outer periphery of the front portion 203b' extends slightly downward (i.e., in the opposite direction to the rear, right and left side surfaces 203r, 203s and 203t) as indicated by an arrow B, thereby defining a right side surface 203s' and a left side surface 203t'. The right side surfaces 203s and 203s' change their rising directions at a position 203e. In the same way, the left side surfaces 203t and 203t' change their rising directions at a position 203f. A space S2 is defined by the rear, right and left side surfaces 203r, 203s and 203t and a portion of the bottom 203b surrounded by these side surfaces.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">As will be described in detail later, these portions of the lower shell 204 are preferably formed integrally by a casting process. Thus, even though the lower shell 204 has a complex structure in which the rear, right and left side surfaces 203r, 203s and 203t are raised to define the deep space S2, the lower shell 204 can still be formed relatively easily compared to the situation where the lower shell 204 is formed by a press forming process. Accordingly, the volume of the space S2 can be adjusted arbitrarily by changing the<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> heights of the rear, right and left side surfaces 203r, 203s and 203t. For example, the dimensions of the space S2 can be set by adjusting the shapes of the rear, right and left side surfaces 203r, 203s and 203t according to the structure of the main frame 102 and rear frame 104 and the arrangement of the engine 108 in the motorcycle 100. As a result, the fuel tank 200 can effectively use the space S2.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In addition, the bottom 203b and the rear, right and left side surfaces 203r, 203s and 203t that surround the space S2 will be located on the bottom and support the fuel in the fuel tank 200 when the fuel tank 200 is attached to the motorcycle 100. For that reason, if those portions surrounding the space S2 are formed integrally by a casting process, the portion of the fuel tank 200 that receives significant force will have increased mechanical strength.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, a pair of holes 212 and a fuel supply port 210 are preferably cut through the bottom 203b in the area surrounded by the rear, right and left side surfaces 203r, 203s and 203t of the bottom 203b. The fuel supply port 210 is preferably connected to the fuel intake port of the<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> upper shell 202 by way of a pipe (not shown). Meanwhile, the holes 212 are preferably used as a drain for exhausting water, which would otherwise be reserved under the fuel injection port of the fuel tank 200, without affecting the appearance and an air hole for introducing air into the fuel tank 200 through a check valve of the fuel injection port, respectively. The fuel supply port 210 preferably has an opening 210h and a flange 210f surrounding the opening 210h. A fuel pump unit (not shown) is preferably inserted into the fuel tank 200 through the opening 210h and may be fixed onto the fuel tank 200 by screwing the flange 210f to a bracket, for example.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">By forming the fuel supply port 210 as an integral part of the lower shell 204, there is preferably no gap between the fuel supply port and the fuel tank. Also, since the bottom 203b is located close to the engine, the bottom 203b may have a high temperature due to the heat transmitted from the engine. For that reason, if a separate fuel supply port were attached to the fuel tank, then the flange of the fuel supply port might be deformed under the heat or the<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> degree of sealing might decrease due to a difference in, thermal expansion coefficient. In contrast, these potential situations can be avoided by forming the fuel supply port 210 as an integral part of the lower shell 204.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">The first set of fixing portions 208a and 208b are preferably formed seamlessly and integrally with the rear side surface 203r. The first set of fixing portions 208a and 208b are preferably connected together with a rib 208c that is provided seamlessly and integrally for the rear side surface 203r. Meanwhile, the second set of fixing portions 206a and 206b are preferably provided seamlessly and integrally on two opposing sides on the outer periphery of the bottom 203b so as to extend from the right and left side surfaces 203s' and 203t', respectively.

By using the rib 208c and this concave curved cross section, the first set of fixing portions 208a and 208b can be strongly connected to the rear side surface 203r of the lower shell 204. Also, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, the rear side surface 203r is arranged so as to rise from the bottom 203b along with the right and left side surfaces 203s and 203t. Therefore, the rear side surface 203r itself is firmly connected to the lower shell body 203 of the lower shell 204. Consequently, the first set of fixing portions 208a and 208b are connected to the lower shell body 203 of the lower shell 204 with high mechanical strength.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a cross section of a portion of the fuel tank 200 where the second set of fixing portions 206a and 206b are provided.

Among other things, a die casting process is preferably used because the lower shell 204 can be formed highly accurately by this process. Also, the lower shell 204 is preferably made of an aluminum alloy to reduce the weight thereof and is more preferably made of an aluminum alloy with a composition that makes the viscosity of its molten alloy low enough to achieve a smooth melt flow during the casting process. Besides, the lower shell 204 also needs to have sufficiently high mechanical strength. Examples of preferred aluminum alloys with these properties include Al-Si based alloys, Al-Si-Mg based alloys, and Al-Si-Cu based alloys. Among other things, an Al-Si-Mg based alloy including about 0.3 wt% of Mg and about 10 wt% of Si is particularly preferred. In that case, since a lot of Si is used, the melted alloy should flow smoothly during the casting process.<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> In addition, since the lower shell 204 has a higher Si content than the upper shell 202, the lower shell 204 is harder than the upper shell 202.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Also, to further reduce the weight of the fuel tank 200, the lower shell 204 preferably has as small a thickness as possible. And the optimum thickness of the lower shell 204 is determined by taking the processibility and the mechanical strength required for the fuel tank into consideration. Specifically, the lower shell 204 preferably has a thickness of about 1.0 mm to about 2.4 mm. The reasons are as follows. If the lower shell 204 were thinner than about 1.0 mm, then it would be difficult to form the lower shell 204 by a die casting process. However, if the lower shell 204 were thicker than about 2.4 mm, then the weight of the aluminum fuel tank would not be significantly lighter than that of a conventional iron fuel tank. In addition, the lower shell 204 includes the fixing portions and receives greater forces than the upper shell 202. Thus, the lower shell 204 is preferably thicker than the upper shell 202.<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --></p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The fuel tank 200 is preferably obtained by bonding together the upper and lower shells 202 and 204 having the above-described features.

The upper and lower shells 202 and 204 may be welded together by an electric arc-welding process such as an MIG or TIG process, a laser welding process, an electron beam welding process, or any other suitable process. If the upper and lower shells 202 and 204 are brazed together, then an Al-Si based alloy is preferably used as a brazing alloy. To achieve an even higher bond strength, the upper and lower shells 202 and 204 are preferably welded together. As described above, the harder lower shell 204 is located inside of the upper shell 202, and therefore, the upper and lower shells 202 and 204 can be held firmly during the bonding process. That is to say, the bonding process can be carried<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> out easily. In addition, since the respective side surfaces of the lower shell 204 are covered with the upper shell 202, their bonding portions make a plane contact with each other.

Thus, if the upper and lower shells 202 and 204 are made of metals with mutually different compositions, which are carefully selected to fulfill their specific functions and be shaped by the best possible forming methods and subsequently bonded together, then a lot of requirements imposed on motorcycle fuel tanks can be satisfied by the fuel tank 200 as a whole.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">The upper shell 202 needs to have a beautiful shape and a smooth surface that should improve the appearance of the motorcycle 100.

Also, if the upper shell 202<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> needs to have a complex shape, then a plurality of expandable materials may be formed into their respective predetermined shapes and then the resulting pieces may be welded or brazed together.

For that reason, the lower shell, including the fixing portions, is preferably made of a cast material. More specifically, the first and second sets of fixing portions 208a, 208b and 206a, 206b of the lower shell 204 are preferably formed integrally with the lower shell body 203 by a casting process. As a result, the first and second sets of fixing portions 208a, 208b and 206a, 206b can be arranged on the lower shell body 203 with high positional accuracy and can be connected to the lower shell body 203 with high mechanical strength. In a motorcycle, the frames are easily subject to vibrations of the wheels on the road and vibrations of the engine. In addition, as the motorcycle is<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> accelerated or decelerated, the fuel stored in the fuel tank is constantly moving and exerting forces on the fuel tank opposite to the direction in which the motorcycle is accelerated or decelerated. Furthermore, these forces are produced repeatedly.

Thus, it is difficult to position with high accuracy or to weld them together with the positional relationship maintained. Besides, in welding the fixing portions, it might be difficult, or at least take some time, to see if the welding process has been done properly. Thus, sufficient reliability cannot be guaranteed in this welding process. Furthermore, due to the heat generated by the welding process, the aluminum alloy of the lower shell body or the fixing portions may have a degraded property, have a decreased strength, or be deformed.
