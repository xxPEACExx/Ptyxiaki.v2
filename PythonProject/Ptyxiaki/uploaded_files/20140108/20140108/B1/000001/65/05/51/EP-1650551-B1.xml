load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0002">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a biochip reader and, in particular, to a biochip reader using light from a coherent source such as laser as excitation light.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view illustrating the principle and configuration of a biochip reader. This figure is based on the confocal optical system, mentioned on <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>pages 132 and 133 of "Application of confocal laser microscopes to medicine and biology," New Optical Microscopes, Vol. II, published by Gakusai Kikaku (which means "Interdisciplinary Planning") Co. , Ltd. on March 28, 1995</text></nplcit>. In a biochip reader based on such a schematic view illustrating its principle and configuration, laser light from light source 1 emitted through pinholes provided in pinhole plate 2 is incident to objective lens 5 after being collimated by lens 3 and transmitted through dichroic mirror 4. Objective lens 5 condenses this excitation light and irradiates sample (biochip) 6.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The fluorescent substances stuck to genes on biochip 6 emit fluorescence by being excited with excitation light. This fluorescence is reflected by dichroic mirror 4 after passing through objective lens 5 and then concentrated by condenser lens 7 and forms image on the plane<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> of pinhole plate 8. These images are the fluorescence images of genes on sample 6 and are detected by detector 9.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">To observe the fluorescence image of sample 6 surface (two-dimensional image), it is necessary to scan the sample 6 surface with excitation light. In this case, normally, the excitation light is not scanned but the stage on which sample 6 is placed (not shown in the figure) is scanned in the direction perpendicular to the optical axis (called stage scan).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In such a biochip reader, laser light is used as the light source because use of white light as a source causes a shortage of light quantity. In addition, employing the confocal type using pinholes not only prevents the detected image from being affected by dust stuck to the surface of sample 6, but also prevents speckle noise from being generated because the excitation light is emitted to the sample after being condensed.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, in such conventional biochip readers, there are problems that adjustment or conditioning of pinholes is troublesome and also this raises its cost. Furthermore, it is disadvantageous that the stage is required to be durable because it is moved for scanning and thus the cost of the stage becomes high.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Next, <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> shows another example of a schematic view of a conventional biochip reader illustrating its principle and configuration. Such a principle is, for example, mentioned on page 158 of "GFP and Bio-imaging," Experimental Chair in Post-genome Age,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> No. 3, a separate volume of Experimental Medicine, published by Yodosha Co., Ltd. on Oct. 25, 2000.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, excitation light from a parallel-light light source such as laser (not shown in the figure) is concentrated by condenser lens 7 and incident to objective lens 13 after being reflected by dichroic mirror 12. In this case, the excitation light forms an image in the position of focal length f of objective lens 13 and this image acts as the second source to be incident to objective lens 13.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Sample 6 is irradiated with the excitation light that has transmitted through objective lens 13. As a sample, for example, a DNA chip that contains DNA on a slide glass whose surface is flat, or the like is used. At each site 15 of the DNA chip, fluorescent substances with which the DNA is labeled emit fluorescence by being excited with excitation light. The fluorescence forms an image on detector 18 via the image forming optical system. In other words, the fluorescence is made parallel by objective lens 13 as shown with continuous lines, passes through dichroic mirror 12 and barrier filter 16, and is incident to lens 17. The image of sample 6 formed by lens 17 is detected by detector 18.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In this case, the behavior of the excitation light irradiating over the entire sample surface is as follows:</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Excitation light reflected at the flat sample surface shown with broken lines (this excitation light is called the reflected excitation light or the return excitation light) is focused by objective lens 13 and focused in the position of focal length f of objective lens 13.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> The excitation light is incident to detector 18 after passing through lens 17 whose intermediate image plane is set at this focal position.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In addition, the reflected excitation light is transmitted through dichroic mirror 12 and barrier filter 16 before passing through lens 17. Barrier filter 16 is formed to pass fluorescence but reject (attenuate) the reflected excitation light and thus the reflected excitation light mixed into detector 18 as background light is reduced by being passed through this barrier filter 16.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">However, in such conventional microscopes, the reflected excitation light cannot be sufficiently reduced although it is attenuated with the barrier filter. Although background light must be reduced to approximately 10<sup>-9</sup> of the fluorescence to be detected in the measurement of fluorescent molecules or the like, there is a problem that an attenuation factor (ratio of exit light intensity to incident light intensity) of only about 10<sup>-7</sup> can be obtained in this reader. Thus, the attenuation is clearly not sufficient.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Further, <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic view of the biochip reader using a microlens array system illustrating its principle and configuration, mentioned in the Japanese patent application No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2001002264A"><text>2001-2264</text></patcit> submitted by the applicant concerned. In <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, a plurality of microlenses ML is arranged on microlens array 21, and light that has passed through each microlens (excitation light) is emitted to sample 23 through dichroic mirror 22. Sample 23 is a biochip, into each of whose cells genes are poured, each cell being arranged at the same pitch as the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> above microlenses and thus spatially arranged so that excitation light from each microlens irradiates each cell respectively.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Fluorescent substances are stuck to each gene on the biochip and generate emission owing to irradiation of excitation light. The emitted fluorescence is reflected by dichroic mirror 22, incident to lens 25 through barrier filter 24, and forms an image on detector 26 (e.g. a camera). In such a manner, a fluorescence image of the biochip can be observed with camera 26.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In addition, barrier filter 24 acts to transmit fluorescence but reject excitation light, and thus the use of this filter can prevent the excitation light reflected by the surface of sample 23 from being incident to camera 26.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">However, in such conventional biochip readers, if shading (coneshaped light intensity distribution) is included in excitation light from the light source, non-uniformity is generated in read data. To prevent this, it is suggested to make the ratio α of the minimum value of light intensity to its maximum value 10 to 20%, by making the amount of shading small using only a center portion of the above conical intensity distribution as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>. However, there occurs another problem that much light is wasted (the light-utilizing efficiency deteriorates) because this method discards light in the peripheral portion.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Furthermore, if the expression of mRNA in a biochip is to be measured using cDNA, there are large differences in the amounts of expression, which causes problems such as cases where a 10- to 100-fold difference<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> exists as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4 (b)</figref> between the expression (signal intensity) of gene A and that of gene B shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4 (a)</figref>. That is, if the amount of expression is to be measured precisely without giving any change, analog-to-digital converters and amplifiers used in the detector must have wide dynamic ranges and high accuracy, and so are expensive. This is a problem.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In addition, there is another problem that, although there is a method to measure the amount of expression several times by changing the gains of analog-to-digital converters and amplifiers, this method takes time for measurement, and dispersion in measured values and discoloring of biochips also increase.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6172785B1"><text>US6172785B1</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO0101112A1"><text>WO01/01112A1</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO9807022A"><text>WO98/07022</text></patcit> disclose respective fluorescence readers, similar to the one disclosed in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> of the present application, which focus an excitation light on a sample.

In <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref>, numeral 31 shows a light source generating coherent light such as laser light (hereafter called "laser light") as excitation light, numeral 32 shows a lens converting<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> the laser light into parallel light and numeral 33, a microlens array. Microlens array 33 is mounted on rotation plate 34 and composed of a plurality of microlenses ML arranged on that plate.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Numeral 35 shows a motor for rotating rotation plate 34, numeral 36 a sample, numeral 37 a lens, numeral 38 a barrier filter, numeral 39 a condenser lens, and numeral 40 a camera using CCDs or the like as detector elements.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Laser light emitted from light source 31 is changed to parallel light by lens 32 and is incident to microlens array 33. Each microlens ML irradiates sample 36 respectively by condensing laser light. Sample 36 has a construction in which a plurality of cells is arranged in a two-dimensional manner and genes are poured into each cell.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">When rotation plate 34 is rotated with motor 35, excitation light beams focused with each microlens ML are scanned over sample 36. Microlenses ML are arranged on rotation plate 34, with the relation between spatial positions such that each excitation light beam can be scanned over each cell individually.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Fluorescence from each gene is incident to lens 39 through barrier filter 38 after being incident to lens 37. Barrier filter 38 acts to transmit fluorescence from sample 36 but reduces the incident excitation light passing through sample 36 and thus is used to reject background light for the sample image.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The sample image focused and formed by lens 39 is detected by detector elements (not shown in the figure) of camera 40.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Using such a configuration, a two-dimensional sample image can be<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> easily obtained by producing multi-beams using a plurality of microlenses and by scanning samples with those beams.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In addition, it is not necessary to employ a confocal reader as required in conventional readers, because dust stuck to samples can be drastically reduced by using cartridges or the like. However, an adequate quantity of excitation light is required. In the present example, since laser light is used as excitation light, a sufficient quantity of light at high luminance can be obtained.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Further, speckle noise is not generated in a sample image in the present example, because the excitation light is focused with microlenses. Furthermore, since pinholes as in the case in conventional readers are not used, readers based on the present example are easier to adjust. In addition, readers that are small, cheap and highly durable can be easily obtained because the moving mechanism to move a stage is not necessary.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 6</figref> shows a schematic view indicating the configuration of an essential part of another comparative example. Although the biochip reader shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref> is of the transmission type, the reader shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 6</figref> is of the reflection type.

For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 16</figref>, the excitation light is forced to have a light intensity pattern in which the intensity is strong at the center part and weak in the peripheral part. The light intensity pattern is arranged such that the ratio α of the lowest value to the highest value of light intensity I in the effective range R of that parallel light is about<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> 90%. The excitation light having such a light intensity distribution irradiates sample 23 in the same light intensity pattern via microlens array 21 and dichroic mirror 22.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">On the other hand, at sample 23, genes are arranged so that the expression distribution shows an inverted pattern from the intensity pattern of excitation light. This is done by arranging the genes with the higher expression genes placed in outer cells and the lower expression genes placed in inner cells, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 17</figref>.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">By placing the light intensity distribution of excitation light and the expression distribution of genes in a relationship as mentioned above, low and high expression genes, in other words, genes which produce little fluorescence or much fluorescence, are irradiated with strong and weak intensity excitation light respectively.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">As a result, even if there is a great difference in expressions, the difference in the fluorescence from each gene to be incident to the detector is small. Accordingly, analog-to-digital converters and amplifiers that are cheap and have moderate accuracy can be used in the detector because wide dynamic ranges and high accuracy are not required.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Further, the excitation light distribution is separately measured in advance and fluorescence from the sample is used by being corrected using the excitation light distribution.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">For example, if only a part of excitation light is<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> employed using light cutting or light reducing mask 100 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 18</figref>, the excitation light emitted to a biochip indicates the light intensity distribution shown in the figure. As described above, if a mask having the light cutting or light reducing pattern (also called "concentration pattern" here) is used, the degree of freedom in arranging genes on a biochip is greatly improved.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">In addition, the reader can also be configured so as to make shading of excitation light variable as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 19</figref>. In <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 19</figref>, the difference of the configuration from that shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 16</figref> is the zoom mechanism. Zoom mechanism 110 uses ordinary zoom lenses and produces a parallel light beam from the light source (not shown in the figure) to microlens array 21 after suitably expanding or contracting the light beam.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">If the beam is expanded with zoom mechanism 110, the light intensity distribution pattern of the excitation light emitted from the light source is extended transversely, and so the intensity distribution pattern of excitation light incident to microlens array 21 becomes flatter. On the contrary, if the light intensity distribution pattern is contracted, the incident excitation light distribution gives a steeper pattern.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Since shading varies with expansion or contraction as shown above, shading can be set arbitrarily corresponding to sample 23 by operating zoom mechanism 110.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Further, a configuration to detect a fluorescence image using a detector composed of detector elements having input-output<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> characteristics of a logarithmic relationship as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 20</figref> may be used without changing the light intensity distribution of excitation light or the arrangement of sample genes.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">According to such a configuration, even if there is a great difference in inputs (fluorescence quantities), saturation in analog-to-digital converters and amplifiers on the detector side can be prevented and so such converters and amplifiers do not need wide dynamic ranges and high accuracy.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">In accordance with the invention having the embodiments described above, even if there are great differences in the expressions of each gene on a biochip, wide dynamic ranges and high accuracy are not required for detectors. Thus, satisfactory sample images can be detected with a detector using analog-to-digital converters and amplifiers that are cheap and have moderate accuracy.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">Furthermore, since shading for light intensity distribution of the light source can be increased, obtaining a great increase in the efficiency of light quantity can also be intended.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56987312" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Biochip-Leser, der konfiguriert ist, um eine gesamte Oberfläche einer Probe, deren Oberfläche flach ist, mit Anregungslicht zu bestrahlen, um Fluoreszenzbilder auszubilden, die aus fluoreszenten Substanzen in der Probe erzeugt sind, wobei der Biochip-Leser aufweist:

<claim-text>deux sources de lumière (R, G) ;</claim-text>
<claim-text>une lentille (13) configurée pour amener la lumière provenant d'une source de lumière (G) à frapper la surface dudit échantillon de façon normale à celle-ci et la lumière provenant de l'autre source de lumière (R) à frapper la surface dudit échantillon selon un angle de rayonnement γ ;</claim-text>
<claim-text>deux filtres barrières (16, 16a) configurés pour transmettre la fluorescence provenant desdites substances fluorescentes, mais pour atténuer la lumière d'excitation réfléchie par ledit échantillon ou traversant celui-ci,</claim-text>
<claim-text>lesdits filtres barrières (16, 16a) étant agencés entre les lentilles de formation d'image (17, 17a) et les détecteurs (18) respectifs et immédiatement avant lesdits détecteurs (18, 18a),</claim-text>
<claim-text>ledit filtre barrière, recevant la lumière frappant la surface de l'échantillon selon un angle de rayonnement γ, étant agencé selon un angle γ par rapport à la surface d'échantillon plate,</claim-text>
<claim-text>lesdites lentilles de formation d'image (17, 17a) étant configurées pour transmettre la lumière d'excitation réfléchie par ledit échantillon ou traversant celui-ci de manière à ce qu'elle frappe les filtres barrières selon un angle d'incidence de ± 5 degrés ou moins.</claim-text></claim-text></claim></claims><drawings mxw-id="PDW16672714" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --><figure id="f0001" num="1,2"><img id="if0001" file="imgf0001.tif" wi="121" he="232" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --><figure id="f0002" num="3,4A,4B"><img id="if0002" file="imgf0002.tif" wi="125" he="207" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --><figure id="f0003" num="5,6"><img id="if0003" file="imgf0003.tif" wi="107" he="221" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --><figure id="f0004" num="7,8"><img id="if0004" file="imgf0004.tif" wi="116" he="220" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --><figure id="f0005" num="9"><img id="if0005" file="imgf0005.tif" wi="105" he="155" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --><figure id="f0006" num="10"><img id="if0006" file="imgf0006.tif" wi="109" he="139" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --><figure id="f0007" num="11,12,13"><img id="if0007" file="imgf0007.tif" wi="122" he="222" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --><figure id="f0008" num="14,15"><img id="if0008" file="imgf0008.tif" wi="110" he="233" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --><figure id="f0009" num="16,17"><img id="if0009" file="imgf0009.tif" wi="118" he="213" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --><figure id="f0010" num="18,19,20"><img id="if0010" file="imgf0010.tif" wi="158" he="233" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><copyright>User acknowledges that Fairview Research LLC and its third party providers retain all right, title and interest in and to this xml under applicable copyright laws.
