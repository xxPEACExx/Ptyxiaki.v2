For example, with respect to aerofoil vanes used in an aircraft it will be understood that those aerofoil vanes are generally formed with platforms at either end to allow mounting of the aerofoil within a compressor or other stage of the gas turbine engine. Unfortunately, these aerofoil vanes are subject to a number of loads including those as a result of flight operation, thermal cycling and turbulent airflows.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">An aerofoil vane typically has two curved surfaces, one concave and one convex. The vane cross-section from leading edge to trailing edge is wider in the middle than at the ends and where the two surfaces meet at the leading and trailing edges of the aerofoil there is a small radius of curvature and it will be understood that the material section of the aerofoil vane is very thin. However, from top to bottom the aerofoil vane may be narrower in the middle. If the aerofoil vane is mounted upon a very stiff platform then when the aerofoil vane flexes there is different distribution of stress and strain on the aerofoil vane. As a result of the curvature of the aerofoil vane, both front to back and as a result of flex motions it will be understood that there are relatively high deflections of the aerofoil vane leading edge and trailing edges of the vane near the ends of the vane where it meets the platform. As the leading and trailing edges of the aerofoil vane are relatively thin these high deflections can lead to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> concentrated stress/strain at the edges of the aerofoil resulting in fatigue failure. These problems are prevalent in both aerofoils made from metallic materials or composite materials but with composite vanes the stressing fatigue applied at the leading and trailing edges may lead to peeling of the composite ply materials in particular and in extreme cases, buckling of the edges.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">An example of a rotor blade system using composite materials is disclosed in United States patent No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4098559A"><text>4,098,559</text></patcit>, which shows a paired blade assembly having a core of continuous fibres running from the tip of one blade to the tip of the adjacent blade.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It will be understood that one approach to alleviating these fatigue problems at the leading and trailing edge of an aerofoil vane is to increase material thickness but such an approach has the detrimental effect of reducing the aero-efficiency of the vane which is disadvantageous with respect to gas turbine engines.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In accordance with the present invention there is provided an aerofoil vane component, a gas turbine engine and a vane assembly as set out in the claims.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:
<ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a schematic perspective view of an aerofoil vane typical of a component mounted upon a platform in accordance with the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> is a schematic plan view of a bottom end of an aerofoil vane component secured upon a platform in accordance with the present invention; and,</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 3</figref> is a schematic section view illustrating the structural configuration of pockets in a back up member part of a platform in accordance with the present invention.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Essentially the problem relates to the variation in the relative thickness of components when secured upon a stiff platform. The narrow cross-section of portions typical at the leading or trailing edges of an aerofoil vane are therefore susceptible to failure through fatigue in comparison with the generally much thicker middle portions of those vanes. Ideally, transfer of stress and strain in regions of the component where there are high stress/strain factors to areas of comparatively low stress/strain would be advantageous particularly if there is only a marginal affect on the load carrying capacity, stiffness and actual frequencies of the component. Clearly the stiffness and load carrying capacity are affected by the material as well as the form of platform whilst the natural frequencies of the material depend upon design shaping etc.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention a platform to which a component is secured is rendered more compliant in the regions of the component where there is a narrower cross-section. As indicated previously these narrower cross-sections in an aerofoil vane would be at the leading and trailing edges would be subject to relatively high deflections leading to concentration of stress and/or strain. Generally, a platform will be moulded or cast integrally or forged with the component. In such circumstances it is typical to add a back up member to further stiffen the platform necessary to achieve the desired stiffness and load carrying capacity for the component. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention this integrally formed platform as well as the back up member can be considered as a platform unit which through structural configuration provides that more flexible compliance in the regions of the platform adjacent to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> portions of the component having a thinner cross section compared to other parts.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">This structural configuration may be achieved by providing cut out pockets in the underside of the platform unit and typically through cut out sections from the back up member at positions below the portions of the components having a narrow cross section, that is to say in an aerofoil vane below the leading and trailing edges of that vane. Alternatively, the platform unit may have material below the portions of the component having a thinner cross-section, that is to say the leading and trailing edges of the vane, which is less stiff than the other parts of the platform unit and therefore provides more compliance in terms of ease of deflection to accommodate flexing in the component in comparison with the remainder of the platform unit.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The platform used in accordance with the present invention is achieved in the composite material manufacturing process. However, it will be understood that this composite may be an organic composite or a composite of metallic ply materials. In any event, as indicated above, components such as an aerofoil vane are manufactured with a thin integral platform as part of the manufacturing process. The composite material is folded in an appropriate way to create the component that is to say the aerofoil vane. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig 1</figref> illustrates such an aerofoil vane 1 and it shows how the end of the vane is joined into the platform - giving the relative proportion of material carried around the fillet. Thus, folded composite material 2 extends out into a platform about the periphery 3 of the component vane 1. In such circumstances the integral platform is normally reinforced as indicated above with a backing member which is independently formed and therefore can incorporate structural configuration as required and so<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> provides varying compliance in the platform unit comprising the thin platform formed integrally with the component and the back up member.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> the folding of the material 2 in order to form the component vane leads to a basic platform of uneven thickness. As can be seen the thickness 3 at the leading and trailing edges has a thinner cross-section and more central folded out cross-section 4. It will be appreciated that <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> depicts a component vane 1 with an edge or "footprint" defined by the line 5 but that this edge will extend outwards in order to form this integral platform. The footprint is the limit of the fillet radius on the join of vane to platform. The platform outside the "footprint" is that - inside of the 'footprint' it curves up gradually to meet the vane. This variation in thickness can in itself be a convenient means for ensuring local compliance of the platform at the leading and trailing edges 6, 7. However, this leads to an uneven surface on which to attach a back up member. In order to make the surface more even it is necessary to build the back up member with additional material. As an alternative to providing cut out windows or apertures in the back up member, the back up member may be structurally configured such that material with a lower stiffness is located below the narrower cross-section portions of the component.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">As can be seen the component vane cross-section 8 is formed from the folded material 2 and generally in order to create the curvature either side of the cross-section 8 that folded material 2 is thinner towards the leading and trailing edges 6, 7 in comparison with central waist portions 9 of the component vane 1. As indicated previously it is the thinning cross-section towards the leading and trailing edges 6, 7 which results in greater flexing and therefore fatigue ageing of these edges 6, 7<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> with resultant premature failure. By providing greater flexibility through compliance in the platform adjacent to the leading and trailing edges 6, 7 the component vane in these portions are able to accommodate greater flex defamation.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 2 and 3</figref> respectively depict a plan view and side cross-section of a component vane 21 formed and presented upon a platform 22. This platform 22 is schematically sectioned such that a central waist portion 22a has a full thickness whilst leading and trailing edge portions 22b have a partial thickness of material from which the vane 21 is formed. Further portions 22c do not include any part of the vane material. Thus, as indicated previously in order to provide a more even surface the portions 22b, 22c may be built up with material which increases the compliance of the platform 22 unit as a whole. However, as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 3</figref>, illustrating a cross-section along the centre line 23 depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> it will be noted that cut out windows 24 are provided beneath the leading edge 26 and trailing edge 27. As indicated previously these cut out windows 24 are formed in a backer member 25 secured to the bottom of the platform formed with the component vane 21. In such circumstances the relative rigidity of the platform unit comprising the platform 22 integrally formed with the vane 21 and the backer member 25 is retained for operational performance whilst enhanced compliant flexibility is achieved adjacent to the leading and trailing edges 26, 27. Such enhanced compliant flexibility accommodates the greater deflections expected in the relatively thin wall section leading and trailing edges 26, 27. This greater flexibility will reduce the stress/strain applied to the leading and trailing edges 26, 27.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In some circumstances open cut out windows 24 may be unacceptable in the operational environment of the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> platform. Thus, these windows 24 may be filled with a highly flexible and compliant foam or other material which essentially provides surface continuity for the back up member 25 of the platform unit comprising that back up member 25 and integral platform layer 22. The cut off windows 24 are shown as rectangular sections, but may be round, oval or other shapes without corners.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Organic matrix composite materials are better utilised with respect to the present invention than metallic components due to the reduced component weight but also such organic matrix composite components have increased problems with respect to stress and strain fatigue particularly at the leading and trailing edges and particularly those arising from local stiffness in the platform 22 at the interface with the leading and trailing edges 26, 27. These problems are particularly exacerbated when it is not possible to increase the radius of curvature of the leading and trailing edges 26, 27 as it would reduce gas flow efficiency. In such circumstances differential provision of differently structurally compliant zones in the platform presenting the component will allow achievement of the two objectives of stiff rigid presentation of the component such as an aerofoil vane whilst similarly allowing localised flexibility where expected deformations will be greatest, that it to say where wall section thickness is narrower.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As indicated above the present platform and component could be formed from organic matrix composite materials or may be achievable in metallic components. However, it may be difficult to provide the cut out windows described with cast components. Similarly, with respect to provision of different materials within the platform unit may be more readily achievable through a composite material type. However, that composite material type may comprise<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> organomatrix plys or two different metals or a solid metal with a metal foam or honeycomb foam component embedded in order to create the varying compliance necessary in accordance with the present invention.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56987276" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --><claim
