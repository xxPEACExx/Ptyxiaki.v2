Especially, a variety of precast polyacrylamide gels different in resolving power can be made easily by varying a gel recipe because the gels are substances synthesized artificially. Accordingly, it is possible to prepare in advance the precast gels differing diversely in separation characteristic or resolution from one another. The artificial gels, since much saving the labor and effort for analytic procedure and excellent in uniformity and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> reproducibility, have helped well the productivity and quality control in the fields stated earlier. The artificial gels obtained on mass-production methods are required the increased shelf-life in preservation on their supply.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Most of polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis used extensively for analytic technique of proteins in the fields of biochemistry and medicine are the system developed by Ornstein [<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>L. Ornstein, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 121, 321-349 (1964</text></nplcit>)] and Davis [<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>B.J. Davis, Ann. N.Y. Acad.

The gels have heretofore produced by the users or analysts in themselves or on themselves for private their use.<br/>
In particular, the Laemmli system is most extensively used, since the molecular weights of proteins can be simply presumed by adding sodium dodecyl sulfate, contracted to "SDS" hereinafter, to gels or electrophoresis electrode solutions. The Laemmli system consists of a gel buffer solution of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, contracted to "Tris" herein, which is partially neutralized with hydrochloric acid, and an electrophoresis electrode solution, or Laemmli's electrophoresis electrode solution using Tris and glycine salt. The gel buffer<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> solution in the system stated earlier, or Laemmli's gel buffer solution contains about 10-20mol% Tris partially neutralized to be adjusted to pH 8.8 with hydrochloric acid. At this pH of the Laemmli's gel buffer solution, however, amide groups are subjected to hydrolysis with time that has elapsed. As the hydrolysis of gels proceeds even under low temperatures, the polyacrylamide gels come to contain partially anionic groups. As a result, the migration distances of proteins are made less while electrophoretic patterns become vague, and therefore it is impossible to preserve the gels over a prolonged period.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The following discussions will present the electrophoresis of nucleic acids. Recently remarkable development of molecular biology has come to need the analysis and preparation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). The analysis of nucleic acids mostly depends on either the agarose electrophoresis separation process or the precast polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation process. As nucleic acids present strong negative charges in the neutral buffer solution while the mobility thereof depends on the molecular sieve effect of supportive matrix gels, either an about 0.3-2% agarose gel or an about 3.5-20% polyacrylamide gel is chiefly employed<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> depending on the size of nucleic acids undergoing analysis.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The agarose gel, because of having a larger pore size, is often used for analytic separation of macromolecular nucleic acids. There are many types of agarose gels, which differ from one another in electroosmosis, gel strength, melting point, and so on. Moreover, because the agarose gels are naturally occurring materials, the differences in quality are frequently seen every a lot of products even the same gels produced in the same facility. For purifying DNA by virtue of the agarose gel electrophoresis separation process, any other purification procedures such as the phenol extract, and so on must be considered because contamination with impurities in the agarose gels would inhibit enzyme activities of restriction enzymes, DNA polymerases, DNA synthetase, and so on.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In contrast, the polyacrylamide gels with relatively small pore size are useful for isolation and analysis of nucleic acids of medium and/or low molecular weight. Because the polyacrylamide gels are artificially synthetic products, they are very high in chemical purity, and thus involving no major problems seen in the agarose gels. Moreover, the polyacrylamide gels may be easily prepared in diverse types of gels,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> which are different in separation characteristics, depending on the desired gel recipe. Accordingly, it is possible to prepare in advance the precast gels differing diversely in separation characteristics from one another. The use of artificial gels mass-produced in advance in diverse separation characteristics, since much saving the labor and effort for analytic procedure and excellent in uniformity and reproducibility, will help well the productivity and quality control in the fields stated earlier. The artificial gels obtained on mass-production methods are required the increased shelf-life in preservation on their supply. The most common buffer system for using agarose and polyacrylamide as the gel material in the electrophoresis separation of DNA is a continuous buffer system of around pH 7.8 to 8.3, in which a gel buffer solution is equal in composition with an electrophoresis electrode solution: a tris-acetic acid buffer, contracted to "TAE" herein, which contains either ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, contracted to "EDTA" or disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate, contracted to "ETA"; a tris-boric acid buffer, abbreviated to "TBE"; and a tris-phosphoric acid, abbreviated to "TPE".</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As stated earlier, the precast gels manufactured<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> on mass-production methods must be able to maintain the long-lasting shelf-life in preservation throughout shipping and storage. Among the prior processes for manufacturing gels superior in shelf-life is a process for manufacturing a polyacrylamide gel having the increased shelf-life disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP4184163A"><text>184163/1992</text></patcit>, which involves a gel buffer solution composed of Tris, ampholyte and acid to be storable for a prolonged period without loss of performance and also expanded remarkably in molecular weight range applicable for analytical electrophoresis. The polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel produced by the process recited just above is available for analysis using Laemmli's electrophoresis electrode solution.<br/>
The polyacrylamide gel contains the ampholyte and has the pH of ranging from 4.0 to 7.5. In an example disclosed, the gel having a pH of ranging from 6.9 to 7.4 is produced, which is described to be stored under refrigeration for four months without variation in mobility of proteins.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The gel buffer solution is set high in neutralization rate of tris to depress the hydrolysis of the polyacrylamide gel, while added with the ampholyte to make gentle a variation in electric potential gradient neighboring a boundary between tris<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> strong acid salt part and tris weak acid salt part, thereby coming to exhibit the wide range in the fractionated molecular weight of species undergoing measurement, which is comparable to the gels fabricated using the Laemmli's electrophoresis electrode solution.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Nevertheless, most polyacrylamide gels containing a gel buffer solution of the pH range 6.9 to 7.4 begin to vary in electrophoretic mobility of proteins after more than five months in storage under refrigeration has gone by. Moreover, the polyacrylamide gel in the form of slab gel is apt to change in shape of gel, tending to dislocate the glass plates. This results in major problems of rendering handling procedure on the electrophoretic analysis worse, causing the cracking of the gels due to the dislocation of the glass plates, and so on. Although it will be speculated that the gels may be improved in shelf life with the gel buffer solution of pH 6.8 or less, such gels have disadvantages of time-consuming for electrophoretic migration and also reducing in the resolution. Thus, none could not have succeed in developing a polyacrylamide gel that can exhibit the wide range in the fractionated molecular weight of species undergoing measurement, which is comparable to the gels fabricated using the Laemmli's gel buffer solution.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In addition, Published Japanese translations of PCT international pulication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP9512907PCT"><text>512907/1997</text></patcit> discloses a buffer system for a long-lasting precast electrophoresis gel wherein separation occurs at neutral pH. The gel buffer solution in the buffer system contains a mono organic amine or substituted amine with a pH near neutrality, titrated with hydrochloric acid to a pH of between about pH 6 and about pH 7. The electrophoresis electrode solution in the buffer system recited above contains a zwitterion selected from the group of MOPS, MES, ACES, MOPSO, TES, HEPES and TAPSO, titrated to a pH of about pH 7 with sodium hydroxide or organic base. Both of the gel buffer solution and the electrophoresis electrode solution are kept at neutral pH and in doing so the polyacrylamide gel itself is less subject to hydrolysis while proteins are separated with remaining completely reduced. The electrophoresis gel system recited earlier is described to have the increased useful shelf-life up to twelve months.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Nevertheless, the buffer system disclosed in Published Japanese translations of PCT international pulication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP9512907PCT"><text>512907/1997</text></patcit> requires using any special molecule markers, or molecules of known molecular weights.

If the polyacrylamide precast gel may be used combined with the electrophoresis electrode solution available for the electrophoresis of proteins to separate analytically DNA, or used combined with the electrophoresis electrode solution commonly available for the electrophoresis of nucleic acids to separate analytically DNA, it will be expected to realize the electrophoretic analysis with efficiency at low costs.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO0067009A"><text>WO-A-00/67009</text></patcit> discloses mixed buffers in gel electrophoresis systems.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Disclosure of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">A primary object of the present invention to solve<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> the subject matter stated earlier is to provide a precast polyacrylamide gel that can be stored under refrigeration over more than six months with preserving the gel shape without loss of resolution of proteins, while coming to exhibit the wide range in the fractionated molecular weight of species undergoing measurement, which is comparable to the gels fabricated using the Laemmli's electrophoresis electrode solution.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A second object of the present invention to solve the subject matter stated earlier is to provide an electrophoresis method of separating and analyzing distinctly DNA by the use of a polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel storable under refrigeration over more than six months without loss of performance, together with an electrophoresis electrode solution availed commonly for the analytic separation of nucleic acids.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A third object of the present invention to solve the subject matter stated earlier is to provide an electrophoresis method of separating and analyzing distinctly DNA by the use of a polyacrylamide gel available for separation of proteins and storable under refrigeration over more than four months without loss of performance, together with an electrophoresis electrode solution for the analysis of proteins.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a precast polyacrylamide gel adapted for use in gel electrophoresis according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The precast polyacrylamide gel of the present invention can be stored under refrigeration for over six months without loss of resolution and gel configuration, and also exhibit the wide range in the fractionated molecular weight of species undergoing measurement, which is comparable to the gels fabricated using the Laemmli's electrophoresis electrode solution.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for fabricating a precast polyacrylamide gel suitable for electrophoresis according to claim 4.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to the process for fabricating a precast polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel as stated earlier, the improved precast polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel may be obtained with efficiency, which is increased in the useful shelf life where the gel can be stored for over six months without loss of resolution and gel configuration.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a use of the precast polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel according to claim 2 or claim 3.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The use of the precast polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel as stated just above makes it possible to realize the wide range in the fractionated molecular weight of species undergoing measurement, which is comparable to the gels fabricated using the Laemmli's gel electrophoresis electrode solution.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In a further another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an electrophoresis system for DNA according to any one of claims 5 to 11.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><heading id="h0004"><u>Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0024" num="0024">In accordance with the present invention, a gel adapted for use in analytic separation of proteins is provided, which is enhanced in the useful shelf-life thereof. The gel contains therein a buffer solution composed of Tris, glycine and at least one conjugate ampholyte, the Tris ranging in concentration in the gel from 0.07mol/litre to 0.2mol/litre, preferably from 0.08mol/litre to 0.1mol/litre. The limited concentration range recited above results in inclusion of leading ions enough in amount to ensure the electrophoresis time comparable to the gels fabricated using the Laemmli's gel buffer solution. With the Tris less in concentration in the gel than 0.07mpl/litre, the electrophoretic pattern becomes overall too vague to avail for the analytic separation of proteins. In contrast, even if the concentration of the Tris in the gel is over 0.2mol/litre, the concentration of the leading ion in the gel becomes too high, thereby prolonging the electrophoresis time, making the operational efficiency of the analysis worse.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The ampholyte is composed of glycine and at least one conjugate ampholyte that has the basic dissociation constant of 8.3 &lt; pKb &lt; 9.6, preferably 9.0 &lt; pKb &lt; 9.6. Only glycine by itself, especially when the gel buffer<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> solution is at pH 7 or less, can not realize the wide range in the fractionated molecular weight of species undergoing measurement, which is comparable to the gels fabricated using the Laemmli's gel buffer solution.<br/>
On the other hand, with the conjugate ampholyte of pKb &lt;8.3, the ampholyte is lower in pKb than the Tris, and for the sake of which the gel buffer solution is varied in pH to make the fractionated molecular weight range much broaden. In contrast, if the conjugate ampholyte is in the condition of pKb &gt; 9.6, the ampholyte exceeds the glycine in basic dissociation constant, making no contribution to helping ensure the gentle potential gradient. To cope with this, when the conjugate ampholyte is selected from the group of serine, tryptophane, phenylalanine, and so on satisfying 9.0 &lt; pKb &lt; 9.6, the ampholytes migrate consecutively towards the anode side to their respective positions on the basis of the pKb value, with the smallest pKb migrating to the position most neighboring the anode, so that the gentle potential gradient may be established in the gel. Thus, the precast polyacrylamide gel of the present invention succeeds in realizing the wide range in the fractionated molecular weight of species undergoing measurement, which is comparable to the gels fabricated<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> using the Laemmli's gel buffer solution.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to the present invention, the amount of the conjugate ampholytes added is from 0.1 to 30mol%, preferably from 1 to 20mol%, with respect to glycine. When the conjugate ampholyte added is less in amount than 0.1mol%, the precast polyacrylamide gel fails in realizing the wide range in the fractionated molecular weight of species undergoing measurement, which is comparable to the gels fabricated using the Laemmli's gel buffer solution. To the contrary, if the conjugate ampholyte is added over 30mol%, the electrophoretic image appearing on the gel becomes too vague to have the practical use.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The total concentration of the conjugate ampholyte and glycine is in the range of from 0.1mol/litre to 0.3mol/litre, preferably from 0.1 to 0.2mol/litre. Even when the ampholyte is either less than 0.1mol/litre or more than 0.3mol/litre, the electrophoretic pattern on the gel also becomes vague to be unavailable for practical use thereof.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The ampholytes used in the present invention preferably has the same number of anionic and cationic groups in a molecule. All the anionic and-cationic groups dissociate into ions in the gel buffer solution so that the ampholytes becomes electrical neutrality.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> At a pH higher than pKb, only the anionic groups dissociate while the cationic groups are less subject to the dissociation so that the ampholytes is charged negatively. Thus, it will be understood that the ampholytes behave substantially like weak monobasic acid.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The given pH of the gel buffer solution for the precast polyacrylamide gel of the present invention, the use and production thereof is adjusted to from 6.0 to 6.8, preferably at 6.3. When the buffer solution is above pH 6.8, the polyacrylamide is susceptible to hydrolysis, and thus can not be stored for a long period without loss of performance. In contrast, if the gel buffer solution is less than 6.0 in pH, the polyacrylamide gel may keep the increased shelf-life while the electrophoretic patterns of proteins are liable to become too vague to have the practical use. The polyacrylamide gel with the gel buffer solution adjusted to pH 6.8 can be stored under refrigeration over six months with no loss of performance. When controlled to just pH 6.3, the gels obtained are remarkably retarded in the rate of hydrolysis compared with the pH 6.8, because the pH 6.3 is near to the pH of the acrylamide itself. This makes it possible to store the gels for over a year with no change or<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> deterioration in gel shape and electrophoretic pattern due to acrylamide hydrolysis.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The use of the precast polyacrylamide gels according to the present invention is an analytic separation of proteins, which employs the electrophoresis electrode solution containing Tris and glycine, preferably containing Tris of 0.025mol/litre, glycine of 0.192mol/litre and SDS of 0.1% by weight.<br/>
The electrophoresis electrode solution, because of having the same composition found in the extensively used Laemmli's gel buffer solution, serves well for the analytic separation of proteins with inexpensive cost and efficiency. Selection of an ampholyte, for example MOPS rather than glycine for the electrophoresis electrode solution may also serve for the analytic separation of proteins. Nevertheless, the fractionated molecular weight range performed by the gel comes into broadening, compared with the gel fabricated using the Laemmli's gel buffer solution used extensively.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The precast polyacrylamide gel of the present invention may be produced in the same fashion as the production of the prior polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, excepting pH regulation and addition of ampholytes. For instance, N,N'-methylene bis-acrylamide, contracted to "BIS" herein, is among<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> the most extensively used water-soluble divinyl compounds, which are able to conjugate with the acrylamide for cross-linking the acrylamide. Any other suitable cross-linker may be utilized such as N,N'-diallyltartardiamide, which is a kind of the commonly available water-soluble divinyl compounds.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">An aqueous monomer solution used in the precast polyacrylamide gel of the present invention may include a water-soluble polymer such as agarose, polyacrylamide, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrorridone, polyethylene oxide, polymethyl vinylether and so on to endow the gel with elasticity and increase the gel strength. Alternatively, the monomer solution may be copolymerized with other monomers.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Copolymerization of monomers in the production of the precast polyacrylamide gel of the present invention takes place with radicals resulting from either polymerization initiator or exposure to any of ultraviolet light and ionizing radiation. The polymerization initiator is preferably, but limited to a polymerization initiator of redox system in which a peroxide such as ammonium persulfate, and so on is simultaneously used with a reducing agent such as N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine, contracted to TEMED herein, and so on. The peroxide and reducing<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> agent are used in the range of from 0.05 to 5% by weight/volume based on the total monomer.

The gel buffer solution without any one or more than two of ampholytes including glycine, when made acidic in pH, gets Tris to rise in neutralization rate, causing much more variation in the potential gradientat an area neighboring a boundary between the tris strong acid salt part and the tris weak acid salt part.
