In such a case, the mask may contain a circuit pattern corresponding to an individual layer of the IC, and this pattern can be imaged onto a target portion (e.g. comprising one or more dies) on a substrate (silicon wafer) that has been coated with a layer of radiation-sensitive material (resist). In general, a single wafer will contain a whole network of adjacent target portions that are successively irradiated via the projection system, one at a time. In one type of lithographic projection apparatus, each target portion is irradiated by exposing the entire mask pattern onto the target portion in one go; such an apparatus is commonly referred to as a wafer stepper. In an alternative apparatus, commonly referred to as a step-and-scan apparatus, each target portion is irradiated by progressively scanning the mask pattern under the projection beam in a given reference direction (the "scanning" direction) while synchronously scanning the substrate table parallel or anti-parallel to this direction. Since, in general, the projection system will have a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> magnification factor M (generally &lt; 1), the speed V at which the substrate table is scanned will be a factor M times that at which the mask table is scanned. More information with regard to lithographic devices as described herein can be gleaned, for example, from <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6046792A"><text>US 6,046,792</text></patcit>, incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In a manufacturing process using a lithographic projection apparatus, a mask pattern is imaged onto a substrate that is at least partially covered by a layer of radiation-sensitive material (resist). Prior to this imaging step, the substrate may undergo various procedures, such as priming, resist coating and a soft bake. After exposure, the substrate may be subjected to other procedures, such as a post-exposure bake (PEB), development, a hard bake and measurement/inspection of the imaged features. This array of procedures is used as a basis to pattern an individual layer of a device, <i>e.g</i>., an IC. Such a patterned layer may then undergo various processes such as etching, ion-implantation (doping), metallization, oxidation, chemo-mechanical polishing, etc., all intended to finish off an individual layer. If several layers are required, then the whole procedure, or a variant thereof, will have to be repeated for each new layer. Eventually, an array of devices will be present on the substrate (wafer). These devices are then separated from one another by a technique such as dicing or sawing, whence the individual devices can be mounted on a carrier, connected to pins, etc.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For the sake of simplicity, the projection system may hereinafter be referred to as the "lens"; however, this term should be broadly interpreted as encompassing various types of projection systems, including refractive optics, reflective optics, and catadioptric systems, for example. The radiation system may also include components operating according to any of these design types for directing, shaping or controlling the projection beam of radiation, and such components may also be referred to below, collectively or singularly, as a "lens". Further, the lithographic apparatus may be of a type having two or more substrate tables (and/or two or more mask tables). In such "multiple stage" devices the additional tables may be used in parallel, or preparatory steps may be carried out on one or more tables while one or more other tables are being used for exposures. Twin stage lithographic apparatus are described, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5969441A"><text>US 5,969,441</text></patcit>.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The photolithographic masks referred to above comprise geometric patterns corresponding to the circuit components to be integrated onto a silicon wafer. The patterns used to create such masks are generated utilizing CAD (computer-aided design) programs, this process often being referred to as EDA (electronic design automation). Most CAD programs follow a set of predetermined design rules in order to create functional masks. These rules are set by processing and design limitations. For example, design rules define the space tolerance between circuit devices (such as gates, capacitors, etc.) or interconnect lines, so as to ensure that the circuit devices or lines do not interact with one another in an undesirable way. The design rule limitations are typically referred to as "critical dimensions" (CD). A critical dimension of a circuit can be defined as the smallest width of a line or hole or the smallest space between two lines or two holes. Thus, the CD determines the overall size and density of the designed circuit.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Of course, one of the goals in integrated circuit fabrication is to faithfully reproduce the original circuit design on the wafer (via the mask). Another goal is to use as much of the semiconductor wafer real estate as possible. Even another goal is to optimize illumination and enhance the contrast of an image on a wafer. By increasing the overall process window (i.e., the ability to consistently print features having a specified CD regardless of whether or not the features are isolated or densely packed relative to adjacent features), one may be able to more easily accomplish each one of the goals.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Methods for optimizing the source illumination and mask patterns so as to improve the overall printing performance have been disclosed in the prior art. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP1239331A"><text>EP 1 239 331</text></patcit> discloses a method and apparatus for microlithography. The method and apparatus include optimizing illumination modes based on characteristics of a specific mask pattern. The illumination is optimized by determining an appropriate illumination mode based on diffraction orders of the reticle, and the autocorrelation of the projection optic. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP1530083A"><text>EP 1 530 083</text></patcit> discloses a model OPC based on eigen function decomposition of an aerial image expected to be produced by a mask pattern on a surface of a resist. With the eigen function decomposition method the aerial image intensity distribution around a point (x,y) is accurately described in the model. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO2004077154A"><text>WO 2004/077154</text></patcit> discloses systems and methods for improved lithographic printing with polarized light. In embodiments, polarized light (radially or tangentially polarized) is used to illuminate a phase-shift mask (PSM) and produce an exposure beam. One further method is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US6563566B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,563,566</text></patcit> to Rosenbluth et al. Specifically, Rosenbluth discloses a lithographic optimization system that alleges to perform an optimization of source illumination and mask patterns to improve the printing of a given mask pattern. The function of merit utilized by Rosenbluth for determining the optimal combination of the source/mask pattern is the aerial image log-slope at a number of pre-selected points along the border of the pattern geometry. The optimization algorithm appears based on the assumption that the printing of a lithographic pattern is solely determined by the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> set of diffraction orders collected in the imaging pupil, independent of their location in the pupil plane.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">While maximizing the aerial image log-slope at selected sampling locations in the pattern enhances the budget/tolerance for exposure variations, commonly referred to as the <i>exposure latitude</i> (EL), it does not help to increase the budget/tolerance for focus variations, commonly referred to as the <i>depth of focus</i> (DOF). Indeed, it is known that patterns that are optimized for EL under in-focus conditions (<i>i.e.,</i> at zero DOF) show complementary results compared to patterns that have been optimized for typical process conditions that accommodate for defocus variations. Another problem is the occurrence of uneven line printing; that is, the contrast at a point on the middle of a line is greater than the contrast at a point at an end of a line formed in a resist. It is therefore desirable to optimize illumination to print features with greater precision, so as to enhance EL.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Polarization, though present in most illuminations, is negligible for low numerical aperture (NA) systems because angles of incident at the resist are shallow. Therefore, any negative or positive affects from polarization are minimal. As alluded to above, photolithographic imaging is moving towards smaller and smaller feature sizes, as would be expected. One of many ways to obtain smaller features is to increase the NA. However, angles of incidence at the resist increase, thus enhancing the negative affects caused by polarization and lessening image contrast. It is therefore desirable to overcome these problems, especially in higher NA systems.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The disclosed concepts include a method of optimizing an illumination for a pattern to be formed in a surface of a substrate according to claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The above-described method may be implemented by a computer program product, comprising executable code transportable by at least one machine readable medium, wherein execution of the code by at least one programmable computer causes the at least one programmable computer to perform a sequence of steps for optimizing polarized illumination for a pattern to be formed in a surface of a substrate.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Yet another aspect of the disclosed concepts includes an apparatus for imaging a mask pattern on a target portion of a substrate using optimized polarized illumination for increasing process window according to claim 10.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The foregoing and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

to a photoresist layer improves as the numerical aperture (NA) of the optical system increases. With a higher resolution, higher process windows are possible. However, such systems are limited by diffraction through air. It has been found that higher NA's are achievable with application of water between the lens of the optical system and the photoresist layer on the wafer, often referred to immersion lithography. However, by increasing the NA of the optical system, negative effects of the electric field on the photoresist also increase. Thus, it is desirable to reduce negative effects of the electric field while maintaining a high NA. One way to reduce these negative electric field effects is to polarize the illumination. It has been found that polarized illumination enhances exposure latitude and process windows in dry systems as well.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">There are two types of polarization, each component being orthogonal to each other, often referred to in optics as "S polarization" and "P polarization." With S polarization, the electric field is always perpendicular to the direction of propagation of light. Because the light is always perpendicular to the direction of propagation, when two beams of light that have S polarization interfere, they will have very good contrast, as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. As for P polarization, the electric field is in the plane of propagation of light, and will cause a destructive interference which in some cases is preferred. As a<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> result, in higher NA systems, it is desirable to optimize S&amp;P polarization as much as possible.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Often polarization may be referred to as X &amp; Y polarization. Notwithstanding, the relationship between S&amp;P and X&amp;Y polarization is well known. P polarization corresponds to a direction that is normal to the mask feature (X direction for a mask feature oriented in the Y direction). S polarization corresponds to a direction that is parallel to the mask feature (Y direction for a mask feature oriented in the Y direction). Mathematically, P polarization is related to X and Y polarization by <i>p̂</i> = <i>x̂</i> cos φ + <i>ŷ</i> sin φ , and S polarization is related to X and Y polarization by <i>ŝ</i> = -<i>x̂</i> sin φ + <i>ŷ</i> cos φ, where φ = tan<sup>-1</sup> (B/α) and coordinates <i>α</i> and β may be defined.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref> illustrates an exemplary brick wall isolation microlithographic mask pattern, and <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1B</figref> illustrates an illuminator for imaging that pattern.

Any number of fragmentation points may be chosen for a given cell, and often depends on the complexity of the pattern.

Based on the calculations discussed above and the optimization constraints set, in Step 24 illumination point intensity and polarization states that maximize the minimum NILS are selected at each fragmentation point (x, y).

The maximum minimum NILS (<i>i.e</i>., the maximum point where slope is 0 or near 0) at each fragment point represents the maximum Exposure Latitude (EL). In other words, NILS is the measure of the image contrast. In an ideal environment, a NILS plot would accurately represent a cross-section of a feature, having vertical edges (slopes of infinity) and horizontal surfaces (slopes of 0).

Conversely, if a pattern is symmetric about one axis, only half of the illuminator needs to be analyzed.

However, in general, it may also be of a reflective type, for example (with a reflective mask). Alternatively, the apparatus may employ another kind of patterning means as an alternative to the use of a mask; examples include a programmable mirror array or LCD matrix.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The source LA (<i>e.g</i>., a mercury lamp or excimer laser) produces a beam of radiation. This beam is fed into an illumination system (illuminator) IL, either directly or after having traversed conditioning means, such as a beam expander Ex, for example. The illuminator IL may comprise adjusting means AM for setting the outer and/or inner radial extent (commonly referred to as σ-outer and σ-inner, respectively) of the intensity distribution in the beam. In addition, it will generally comprise various other components, such as an integrator IN and a condenser CO. In this way, the beam PB impinging on the mask MA has a desired uniformity and intensity distribution in its cross-section.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">It should be noted with regard to <figref idrefs="f0028">Fig. 28</figref> that the source LA may be within the housing of the lithographic projection apparatus (as is often the case when the source LA is a mercury lamp, for example), but that it may also be remote from the lithographic projection apparatus, the radiation beam that it produces being led into the apparatus (<i>e.g.</i>, with the aid of suitable directing mirrors); this latter scenario is often the case when the source LA is an excimer laser (<i>e.g.</i>, based on KrF, ArF or F<sub>2</sub> lasing). The current invention encompasses at least both of these scenarios.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">The beam PB subsequently intercepts the mask MA, which is held on a mask table MT. Having traversed the mask MA, the beam PB passes through the lens PL, which focuses the beam PB onto a target portion C of the substrate W. With the aid of the second positioning means (and interferometric measuring means IF), the substrate table WT can be moved accurately, <i>e.g</i>. so as to position different target portions C in the path of the beam PB. Similarly, the first positioning means can be used to accurately position the mask MA<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> with respect to the path of the beam PB, e.g., after mechanical retrieval of the mask MA from a mask library, or during a scan. In general, movement of the object tables MT, WT will be realized with the aid of a long-stroke module (coarse positioning) and a short-stroke module (fine positioning), which are not explicitly depicted in <figref idrefs="f0028">Fig. 28</figref>. However, in the case of a wafer stepper (as opposed to a step-and-scan tool) the mask table MT may just be connected to a short stroke actuator, or may be fixed.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The depicted tool can be used in two different modes:
<ul><li>In step mode, the mask table MT is kept essentially stationary, and an entire mask image is projected in one go (<i>i.e.,</i> a single "flash") onto a target portion C. The substrate table WT is then shifted in the x and/or y directions so that a different target portion C can be irradiated by the beam PB;</li><li>In scan mode, essentially the same scenario applies, except that a given target portion C is not exposed in a single "flash". Instead, the mask table MT is movable in a given direction (the so-called "scan direction", <i>e.g</i>., the y direction) with a speed v, so that the projection beam PB is caused to scan over a mask image; concurrently, the substrate table WT is simultaneously moved in the same or opposite direction at a speed <i>V</i> = <i>Mv</i>, in which <i>M</i> is the magnification of the lens PL (typically, <i>M =</i> 1/4 or 1/5). In this manner, a relatively large target portion C can be exposed, without having to compromise on resolution.</li></ul></p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The concepts disclosed herein may simulate or mathematically model any generic imaging system for imaging sub wavelength features, and may be especially useful with emerging imaging technologies capable of producing wavelengths of an increasingly smaller size. Emerging technologies already in use include EUV (extreme ultra violet) lithography that is capable of producing a 193nm wavelength with the use of a ArF laser, and even a 157nm wavelength with the use of a Fluorine laser. Moreover, EUV lithography is capable of producing wavelengths within a range of 20-5nm by using a synchrotron or by hitting a material (either solid or a plasma) with high energy electrons in order to produce photons within this range. Because most materials are absorptive within this range, illumination may be produced by reflective mirrors with a multi-stack of Molybdenum and Silicon. The multi-stack mirror has a 40 layer pairs of Molybdenum and Silicon where the thickness of each<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> layer is a quarter wavelength. Even smaller wavelengths may be produced with X-ray lithography. Typically, a synchrotron is used to produce an X-ray wavelength.
