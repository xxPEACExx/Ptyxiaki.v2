But this effect did not show relation to cell density, as did clonal inhibition. It is anticipated that dcted clonal inhibitors or stimulators also will be active against other diseases where cloning might be involved in the pathogenesis (e.g. atheromatosis). Finally, clonal stimulators might be detected by the same kind of tests as clonal inhibitors and the responsible agents might be carcinogenic. It is important to know if drugs, internal physiological and pathological substances, or pathological agents with such activity were generated in the body or might originate from food or other external sources.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">A basic assumption for the development of malignant tumours or its metastases is that they usually are developed from single cells that had to be cloned before developing a primary tumour or a metastasis and that inhibiting these processes should be beneficial.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The process of cloning is a "weak point" or a period in the life of a cell that has special needs. In cell culture the cloning procedure is facilitated by growth factors e.g. conditioned medium, insulin, insulin like growth factor, growth hormone, cytokines, serum extenders (e.g. Mito+) etc. in addition to serum (experiments number 3,25)</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">During organogenesis in the embryo, several cell clones are created. Later these clones develop organs that all together constitute the individual.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">When tumours arise later in life, also these are clones. New clones in a developed individual seem not to fit in among normal organs, and tumours with consequences ranging from none to lethal might be the result.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">With a drug that is able to decrease or stop cloning of normal cells or tumour cells, it should be possible to decrease or even abolish the development of malignant disease or metastases from primary tumours.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, it is important to be aware of, that if a drug only acts against cloning, growth of existing multi-cellular tumours don't need to be stopped since <u>no extra</u> cloning of these multi-cellular tumours is necessary for their further expansion.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Therefore, treatment of malignant growth using selective clonal inhibitors will only stop cells that were apart from each other, not multi-cellular tumours. The latter have to be removed or inactivated by irradiation or other conventional treatment. The cytostatic activity of clonal inhibitors, if any at all, will probably be much less than for regular cytostatics. Therefore, it is anticipated that it will be possible to continue the treatment over much longer time periods with selective clonal inhibitors that do not possess regular cytostatic activity. Continuous treatment of selected cancer patients might protect against recurrences in a way not possible with classical cytostatics.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Cancer patients expected to profit most on anti-clonal treatment are those being radically treated for a malignancy without known metastases or where detected metastases had been removed or otherwise neutralised. Statistically some of the conventionally and radically treated patients will get recurrences or metastases later. It is expected that use of the compounds of the invention will reduce or in some instances stop these recurrences.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Tumours with known rest tumour might also benefit, since the export of metastatic cells from the rest-tumour and local infiltration might be stopped. This will probably induce a more benign appearance of the disease.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Leukaemia with no solid tumours should be a good choice for treatment since collocation inhibition is expected to be small and development of resistance against chemotherapy reduced since new clones should be significantly reduced in number.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Treatment with the aim of reducing or stopping spread of metastatic cells might be desirable during conventional treatment. Otherwise conventional treatment might loose control of metastatic cells.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In persons with high risk of getting malignant tumours (e.g. familiar breast or colon cancer) suitable drugs detected by the method of the invention might probably have valuable prophylactic effect.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Arteriosclerosis has been shown to contain cloned cells either developed de novo or from previously cloned cells. Growth enhancers might be an important pathogenic<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> factor and it has been shown that stretching of cultured cells induced liberation of such (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Standley, PR et al (1999) Am J Physiol, 276, E697-705</text></nplcit>). Stretching of vascular cells might occur chiefly in the curves of thicker parts of coronary arteries (<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>E. Tjøtta, The distribution of Atheromatosis in the Coronary Arteries, J. Atheroscler. Res. 3 (1963) 253-261</text></nplcit>). These parts are also affected significantly more by atheromatosis than straight parts that probably were bended less. Thinner parts of the arteries were not affected by atheromatosis probably because bending will provide less local stretching of the wall. In addition mechanical factors and infections might increase inner pores of arteries witch resulting oozing inn of growth factors from serum. Experiments described later clearly show that growth factors increase the clonal growth of normal cells in agar (Experiments 3, 25).</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Moreover, recurrences of Herpes virus infections may be initiated by some local or general cell destruction as mediated through UV light, low temperature, menstruation etc. It is known that ultrasound and freezing and thawing can induce liberation of insulin like growth factor. Stretching of vascular cells can as well liberate this factor as indicated above. Therefore, Herpes simlex virus that has been found in the arterial wall, might "seek" the parts of the vessel where bending induces these factors and possibly participate in the local pathogenesis.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Bigger clones or atheromas will probably be hard to attack by said substances because of collocation inhibition since this inhibition of the reduction of clonal growth is shown also for normal cells in culture. Prophylactics probably are easier. Such therapy might prevent restenosis in connection with introducing stents, bypass operations or endarterectomies.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">For patients with familiar high-risk, specific prophylactics seem desirable. However, for the man in the street, prophylactic measures through food, vitamins or natural products as plant extracts seems better, but foregoing specific testing of such products is needed.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The sensitivity of individual malignant tumours might be tested in assays based on cloning. It is the inventor's view that the consequences of the findings in existing tests have not been interpreted correctly. An example of this is an article written by <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>David H. Kern and Carl A. Bertelsen in International Advances in Surgical Oncology 7:187-213 (1984</text></nplcit>); Present Status of Chemo sensitivity Assays. In this article four studies were summarised in Table II on page 198 with the following conclusion: <i>"It is evident from each of these studies that the assay is very accurate for predicting tumor resistance. However, the assay is only about 60% accurate for predicting tumor sensitivity to a given agent. "</i> The opinion of the inventor is that this discrepancy might have a special explanation. When a drug is testing positive for activity against a certain tumour, the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> result indicates that the drug is active as a clonal inhibitor since the test used was a test where clones were inhibited by the drug. The drug, however, does not need to be fully effective, or effective at all, against tumours having reached a multi-cellular stage. Only compounds possessing general anti-mitotic or other cytostatic activity in addition to clonal inhibition would be expected to be able to stop both post-clonal and clonal growth.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">However, when testing negatively in a clonal test, the result indicates no effect on cloning and no other anti-growth effect that may be effective against any stage in tumour development.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Therefore, a positive result in a clonal inhibitory test might mislead the oncologist to believe that the drug could be used also for treating tumours that are bigger than a certain maximum.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the following there will be presented data indicating that an inhibitor of cloning is more active when the cells are seeded at low density compared to higher density. Thus high collocation of cells seemed to inhibit the effect of clonal inhibitors and was called collocation inhibition of clonal inhibitors. It is supposed that the less the collocation inhibition of the clonal inhibitor is, the more toxic the substance would be for the body with its multicellular organs.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Further, data indicating inhibition of the initiation of cell migration or export of malignant cells to other locations in the body by candidate anti-cancer drugs is also included (Experiment 9).</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The method described herein comprises a three-phasic test for screening or testing the effect of drugs, potential drugs, food, food additives, toxins, potential toxins, pollutants, chemical compounds or physiological and pathological components from the body for specific inhibition or stimulation of clonal growth.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In prior art testing for drugs or potential drugs for anti-cancer effect only a single phasic test (e.g. <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Macpherson and Montagniers soft agar cloning technique, 1964, Virology, 23, 291-294</text></nplcit>) has been used for this purpose. It is the inventors opinion that said test is inaccurate and has in addition been misinterpreted. The three-phasic test will in contrast to prior art give more precise data of the expected clinical effect of the candidate drug that is tested. The data obtained from the method might indicate the optimal clinical stage for a particular drug and also give an indication of which drug would be optimal for a particular patient and if and how conventional treatment has to be included in the therapy.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">The present invention is based on the assumption that the easiest way to stop a malignant tumour would be to:
<ol><li>1. Stop the cloning that initiates tumour growth.</li><li>2. On a later stage to stop single cells outside an established tumour in a growth that is thought to be more or less clonal and would lead to local infiltration.</li><li>3. To stop the export of single cells from the primary tumour trough the vascular system.</li><li>4. In addition it is important to stop the establishment of single cells or groups of very few cells arriving in other organs before they settle as new metastatic clones.</li></ol></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">All these qualities of the malignant process might be attacked if there could be found a drug with the general ability to stop the cloning procedure without toxic effect on the organism or densely collocated cells.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">To detect such compounds a method has been established that is able to control the qualities of substances found by screening. This method might have many modifications.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The present invention comprises:
<ul><li>A method of selection and testing of drugs, potential drugs, food, food additives, toxins, potential toxins, components from physiological or pathological processes, chemical compounds including microbes, the outcome of physical effects (e.g. radioactivity or ultrasound) on the body, parts of the body or on said substances for specific anti-cloning or clonal stimulating effect, the said method comprises the following:
<ul><li>a clonal test to study the effect on cloning of said substances and;</li><li>a collocation inhibition test to study how increase of local cell concentration (increase of cell collocation) may decrease or abrogate the effect of said substances or physical effects on the process of cloning and on toxicity and;</li><li>tests for the ability of said substances or physical effects to influence the development of metastases in other ways than on cloning, e.g. on export of metastatic cells from a malignant tumour or location containing tumour cells.</li></ul></li></ul></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The present invention relates to the use of 4-OH-OPB for preparing a pharmaceutical preparation for the treatment of psoriasis or for the treatment or prophylactics of arteriosclerosis or cancer, with the provision that said cancer is not malignancies derived from CD4 lymphocytes and HIV related Kaposis sarcoma.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The present invention is based on the assumption that cloning is the "weak point" in the genesis of a malignant tumour or its metastases and that drugs can be selected in cell cultures when showing a sufficient inhibition of the process of cloning.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The export of metastatic cells from a tumour cell containing location is shown to be stopped by a clonal inhibitor, 4-OH-OPB. However, other collocated tumour cells did not inhibit this effect.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The method described herein is suitable for screening many substances and will probably make it possible to detect a number of non-toxic active inhibitors of cloning.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">After the candidate drug has been selected in tissue culture, there is also need for studying the toxic effects in cell culture, animals or man and to test the inhibiting potential on tumours and the effect on tumour cell spread in the body.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">With an effective clonal inhibition, the therapy of malignant tumours could probably be much more aggressive than before, since the chance of getting new metastases as a result, will be reduced or abolished. Instead of palliative measures, sub-radical tumour treatment could enter the scene since clonal inhibition and anti-migratory drug effects might be stopping the feared dissemination of malignant cells.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">After conventional radical cancer treatment, many patients will develop recurrences or distant metastases probably mostly from silent single tumour cells. Clonal inhibitors are expected to arrest such seeds. In the described experiments in mice, at least100000 tumour cells transplanted to peritoneum were stopped.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The other aspect of the test is to detect clonal stimulators. The inventor has shown the effect of some; insulin, conditioned medium, serum and Mito+ (experiment number 3). Clonal stimulation might well have carcinogenic properties or stimulate the development of atheromatosis and might therefore yield results of interest for development of new drugs, control of existing drugs, food, food additives, preserving agents, microbes and chemicals.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The results would also be of interest when studying physiological processes, body fluids in healthy individuals and people having a disease, especially during tumour disease and in infections. But also arteriosclerosis might depend on cloning of cells in the inner arterial wall. People with increased risk of getting tumours with genetic, environmental, toxic or physical aetiology and arteriosclerosis or other diseases that might be related to<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> cloning, could be studied with the aim of finding effective drugs among the detected compounds having effects against these pathological mechanisms.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Since metastases might arise from single cells, each of them represents a subclone. It is the experience of the inventor, after having done many cloning experiments, that nearly each new clone consists of cells that behave differently compared to the parent cell strain or other clones. It is expected that this would also happen in the body when the malignant disease progresses. To avoid such tumours consisting of a library of different properties, the production of new metastatic clones should be inhibited as indicated. This will probably also inhibit the development of therapy resistant clones. Then, if needed, conventional chemotherapy might be more effective.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Still conventional cancer treatment is considered necessary at the time of diagnosis since at the time of diagnosis the tumour will always be bigger than single cells or a few cells. But the indications for treatment, with the aim of curing the disease, might be widened since the clonal inhibitors might save those already having small metastases and inhibit export of new metastatic cells.

Shortly described: Mice were immunised with sheep red cells. At the same time subcutaneous injection with a clone inhibitor, e.g. 4-OH-OPB, was performed. After 5 days the spleen was squeezed and spleen-cells counted and mixed with agar medium, sheep red cells and complement. After a short time plaques appeared and were counted and per cent of total number of spleen cells was calculated. The treated mice showed a dose dependent inhibition of growth stimulation of antibody producing cells by 4-OH-OPB treatment (see experiment 10). The treated mice did not show any sign of immunological incompetence. Therefore, it is probable that it is only the reaction against the new immunogen that is affected. This is analogous to what happen in the organism when single tumour cells were injected into the peritoneum and all the other cells in the neighbourhood were unable to abrogate the clonal inhibition of 4-OH-OPB. Only cells of the same specificity seemed to be the «victim» of clonal inhibition even if lots of other B-lymphocytes are present, but with other specificities.

High local cell density at the injection site did not abrogate this effect against export of metastatic cells, and cell cultures indicate that only a short distance apart from heavily concentrated cell masses, the clonal inhibition of 4-OH-OPB is fully active (experiment 13).

The compound benzo(a)pyrene, a known carcinogen, gave results that may indicate that this is correct (experiment 26).

There is no good animal model for studying development of arteriosclerotic disease. The described in vitro tests might be a good<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> beginning. Screening compounds, body components, food, drugs or pollutants for possible effects would probably need a normal cell line, e.g. BHK21/c13. Since testing for possible stimulation of these cells in soft agar culture seems necessary, other stimulants should be used in minimal amounts in order to increase the sensitivity of the test.</p><p id="p0187" num="0187">Many cytotoxic agents have been used for treatment of malignant disease and some have been tested here.</p><p id="p0188" num="0188">Testing of food, food additives, preserving agents or stuff used for pleasure (e.g. tobacco) and pollutants has not jet been undertaken, but is probably important since such agents from the external milieu has been considered being the cause of many diseases.

The inventor has observed that liberation of growth factor(s) that stimulate(s) clonability from cells being frozen and thawed or exposed to ultra sound. Therefore, physical effects on cells may also influence the level of clonability. Since decrease of clonability is correlated to anti-cancer effect, the opposite, compounds stimulating clonal growth might stimulate carcinogenesis or development of metastases.</p><p id="p0191" num="0191">Clonal inhibitors are of interest in treatment or prophylaxis of several diseases or disorders. Inherited or phenotypic abnormalities might be detected before the development of disease (e.g. cancer). These substances or principles changing clonal growth might be of interest for reproductive or other physiology and embryology. Embryology and reproductive physiology since the<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> key processes are development of new clones , and normal physiology since changes in old age seems to create a better milieu for abnormal clonal growth After selecting compounds in culture, there is need for studying the toxic effects both in cultures, animals or man and to test the inhibiting potential on tumours and the effect on tumour cell spread in the body</p><p id="p0192" num="0192">The higher the "detoxifying" or "inactivating" collocation effect, the less toxic the substance is supposed to be for the body. Such substances having low toxicity could be expected to be used over long time periods preventing recurrences or metastatic growth, but not to inhibit tumours larger than a certain size.</p><p id="p0193" num="0193">Data from the testing of clonal inhibition, toxicity, inhibition of the anti-clonal growth effect by local collocation of tumour cells and the influence on metastatic cellular spread (see later) would be important when ranking substances tested. If, in addition, these results were compared with those previously examined and better known candidates, it might be possible to put up a priority list of candidates that should be examined further.</p><p id="p0194" num="0194">When testing candidate drugs for the treatment of a certain patient, the data from the clonal test together with the collocation inhibition test and, if possible, the effect on the development of metastases will probably indicate the expected clinical effect more precisely than clonal inhibition alone. These data might also indicate the optimal clinical stage for using a particular drug and the optimal drug for a particular patient.</p><p id="p0195" num="0195">Evaluation of the ability to reduce the export of metastatic cells also is vital for clinical use. An example of such test has been described using mice and Ehrlich carcinoma (experiment number 9). The indicated treatment is expected to reduce or eliminate the chance of metastatic spread during and after necessary conventional treatment, mainly surgery, irradiation or cytostatics. However, the growth is not expected to decrease if tumours were over a certain size. It is the inventor's opinion, however, that such tumours might behave more like benign tumours since treatment might stop secondary metastatic spread (experiment 9) and local infiltration (see experiment 13).</p><p id="p0196" num="0196">The animal experiments indicate that other cells in the animal with other phenotypes do not act as collocation inhibitors of the cloning inhibition of Ehrlich carcinoma cells. One of the test substances; 4-OH-OPB, a substance previously known to treat viral infections, seems to be fully active on tumour cells in the peritoneum of mice even when the cell mass of organs close to peritoneum far exceeds the cell mass of the injected tumour cells (experiments 7-8). Further, the whole immune<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> system seems not affected when treated with 4-OH-OPB, only the reaction against new intruders (experiment 10).</p><p id="p0197" num="0197">Further, Ehrlich ascites tumour in mice, is used as a good example of single tumour cells capable of developing malignant colonies after what is supposed to be cloning-like processes when seeded in peritoneum. When treated at the same time as being transplanted, before having chance of being cloned, these cells were inhibited easily and cannot be traced at the time when untreated control mice die with extensive involvement (experiment 7-8).</p><p id="p0198" num="0198">However, postponing treatment one day or more made the disease resistant for even several times higher doses than those that were able to cure the malignancy when treated immediately during transplantation (experiment number 8).</p><p id="p0199" num="0199">But the higher the dose of intraperitoneally injected 4-OH-OPB, the smaller the necessary number is of subcutaneously injected Ehrlich tumour cells that might induce tumour at the site of injection.</p><p id="p0200" num="0200">An inhibiting effect on a supposed metastatic migration of Ehrlich tumour cells by using 4-OH-OPB would explain these observations since untreated control developed ascites only, and no local tumours at the subcutaneous injection sites.</p><p id="p0201" num="0201">Therefore, there is at least two distinct effects of 4-OH-OPB, one is anti-clonal growth, the other is an anti-metastatic effect that seems to inhibit export of metastatic cells from the subcutaneously transplanted cell mass. Other collocated tumour cells inhibit the first of these, not the other. The inventor has shown that 4-OH-OPB inhibits growth and migration of cells coming from an area containing many transplanted tumour cells.</p><p id="p0202" num="0202">It has not previously been shown that the detected substance 4-OH-OPB has the ability to act as a selective inhibitor of clonal growth and an inhibitor of the export of metastatic cells. In the patent application No <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="GB0002513W"><text>PCT/GB00/02513</text></patcit> of by A-Viral ASA it is only expected that this compound (AV-1101) would inhibit or cure malignancies derived from CD4 lymphocytes and HIV related tumour Kaposis sarcoma.. Therefore, such malignancies are not included in this application.</p><p id="p0203" num="0203">The explanation of the experiments in mice are in accordance with experiments in cell cultures where even small colonies are much more resistant against treatment than single cells (experiment 6). It is assumed that during delay of 24 hours or more before starting treatment after transplantation of Ehrlich ascites in mice, some cells might have had the chance to start growing. This might have created places with new cells or colonies where collocation is able to suspend or significantly decrease the effect of the inhibitor of clonal growth.<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --></p><p id="p0204" num="0204">When injecting Ehrlich cells subcutaneously, the injected cells probably quickly started "travelling" to peritoneum. This migration seemed to be so effective that only peritoneum contained tumour cells after subcutaneously injecting such cells in the untreated control.</p><p id="p0205" num="0205">However, when treated with intra-peritoneal injections of the clonal inhibitor 4-OH-OPB, no spread of tumour cells from these subcutaneous injection sites were found in peritoneum.</p><p id="p0206" num="0206">Further, when testing inhibitors of tumours from individual patients, the results of clonal growth should be interpreted correctly and treatment instituted during and after removing or inactivating detectable tumours or metastases. There is hope of getting control of remaining single cell metastases after starting such treatment. Used in this way it is expected to be life saving in a number of patients. There is also a possibility that such treatment of inoperable tumours might inhibit or stop development of metastases.</p><p id="p0207" num="0207">Regarding spontaneous or induced tumours, prophylactics might be relevant when there is great risk of contracting the disease, e.g. familiar breast cancer or colon cancer.</p><p id="p0208" num="0208">A useful possibility for studying spontaneous tumours may be tests using animals developing tumours spontaneously (e.g. Dr. Reidar Eker's kidney tumour in rats). Also prevention or treatment of cancer in old cats or dogs would be interesting since it should be possible to obtain a sufficient number. However, candidate drugs for prophylactics of spontaneous tumours should preferably first be selected by using cultured normal cells being stimulated to be able to form colonies in soft agar (e.g. experiment number 6).</p><p id="p0209" num="0209">An evaluating system for anti-cancer drugs mentioned before comprises:

Our findings (experiment number 3) are in agreement with the report of Macpherson and Montagnier that only transformed cells could form colonies in soft agar.</p><p id="p0217" num="0217">However, many other cells probably are suitable in this test, and we need to mention some: malignant cells, normal cells, cell lines, transformed cells and cells from patient tumours or cells from the immune system (e.g. the spleen) being clonally selected after immunization (experiment number 10). The latter can also be detected or quantified using e.g. Jerne's classical test.</p><p id="p0218" num="0218">Other cloning techniques, e.g. cloning in fluid medium using micro-well plates are as well possible for the detection of clonal inhibitors.</p><p id="p0219" num="0219">Addition of other growth factors than insulin may be relevant, especially for normal cells growing in agar. Experimental testing of some examples has been described later (experiment 3 and 6).

Based on the theory that cloning is essential for development of cancer or its metastases, an increase of clonability by chemical compounds, physical effects, infectious agents etc. would indicate a possible carcinogenic effect and stimulation of the development of metastases and possibly influence on other pathological conditions where cloning might be part of the aetiology (e.g. atheromatosis).</p><heading id="h0075"><b><u>Collocation inhibition test</u></b></heading><p id="p0228" num="0228">The collocation inhibition test comprises;

Tumour cells harvested from ascitic mouse were mainly solitary. Transplanted to a new animal these cells will be distributed over large surfaces in the peritoneum and by the time of transplantation the cells do not have chance to form aggregates that might resist clonal inhibition due to collocation. However, when postponing the treatment for one day, clonal inhibition is not easy to obtain (experiment number 8). This is supposed to be caused by local increase in cell density or collocation caused by growth or aggregation or both. Also cell culture experiments indicate a decreased growth inhibition after having been growing before treatment or having been seeded more densely (experiment number 5 and 6).<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --></p><heading id="h0076"><b><u>Test for influencing the development of metastases</u></b></heading><p id="p0231" num="0231">The test for influencing the development of metastases comprises:

There are separate assays testing the effect of candidate drugs etc. on each of these stages:</p><p id="p0233" num="0233">This assay involves different numbers of Ehrlich carcinoma cells injected in six subcutaneous locations of mice that were treated by intraperitoneal injections of the compound tested, e.g. 4-OH-OPB (experiment number 9). The treatment was effective in stopping migration of tumour cells to peritoneum. The cells were probably arrested in the original subcutaneous location where the local cell concentration consequently became higher then that in untreated controls. When operating with different cell numbers in the different injection sites, the number of growing tumours indicated which cell number that is necessary for the development of tumours in treated or untreated animals.</p><p id="p0234" num="0234">The next test is the assay detecting the effect on clonal inhibition performed either in cell culture or in mice or in other animals if necessary.</p><p id="p0235" num="0235">The first test is preferably using tumour cells capable of generating metastases (e.g. Ehrlich carcinoma, experiment number 9) the other could also be using the same transplantable ascites tumour injected intraperitonally in mice treated with the compound under test, (e.g. the 4-OH-OPB, experiment number 7 and 8). In cell culture, the polyoma virus transformed BHK21c13 cell line S100T1 has been used as example (experiment number 2,4-6).</p><p id="p0236" num="0236">Each detected new compound having an effect on clonability in cell culture needs to be evaluated for the ability of collocated cells to inhibit or modify this effect. Collocation of cells seems not to affect the effect on the export of metastatic cells, only the effect on clonal growth.</p><p id="p0237" num="0237">Further, when testing individual patients for inhibitors of their own tumour cells, the results of clonal growth should be interpreted correctly and treatment instituted after or during removing or inactivating tumours or metastases that were too great for cytotoxic<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> treatment. There is hope of getting control of single cell metastases after starting the treatment. Used as indicated it is expected that this effect will be life saving in a number of patients.</p><p id="p0238" num="0238">Next, even with greater tumours that might be inoperable, the indicated treatment might reduce or stop the export of metastases since collocation do not seem to interfere with the effect on export of metastatic cells.</p><p id="p0239" num="0239">It has not previously been shown that the detected substance 4-OH-OPB has the ability to act as a selective clonal inhibitor and inhibitor of the export of metastatic cells.</p><p id="p0240" num="0240">The present invention comprises the use of the substance 4-OH-OPB that has been shown to stop growth of Ehrlich carcinoma cells transplanted to peritoneum of mice if the mice were treated immediately. Export of Ehrlich cells from the subcutaneous injection site is probably also stopped. The subcutaneous collocation of Ehrlich cells, however, had to be higher than a certain minimum in order to support local tumour growth in treated animals. To sustain the local collocation of relatively few injected tumour cells at a level where local growth was possible, quite high doses of 4-OH-OPB was needed. If the injected number of tumour cells was relatively low, even higher doses of 4-OH-OPB were necessary for the induction of local growth. That means that both cell number and concentration of 4-OH-OPB in tissues acts in the same way. The inventor believes that 4-OH-OPB increases local concentration of tumour cells because they no longer migrate or migrate less than before. Only if the local tumour cell concentration becomes higher than a certain minimum local tumour growth could start.</p><heading id="h0077"><b>The compounds that inhibit clonal growth</b></heading><p id="p0241" num="0241">The substances obtained by the described method can be used for pharmaceutical preparations for the treatment or prophylactics of cancer, arteriosclerosis, autoimmunity, and rejection of transplants or pathological processes related to the growth that might be initiated by radioactivity or other physical effects.</p><p id="p0242" num="0242">Regarding spontaneous or primary tumours, prophylactic measures might be relevant when there is great risk of contracting the disease, e.g. familiar cancer mamma or cancer of the colon.</p><p id="p0243" num="0243">Compounds that inhibit clonal growth should be tested to exclude a too strong inhibition of the immune system. The immune system is very much dependent on its ability to produce clones that were effective against new infections. The use of compounds<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --> inhibiting the growth of malignant clones might be important for prophylactics of cancer and inhibiting the development of metastases, but might also influence physiological processes negatively, e.g. natural cloning processes in the immune system and organogenesis in the foetus.</p><p id="p0244" num="0244">In order to examine the degree of diminishing cloning in the immune system, Jerne's test in mice may be suitable (Experiment 10). Sheep erythrocytes are injected into mice. A few days later cells from the spleen of the animals are studied. In experiment 10 the smallest dose was about 3.8 µM if 4-OH-OPB was solved in the extracellular fluid of the mouse. The smallest effective dose in experiment 8 was 0.37 µM in extracellular fluid and 4.7 µM in peritoneum. But there are indications that normal cells might tolerate higher doses than malignant cells. <i>Therefore, it is thought that effective tumour inhibiting doses of 4-OH-OPB probably will affect the clonability of antibody producing cells in the spleen under or shortly after primary immunisation moderately, about 2 logs.</i></p><p id="p0245" num="0245">Clonal inhibitors, however, might be dangerous for foetal development since the development of organs is based on clones.</p><p id="p0246" num="0246">The compound, 4-OH-OPB, that is not a classical cytostatic, was found by the described method dealing with detection of possible drugs suitable for cancer treatment or treatment of other diseases where cloning is a central part ofpathogenesis (e.g. arteriosclerosis). This compound might become a drug not previously being shown possessing said effect. 4-OH-OPB is probably less toxic than any cytostatic drug, but nevertheless capable of arresting tumour progression when the malignant process is in its most vulnerable period i.e. the process of cloning.</p><p id="p0247" num="0247">Since the process of cloning is considered more difficult for the cell to go through than regular cell growth assisted by collocated cells, it is assumed that in the body the initial cloning of a primary tumour and even the start of metastases or local infiltration from single or few cells is easier to inhibit than already cloned bigger tumours. However, export of cells from "bigger" tumours or a location rich in tumour cells might be inhibited by treatment. This effect is thought to induce a more benign behaviour of a malignant tumour and possibly a full change from malignant to benign growth.</p><heading id="h0078"><b><u>Discussion</u></b></heading><p id="p0248" num="0248">It is important to verify the anti-tumour effect in animals of compounds discovered by the method indicated above.

Also compounds with analogous chemical structure to 4-OH-OPB were thought having a chance to possess activity.

If this is true, a reduced export of cells would increase the number of cells in the primary injection site compared to untreated animals.

An other<!-- EPO <DP n="84"> --> important aspect is that spleen cells with other specificities seem not to be able to inhibit the effect. That was also the conclusion when injecting Ehrlich cells in peritoneum, a place with many other cells. The other abdominal cells seemed not to be able to abrogate the clonal inhibition of 4-OH-OPB.

The interpretation of this is probably not that each cell needed a certain amount 4-OH-OPB to be bound to postulated receptors of the cell forfull clonal inhibition, since in agar cultures seeded with cells in a concentration gradient, the colony inhibition was strongest in sparsely seeded areas.</i></p><p id="p0411" num="0411"><i>It is expected that within the same culture the availability of 4-OH-OPB should be equal for all cells.

But if such cells are gathered in follicles with many collocated cells of the same specificity it is expected that the effect would be abrogated just as in densely seeded areas of the agar or when tumour cells were collocated in clumps larger than a few cells. The treated animals do not show any sign of organ toxicity or destruction of the immune system or other organs.

Low concentration showed break through of clonal growth close to the sparsely<!-- EPO <DP n="149"> --> seeded limit in the right hand side of the picture. High concentration did not affect the densely seeded parts of the gradient, which might indicate a low toxicity for densely collocated cells. It is our opinion that these cells were analogous to most of the organs in the organism and would indicate organ toxicity in the body. However, after storing 4-OH-OPB solved in DMSO in the refrigerator, a cytotoxic effect had occasionally been observed of high concentrations added to densely seeded S100T1 cells.
