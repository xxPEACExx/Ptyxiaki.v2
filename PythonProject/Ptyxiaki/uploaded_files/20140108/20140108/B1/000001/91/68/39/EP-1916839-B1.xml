This digital camera has a moving picture photographing function in addition to a normal still picture photographing function, and has a CCD 1, an A/D converter 2, a timing generator (TG) 3, a driving circuit 4, a image signal processing section 5, a JPEG converter 6, an MPEG converter 7, an SDRAM 8, and a display section 9.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Due to the CCD 1 being driven by the driving circuit 4 on the basis of a timing signal transmitted from the timing generator 3, the CCD 1 photoelectrically converts an optical image of an object which has been incident via an optical system (not shown), and outputs image pickup signals of one screen at given intervals. The A/D converter 2 converts the analog image pickup signals outputted by the CCD 1 into digital image signals. The converted image pickup signals are transmitted to the image signal processing section 5 via the timing generator 3.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a photographing stand-by state in a still picture photographing mode and a moving picture photographing mode, the image signal processing section 5 generates a digital image signal for each of R, G, and B from an image pickup signal which has been<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> outputted from the CCD 1 and converted into a digital signal, and applies various picture processing such as pixel interpolation processing, white-balance processing, luminance/chromatic-difference signal conversion processing, or the like to the image signal, and generates a video signal on the basis of the processed image data and transmits the video signal to the display section 9.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The display section 9 includes a liquid-crystal display on which color display is possible and a driving circuit thereof, and displays an image based on the above-described video signal which is transmitted from the image signal processing section 5 and is sequentially varied, i.e., a through image. Further, the display section 9 carries out, as is for an operational assistance, a display of processing menu at the time of selecting functions and a display of diagrams, icons or the like for setting.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The JPEG converter 6 is formed from a circuit dedicated to carrying out compression and expansion of still image data in accordance with a JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) standard, and at the time of photographing in a still picture photographing mode, the JPEG converter 6 compresses image data onto which picture processing is applied by the image signal processing section 5. Here, the compressed data is transferred to a flash memory 11 or a recording media<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> interface circuit 13 which will be described later. Further, in a reproduction mode, the JPEG converter 6 expands still image data which has been recorded in a state of being compressed. Here, the expanded still image data is displayed as a still image on the display section 9 by being transmitted to the image signal processing section 5 and converted into a video signal.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The MPEG converter 7 is formed from a circuit dedicated to carrying out compression and expansion of moving picture data in accordance with the MPEG standard, and at the time of photographing in a moving picture photographing mode, the MPEG converter 7 successively compresses moving picture data onto which image processing are applied by the image signal processing section 5, i.e., the image data for each frame which has been sequentially picked-up by the CCD 1. Here, the compressed data is transferred to the flash memory 11 or the recording media interface circuit 13 which will be described later. Further, in a reproduction mode, the MPEG converter 7 expands moving picture data which has been recorded in the compressed state. Here, the expanded moving picture data are successively transmitted to the image signal processing section 5 and converted into video signals, and thereafter, are displayed as a moving picture on the display section 9.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The SDRAM 8 is a working memory in the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> embodiments, and YW data such as reference data, search data, or the like, i.e., image data is temporarily stored therein at the time of compression and expansion of moving picture data by the MPEG converter 7. Further, image data generated in the process at the time of compressing and expanding a still image by the JPEG converter 6 is temporarily stored in the SDRAM 8.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Further, the digital camera has a control section 10, the flash memory 11, a key input section 12, the recording media interface circuit 13, and an I/O port 14.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The control section 10 is composed of peripheral circuits including a processor (CPU) and a program ROM and RAM which are not illustrated, and a clock switching control section 101 and a timer control section 102 which are illustrated. In the control section 10, the above-described processor functions as control means of the embodiments by controlling the above-described respective sections of the digital camera on the basis of various control programs stored in the program ROM and key operation signals transmitted from the key input section 12.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Further, the clock switching control section 101 is switching means of the embodiments, and receives a clock speed switching signal from the above-described processor, and switches an access speed (a read/write<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> speed of data) of the aforementioned SDRAM 8 by switching the clock signal frequency. The timer control section 102 starts various time-counting operations by receiving a count start signal from the above-described processor, and outputs an ending signal to the processor at a point in time when the time-counting operations are completed.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The flash memory 11 is a nonvolatile memory storing the data required to be maintained even when the power source is turned off as well, for example, various setting data set by a user. Note that some or all of the control programs stored in the program ROM of the control section 10 described above may be recorded in the flash memory 11.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The key input section 12 has a shutter button, a power source on/off key, a mode switching key used for switching an operation mode, a cursor key used for selecting a function and selecting a screen, a set key, or the like, and outputs an operation signal corresponding to the key operation to the control section 10. The above-described mode switching key is used for switching a still image photographing mode and a moving picture photographing mode, and a reproduction mode for reproducing a still image or a moving picture. Further, the above-described shutter button has a configuration in which it is possible to operate at two-stages of a half-pressed state for indicating AF<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> locking in a still image photographing mode and a moving picture photographing mode, and a fully-pressed state for indicating photographing, and functions as indicating means of the embodiments in a moving picture photographing mode.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Various recoding media 15 mounted on a camera body (not shown) are connected to the aforementioned recording media interface circuit 13. When the shutter button is operated so as to be fully pressed in a still image photographing mode, the recording media interface circuit 13 records the compressed still image data which has been transferred from the aforementioned JPEG converter 6 onto the recording medium 15, and when the shutter button is operated so as to be fully pressed in a moving picture photographing mode, the recording media interface circuit 13 records the compressed moving picture data which are successively transferred from the MPEG converter 7 onto the recording medium 15. Note that, for example, when the recording medium 15 is not mounted thereon, the compressed still image data or moving picture data is recorded on an image recording area which has been ensured in advance in the flash memory 11.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The I/O port 14 is used for inputting/outputting various data including image data between the digital camera and an external device, for example, for transferring the still image data or the moving picture<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> data which has been already recorded onto the recording medium 15.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Next, operations in accordance with the control of the control section 10 when a moving picture photographing mode is selected by a user in the digital camera formed from the above-described configuration will be described in accordance with a flowchart of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">When a moving picture photographing mode is selected, the digital camera is made to be in a monitoring state, and starts to drive the CCD 1, and continues the processing of displaying a picked-up through image of an object on the display section 9 (step SA1). In this state, when the shutter button is fully pressed by the user (YES at step SA2), a clock signal is switched to a clock signal having a frequency higher than a normal frequency by the clock switching control section 101, and in accordance therewith, an access speed of the SDRAM 8 is made to be a high speed (step SA3). Thereafter, the time when the operation of switching the frequency is completed is waited for, and at the point in time when it is completed (YES at step SA4), the digital camera proceeds to a moving picture photographing/recording state, and starts MPEG encoding processing in which image data of each frame which has been sequentially picked-up by the CCD 1 is<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> successively compressed by the MPEG converter 7 and the SDRAM 8, and records moving picture data onto the recording medium 15 by continuing the processing (step SA5).</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Then, when the shutter button is fully pressed again by the user, or when a photographing-forced-terminating period has come in which the storage capacity of the recording medium 15 reaches the upper limit, or it has reached a maximum moving picture photographing time determined in advance (YES at step SA6), the moving picture photographing is completed at that point in time, and the MPEG encoding processing by the MPEG converter 7 and the SDRAM 8 is completed (step SA7). Continuously, the clock signal is switched to a clock signal having a normal frequency by the clock switching control section 101, and the access speed of the SDRAM 8 is made to return to a normal speed (low speed) (step SA8). Thereafter, the time when the operation of switching the frequency is completed is waited for, and at the point in time when it is completed (YES at step SA9), the digital camera proceeds to a monitoring state again (step SA1), and the above-described operations are repeated.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">As described above, in the present embodiment, due to the access speed of the SDRAM 8 being suppressed to a normal speed (low speed) before the moving picture photographing is started, the useless electricity<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> consumption (of a battery, for example) during a monitoring period in which MPEG encoding processing is not carried out can be removed. Moreover, due to the access speed of the SDRAM 8 being switched to a high speed when the moving picture photographing is started by fully-pressing the shutter button, an operation of transferring image data at a high speed and in a large amount which is needed for moving picture (data) compression can be carried out during the period of moving picture photographing. Therefore, while an attempt is being made to lengthen the life of the battery, moving picture compression in real-time for which an operation of transferring image data at a high speed and in a large amount is required can be carried out. In accordance therewith, an attempt can be made to lengthen a continuous photographing time in a case in which moving picture compression in real-time is carried out.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Note that, in the present embodiment, the access speed of the SDRAM 8 is switched from a normal speed to a high speed at the time of starting moving picture photographing at the point in time when the fully-pressed state of the shutter button for the first time is carried out, and is made to return to the normal speed at the time of ending the moving picture photographing started by the fully-pressing operation of the shutter button for the second time. However,<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> it may be carried out as follows.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">For example, the access speed of the SDRAM 8 may be switched from a normal speed to a high speed at the point in time when a moving picture photographing mode is set by the user, and may be made to return to the normal speed at the point in time when a moving picture photographing mode is completed (is switched to another operating mode) by the user. Further, additionally, the access speed of the SDRAM 8 may be switched from a normal speed to a high speed at the point in time when the fully-pressing operation of the shutter button for the first time is carried out after a moving picture photographing mode is set, and the access speed may be made to return to the normal speed at the point in time when a moving picture photographing mode is completed by the user. In the above-described case, because the useless electricity consumption during the operating period in a still image photographing mode or a reproduction mode other than a moving picture photographing mode can be removed, while an attempt is being made to lengthen the life of the battery, moving picture compression in real-time for which an operation of transferring image data at a high speed and in a large amount is required can be carried out in a moving picture photographing mode.</p><heading id="h0002">(Second Embodiment)</heading><p id="p0029" num="0029">Next, a second embodiment of the present invention<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> will be described.

In this state, when the shutter button is pressed by half by the user (YES at step SB2), a clock signal is switched to a clock signal having a frequency higher than a normal frequency by the clock switching control section 101, and in accordance therewith, an access speed of the SDRAM 8 is made to be a high speed (step SB3), and at the point in time when it is completed (YES at step SB4), the digital camera once proceeds to a photographing stand-by state (step SB5). Note that the content of the operation in this state is the same as in the monitoring state at step SB1.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Continuously, when the shutter button in the half-pressed state is fully pressed by the user during the time of being in this photographing stand-by state (YES at step SB6), the digital camera proceeds to a moving picture photographing/recording state, and starts MPEG encoding processing by the MPEG converter 7 and the SDRAM 8, and records moving picture data onto the recording medium 15 by continuing the processing (step SB8).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Then, when the shutter button is fully pressed again by the user, or when the photographing-forced-terminating period described above has come (YES at step SB9), at that point in time, the moving picture photographing (MPEG encoding processing) is completed (step SB10). Thereafter, a clock signal is switched to a clock signal having a normal frequency, and the access speed of the SDRAM 8 is made to return to a normal speed (low speed) (step SB11), and at the point in time when it is completed (YES at step SB12), the digital camera proceeds to a monitoring state again (step SB1), and the above-described operations are repeated.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">On the other hand, when the shutter button in the half-pressed state is cancelled without being fully pressed by the user after the digital camera has been made to be in a photographing stand-by state at step SB5, (NO at both steps SB6, SB7), the digital camera<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> immediately proceeds to step SB11 described above without executing moving picture photographing, and the access speed of the SDRAM 8 is made to return to a normal speed (low speed), and at the point in time when it is completed (YES at step SB12), the digital camera proceeds to a monitoring state again (step SB1), and the above-described operations are repeated.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">As described above, in the present embodiment, due to the access speed of the SDRAM 8 being suppressed to a normal speed (low speed) before the shutter button is pressed by half, i.e., generally, up to the time directly before moving picture photographing is started, the useless electricity consumption during the monitoring period before that can be removed. Moreover, due to the access speed of the SDRAM 8 being switched to a high speed in advance at a point in time when the shutter button is pressed by half, during the period of moving picture photographing which is started by fully-pressing the shutter button, an operation of transferring image data at a high speed and in a large amount which is needed for moving picture compression can be carried out. Therefore, while an attempt is being made to lengthen the life of the battery, moving picture compression in real-time for which an operation of transferring image data at a high speed and in a large amount is required can be carried out.<br/>
In accordance therewith, an attempt can be made to<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> lengthen a continuous photographing time in a case in which moving picture compression in real-time is carried out.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Note that, in the present embodiment, there is the following advantage as compared with the first embodiment. Namely, as in the first embodiment, in a case in which moving picture photographing is started by going through the clock switching stage after an indication of starting photographing (fully-pressing operation) by the shutter button is carried out in a monitoring state, it takes a given time until the time when the moving picture photographing/recording processing is actually started. In contrast thereto, in the present embodiment, because the access speed of the SDRAM 8 is switched to a high speed in advance at the point in time when the shutter button is pressed by half, there is the advantage that the time (release time lag) until the time when the moving picture photographing/recording processing is actually started after an indication of starting photographing (fully-pressing operation) is carried out can be shortened.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">However, because the access speed of the SDRAM 8 is switched to a high speed in advance at the point in time when the shutter button is pressed by half, as compared with the first embodiment, an extra electricity consumption exists during the monitoring period after the shutter button is pressed by half,<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> i.e., in a photographing stand-by state.

Then, when an operation of the shutter button for the third time is carried out by the user, or when a photographing-forced-terminating period described above has come (YES at step SC9), the moving picture photographing (MPEG encoding processing) is completed at that point in time (step SC10). Thereafter, a clock signal is switched to a clock signal having a normal frequency, and the access speed of the SDRAM 8 is made to return to a normal speed (low speed) (step SC11), and at the point in time when it is completed (YES at step SC12), the digital camera proceeds to a monitoring state again (step SC1), and the above-described operations are repeated.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">On the other hand, after the digital camera is made to be in a photographing stand-by state at step<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> SC5, when a given time has passed from the time when the digital camera is made to be in a photographing stand-by state without the shutter button being pressed by the user (NO at step SC6 and YES at step SC7), the digital camera immediately proceeds to step SC11 described above without executing moving picture photographing, and the access speed of the SDRAM 8 is made to return to a normal speed (low speed), and at the point in time when it is completed (YES at step SC12), the digital camera proceeds to a monitoring state again (step SC1), and the above-described operations are repeated.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">As described above, in the present embodiment, due to the access speed of the SDRAM 8 being suppressed to a normal speed (low speed) before the shutter button is operated for the first time, the useless electricity consumption during the monitoring period can be removed. Moreover, due to the access speed of the SDRAM 8 being switched to a high speed in advance at the point in time when the shutter button is operated for the first time, an operation of transferring image data at a high speed and in a large amount which is needed for moving picture compression can be carried out during the period of moving picture photographing after the shutter button is operated for the second time. Therefore, while an attempt is being made to lengthen the life of the battery, moving picture<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> compression in real-time for which an operation of transferring image data at a high speed and in a large amount is required can be carried out.
