In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> system 1 has a first information processor 10, and service-providing devices 20A, 20B, and 20C (hereinafter collectively referred to as "service-providing device 20") connected to the first information processor 10.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The first information processor 10 is a device which receives provision of a service from the service-providing device 20. The service-providing device 20 is a device which provides a service to the first information processor 10. In the first exemplary embodiment, the first information processor 10 is a client computer such as a personal computer used by a user, the service-providing device 20 is a server computer, and the first information processor 10 and the service-providing device 20 are connected to each other through the Internet N1. No particular limitation is imposed on the service provided by the service-providing device 20. For example, the service-providing devices 20A, 20B, and 20C may provide a banking service, an auction service, and a trading service, respectively.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The service-providing device 20 is a device which has a function as an authentication device which authenticates a user and provides a service to the first information processor 10 of a user when the authentication of the user is successful. In the first exemplary embodiment, first and second authentications are employed for authenticating the user, and the service is provided when both authentications are successful.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The first authentication will now be described. The first information processor 10 receives an input of first authentication information (for example, user ID and password) from a user and<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> transmits the first authentication information to the service-providing device 20. The service-providing device 20 receives the first authentication information from the first information processor 10, and executes the first authentication based on the first authentication information.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Next, the second authentication will be described.

The<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> authentication-service-providing device receives second authentication information for authenticating a user from the second information processor, executes the second authentication based on the second authentication information, and issues third authentication information to the second information processor when the second authentication is successful. The authentication device receives first authentication information for authenticating a user from the first information processor; executes the first authentication based on the first authentication information; receives, from the first information processor, the third authentication information obtained by the second information processor and input to the first information processor; and cooperates with the authentication-service-providing device to obtain a result of the third authentication based on the third authentication information. By virtue of this structure, according to the first exemplary embodiment, two-factor, two-route authentication can be realized with a simple structure.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">More specifically, a two-factor, two-route authentication system can be constructed by simply adding, to a typical authentication system of one-factor, one-route including an authentication device which executes the first authentication based on the first authentication information, an authentication-service-providing device, a mechanism for the authentication device to receive the third authentication information from the first information processor, and a mechanism for the authentication device to cooperate with the<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> authentication-service-providing device to obtain a result of the third authentication. In addition, because the authentication-service-providing device is provided separately from the authentication device, the authentication-service-providing device can be managed by a party different from that for the authentication device. By virtue of this configuration, the operator of the authentication device (for example, a service provider) can outsource the portion related to the second authentication. When the authentication-service-providing device is constructed by the authentication service provider, the operator of the authentication device of one-factor authentication can introduce the two-factor, two-route authentication by merely adding, in the authentication device, a mechanism to receive the third authentication information from the first information processor and a mechanism to cooperate with the authentication-service-providing device to obtain a result of the third authentication. In addition, because the authentication-service-providing device can be shared by multiple authentication devices (or multiple services), the cost related to the second authentication can be reduced. Moreover, because authentication systems become common among multiple services, the convenience to the user can be improved as compared with a configuration in which each of the multiple service providers employs its own authentication system.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">When the first authentication is successful but the third authentication fails, it is highly probable that the first<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> authentication information has been fraudulently obtained. Thus, in the first exemplary embodiment, it is possible to detect fraudulent acquisition of the first authentication information, on the basis of results of the first and third authentications. In addition, it is possible to identify the origin of the fraudulent access on the basis of the identification information (such as an address on the network such as an IP address) of the first information processor transmitting the first and third authentication information. In particular, in the structure in which the third authentication is executed in the authentication-service-providing device, the fraudulent acquisition of the first authentication information can be detected in the authentication service providing device, and, thus, it is not necessary to provide a mechanism to detect fraud in the authentication device. In addition, with the structure in which the third authentication is executed in the authentication-service-providing device, when the authentication-service-providing device is shared by multiple authentication devices (or services), fraud can be collectively detected for the multiple authentication devices (or services), and, thus, the scale of fraud can be easily known.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">In the structure in which the third authentication is executed by the authentication-service-providing device, because the authentication-service-providing device checks the third authentication information issued by the authentication-service-providing device, a time synchronization process among devices which is necessary in a hardware token is<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> not necessary.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Because the third authentication information has a validity period and is one-time information, the possibility of theft of the third authentication information can be reduced, along with damages caused by the theft.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The system 1 according to the first exemplary embodiment may also be configured in any of the following configurations (a) - (i).
<ol><li>(a) In configuration (a), the third authentication unit 44 of the authentication-service-providing device 40 may receive, from the service-providing device 20, identification information of the first information processor 10 transmitting the third authentication information, along with the third authentication information. The identification information of the first information processor 10 may be, for example, an address of the first information processor 10 on the network (such as an IP address).
<br/>
According to this configuration, when the authentication-service-providing device 40 detects fraudulent acquisition of the first authentication information, it is possible to identify the origin of the fraudulent access on the basis of the identification information of the transmitting first information processor 10. In particular, when the authentication-service-providing device 40 is shared among multiple authentication devices (or services), the fraudulent access and origin of the fraudulent access can be collectively detected for the multiple authentication devices (or services).<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> -->
</li><li>(b) In configuration (b), the authentication-service-providing device 40 may further have a fraudulent information notification unit 45 that reports information related to fraud when the first authentication is successful and the third authentication fails. The information related to fraud may include, for example, a message indicating that there is a possibility that the first authentication information has been fraudulently obtained and information indicating the origin of the fraudulent access (such as the IP address of the transmitting first information processor). The notification destination of the information related to the fraud may be, for example, a user corresponding to the first authentication information which has been fraudulently obtained (more specifically, the mail address, phone number, facsimile number, etc. of the user), the service-providing device 20 transmitting the third authentication information, the service provider managing the service-providing device 20 (more specifically, the mail address, phone number, facsimile number, etc. of the service provider), the administrator of the authentication-service-providing device 40, and a memory accumulating the information related to fraud. The structure to notify the user corresponding to the first authentication information which has been fraudulently obtained may be realized, for example, in the following manner. Specifically, the service-providing device 20 transmits, to the authentication-service-providing device 40, user identification information for identifying a user along with the third<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> authentication information, and, when the authentication-service-providing device 40 detects the fraudulent acquisition, the authentication-service-providing device 40 notifies a notification destination of the user (such as a mail address) which is registered in advance in correspondence to the user identification information.
<br/>
With this configuration, it is possible to report the information related to fraud such as the possibility of fraudulent acquisition of the first authentication information to an appropriate notification destination and to quickly report the information related to fraud.
</li><li>(c) In configuration (c), when the authentication-service-providing device 40 receives from a user a usage termination application on-line or off-line, the authentication-service-providing device 40 may perform a usage termination process of the second authentication information of the user. Here, the usage termination process may be, for example, a deletion process of the registration of the second authentication information and a setting process of a usage termination flag corresponding to the second authentication information.
<br/>
With this configuration, the user can terminate issuance of the third authentication information to the user. In particular, when the second authentication information is the individual identification ID of the second information processor 30, and when the user loses the second information processor 30, it is possible to avoid fraudulent use of the second information processor 30.<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> -->
</li><li>(d) In configuration (d), the configuration (c) is employed with the authentication-service-providing device 40 further reporting information related to fraud when the second authentication information from the second information processor 30 is information for which the usage termination process is applied. Here, the information related to fraud may be, for example, a message indicating that there is a possibility that the second authentication information has been fraudulently obtained and a message indicating that the second information processor 30 may have been fraudulently obtained. In addition, the notification destination of the information related to fraud may be the user corresponding to the second authentication information which has been fraudulently obtained (more specifically, the mail address, phone number, facsimile number, etc. of the user), the administrator of the authentication-service-providing device 40, or a memory which accumulates the information related to fraud.
<br/>
With this configuration, the information related to fraud such as the possibility of fraudulent acquisition of the second authentication information can be reported to an appropriate notification destination and the information related to fraud can be quickly reported.
</li><li>(e) In the above-described configuration, as a form of the service-providing-device 20 obtaining a result of the third authentication, there is described a configuration in which the service-providing device 20 obtains the result of the third authentication from the authentication-service-providing device 40. In configuration (e), the service-providing device 20 may<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> execute the third authentication. <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is a block diagram showing a functional structure of the system 1 in which the service-providing device 20 executes the third authentication. In <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, the authentication-service-providing device 40 has an authentication-information-providing unit 46 in place of the third authentication unit 44 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. The authentication-information-providing unit 46 provides issued third authentication information to the service-providing device 20.
<br/>
In the above-described configuration, the third authentication is executed in the following manner. Specifically, the third authentication result obtaining unit 22 of the service-providing device 20 obtains, from the authentication-information-providing unit 46, the third authentication information issued by the authentication information issuance unit 42. The third authentication result obtaining unit 22 executes the third authentication based on the third authentication information received from the first information processor 10 and the third authentication information obtained from the authentication-information-providing unit 46. More specifically, the third authentication result obtaining unit 22 determines whether or not the third authentication information received from the first information processor 10 matches any of the third authentication information obtained from the authentication-information-providing unit 46.
</li><li>(f) In configuration (f), the second information processor 30 may receive designation of a service-providing device 20 (or<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> service) from a user and may transmit the designation to the authentication-service-providing device 40 along with the second authentication information. For example, when the authentication-service-providing device 40 receives the second authentication information from the second information processor 30, the authentication-service-providing device 40 transmits, to the second information processor 30, a list of services registered in advance in relation to the second authentication information. The second information processor 30 receives the list of services and displays the list on a web screen, receives a selection of a service from the user on the screen, and reports a selected service to the authentication-service-providing device 40.
<br/>
When the second authentication based on the second authentication information is successful, the authentication-service-providing device 40 issues third authentication information dedicated for the designated service-providing device 20 (or service). More specifically, in one aspect, the authentication-service-providing device 40 stores the issued third authentication information in relation to a service ID indicating a designated service. The service-providing device 20 transmits the third authentication information to the authentication-service-providing device 40 along with the service ID of the service of the service-providing device 20. When the authentication-service-providing device 40 receives the third authentication information and the service ID, the authentication-service-providing device 40 matches the third authentication information with the third authentication<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> information stored in relation to the service ID. In another aspect, the authentication-service-providing device 40 issues third authentication information in which the service ID indicating the designated service is embedded. The service-providing device 20 transmits the third authentication information to the authentication-service-providing device 40 along with the service ID of the service of the service-providing device 20. When the authentication-service-providing device 40 receives the third authentication information and the service ID, the authentication-service-providing device 40 determines whether or not the service ID embedded in the third authentication information matches the received service ID. When the authentication-service-providing device 40 determines that the service IDs match, the authentication-service-providing device 40 matches the received third authentication information and the stored third authentication information, and when the authentication-service-providing device 40 determines that the service IDs do not match, the authentication-service-providing device 40 determines that the authentication has failed.
<br/>
With this configuration, because the third authentication information is dedicated for a particular-service-providing device (or service), the usage of the third authentication information can be limited and security can be improved.
</li><li>(g) In configuration (g), the second information processor 30 (for example, a portable phone) may be connected to the authentication-service-providing device 40 via the first information processor 10. For example, the second information<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> processor 30 may communicate with the authentication-service-providing device 40 via the first information processor 10 and the Internet N1. The communication between the second information processor 30 and the first information processor 10 may be wireless, such as via infrared communication, or through wires, such as via a cable connection.
<br/>
With this configuration, the second authentication and the acquisition of the third authentication information can be executed even in an environment in which the second information processor 30 (for example, a portable phone) cannot directly connect to the authentication-service-providing device 40 through the portable phone network N2 (for example, in an area outside of a communication area of the portable phone such as underground).
</li><li>(h) In configuration (h), the first information processor 10 and the second information processor 30 may be physically realized as one device. For example, it is possible to realize the first information processor 10 with a first application software and the second information processor 30 with a second application software, in one computer.</li><li>(i) In configuration (i), the second information processor 30 may have a function to lock the operation of the device. In this case, the second information processor 30 locks the operation on the basis of a lock operation by the user. When the second information processor 30 receives input of authentication information from a user (such as a password and biometric information such as a fingerprint) and authentication based on the authentication information is successful, the second information<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> processor 30 releases the lock of the operation.</li></ol></p><heading id="h0012">[Example]</heading><p id="p0068" num="0068">An authentication system according to an example of the present invention realizes two-factor, two-route authentication, and in many points is similar to the authentication system of the first exemplary embodiment, except that checking the result of the second authentication by the service-providing device is realized without the third authentication.

When the second authentication based on the individual identification ID is successful, the authentication-service-providing device 40 sets a flag assigned to the service ID corresponding to the selected service among the service IDs correlated to the individual identification ID. In other words, the second authentication successful information is recorded by setting the flag. For example, when the service ID corresponding to the selected service is "B" and the second authentication based on the individual identification ID of "A" is successful, a flag corresponding to a combination of the individual identification ID of "A" and the service ID of "B" is set.

Specifically, the authentication-service-providing device 40 specifies an<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> individual identification ID corresponding to the user who is identified by the received user ID on the basis of a correspondence table, which is recorded in the authentication-service-providing device 40 in advance, between the user ID and the individual identification ID.

The authentication-service-providing device receives the second authentication information for authenticating the user from the second information processor and executes the second authentication based on the second authentication information. The authentication device receives the first authentication information for authenticating the user from the first information processor, and executes the first authentication based on the first authentication information and cooperates with the authentication-service-providing device to check whether or not the second authentication is successful for the user specified by the first authentication information. With<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --> this configuration, in this example, two-factor, two-route authentication can be realized with a simple structure.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">More specifically, a two-factor, two-route authentication system can be introduced by simply adding, to a general authentication system of one-factor, one-route including an authentication device which executes the first authentication based on the first authentication information, an authentication-service-providing device and a mechanism in which the authentication device checks a result of a second authentication in cooperation with the authentication-service-providing device. In addition, because the authentication-service-providing device is provided separately from the authentication device, the authentication-service-providing device can be operated by a party different from that for the authentication device. Therefore, the operator of the authentication device (for example, a service provider) can outsource the portions related to the second authentication. When the authentication-service-providing device is constructed by an authentication service provider, an operator of an authentication device of one-factor authentication can introduce a two-factor, two-route authentication by merely adding, to the authentication device, a mechanism to check the result of the second authentication in cooperation with the authentication-service-providing device. Because the authentication-service-providing device can be shared by multiple authentication devices (or multiple services), cost related to the<!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --> second authentication can be reduced. In addition, because the authentication systems become common among multiple services, the convenience to the user can be improved as compared with a structure in which each of the multiple service providers employs its own authentication system.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">Moreover, in this example, it is not necessary to present the third authentication information from the first information processor to the authentication device. Thus, input of the third authentication information to the first information processor by the user is not necessary, and there are advantages of reduced amount of operation and prevention of errors in input.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">When the first authentication is successful and it cannot be confirmed that the second authentication is successful, it is highly probable that the first authentication information has been fraudulently obtained. Thus, in this example, it is possible to detect fraudulent acquisition of the first authentication information on the basis of the result of the first authentication and the checking result of the second authentication. In addition, it is also possible to identify an origin of fraudulent access on the basis of identification information (such as, for example, an address on the network such as an IP address) of the first information processor transmitting the first authentication information in this case. In particular, with the structure in which the authentication-service-providing device checks the result of the second authentication, fraudulent acquisition of the first authentication information can be detected in the authentication-service-providing device, and, thus, it is not<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --> necessary to provide a fraud detection mechanism on the side of the authentication device. In addition, with the structure in which the authentication-service-providing device checks the result of the second authentication, when the authentication-service-providing device is shared by multiple authentication devices (or services), fraud can be collectively detected for the multiple authentication devices (or services), and, thus, the degree of fraud can be easily known.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">With the structure in which the authentication-service-providing device checks the result of the second authentication, the authentication-service-providing device checks the result of the second authentication recorded by the authentication-service-providing device, and, thus, a time synchronization process among devices which is necessary for a hardware token is not necessary.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">Moreover, because a record indicating that the second authentication is successful has a validity period and is one-time, security risks due to the validity of the record being continued can be avoided or at least reduced.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">The below-described configurations (j) - (s) may be employed in a system according to this example.
<ul><li>(j) In the above-described configuration, the service-providing device 20 presents the user ID (a portion of the first authentication information) to the authentication-service-providing device 40. In configuration (j), the service-providing device 20 may present the individual identification ID (second authentication information) to the<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> authentication-service-providing device 40. In this configuration, the service-providing device 20 has a memory 25 which stores in advance a user ID and an individual identification ID in a pair. When the first authentication for a certain user ID is successful, the service-providing device 20 identifies the individual identification ID correlated to the user ID in the memory 25 and presents the individual identification ID to the authentication-service-providing device 40. When the authentication-service-providing device 40 receives the presentation of the individual identification ID from the service-providing device 20, the authentication-service-providing device 40 refers to the second authentication result memory 47 and determines whether or not a flag is set for the individual identification ID.</li><li>(k) In the above-described configuration, the second authentication successful information is recorded by use of a flag. Alternatively, the second authentication successful information may be recorded in a different form. For example, in configuration (k), the second authentication successful information is recorded in the following form. Specifically, the second authentication result memory 47 stores a list of second authentication information in advance. When the service ID of the selected service is "B" and the second authentication based on the second authentication information of "A" is successful, the authentication-service-providing device 40 records the service ID of "B" in the second authentication result memory 47 as the second authentication successful information, in correlation with the<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> second authentication information of "A."</li><li>(l) In configuration (1), the authentication-service-providing device 40 receives from the service-providing device 20 identification information of the first information processor 10 transmitting user identification information (for example, a user ID) along with the user identification information. Here, the identification information of the first information processor 10 may be the address of the first information processor 10 on the network (such as an IP address).
<br/>
With this configuration, when fraudulent acquisition of the first authentication information is detected in the authentication-service-providing device 40, the origin of the fraudulent access can be identified on the basis of the identification information of the transmitting first information processor 10. In particular, when the authentication-service-providing device 40 is shared by multiple authentication devices (or services), fraud and origin of the fraudulent access can be collectively detected for multiple authentication devices (or services).
</li><li>(m) In configuration (m), the authentication-service-providing device 40 may further have a fraud information notification unit 45 which notifies information related to fraud when the first authentication is successful and success of the second authentication is not confirmed. The information related to the fraud may be, for example, a message indicating that there is a possibility that the first<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --> authentication information has been fraudulently obtained and information indicating the origin of the fraudulent access (IP address or the like of the transmitting first information processor 10). The notification destination of the information related to fraud may be, for example, a user corresponding to the fraudulently obtained first authentication information (more specifically, the mail address, phone number, facsimile number, etc. of the user), the service-providing device 20 transmitting the user identification information, a service provider managing the service-providing device 20 (more specifically, the mail address, phone number, facsimile number, etc. of the service provider), the administrator of the authentication-service-providing device 40, and a memory device accumulating information related to fraud. In the configuration in which a user corresponding to the fraudulently obtained first authentication information is reported, the authentication-service-providing device 40 reports, for example, a notification destination (the mail address or the like) of the user who is registered in advance in correlation with the user identification information.
<br/>
With this configuration, it is possible to notify an appropriate notification destination of information related to fraud such as the possibility of the fraudulent acquisition of the first authentication information and to quickly report the information related to fraud.
</li><li>(n) In configuration (n), when the authentication-service-providing device 40 may receive a usage<!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --> termination application from a user on-line or off-line, the authentication-service-providing device 40 may apply a usage termination process of the second authentication information of the user. The usage termination process may be, for example, a process to delete registration of the second authentication information or a process to set a usage termination flag corresponding to the second authentication information.
<br/>
With this configuration, the user can terminate the second authentication for the user. In particular, in the configuration in which the second authentication information is the individual identification ID of the second information processor 30, fraudulent use of the second information processor 30 when the second information processor 30 is lost can be avoided.
</li><li>(o) Configuration (o) is similar to configuration (n), except that the authentication-service-providing device 40 may further report information related to fraud when the second authentication information from the second information processor 30 is information for which the usage termination process is applied. The information related to fraud may be, for example, a message indicating that there is a possibility that the second authentication information has been fraudulently obtained or a message indicating that there is a possibility that the second information processor 30 has been fraudulently obtained. The notification destination of the information related to fraud may be, for example, a user corresponding to the fraudulently obtained second authentication information (more specifically, the mail address, phone number, facsimile number, etc. of the user), the<!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --> administrator of the authentication-service-providing device 40, or a memory device accumulating the information related to fraud.
<br/>
With this configuration, it is possible to report the information related to fraud such as the possibility of fraudulent acquisition of the second authentication information to an appropriate notification destination and to quickly report the information related to fraud.
</li><li>(p) In the above-described configuration, the service-providing device 20 obtains the checking result of the second authentication from the authentication-service-providing device 40. In configuration (p), the actual determination of whether or not the second authentication is successful may be made by the service-providing device 20. In this configuration, the authentication-service-providing device 40 uses an arbitrary method to provide to the service-providing device 20 information similar to the stored content of the second authentication result memory 47.</li><li>(q) In the above-described configuration, the service-providing device 20 (or service) is specified and the second authentication is executed. In configuration (q), the second authentication may be executed without specifying the service.</li><li>(r) In configuration (r), the second information processor 30 (such as, for example, a portable phone) may be connected to the authentication-service-providing device 40 via the first information processor 10. For example, the second information processor 30 may communicate with the<!-- EPO <DP n="52"> --> authentication-service-providing device 40 via the first information processor 10 and the Internet N1. The communication between the second information processor 30 and the first information processor 10 may be wireless, such as via infrared communication, or through a wire, such as via a cable connection.
<br/>
With this configuration, it is possible to execute the second authentication even in an environment in which the second information processor 30 (such as, for example, portable phone) cannot directly connect to the authentication-service-providing device 40 via the portable phone network N2 (for example, in an area outside of communication area of the portable phone, such as underground).
</li><li>(s) In configuration (s), the first information processor 10 and the second information processor 30 may be realized by a physically combined device. For example, it is possible to realize the first information processor 10 with a first application software and the second information processor 30 with a second application software in one computer.</li></ul></p><p id="p0104" num="0104">The foregoing description of the exemplary embodiments of the present invention has been provided for the purposes of illustration and description.
