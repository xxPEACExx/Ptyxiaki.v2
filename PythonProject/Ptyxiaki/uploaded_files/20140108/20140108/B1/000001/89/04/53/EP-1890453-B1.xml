The communication system 1 comprises a transmitting device 10 and a receiving device 20 and performs, for example, Ethernet communication. In the figure, the transmitting device 10 and the receiving device 20 are separately illustrated; in practice, a single communication device functions as both the transmitting and receiving devices 10 and 20.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The transmitting device 10 includes a coder 11, a polarity-reversed data generator 12, and a transmitter 13. The coder 11 encodes the data of a primary signal to generate encoded data such that the polarity of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> encoded data alternates between positive and negative polarities.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The polarity-reversed data generator 12 reverses the polarity of part of the encoded data to generate polarity-reversed data. The transmitter 13 transmits, as communication data, the encoded data including the polarity-reversed data.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The receiving device 20 includes a receiver 21, a polarity-reversed data detector 22, a polarity recognizer 23, and a controller 24. The receiver 21 receives the communication data. The polarity-reversed data detector 22 determines whether or not the polarity of the received communication data alternates between positive and negative polarities, and detects, as the polarity-reversed data, data of which the polarity differs from the expected polarity. The polarity recognizer 23 recognizes the polarity of the polarity-reversed data and treats the recognized polarity as control information. The controller 24 controls the receiving device 20 in accordance with the control information.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The coder 11 generates the encoded data by converting the primary signal n bits by n bits into an m-bit data unit (n &lt; m) whose polarity alternates between positive and negative polarities. In the following description, it is assumed that n and m are 8 and 10, respectively, so that 8B/10B conversion is performed.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The following is a brief explanation of the 8B/10B<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> conversion. The 8B/10B conversion is an encoding scheme employed especially in Gigabit Ethernet such as 1000BASE-LX, 1000BASE-SX and 1000BASE-CX or in Fiber Channel, wherein a pattern is selected from within the 10-bit code space so that 0s and 1s may be almost equal in number, and 8-bit code is converted to 10-bit code for transmission and vice versa for reception.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">When converting 8-bit data to 10-bit data, the balance of the 0s and 1s contained in the data is suitably adjusted to thereby enable recovery of the data signal with reduced bit error rate as well as recovery of the clock signal embedded in the data signal.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">If, at this time, the bits 0 and 1 are simply allotted high and low signal voltages for transmission, the signal level remains unchanged in cases where there is a succession of 0s or 1s, possibly making the receiving side fail to achieve self-synchronization. To avoid the inconvenience, the occurrences of 0s and 1s are made even to adjust the direct-current balance (reduce the direct-current component), thereby preventing repetition of an identical state and enabling stable communications.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The communication system 1 to which a first embodiment of the invention is applied will be now described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> illustrating the operation of the first embodiment. Let us suppose that the transmitting device 10 transmits data 00-01-02-03-04-05 (h) as the primary signal to the receiving device 20.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">S1: The coder 11 subjects the data 00-01-02-03-04-05 (h) to 8B/10B conversion (e.g., 8-bit code is converted to 10-bit code by using an 8B/10B conversion table or the like prepared beforehand).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In this instance, 00 is converted to 100111 0100 (-), 01 to 100010 1011 (+), 02 to 101101 0100 (-), 03 to 110001 0100 (+), 04 to 110101 0100 (-), and 05 to 101001 0100 (+). Each sign enclosed in parentheses indicates the polarity of data. The conversion is carried out such that the polarity begins with negative polarity (-) as an initial value and thereafter alternates between positive (+) and negative (-) polarities.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">S2: The polarity-reversed data generator 12 reverses the polarity of part of the encoded data. In <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the polarity of 101101 0100 (-), which is the 10B data of 02, is reversed, thus obtaining 010010 1011 (+).</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">S3: The transmitter 13 transmits communication data including the polarity-reversed data 010010 1011 (+), and the receiver 21 receives the communication data.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">S4: The polarity-reversed data detector 22 determines whether or not the polarity of the received communication data alternates between positive and negative polarities, and detects, as the polarity-reversed data, data of which the polarity differs from the expected polarity.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In this instance, the communication data is received in the order: 100111 0100 (-) → 100010 1011 (+)<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> → 010010 1011 (+) → 110001 0100 (+) → 110101 0100 (-) → 101001 0100 (+). The third data 010010 1011 (+), which is the 10B data of 02, has polarity different from the expected polarity, and therefore, this data is detected as the polarity-reversed data.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">S5: The polarity recognizer 23 determines whether the polarity of the polarity-reversed data is reversed in the positive-to-negative direction or vice versa, and treats 1-bit information indicated by the determined reversal direction as control information for the receiving device 20.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">For example, if data with the polarity (+) is input at the timing when the polarity (-) is expected, this polarity reversal direction is recognized as the control information "1". On the other hand, if data with the polarity (-) is input at the timing when the polarity (+) is expected, the polarity reversal direction is recognized as the control information "0". In the example of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, data with the polarity (+) is received at the timing when the polarity (-) is expected, and therefore, the control information "1" is derived.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> shows an example of polarity reversal from the positive to negative polarity. In the figure, the polarity of the data 110001 0100 (+), which is the 10B data of 03, is reversed, thus obtaining 001110 1011 (-). As a result, the control information "0" is derived.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, "<figref idrefs="f0001">1</figref>" is obtained as<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> the control information, and the controller 24 performs a predetermined control action in accordance with the control information "1". For example, prearrangement is made such that the control information "1" indicates a notification of fault occurrence, and when the control information "1" is received from the transmitting device 10, the controller 24 executes an appropriate process to cope with the fault occurring in the transmitting side.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Thus, in the first embodiment, the polarity of data is reversed so that the polarity-reversed data may be used as the control information. It is therefore unnecessary to insert control information in user channel resources, and the control information can be transmitted as a polarity change of the primary signal. Accordingly, the bandwidth available to users does not decrease at all and yet the control information can be transferred between the transmitting and receiving devices, making it possible to improve communication quality.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">After the control information is derived from the polarity reversal direction of the polarity-reversed data, the receiving device 20 again reverses the polarity of the polarity-reversed data to recover the original data, that is, the data 010010 1011 (+) is reversed in polarity as 101101 0100 (-), so that the data 101101 0100 (-) corresponding to 02 may be used as user data. The receiving device 20 then performs 10B/8B conversion, thus obtaining 00-01-02-03-04-05 (h).<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The communication system 1 to which a second embodiment of the invention is applied will be now described. In the second embodiment, the first polarity-reversed data is recognized as a control information start trigger, and the polarities of the succeeding k (= 1, 2, ...) units of 10B data are treated as the control information.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates operation according to the second embodiment. It is assumed here that the transmitting device 10 transmits data 00-01-02-03-04-05 (h) as the primary signal to the receiving device 20.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">S11: The coder 11 subjects the data 00-01-02-03-04-05 (h) to 8B/10B conversion, so that 00 is converted to 100111 0100 (-), 01 to 100010 1011 (+), 02 to 101101 0100 (-), 03 to 110001 0100 (+), 04 to 110101 0100 (-), and 05 to 101001 0100 (+). The conversion is carried out such that the polarity begins with negative polarity (-) as an initial value and thereafter alternates between positive (+) and negative (-) polarities.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">S12: The polarity-reversed data generator 12 generates polarity-reversed data by reversing the polarity of at least one unit of 10B data. In <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, the polarity of 101101 0100 (-), which is the 10B data of 02, is reversed, thus obtaining 010010 1011 (+). Further, the polarity of 110101 0100 (-), which is the 10B data of 04, is reversed, thus obtaining 001010 1011 (+).</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">S13: The transmitter 13 transmits communication<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> data including the polarity-reversed data 010010 1011 (+) and 001010 1011 (+), and the receiver 21 receives the communication data.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">S14: The polarity-reversed data detector 22 determines whether or not the polarity of the received communication data alternates between positive and negative polarities, and detects, as the polarity-reversed data, data of which the polarity differs from the expected polarity.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In this instance, the communication data is received in the order: 100111 0100 (-) → 100010 1011 (+) → 010010 1011 (+) <b>→</b> 110001 0100 (+) → 001010 1011 (+) → 101001 0100 (+). The third data 010010 1011 (+), which is the 10B data of 02, and the fifth data 001010 1011 (+), which is the 10B data of 04, have polarity different from their expected polarity, and therefore, these two units of data are detected as the polarity-reversed data.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">S15: The polarity recognizer 23 recognizes the first detected polarity-reversed data as the control information start trigger and treats the polarities of the succeeding k units of 10B data as the control information. The value of k is determined beforehand.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Where k = 2, for example, the first polarity-reversed data 010010 1011 (+) corresponding to 02 is recognized as the control information start trigger, and the polarities of the two units of 10B data (20 (= 2 x 10) bits in total) succeeding 02 and corresponding to 03 and<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> 04, respectively, are treated as the control information.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Assuming that the polarity identical with the expected polarity indicates "1" and that the polarity different from the expected polarity indicates "0", the polarities of the two units of 10B data corresponding to 03 and 04 show "10" as the control information. In accordance with the control information "10", the controller 24 performs a predetermined control action.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">With reference to the aforementioned Step S12, it is stated that "the polarity-reversed data is generated by reversing the polarity of at least one unit of data." The expression "at least one unit of data" is used because the polarity of one unit of 10B data needs to be reversed so as to indicate the control information start trigger and also because it is likely that the polarities of the succeeding units of data happen to agree with the contents of the control information to be communicated and thus need not be reversed.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Thus, in the second embodiment, the first detected polarity-reversed data is recognized as the control information start trigger, and the polarities of the k units of 10B data succeeding the polarity-reversed data are treated as the control information.

The expression "at least two units of data" is used because the polarity of two units of 10B data needs to be reversed, one to indicate the control information start trigger and the other to include the error-correcting code, and also because it is likely that the polarities of the intervening units of data happen to agree with the contents of the control information to be communicated and thus need not be reversed.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In this manner, the third embodiment is configured to perform the function of the second embodiment, and besides, the error-correcting code such as a parity check code is included in the communication data to be transmitted.

Based on the control information "1", therefore, it is concluded that the data was normally transmitted.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> shows the case where an error response has been received. The 10B data corresponding to 03 is 001110 1011 (-), that is, the polarity of the 10B data has been reversed and differs from the expected polarity. Accordingly, the control information "0" indicative of error response is derived.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Thus, in the fourth embodiment, the polarity of the primary signal is utilized to transmit the response message start trigger, which indicates the start of a response message responsive to the data received, as well as the ACK or NACK message. It is therefore possible to determine whether or not data has been normally transmitted. For example, normalcy of data transmission<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> may be determined based on the parity check code used in the third embodiment, and a response message indicating the determination result may be transmitted by using the function of the fourth embodiment.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">A modification of the communication system 1 will be now described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> illustrating the principle thereof.

Also, the transmitter attaches 110000 0111 (+), which is 10B data corresponding to FC and serving as the SOP indicating the start of packet data, to the encoded data and transmits, as communication data, the encoded data whose polarity has been processed by the polarity processor 33.

At the receiving device, it is determined whether or not the polarity of received communication data alternates between positive and negative polarities, data having polarity different from the expected polarity is detected as the polarity-reversed data, and the polarity of the polarity-reversed data is treated as control information. Thus, since the control information can be communicated between the transmitting and receiving devices without decreasing the bandwidth available to users, all channel resources can be devoted to user data, making it possible to improve communication quality.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56986523" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Kommunikationssystem (1) zum Kommunizieren von Daten, umfassend:
