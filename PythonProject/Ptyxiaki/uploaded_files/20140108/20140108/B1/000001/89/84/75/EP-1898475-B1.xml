load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a resistive-type high temperature superconductor based fault current limiter with improved thermal management during quench.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">A high temperature superconductor based fault current limiter (hts-fcl) is a device that automatically limits fault currents in high voltage networks to a low current value close to the nominal current. The benefit of such a device is that it reduces drastically the short circuit power of the high voltage network and, thus, allows to interconnect networks without increasing the short circuit power or to decrease safety margines so that other machineries connected to the network can be designed for lower short circuit power and, therefore, can be made lighter and cheaper.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A hts-fcl makes use of the fact that the high temperature superconductor material looses its superconductivity and transits from the non-resistive superconducting state to a normal state with high electrical resistivity when at least one of the critical current (Ic), the critical temperature (Tc) or the critical magnetic field (Hc) of the superconductor material is exceeded. This transition from the superconducting state to the normal resistive state is called "quenching".</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In normal operation with nominal current In, that is, in the cooled state, the superconductor material is in its superconducting state with essentially zero resistance so that there is no voltage over the whole fcl - the fcl is "invisible" for the network.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In case of fault such as short circuit the current rises to several times the nominal current In exceeding Ic of the superconductor material which causes the superconducting material to transit to the normal resistive state.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The electric resistance R of a fcl in the normal resistive state is generally chosen such that the current which can pass the hts components is not more than about 2 to 6 times, preferably 2 to 3 times, of the nominal current In.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">For example, in a 110 kV network the fcl should limit the current to 5.400 ampere in fault event which corresponds to the threefold of the nominal current of 1.800 ampere. Consequently the hts components should have a normal state resistance of about 20 ohms with R<sub>fcl</sub> = Voltage / limited current.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">There are known hts-fcl which are composed of a bulk component of high temperature superconductor material or of a plurality of such bulk components electrically connected in series.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Within a resistive fcl with the hts components electrically connected in series the components must be very homogenous in view of their properties such as critical current density, critical current, normal state resistivity etc.. If, for example, the critical current Ic of the hts-components or of part of a single component differs quench and in the result heat up is non uniform. Such non uniform heat up would lead to the formation of a temperature gradient within the material of the hts components and in the result to breakage due to thermal shock.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Further, if only the part with lowest Ic starts to quench resistance built up in this part is insufficient to limit the fault current until also the other hts components reach their resistive state. In the consequence without the provision of suitable means such as a breaker this part will heat up and local burn-out can occur.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In general, during fault event when the high temperature superconductor material quenches the material has to absorb a large quantity of energy within a very short time of only some tens of millisecond. In the result within the components a power density is generated which is orders of magnitude too high to be transported into a cooling environment, usually cooling bath, within the necessary short time. Since sufficient heat dissipation is not possible the hts material heats up almost adiabatically until melting of the material. Thus, for avoiding heating up until melting of the material a breaker or likewise means must be provided for taking the fcl from the network.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A further drawback is, that due to the very high power density generated inside the hts material the material can not recover to the superconducting state "under<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> load", that is online, after quench but must be taken from the network for cooling down. However, in the result, when the hts-fcl is offline in order to avoid melting and/or for recovery to the superconducting state the network is not protected against fault events or any other additional protection equipment would be necessary.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Apart from the use as bulk material referred to above there is also known to use hts-material in form of layers, wherein a layer of the hts-material is deposited on a suitable substrate.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">However, for a superconductor layer to have good superconductor properties such as high current density etc. the crystal grains of the superconductor material must have a certain degree of orientation. In particular, the crystal grains should be aligned both perpendicular to the plane of the substrate (c-axis orientation) and parallel to the plane of the substrate (a-b-orientation).<br/>
In general, techniques for obtaining hts-layers with suitable alignment (texture) are well known.<br/>
For example, there are vacuum based processes such as pulsed laser deposition, sputtering and electron beam evaporation.<br/>
A specific example for such vacuum based process is a method called IBAD (Ion beam assisted deposition) wherein on randomly oriented metallic substrates a highly textured buffer layer is deposited which serves to transfer the desired texture to the superconductor layer grown on the buffer layer.<br/>
Further, according to ISD - inclined substrate deposition - texturing of a to be deposited layer is obtained by deposition under specific angle.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In addition, there are wet chemical processes such as metal organic deposition (MOD) including sol-gel method etc..<br/>
In MOD-techniques usually organic compounds of the metals constituting the superconductor material are used as precursors, dissolved in a solvent, deposited on the substrate and converted to the final hts-material by heat treatment.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Substrates with suitable texture are obtainable by RABiTs (rolling assisted biaxial texturing of substrates). Such textured substrates can serve as template for transferring a desired texture to a layer deposited thereon.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5761017B1"><text>US 5,761,017 B1</text></patcit> discloses a hts fault current limiter composed of hts filaments which are at least partially encapsulated in an epoxy having thermal conductivity properties that enable the superconductor to heat rapidly during fault condition while preventing thermal run-away.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">For successful use the choice of epoxy is considered to be critical: Too low of thermal conductivity will result in a device that is essentially adiabatic and will burn-out due to thermal run-away; too high of thermal conductivity will result in a lower ultimate resistance in the device.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">It was the object of the present invention to provide a hts-fcl with improved thermal management which allows prompt and sufficient heat exchange with the environment, such as a cooling reservoir, thereby preventing heating up of the hts material to melt.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">It was also the object of the present invention to provide a hts-fcl which is protected against local burn-out.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Further, it was the object of the present invention to provide a hts-fcl which can automatically recover from its normal resistive state to the superconducting state under load, that is without being taken from the network.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In particular, the present invention relates to a hts-fcl which is capable of working without a breaker for avoiding excessive heat up and for allowing recovery.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to the present invention a resistive-type hts-fcl element is provided comprising a plurality of high temperature superconductor components arranged within a matrix material of thermal conductivity which is at least the thermal conductivity of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, wherein the plurality of high temperature superconductor components is connected electrically in parallel and having the features of claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to a further aspect the high temperature superconductor components of the hts-fcl element of the present invention can be in the form of a hts layer, in particular, a coated conductor comprising a layer of hts material.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to yet a further aspect, the matrix material of thermal conductivity has an outer surface provided with surface area enhancing means.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The hts-fcl of the present invention comprises a plurality of hts-components connected in parallel.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Nominal current In to be transported is, thus, distributed over all the components and in the consequence each single component carries only a respective fraction of the overall nominal current.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Since each single hts component has to carry only a fractional part of the overall nominal current critical current Ic of the hts component can be selected to be low.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In fault event when the hts component with the lowest Ic starts quenching the current is redistributed to the other hts components connected thereto in parallel. Therefore, in the component which first starts to quench heating is only small until all the other parallel components are also in the normal resistive state. Consequently, burn-out of single components can be avoided. Further, the power density created by the fault current is shared by all the hts components connected electrically in parallel so that the maximum heat-up of the individual component is limited.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In addition, by the thermally conductive matrix material heat exchange with the environment, usually the cooling bath of the fault current limiter, is improved so that the heat generated during fault can be effectively dissipated into the cooling medium likewise within a very short time. In the result the hts component can reach a stable temperature which is below room temperature and, in particular, below the melting point of the hts material without the need of a breaker.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">According to the present invention heat exchange can be further improved by providing the outer surface of the matrix material with means enhancing the surface area available for heat exchange, referred to as "surface area enhancing means".</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">According to the present invention by the provision of a matrix material of good thermal conductivity and the use of a plurality of hts-components a resistive type hts-fcl is obtained having improved thermal management, wherein heating-up is controlled by distributing the power density created during fault over the plurality of single hts components as well as by improved heat exchange with the environment.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Thereby not only local burn out can be avoided but also uncontrolled heat-up to a temperature until melting of the material.<br/>
Consequently, it is not necessary to provide a breaker for preventing such uncontrolled heat-up.<br/>
Further, due to the effective heat dissipation into the environment the hts material can return from the normal resistive state to its superconducting state without the need to be taken from the network.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">According to the present invention due to the effective thermal management the fcl will only heat up to a certain temperature Ts at which the fcl is in a stable equilibrium. In order to have a sufficient driving force for heat dissipation usually the temperature Ts is selected to be above the temperature T<sub>B</sub> of the cooling bath. Preferably, T<sub>S</sub> should be further considerably below room temperature.<br/>
Due to the difference between temperature Ts and the temperature T<sub>B</sub> of the cooling bath the ohmic heat produced in the hts components can be exactly conducted into the cooling bath by conduction and convection.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The desired temperature Ts of the fcl can be adjusted, for example, by selection of the number of hts components or by adjustment of the resistance of the hts components etc..</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Preferably, according to the present invention Ts of the fcl should be close to the temperature of the cooling bath T<sub>B</sub>. Preferably, the difference Ts - T<sub>B</sub> is less than 100 K, more preferably less than 50 K, particularly less than 25 K and most preferred less than 10 K.<br/>
It has been observed that at such a Ts cooling back of the fcl to its superconducting state after fault is particularly facilitated even in case that the fcl is connected to the network - that is, online.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Bearing the above in mind it is clear that the required number of hts components can vary depending on external factors such as the nominal current In, desired limited current I<sub>I</sub> etc., as well as on the specific design of the respective fcl such<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> as matrix material, in particular heat conductivity of the matrix material, width of the hts components, surface available for heat dissipation etc..</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">According to the present invention the number of hts-components suitable for the present hts-fcl is determined based on the nominal current as well as the critical current Ic of the components in accordance to the following formula: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mi>Ic</mi><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">x</mi><mo>*</mo><mi>nominal current</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>number of parallel components</mi><mo>,</mo><mspace width="1em"/><mi>with</mi><mspace width="1em"/><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn><mo>&lt;</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">x</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">5</mn><mo>,</mo><mspace width="1em"/><mi>preferably</mi><mspace width="1em"/><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn><mo>&lt;</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">x</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2.</mn></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="141" he="11" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0039" num="0039">For the present invention, in order to keep the power density small which is created within each single hts component during fault also the critical current Ic of each hts-component should be only small.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Referring to the example set out above with a nominal current of 1800 A and Ic of 50 A according to the formula above the desired number of components should be between 36 and 72.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Consequently, in the hts-fcl element of the present invention the number of hts-components n = x * nominal current/Ic (component), with x being a value between 1 and 5 (1 &lt; x &lt; 5), in particular 1 &lt; x &lt; 2.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In view of the above, the number of the hts components present is from 10 to 100, preferably more than 25, more preferably more than 50 and particularly preferred more than 75.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Further, a suitable Ic of the hts components for nowadays applications as referred to above is 50 A or less.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">However, as is clear, Ic of the hts component can vary depending on the specific application and design of the fcl element.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In principle, for the present invention any hts material can be used.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">An example of a suitable superconducting material is the oxide high temperature superconductor REBCO with RE being Rare Earth metal or one of the Bi, TI or<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> Hg superconductors can be used.

If hts materials of high critical current density are used it is possible to reduce the thickness of the hts layers in order to obtain the desired critical current of about 50 A.

That is, if the superconductor material quenches and transits to its normal resistive state the overall resistance of the component can be enhanced by the provision of the connection of high resistance 4 resulting in improved current restricting performance</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The reason therefore is that during fault event the current runs through the whole hts-component inclusive the hts layer 3, the substrate 1, the connection layer 4 and even the buffer layer(s) 2 provided that they are conductive. Since the resistances of these constituting parts of the hts component are connected in parallel it is preferred that the materials of which they are made are selected to have high resistivities in order to obtain a high overall resistance. Moreover, the higher the resistance of the hts component in its normal resistive state the lower the amount and length of component required to reach the total resistance needed for the fcl which is advantageous in terms of costs.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">For illustrating the above statement the following example is given.<br/>
A substrate of 1 cm width and 25 micron thickness of Hastelloy G276 has a resistivity of ρ = 130 µΩcm and, consequently, a resistance of 4 Ω/m for a given substrate stripe. Since usually the superconductor layer will develop a resistivity of about 150 - 800 µΩcm in its normal resistive state and is only some micron thin the resistance of the superconductor layer will be much higher than that of the substrate. Consequently, in case of a fault most of the current will flow in the substrate.<br/>
In view of the above preferably the connection layer 4 has at least a similar resistivity as the substrate. Further preferably, its overall cross section should be not greater than that of the substrate.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058"><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Figure 2</b></figref> shows a sectional view along the horizontal direction of an fault current limiter element according to the present invention.
