within a body are known in the art. Such devices may include, inter alia, various endoscopic imaging systems and devices for performing imaging in various internal body cavities.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20040111031A1"><text>US2004/0111031A1</text></patcit> discloses a spectral polarizing tomographic dermatoscope. Document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20030174208A1"><text>US2003/0174208A1</text></patcit> discloses a capsule shaped in-vivo imaging system.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> which is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of a prior art autonomous in-vivo imaging device. The device 10A typically includes a capsule-like housing 18 having a wall 18A. The device 10A has an optical window 21 and an imaging system for obtaining images from inside a body cavity or lumen, such as the GI tract. The imaging system may include an illumination unit 23. The illumination unit 23 may include one or more light sources 23A. The one or more light sources 23A may be a white light emitting diode (LED), or any other suitable light source, known in the art. The imaging system of the device 10A includes an imager 24, which acquires the images and an optical system 22 which focuses the images onto the imager 24.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In some configurations when a capsule or tube shaped device is used, the imager 24 may be arranged so that its light sensing surface 28 is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the device 40. Other arrangements may be used.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The illumination unit 23 illuminates the inner portions of the body lumen through an optical window 21. Device 10A further includes a transmitter 26 and an antenna 27 for transmitting the video signal of the imager 24, and one or more power sources 25. The power source(s) 25 may be any suitable power sources such as but not limited to silver oxide batteries, lithium batteries, or other electrochemical cells having a high energy density, or the like. The power source(s) 25 may provide power to the electrical elements of the device 10A.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Typically, in the gastrointestinal application, as the device 10A is transported through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the imager, such as but not limited to the multi-pixel imager 24 of the device 10A, acquires images (frames) which are processed and transmitted to an external receiver/recorder (not shown) worn by the patient for recording and storage. The recorded data may then be downloaded from the receiver/recorder to a computer or workstation (not shown) for display and analysis.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">During the movement of the device 10A through the GI tract, the imager may acquire frames at a fixed or at a variable frame acquisition rate. For example, in one example the imager (such as, but not limited to the imager 24 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) may acquire images at, for example, a fixed rate of two frames per second (2 Hz). However, other different frame rates may also be used, depending, inter alia, on the type and characteristics of the specific imager or camera or sensor array implementation that is used, and on the available transmission bandwidth of the transmitter 26. The downloaded images may be displayed by the workstation by replaying them at a desired frame rate. In this way, the expert or physician examining the data is provided with a movie-like video playback, which may enable the physician to review the passage of the device through the GI tract.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Decreasing the cross-sectional area of such devices may be limited by the cross-sectional area of the imaging sensor, such as for example the imager 24 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. In order to decrease the size and the cross sectional area of the imaging sensor one may need to reduce the pixel size.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In certain imaging sensors, the area of a single pixel cannot be indefinitely reduced in size because the sensitivity of the pixel depends on the amount of light impinging on the pixel which in turn may depend on the pixel area.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Typically, color imaging in imaging sensors may be achieved by using an array of color pixels. For example, in a color image sensor such as the imaging sensor 24 of the device 10A of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, there may be three types of pixels in the imager. Each type of pixel may have a special filter layer deposited thereon. Generally, but not necessarily, the filters may be red filters, green filters and<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> blue filters (also known as RGB filters). The use of a combination of pixels having red, green and blue filters is also known in the art as the RGB color imaging method. Other color imaging methods may utilize different color pixel combinations, such as the cyan-yellow-magenta color pixels (CYMK) method.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The pixels with the color filters may be arranged on the surface of the imager in different patterns. For example, one type of color pixel arrangement pattern is known in the art as the Bayer CFA pattern (originally developed by Kodak™). Other color pixel patterns may also be used.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">A problem encountered in the use of RGB color pixel arrays within in-vivo imaging device such as swallowable capsules, or catheter-like devices, or endoscopes, or endoscope like devices, is that for color imaging, one typically needs to use imagers having multiplets of color pixels. Thus, for example in an imager using RGB pixel triplets, each triplet of pixels roughly equals one image pixel because a reading of the intensities of light recorded by the red pixel, the green pixel and the blue pixel are required to generate a single color image pixel. Thus, the image resolution of such a color image may be lower than the image resolution obtainable by a black and white imaging sensor having the same number of pixels. The converse of this is that for a given number of pixels a greater area may be needed for the imager.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A further problem encountered in in-vivo imaging with an autonomous device is the reflection by a turbid media such as liquids or particles floating in a body lumen of light emitted by an illumination unit 23. Such reflected light may cloud or impair an image of a target tissue or wall of a body lumen.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A further problem encountered in in-vivo imaging with an autonomous device is the limitation of images that can be captured to images of the upper surface of a wall of a body lumen. Characteristics such as pathologies of lower layers of tissues may not be clearly visible in in-vivo images captured by prior art autonomous in vivo devices.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">The invention is herein described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like components are designated by like reference numerals, wherein:

All the blue light sources 57 may be switched on within the duration of the time period 44A (<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 3</figref>) and terminated at the end of the time period 44A. The advantage<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> of the light source configuration of the device 50 is that the red, green and blue light sources may distribute the light relatively evenly to achieve relatively uniform light distribution in the field of view of the optical imaging system 22B (<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 4</figref>). Other configurations may be used, such as configurations not using different banks of colored lights.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">It is noted that while the specific light source configuration illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 4</figref> is suitable for performing an embodiment of the color imaging method of the present invention, many other different light source configurations including different numbers of light sources, different spectra and colors, and different types of light sources may be used. Moreover, the number and the geometrical arrangement of the red, green and blue light sources 55, 56, and 57, respectively, within the four illumination elements 53A, 53B, 53C, and 53D may be different. Furthermore, the number of the illumination elements and their arrangement with respect to the optical system 22B may also be varied.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">It is noted that the color imaging method and device disclosed hereinabove need not be limited to methods and devices using RGB illumination sources or the RGB method for color imaging. Other types of color imaging methods may also be used. For example, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention the light source(s) 30A, 30B, and 30C may be adapted for used with the CYMK method which is well known in the art, by using light sources producing light having cyan, yellow and magenta spectral characteristics as is known in the art. This adaptation may be performed, for example, by using white or approximately white or broadband light sources in combination with suitable cyan, yellow and magenta filters. Other, different spectral color combinations known in the art may also be used.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">The use of the CYMK color method may also require proper adaptation of the data processing for color processing and color balancing.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">It is noted that the RGB or CYMK illuminating method disclosed hereinabove may have the advantage that they may allow the use of an imaging sensor having a third of the number of color pixels used in a conventional color imager having pixel triplets (such as, but not limited to red, green, and blue pixel triplets or cyan, yellow, and magenta pixel triplets, or the like). In this way, one<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> may reduce the size and the light sensitive area of the imaging sensor without reducing the nominal image resolution.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">The use of, for example, the three color illumination periods disclosed hereinabove for an embodiment of the present invention, may provide three temporally separate exposures of the imaging sensor to three different types of colored light, may have other advantages. For example, in the RGB example disclosed hereinabove, the three consecutive exposures of the same pixels to red, green and blue light, the data available after the completion of an imaging cycle includes the intensity of red, green and blue light values which were measured for each pixel of the imaging sensor. It is therefore possible to directly use the measured values for displaying a color image which may simplify the data processing and may improve the resolution and the color quality or fidelity (such as, for example, by reducing color aliasing effects). This is in contrast with other color imaging methods, used in imaging sensors having color pixels arranged in triplets or other arrangement types on the imaging sensor, in which it is necessary to perform the post-processing computations for interpolating or approximating the approximate color intensity at each pixel by using the data of the surrounding pixels having different (or complementary) colors.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">It is noted that for autonomous in vivo imaging devices which may be moved through, for example, the GI tract or through other body cavities, caution must be exercised in choosing the duration of the imaging cycle and of the duration of the illumination time periods 42A, 43A and 44A, and the duration of the readout time periods 42B, 43B, and 44B. In some embodiments, the duration of these time periods should be as short as possible to reduce the probability that the device 40 may be moved a substantial distance in the GI tract (or other body cavity or lumen) within the duration of any single imaging cycle. If such a substantial movement of the device 40 occurs within the duration of a single imaging cycle, the "red", "green" and "blue" acquired images may not be identical (or in other words may not properly register), which may introduce errors in the processing of the final color image which may in turn cause the color image to be blurred or smeared or distorted or not<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> representative of the shape or the true color of the imaged object. Thus, typically, each of the different precursor images captured within an imaging cycle captures substantially the same image or view (e.g., the same view of a portion of an in-vivo area), using a different color or spectrum. Significant movement in between images may result in a different view being imaged. Of course, where movement is less of a problem, timing may be less of an issue.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">In insertable devices such as endoscopes or catheter-like devices, the device may be held relatively static with respect to the imaged object, which may allow the use longer duration of the illumination time periods 42A, 43A and 44A, and the duration of the readout time periods 42B, 43B, and 44B.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088"><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 5A</figref> illustrates a series of steps of a method according to an embodiment of the present invention.
