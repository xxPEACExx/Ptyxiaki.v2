Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the wireless LAN system includes a basic service set (BSS) 10, the Internet 11, and a content server 12.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The BSS 10 includes a wireless terminal 101 and an access point (AP) 102. A wireless terminal 101, which is a type of subscriber terminal requesting wireless LAN services, is called a station. The AP 102 is connected to a wired network, such as the Internet 11, or is wired, via a distribution system (DS), to another AP (not shown) that constitutes another BSS so that the AP 102 can bridge the Internet 11 and another network.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The station, i.e., the wireless terminal 101, has a hierarchical structure shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>, the station includes a radio frequency (RF) layer 20, a baseband layer 21, and a media access control (MAC) layer 22. Here, the RF layer 20 and the baseband layer 21 are called physical layers.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The MAC layer 22 receives carrier sense information from the physical layers, i.e., the RF layer 20 and the baseband layer 21, and determines, based on the received carrier sense information, whether a wireless medium is currently being used before transmitting a frame to a receiving station. If the wireless medium is in an idle state, a sending station transmits the frame to the receiving station. All stations within a propagation range of the sending station can<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> determine whether the wireless medium is being used when the frame is transmitted thereto by referring to a duration field value of the frame. The receiving station, which receives the frame from the sending station, transmits an acknowledgement (ACK) frame to the sending station, a process which is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3A</figref>. Writing the time of use of the wireless medium into a frame and transmitting the frame is called virtual carrier sense.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Since wireless LAN systems are mainly employed in portable or mobile devices, battery power has always been an important issue to be dealt with. Current wireless LAN systems consume about 80% or more of their energy while performing operations on the physical layers.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In order to minimize power consumption, stations adopt a power management program so that they can operate with low power consumption. The power management program is used in an infrastructure network using the AP 102. Power management of the stations can be carried out every predetermined number of beacon cycles by using the power management program. Each beacon cycle lasts for an average of 100 msec. During the exchange of power management frames in a network, the AP 102 needs to buffer the power management frames, which makes it impossible to control power of the station every 100 msec or less. Therefore, if a station consumes too much power during a real-time bi-directional service, such as a voice/video call, it cannot properly provide the real-time bi-directional service.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3B</figref> is a timing diagram illustrating a virtual carrier sense operation performed by stations in a wireless LAN environment. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3B</figref>, first through third stations STA-1, STA-2, and STA-3 and other stations periodically perform virtual carrier sense operations to share a wireless medium. For example, in a case where the first station STA-1 transmits (30) a frame to the third station STA-3, the second station STA-2 and the other stations, which are not the target stations for the frame consume as much power as they carry out a virtual carrier sense operation (31). In response to the receipt of the frame, the third station STA-3 transmits (32) an ACK message, which indicates that no error has occurred in the received frame, to the first station STA-1. The second station STA-2 and the other stations also carry out the virtual carrier sense (33).<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> -->Therefore, each of the second station STA-2 and the other stations unnecessarily consumes as much power as the first station STA-1 does.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Stations constituting a wireless LAN system consume power when transmitting and receiving frames to and from one another or carrying out a virtual carrier sense operation. Each of the stations consumes 30 - 50 % more power when transmitting a frame than when receiving a frame. In addition, each of the stations consumes power only for transmitting a frame after performing a carrier sense operation. When performing the carrier sense operation, each of the stations consumes as much power as they receive a frame. In a case where a plurality of stations share a wireless medium, however, they consume more power when carrying out a carrier sense operation than when transmitting a frame. For example, in a case where 20 or more stations share a single wireless medium for a predetermined amount of time, they consume at least 10 times more power when carrying out a virtual carrier sense operation than when transmitting a frame. Therefore, in a wireless network structure, such as a hot spot, in which a plurality of stations are served by one AP, the plurality of stations consume most of their power carrying out a virtual carrier sense operation. Consequently, it is necessary to reduce the power consumption of the plurality of stations consumed when the plurality of stations carry out the virtual carrier sense.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6580700B"><text>US 6 580 700</text></patcit> discloses a wireless LAN in which data rate is analysed by a mobile unit to indentify the most eligible access point at the highest data rate.

Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>, the hierarchical structure of the station includes a radio frequency (RF) layer 41, a baseband layer 42, and a media access control (MAC) layer 43. The RF layer 41 includes an RF/IF signal processor 411, which receives an RF signal via an antenna 40, converts the received RF signal into an intermediate frequency (IF) signal, and converts the IF signal into a baseband signal, a voltage controlled oscillator-phase locked loop (VCO-PLL) 412, which provides a reference frequency to the RF/IF signal processor 411, and a first register 413, which stores data necessary for the operation of the RF/IF signal processor 411 and provides the data to the RF/IF signal processor 411.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The baseband layer 42 includes an analog-to-digital converter 421, which converts the baseband signal output from the RF/IF signal processor 411 into a digital signal, a baseband signal processor 422, which demodulates the digital signal output from the analog-to-digital converter 421 using a demodulation method, such as a frequency-shift keying (FSK) method, thereby recovering the original signal, and a second register 423, which stores data necessary for the operation of the analog-to-digital converter 421 and the baseband signal processor 422 and provides the data to the analog-digital converter 421 and the baseband signal processor 422.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The MAC layer 43 includes a MAC service access point (SAP) 431, which receives frames from the baseband signal processor 422, a received power controller 433, which controls power of the station based on frames received from the MAC SAP 431, and a frame processor 432, which communicates with a host (not shown) by carrying out protocol control or direct memory access.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">When receiving a signal, power of the station is controlled in the following manner. <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram illustrating a method of controlling power according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. More specifically, <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the operation of the received power controller 433.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>, the received power controller 433 receives a PLCP frame and a MAC frame via the MAC SAP 431 in step 50. The PLCP frame and the MAC frame include various information, including header information and MAC frame transmission speed information. <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the structure of a PLCP data unit (PPDU). Referring to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref>, the PPDU includes a PLCP preamble, a PLCP header, and a MAC sublayer protocol data unit (MPDU). In <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref>, a synchronization field (sync) is used for obtaining incoming signals and synchronizing the incoming signals, and a start-of-frame-delimiter field (SFD) includes information indicating a beginning point in the PPDU. A signal field (SIGNAL) indicates an adopted modulation scheme, and a service field (SERVICE) is a reserved field. A length field (LENGTH) indicates an amount of time required to transmit the MPDU, and a cyclical redundancy check (CRC) field has a frame check sequence (FCS) value calculated by a transmitting station. The PLCP preamble and the PLCP header can be transmitted at a speed of 1 Mbps, and the MPDU can be transmitted at a speed of 1 or 2 Mbps.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In step 51, the received power controller 433 extracts transmission speed information and frame transmission period information from the information received in step 50. In step 52, the received power controller 433 determines a power-controlled period, by interpreting the extracted information. The frame transmission period information can be obtained from a duration field of each MAC frame.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIGS. 7(a) through 7(c)</figref> illustrate different examples of MAC frames. More specifically, <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7(a)</figref> illustrates the structure of a request-to-send (RTS) frame,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7(b)</figref> illustrates the structure of a clear-to-send (CTS) frame, and <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7(c)</figref> illustrates the structure of a data frame. In <figref idrefs="f0006">FIGS. 7(a) through 7(c)</figref>, RA represents a reception address, and TA represents a transmission address. In <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7(c)</figref>, ADDRESSES 1 through 4 are address fields, which can be respectively classified as one of a transmission address, a reception address, and a group address.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A power-controlled period for the baseband layer 42 is calculated independently of a power-controlled period for the RF layer 41 because the time taken for the baseband layer 42 to stabilize differs from the time taken for the RF layer 41 to stabilize. For example, given the current level of technology, it takes the baseband layer 42 no more than 5 microseconds to stabilize, while it takes the RF layer 41 no more than 10 microseconds to stabilize.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Once the power-controlled period of the baseband layer 42 and the RF layer 42 is determined, the received power controller 433 compares its address with a reception address of the received MAC frame in step 53. If the reception address of the received MAC frame is identical to the address of the received power controller 433, the method returns to step 50, a PLCP is continuously received, and the frame processor 432 performs an operation. In step 53, if the reception address of the received MAC frame is different from the address of the received power controller 433 in step 53, the received power controller 433 switches current modes of the baseband layer 42 and the RF layer 41 to low power modes during the power-controlled period determined in step 52. When the baseband layer 42 is in a low power mode, all the elements thereof except for the second register 423 are powered down and clocks provided thereto are all blocked. When the RF layer 41 is in the low power mode, all the elements thereof, except for the VCO-PLL 412 and the first register 413, are powered down. The first and second registers 413 and 423 and the VCO-PLL 412 are preferably continuously supplied with power because they require more time to stabilize after they are powered than the rest of the baseband layer 42 and the RF layer 41.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">When power is cut off, the received power controller 433 counts the power-controlled period in step 55. If the power-controlled period of the RF layer 41 is over, the received power controller 433 applies power to the RF layer 41 so<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> that the RF layer 41 can be switched from the low power mode to a normal operational mode. Once the RF layer 41 is powered, it stabilizes within 10 microseconds.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">When the RF layer 41 returns to the normal operational mode and the power-controlled period of the baseband layer 42 is over, the received power controller 433 applies power to the baseband layer 42 so that the baseband layer 42 can be switched from the low power mode to the normal operational mode.

Referring to <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8</figref>, when a first station STA-1 transmits (80) a MAC frame to a third station STA-3, a second station STA-2 and other stations, like the third station STA-3, carry out a carrier sense operation (81) so that they consume as much power as the third station STA-3. However, once the second station STA-2 and the other stations determine that the MAC frame is not directed thereto, they shift a current mode of each layer to a low power mode (82). When the third station STA-3 transmits (83) an ACK frame to the first station STA-1, the second station STA-2 and the other stations also carry out a virtual carrier sense (84). However, once the second station STA-2 and the other stations determine that the ACK frame is not directed thereto, they shift the current mode of each layer to the low power mode (85).</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The method of controlling the power consumption of stations according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention was simulated under a circumstance where two stations and an AP were used in an Internet environment with some traffic. Simulation results show that the power consumption of stations in the present invention can be reduced to 30 - 50 % of the power consumption of stations in the prior art.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">According to the present invention, it is possible to control the power consumption of stations in a hardware manner while the stations carry out a carrier sense operation. Thus, it is possible to minimize the power consumption of the stations in a bi-directional real-time communication service. The present invention complies with the IEEE 802.11 standard, and thus it can be readily applied to IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN systems. If the present invention is applied to a structure, into which a MAC layer, a baseband layer, and an RF layer are integrated in a silicon-on-chip manner, power conservation can be maximized. In addition, the present invention can be easily applied to field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or digital signal processors (DSPs).</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56987522" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Verfahren zum Steuern des Stromverbrauchs einer Station, wenn sie ein drahtloses Signal empfängt, unter Verwendung einer hierarchischen Struktur, die eine Hochfrequenzschicht (41) und eine Basisbandschicht (42) umfasst, wobei das Verfahren Folgendes umfasst:
