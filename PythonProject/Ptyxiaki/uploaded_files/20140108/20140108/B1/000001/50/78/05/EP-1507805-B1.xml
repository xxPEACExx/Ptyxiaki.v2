In principle, however, higher concentrations are also possible.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The suspension polymerization is carried out in an inert dispersion medium which is customary for the Ziegler low-pressure process, for example in an aliphatic or cyclo-aliphatic<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> hydrocarbon; examples thereof which may be mentioned are, for example, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, isooctane, cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane.

The bulk densities are comparable with those in accordance with the prior art.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Thus, on use of the gelatinous magnesium alkoxide dispersions produced in accordance with the invention by prior heat treatment and subsequent vigorous stirring, using a stirring element, or shearing, using a high-performance shearing tool, a suspension of the ground magnesium alkoxide in an inert hydrocarbon in which the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> magnesium alkoxide particles are insoluble, the morphological properties of the polymer powder can be influenced directly. This means valuable advantages for an industrial process, in addition to which it should in particular be emphasized that transport of the polymer powder in the plant is simpler, the flowability of the polymer powder is better, impurities due to coarse fractions (fisheyes) are reduced, drying requires less energy and the extruder can be operated at higher throughputs. The high catalyst productivity gives rise to lower catalyst residue contents in the product.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In the context of the working examples described below, by means of which the invention is intended to be explained still more clearly to the person skilled in the art, the Mg:Ti:Cl ratios for characterization of the catalysts were determined by conventional analytical methods.
