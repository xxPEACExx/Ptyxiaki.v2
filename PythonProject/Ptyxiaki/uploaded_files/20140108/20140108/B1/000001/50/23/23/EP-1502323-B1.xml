to reflect array antennas, and more particularly to a microstrip asymmetric-element phase shifting reflect array antenna.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Many radar, electronic warfare and communication systems require a circularly polarized antenna with high gain and low axial ratio. Conventional mechanically scanned reflector antennas are available to meet these specifications. However, such antennas are bulky, difficult to install, and subject to performance degradation in winds. Planar phased arrays may also be employed in these applications. However, these antennas are costly because of the large number of expensive GaAs Monolithic microwave integrated circuit components, including an amplifier and phase shifter at each array element as well as a feed manifold and complex packaging. Furthermore, attempts to feed each microstrip element from a common input/output port becomes impractical due to the high losses incurred in the long microstrip transmission lines, especially in large arrays.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Conventional microstrip reflect array antennas use an array of microstrip antennas as collecting and radiating elements. Conventional reflect array antennas use either delay lines of fixed lengths connected to each microstrip element to produce a fixed beam or use an electronic phase shifter connected to each microstrip element to produce an electronically scanning beam. These conventional reflect array antennas are not desirable because the fixed beam reflect arrays suffer from gain ripple over the reflect array operating bandwidth, and the electronically scanned reflect array suffer from high cost and high phase shifter losses.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is also known that a desired phase variation across a circularly polarized array is achievable by mechanically rotating the individual circularly polarized array elements. Miniature mechanical motors or rotators have been used to rotate each array element to the appropriate angular orientation. However, the use of such mechanical rotation devices and the controllers introduce mechanical reliability problems. Further, the manufacturing process of such antennas are labor intensive and costly.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4053895A"><text>U. S. Patent No. 4,053, 895</text></patcit> entitled "Electronically Scanned Microstrip Antenna Array" issued to Malagisi on October 11, 1977, antennas having at least two pairs of diametrically opposed short circuit shunt switches placed at different angles around the periphery of a microstrip disk is described. The shunt switches connect the periphery of the microstrip disk to a ground reference plane. Phase shifting of the circularly polarized reflect array elements is achieved by varying the angular position of the short-circuit plane created by diametrically opposed pairs of diode shunt switches. This antenna is of limited utility because of the complicated labor intensive manufacturing process required to connect the shunt switches and associated bias network between the microstrip disk and ground, as well as the cost of the circuitry required to control the diodes.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">We are aware of <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5835062A"><text>US Patent number 5 835 062</text></patcit>, which discloses a flat panel-configured electronically steered phased array antenna comprising an array of elements each having an even number of dipole antenna elements externally away from a centre point.

The reflect array antenna of the present invention enables an increase in the number of phase states for the reflect array elements, while reducing the number of switches required to provide electronic beam scanning. The reflect array antenna of the present invention provides increased performance for a given frequency, that is, a greater number of discreet phase states for a given number of switches. Alternatively, the described reflect array antenna provides improved performance (number of phase states) at a higher frequency due to<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the ability to utilize fewer switches and therefore provide phase shift integration. This enables the claimed reflect array antenna to be used as an electronically steered array (ESA) at millimeter wave frequencies for applications requiring low cost, for example, millimeter wave communication apertures, and millimeter wave missile seekers.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a reflect array antenna comprising a non-electrically conductive substrate with the antenna array supported on the substrate. Each array of the antenna comprises patch antenna elements having a plurality of notches formed in the antenna element, the notches are angularly displaced around the circumference of the element. A plurality of stub short transmission lines are individually positioned in each of the plurality of notches.

As illustrated, the antenna 10 includes a substantially flat circular disk 12 supporting a plurality of subarrays 14 where each subarray 14 supports a plurality of array elements 16 disposed in a regular and repeating pattern as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2</figref>. The array elements 16 may be etched on the top side of an insulating dielectric sheet, which may be supported and strengthened by a thicker flat panel. For high frequencies, the array elements may be constructed as thin or thick film metallization on a semiconductor substrate.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref>, the subarrays 14 supporting antenna elements 16 are arranged in rows and columns on the disk 12. A subreflector 18 is located above the disk 12, either centered (as shown) or offset over the plurality of subarrays 14. The subreflector 18 is supported from the disk 12 by supports 20. Energy captured by the subreflector 18 is focused onto a feed horn 22 connected to processing circuitry for the radio frequency energy captured by the antenna elements 16 of the subarrays 14.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Although the antenna 10 is shown on a substantially flat substrate 12, it will be understood that the invention contemplates substrates that may be curved or formed to some physical contour to meet installation requirements or space limitations. The variation in the substrate plane geometry and the spherical wavefront from the feed and steering of the beam may be corrected by modifying the phase shift state of array elements 16. Further, the subarrays 14 may be fabricated separately and then assembled on site to increase the portability of the antenna and facilitate its installation and deployment.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURES 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, the reflect array antenna of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref> utilizes antenna elements 16 comprising switched microstrip stubs 24 arranged around the perimeter of circular microstrip patch radiating elements 26. Incident circularly polarized energy is captured by the patch radiating elements 26 and reflected with a phase shift that depends on which stub is electrically short circuited to the patch radiating element. Each circular microstrip patch radiating element 26 has an odd number of microstrip stubs 24 arranged at uniform angular increments around the perimeter of the antenna element. Each of the microstrip stubs 24 are inset into notches 28 extending from the perimeter of the antenna element 26 for impedance matching as will be explained. Electronic switches 30 such as PIN diodes FETS or MEMS are interconnected to a respective microstrip stub 24 by means of bond wires 32. The requirement of the electronic switches 30 is that when a switch is in the "off" or "on" state, it is a good RF open or short circuit, respectively.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURE 3</figref>, PIN diodes are utilized as the electronic switches 30 and function as the reflect array control elements. The chip diodes shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURE 3</figref> are mounted to the surface of the radiating element 26 typically by means of a conducting adhesive. The top surface of each diode is connected to one of the microstrip stubs 24 by means of the bond wires 32 and to a DC bias connection (not shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURE 3</figref>) using bond wires 34. When a positive voltage is applied to one of the DC bias connections, the respective electronic switch 30 is forward biased, thereby creating an RF short circuit by operation of the electronic switch thereby allowing a current to flow between one of the microstrip stubs 24 and the respective patch radiating element 26. Thus, the electronic switches 30 control the phase of the reflective energy, for example, with five stubs as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURE 3</figref>, relative phase shifts of 0 degrees, 72 degrees, 144 degrees, 216 degrees, and 280 degrees, may be achieved. An alternative fabrication method uses a semiconductor substrate 14 with all of the PIN diodes constructed at once using<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> established semiconductor manufacturing process. This method would make it possible to use the reflect array at millimeter wave frequencies, where the small dimensions of the patches and stubs would make individually-placed and wire-bonded diodes impractical.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A feature of the present invention is the use of asymmetric inset microstrip stubs 24. As previously mentioned, the stubs are inset into the perimeter of the radiating element 26 for impedance matching since the stubs 24 serve as short transmission line sections. For best operation, the microstrip stubs 24 are impedance matched to the patch radiating element 26 at the connection points of the electronic switches 30. Typically, the input impedance of a circular patch radiating element 26 is 300 to 500 Ohms at the perimeter, while the microstrip stubs typically have a 100 Ohm characteristic impedance. The insets place the attachment points inside the patch perimeter, where its input impedance is nearer to 100 Ohms.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURES 3 and 4</figref>, an individual antenna element 16 comprises a metallic disk member 26, a metallic ground plane member 36, and dielectric medium 38 and 39 functioning as insulating layers (the RF substrate 38 and DC substrate 39). Also comprising each of the radiating elements 26 is a DC bias connection metallized conductor 40 on the bottom side of the insulating layer 39. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURE 4</figref>, the two dielectric medium substrates 38 and 39 are isolated from each other by means of the ground plane 36 which comprises metallization on either the bottom of the RF substrate 38 or the top of the DC substrate 39. A DC bias connection from the conductor 40 to the bond wires 34 are by means of vias 42 passing through small holes in the ground plane 36. Also metallized on the top surface of the RF substrate 38 are the microstrip stubs 24.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The antenna elements 16 either singly or in an array are fabricated by etching a printed circuit board or semiconductor substrate using conventional microcircuit techniques. The center of each circular radiating element 26 is short-circuited to the ground plane 36 by an RF ground via 44.
