useful as a raw material for optical lenses, films, optical fibers, optical disks, heat-resisting resins, engineering plastics, and others.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Recently, in polymers (e.g., a polycarbonate-series resin, an epoxy resin, and a polyester-series resin) made from a bisphenol compound as a raw material, materials having improved heat resistance, transparency and high refractive index compared with the conventional one have been strongly required. A 9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene, which is one of fluorene derivatives, is a promising material for producing a polymer being excellent in heat resistance and having high transparency and high refractive index, and is expected as a raw material for an optical lens such as an automotive headlamp lens, a compact disk (CD), a CD-ROM pickup lens, a Fresnel lens, a fθ lens for laser printer, a camera lens, and a projection lens for rear projection television; a film such as a retardation film, and a diffusion film; a plastic optical fiber; and an optical disk substrate.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As a synthetic method for 9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene, there has been known a method which comprises subjecting fluorenone, as a starting material, obtained by air oxidation of fluorene to a condensation reaction with phenol using a hydrogen chloride gas and mercaptopropionic acid as catalysts [<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>J.

Moreover, the handling of the hydrogen chloride gas is under the control of various laws such as Fire Defense Law, High Pressure Gas Control Law, Poisonous and Deleterious Substances Control Law, and Clean Air Act Law. It is therefore necessary to pay sufficient attention to safety measures and environmental protection for installation of equipment, and handling and storage of the hydrogen chloride gas.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Incidentally, in the case using a concentrated sulfuric acid as an acid catalyst, the reaction is progressed by the dehydration property of the concentrated<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> sulfuric acid despite of the presence of water. However, since a sulfuric acid-containing waste fluid is discharged in large quantity, the treatment of the waste fluid requires a great deal of labor.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">On the other hand, a fluorene derivative obtainable by a production method using a hydrogen chloride gas or a concentrated sulfuric acid as a catalyst usually includes impurities such as a sulfonated compound, and turns out yellow. Accordingly, in order to use the fluorene derivative obtained by the method, as a raw material for the above-described polycarbonate-series resin or polyester-series resin in which high transparency is required, it is necessary to purify the fluorene derivative highly and strictly. Therefore, various purification methods have been examined [e.g., Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP6321836A"><text>321836/1994</text></patcit> (<patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP6321836A"><text>JP-6-321836</text></patcit>)].

As the acidic medium, there is used hydrochloric acid. However, the amounts of the reactants as used in the known method lead to purities, yields, colours and transparency properties, which are still unsatisfactory.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for producing a fluorene derivative safely and simply at high yield without using a hydrogen chloride gas having handling difficulty.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for producing a highly transparent and highly purified fluorene derivative safely and simply without complicated purification.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0003">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The inventors of the present invention made intensive studies to achieve the above objects in view of few problems of the conventional art mentioned above, and finally found that a fluorene derivative being scarcely colored and excellent in transparency can be simply or conveniently obtained by using a hydrochloric acid aqueous solution instead of a hydrogen chloride gas, and carrying out a reaction in coexistence with a thiol compound.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">That is, in the present invention, fluorenone and a phenolic compound represented by the formula (I) are subjected to a condensation reaction in coexistence with a thiol compound and a hydrochloric acid aqueous solution to produce a fluorene derivative represented by the formula (II):

According to the production method of the present invention, use of the thiol compound and hydrochloric acid at the above proportion ensures a simple (or convenient) production of a fluorene derivative excellent in transparency.</p><heading id="h0010">[Production method of fluorene derivative]</heading><p id="p0035" num="0035">The production process of the present invention may be conducted by charging fluorenone, a phenolic compound (I), a thiol compound, and the hydrochloric acid aqueous solution in a reactor, and stirring the mixture<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> under an atmosphere of an inert gas. As the inert gas, for example, there may be utilized a nitrogen gas, an argon gas, and a helium gas.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The reaction temperature varies with the kind of a phenolic compound or a thiol compound to be used, and is usually about 10 to 100°C (e.g., about 10 to 80°C) and preferably about 20 to 50°C. When the reaction temperature is too low, the reaction rate becomes slow. When the reaction temperature is too high, a side reaction occurs and results in the yield deterioration.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a solvent such as toluene and xylene, and may be usually carried out in the absence of a solvent. Moreover, use of an excessive amount of the phenolic compound as a solvent can make the reaction more smoothly.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The progress of the reaction may be followed up by an analytical means such as a liquid chromatography, and the point that an amount of unreacted fluorenone becomes not more than 0.5% by weight in the reaction mixture may be determined as an end point. The reaction mixture after completion of the reaction usually contains unreacted fluorenone, an unreacted phenolic compound, the catalyst, by-product(s), and others in addition to a fluorene derivative as a reaction product.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">After completion of the reaction, a highly purified fluorene derivative is obtained from the reaction mixture by a conventional manner (e.g., a means such as<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> concentration, extraction, crystallization, filtration and chromatography, or a separation and purification means by combination thereof). In particular, by at least a crystallizing operation, especially by combination of a distributing operation and a crystallizing operation, a color-free fluorene derivative with a high purity can be obtained simply and easily. The distributing operation may for example be carried out by adding an extractant (an organic solvent alone, or a mixed solvent of an organic solvent and water) to the reaction mixture to transfer or extract the object compound into an organic layer. The crystallizing operation may be carried out by optionally condensing the organic layer, then adding a crystallization solvent to the organic layer, and optionally cooling the resultant mixture.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">After removing the remaining hydrochloric acid and the thiol compound from the reaction mixture, a crystallization solvent is usually added to the residue for mixing and dissolving. More specifically, a purified fluorene derivative may be obtained by subjecting fluorenone and an excessive amount of a phenolic compound to a condensation reaction in coexistence with β-mercaptopropionic acid and hydrochloric acid, adding an extractant to the reaction mixture for distributing a fluorene derivative to an organic layer, condensing the organic layer, and adding a crystallization solvent to the residue to crystallize an object compound. Moreover, a<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> fluorene derivative may be crystallized by neutralizing the reaction mixture with an alkaline aqueous solution to remove the aqueous layer, condensing the organic layer, and adding a crystallization solvent to the residue.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The neutralizing treatment may be conducted by adding at least an alkaline aqueous solution to the reaction mixture. As the alkali, there may be used an alkali metal hydroxide, an inorganic base (such as a carbonate) and/or an organic base. The neutralizing treatment may be carried out by adding both an extractant and an alkaline aqueous solution to the reaction mixture. Examples of the extractant include an organic solvent to which a fluorene derivative is soluble (e.g., a aliphatic hydrocarbon such as hexane, an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene and xylene, an alicyclic hydrocarbon such as cyclohexane, and a halogenated hydrocarbon), or if necessary, a mixed solvent of the organic solvent and a poor solvent to a fluorene derivative (e.g., water).</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">After the neutralizing treatment, the extractant layer (organic layer) is optionally washed with water, the water layer is removed, and then a crystallization solvent may be appropriately added to the organic layer to precipitate (or separate) a crystal. The fluorene derivative is usually crystallized by removing the organic solvent by distillation or other means to condense the organic layer, and adding a crystallization solvent to the residue. The crystallization solvent comprises a<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> hydrocarbon and a polar solvent. It is estimated that the polar solvent produces a clathrate crystal with the fluorene derivative.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Examples of the hydrocarbon include an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as pentane, hexane, and octane; an alicyclic hydrocarbon such as cyclohexane, and methylcyclohexane; an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene; a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane, trichloroethylene, and dichlorobenzene; and others. These hydrocarbons may be used singly or in combination. The preferred hydrocarbon includes a solvent to which a fluorene derivative is soluble, in particular, an aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g., toluene).</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The polar solvent includes, for example, water, an alcohol (e.g., a C<sub>1-4</sub>alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol and butanol, in particular a C<sub>1-3</sub> alkylalcohol), a ketone (e.g., a diC<sub>1-4</sub>alkyl ketone such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, diethyl ketone, ethyl propyl ketone, di-n-propyl ketone and diisopropyl ketone, in particular a C<sub>3-7</sub>alkyl ketone), a nitrile (e.g., acetonitrile); and others. These polar solvents may be used singly or in combination. In particular, a crystallization solvent comprising the aromatic hydrocarbon (particularly toluene) and the ketone (particularly acetone) is effective in removing a causative substance of coloring (an impurity, a coloring<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> component).</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The proportion of the polar solvent relative to the hydrocarbon is, for example, about 0.5 to 10 parts by weight (e.g., about 1 to 10 parts by weight), preferably about 2 to 8 parts by weight (e.g., about 2 to 6 parts by weight), and particularly about 3 to 5 parts by weight, relative to 1 part by weight of the hydrocarbon. The amount of the crystallization solvent is usually about 1 to 10 parts by weight, preferably about 1 to 5 parts by weight (e.g., about 2 to 5 parts by weight), relative to 1 part by weight of the residue (or solid matter).</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The crystallizing operation may be carried out by a conventional method, for example, by dissolving the residue in a crystallization solvent and cooling the mixture. A highly purified and highly transparent fluorene derivative is obtained by collecting (or recovering) a precipitated crystal by filtration or other means, optionally washing the crystal, and drying the crystal. Incidentally, the crystallizing operation may be repeatedly carried out. In the present invention, a fluorene derivative being scarcely colored and having high transparency can be obtained by one (or a single) crystallizing operation.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The production process of the present invention achieves a highly purified fluorene derivative practicable as a raw material for a polymer in which high transparency is required (e.g., a polycarbonate-series resin, a<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> polyester-series resin, and an epoxy resin) .
