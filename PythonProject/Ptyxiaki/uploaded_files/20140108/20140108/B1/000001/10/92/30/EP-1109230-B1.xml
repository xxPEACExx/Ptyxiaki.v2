Tunnel junctions are used to link the individual Ge bottom, GaAs middle and GaInP top cells. The performance of a dual-junction and a triple-junction photovoltaic cell are compared with high-efficiency Si solar cells.

According to this document, current-matching problems between the top cell and the bottom cell need not be considered by the disclosed 3-terminal GaAs-Si tandem solar cell. Further according to this document, a conversion efficiency of such a system is lower than the conversion efficiency of GaAs on a GaAs substrate because of the high dislocation density in the GaAs layer on Si. To improve the conversion efficiency, two methods are proposed. One method is the use of an electric field to collect the carriers. Another method is the improvement of the minority carrier lifetime by reducing the dislocation density of the epitaxial layer.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A further document, <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 11, No. 309 (E-547), 8th October 1987 (1987-10-08</text></nplcit>) und <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP62102567A"><text>JP 62 102 567 A, 13th May 1987</text></patcit> shows an N-type Ge layer and a P-type Ge layer grown on a N-type Si substrate. The crystallinity of the Ge layer is improved by a thick growth, and a mechanical strength is further increased by the thick growth. Then, an N-type GaAs layer and a P-type GaAs layer are formed.

The continued interest has been in both terrestrial and non-terrestrial applications. In the non-terrestrial environment of outer space, the concern over limited resources of any type is a major one. This is because the need to increase the amount of a resource increases the payload. An increased payload can increase the cost of a launch more than linearly. With the ready availability of solar energy in outer space for a spacecraft such as a satellite, the conversion of solar energy into electrical energy is an obvious alternative to increased payload.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The cost per watt of electrical power generation capacity of photovoltaic systems is the main factor which inhibits their widespread use in terrestrial applications. Conversion efficiency of sunlight to electricity is of critical importance for terrestrial photovoltaic systems, since increased efficiency means that all area-related components of the electricity generation system, <i>i.e</i>., cell area, module or collector area, support structures, land area, etc., can be reduced when the efficiency is increased, for a given required power output of the system. For example, in concentrator photovoltaic systems which concentrate the sunlight, typically from 2 to 2000 times, onto the photovoltaic cell, an increase in efficiency means that the area of the expensive concentrating optics can be reduced proportionally. Concentrator photovoltaic systems are a likely application of the multijunction cells described in this invention, because the cell area can be reduced by the concentration ratio, allowing the use of relatively complicated solar cells with a high cost per unit area.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Irrespective of the application, and as with any energy generation system, efforts have been ongoing to increase the output and/or efficiency of PV cells. In terms of output, multiple cells or layers having different energy bandgaps have been stacked so that each cell or layer can absorb a different part of the wide energy distribution of photons in sunlight. The stacked arrangement has been provided in a monolithic structure on a single substrate or on multiple substrates.

The p-n (or n-p) junctions can be of the homojunction or heterojunction type. When solar energy is received at a junction, minority carriers (i.e., electrons and holes) are generated in the conduction and valence bands of the semiconductor materials adjacent the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> junction. A voltage is thereby created across the junction and a current can be utilized therefrom. As the solar energy passes to the next junction which has been optimized to a lower energy range, additional solar energy at this lower energy range can be converted into a useful current. With a greater number of junctions, there can be greater conversion efficiency and increased output voltage.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">For the multiple-cell PV device, efficiency is limited by the requirement of low resistance interfaces between the individual cells to enable the generated current to flow from one cell to the next. Accordingly, in a monolithic structure, tunnel junctions have been used to minimize the blockage of current flow. In a multiple wafer structure, front and back metallization grids with low coverage fraction and transparent conductors have been used for low resistance connectivity.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Another limitation to the multiple cell PV device is that current output at each junction must be the same for optimum efficiency in the series-connected configuration. Also, there is a practical limit on the number of junctions, since each successive junction generates a smaller current.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Whether in the multiple-junction or single-junction PV device, a conventional characteristic of PV cells has been the use of a single window layer on an emitter layer disposed on a base/substrate, which is shown for example in <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US5322573A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,322,573</text></patcit>. Similarly, a single layer back-surface field structure below the base/substrate has been used, as shown in <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="US5800630A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,800,630</text></patcit>. The purpose of the back-surface field structure has been to serve as a passivation layer, like the single window layer described above.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The concern over efficiency in PV cells has created more interest in the use of germanium, gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, and gallium indium phosphide, all of which have been thought to be more efficient than silicon. Indium phosphide has another perceived advantage of being radiation resistant, which is of particular benefit in space applications. However, silicon is stronger, less expensive, and less than half as dense as Ge and GaAs<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> substrates. Accordingly, silicon remains highly viable for continued use and is discussed, for example, in <nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>Hayashi et al., "MOCVD Growth of GaAsP on Si For Tandem Solar Cell Application," First WCPEC, pp. 1890-1893 (1994</text></nplcit>) and <nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>Wojtczuk et al., "Development of InP Solar Cells on Inexpensive Si Wafers," First WCPEC, pp. 1705-1708 (1994</text></nplcit>).</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As can be seen, there is a need for an improved multijunction photovoltaic cell that is thinner and lighter than conventional solar cells, which has increased efficiency, yield, and adaptability to different applications.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In view of the above it is an objective of the present invention to provide a monolithic multijunciton photovoltaic cell adapted to convert incident radiation more efficiently.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">This objective is achieved by a monolithic, multijunction photovoltaic cell according to claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The present invention is generally directed to an improved multijunction photovoltaic cell in which a pure silicon or silicon-germanium or pure germanium substrate serves as an active subcell.

In general, however, the photovoltaic cell of the present invention includes a Si or SiGe or Ge substrate that serves as an active subcell. The Si or SiGe or Ge substrate can be operatively placed at the top, bottom, or intermediate positions within the photovoltaic cell. In many, but not all, of the preferred embodiments, a transition layer is provided between the active substrate and the other active subcells in the multijunction photovoltaic cell. The transition layers are generally intended to minimize the adverse affects of dislocation densities resulting from lattice constant mismatches and coefficient of thermal expansion mismatches.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Furthermore, while the present invention may be particularly useful in the context of spacecraft, such as in a solar panel 191 of a satellite 190 (<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 6</figref>), other applications - both terrestrial and non-terrestrial - are contemplated. Still further, even though the present invention is described in the context of a<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> photovoltaic cell, the invention is not so limited. Other contexts, such as sensors and other optoelectronic devices, are contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Given the breadth of contexts of the present invention, it can be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the different semiconductor layers that form the photovoltaic cell of the present invention can be made by many well-known processes in the art, such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), liquid phase epitaxy (LPE), metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), and conventional wafer bonding of the already-grown semiconductor layers of the upper subcells to the active Si or SiGe or Ge substrate. In accordance with such known methods, the specific materials comprising the semiconductor layers may be altered and optimized to meet the requirements of the particular context.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A photovoltaic cell 10 is schematically depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG.1a</figref>. The cell 10 can receive incident light that passes through an antireflection layer or coating (not shown) that is disposed on top of the cell 10, as viewed from <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1a</figref>. The antireflection layer is intended to minimize surface reflections between the optically transparent media above the cell (such as air, glass, or polymer) and the semiconductor layers of the cell 10, thereby enabling more photons to enter the cell 10. The antireflection layer can be made from well-known materials in the art, such as TiO<sub>2</sub>, Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, and MgF<sub>2</sub>. The thickness of the antireflective coating can vary, but is typically between about 0.04 and 0.35 microns.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The photovoltaic cell 10 includes a Si or SiGe substrate 11 that is located at a bottom position of the cell 10, when viewed from <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1a</figref>. The substrate 11 is an "active" subcell, as opposed to an "inactive" one. The distinction refers to the ability of the subcell 11 to provide photogenerated current density and voltage in addition to structural support, as compared to simply providing support. Accordingly, the substrate 11 has an active side, which is typically the side or surface closest to the p-n junction of the substrate subcell 11, and is typically the side or surface that receives the incident light. In<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> the cell shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1a</figref>, the active side of the substrate 11 is the upper side or surface when viewed from <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1a</figref>.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Given its active function, the active substrate 11 is formed with a p-n junction. The polarity of this p-n junction may be oriented such that the n-type region is above the p-type region (n-on-p configuration), or such that the p-type region is above the n-type region (p-on-n configuration). The particular semiconductor layers used to form the p-n junction can vary according to practices well-known in the art. For either polarity of p-n junction in the substrate 11, the top layer (i.e., the emitter of the active substrate 11) can be made, for example, of Si, SiGe, GaAs, GaPAs, GaInP, or GalnPAs. This top layer is n-type in the n-on-p configuration and p-type in the p-on-n configuration. The lower region of the p-n junction (i.e., the base of the active substrate 11) for either polarity is composed of the of the active substrate 11. This lower region (which can be the bulk of the substrate or a doped region of the substrate) is p-type in the n-on-p configuration and n-type in the p-on-n configuration.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The top layer of the p-n junction can be formed by: (1) epitaxial growth on the active substrate; (2) dopant diffusion or ion implantation to form the top, doped layer in the active substrate, before subsequent epitaxial growth; or (3) diffusion of species that act as dopants in the active substrate from the epitaxial layers grown on top of the active substrate. In one preferred configuration, the top layer is an n-type Si or SiGe layer, formed in a p-type Si or SiGe substrate by diffusion of group-V elements such as phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony, into the substrate prior to the growth of epitaxial layers on the substrate to form the other subcells in the multijunction photovoltaic cell 10. In a second preferred configuration, the top layer is an n-type Si or SiGe layer, formed in a p-type Si or SiGe substrate by diffusion of group-V elements such as phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony, into the substrate during epitaxial growth of III-V compounds on the Si or SiGe substrate.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In general, the particular dopant used can vary according to well-known methods in the art. If, as in the particular preferred configurations described above, the substrate 11 is made with an n-type Si or SiGe layer doped with<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony, then the p-type Si or SiGe substrate can be doped with group-III elements such as boron, aluminum, gallium, or indium. The dopant concentration can also vary, but will typically be from about 10<sup>18</sup> to 10<sup>21</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> (and preferably about 3×10<sup>18</sup> to 10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>) in the top layer (i.e., the emitter of the substrate 11). The dopant concentration in the bottom layer (i.e., the base of the substrate 11) can range from nearly intrinsic (around 10<sup>13</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>) to about 10<sup>19</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> (and is preferably about 10<sup>15</sup> to 3×10<sup>18</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>).</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Just as the types of materials and dopants can vary for the semiconductor layers in the substrate 11, their thicknesses can also vary. Typically, however, the overall thickness of substrate 11, in this embodiment, may range from about 25 to 1000 µm, although preferably about 100 to 400 µm. The thickness of the upper layer of the p-n junction in the substrate 11 may range in thickness from about 0.05 to 5 µm, and is preferably about 0.1 to 1 µm. With the above thickness ranges for the upper layer of the p-n junction, the thickness of the lower layer of the p-n junction (in the case that it is formed from the bulk of the substrate) therefore has about the same thickness range as the entire substrate. The subcell 11 formed from the Si or SiGe substrate is also characterized by an energy bandgap E<sub>g</sub> that can vary from that of Si (E<sub>g</sub> = 1.12 eV) to that of Ge (E<sub>g</sub> = 0.67 eV) and all points in between, depending on the Si and Ge compositions in the SiGe substrate.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In a variation of the cell shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1a</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 1b</figref> depicts a cell wherein a second upper buffer layer 12, a transition layer 18, and a first upper buffer layer 13 are adjacent the active side of the active substrate 11. In general, however, the buffer layer 12, the buffer layer 13, or both, and the transitional layer 18 are optional and can be absent from the cell 10. The number of upper subcells may range from 1 to n, where n is an integer. As mentioned above, the transition layer 18 serves to achieve current matching in the subcells of the photovoltaic cell 10 by allowing the growth of semiconductor compositions that have the appropriate bandgaps for current matching of the subcells, while minimizing the adverse effects of dislocation densities resulting from lattice-constant mismatches and mismatches in the coefficient of thermal<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> expansion. As used herein, the dislocation density is that which would otherwise occur between the substrate 11 and an n<sup>th</sup> upper subcell 14 in the absence of the transition layer 18. The n<sup>th</sup> upper subcell 14 is the lowermost subcell in a plurality of upper subcells 14 to 17, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1a</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">1b</figref>.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The transition layer 18 can be made according to well-known methods in the art. For example, the transition layer 18 can be a strained-layer superlattice, a layer with step-graded composition, a layer with continuously-graded composition, or a layer with multiple strain-balanced sublayers. These and similar types of transition layers may be grown under irradiation with atomic hydrogen to minimize the dislocation density, as described in<nplcit id="ncit0007" npl-type="s"><text> Okada et al., "Growth of GaAs and AlGaAs on Si Substrates by Atomic Hydrogen-Assisted MBE (H-MBE) for Solar Cell Applications, First WCPEC, pp. 1701-1704 (1994</text></nplcit>). The transition layer 18 may be formed by a compliant layer that is soft at the temperatures of epitaxial growth, but which can still serve as a template for the nucleation of crystal growth, such as borosilicate glass. The transition layer 18 may consist of a dielectric or other material resistant to high temperature, with vias etched through it to the layer underneath (either the upper buffer layer 12 or the top of the substrate 11). Single-crystal growth of a semiconductor is nucleated selectively in the vias, the epitaxial growth continues out of the vias and laterally over the dielectric or other temperature resistant layer, until a continuous semiconductor film is formed over the transition layer 18. The grown semiconductor in the unit cell around each via is single-crystal material with the same crystal orientation as the material around each of the other vias, providing a suitable template for epitaxial growth of the subsequent semiconductor layers to form the other subcells 14-17 in the multijunction cell 10. Alternatively, the transition layer 18 may be formed by twist-wafer-bonding, such as described in <nplcit id="ncit0008" npl-type="s"><text>Ejeckam et al., "Lattice engineered compliant substrate for defect-free heteroepitaxial growth," Appl. Phys. Lett. 70(13), pp. 1685-1687, 13 March 1997</text></nplcit>. The transition layer 18 can also be formed by conventional wafer bonding of a thin semiconductor layer to the active substrate 11, which is then<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> used for growth of the semiconductor layers of the upper subcells. Additionally, the transition layer 18 may be absent by using conventional wafer bonding of the semiconductor layers of the upper subcells, which have already been grown on a separate substrate, to the active substrate. In this latter case, the separate substrate, such as Ge or GaAs, on which the semiconductor layers of the upper subcells are grown, may: 1) be absent when bonding to the active Si or SiGe substrate; 2) be present during bonding, and removed after bonding, leaving the semiconductor layers or the upper subcells bonded to the active Si or SiGe substrate; 3) be present during bonding and left on as part of the final cell structure; or 4) have been transferred to another supporting substrate before bonding, with the supporting substrate being present during bonding and then removed afterward.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The transition layer 18, the second upper buffer layer 12, and the first upper buffer layer 13 may vary in composition, thickness and doping. These layers may be composed of multiple sublayers, as in a strained-layer superlattice or in a layer with step-graded composition, in order to transition from one lattice constant to another. Preferably, these layers will be highly transparent to light that can photogenerate electron-hole pairs in the active substrate 11, and that is transmitted through the upper subcells 14-17, in order for the substrate 11 to generate as much current as possible. If the transition layer 18, upper buffer layer 13, or upper buffer layer 12 are composed of semiconductor materials, then preferably the light absorption in these layers is kept low by one or more of the following: (1) forming these layers from semiconductors that have bandgaps above or equal to that of the n<sup>th</sup> upper subcell 14; (2) forming these layers from semiconductors with an indirect bandgap or with low absorption coefficient in general; (3) making these layers thin to reduce their absorption even for high absorption coefficients.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">For example, with a Si substrate 11, the upper buffer layer 12 can be formed from GaP which has a high, indirect bandgap of ~2.26 eV and has only -0.37% lattice-mismatch to Si. The transition layer 18 can be a region of step-graded composition of GaPAs formed by sublayers of changing composition<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> from GaP with lattice constant of 5.451 A to the desired composition of GaPAs. For instance, this composition could be GaP<sub>0.07</sub>As<sub>0.93</sub>, with lattice constant of 5.638 A and bandgap of ~1.509 eV. The upper buffer layer 13 can then be composed of the same composition of GaPAs to allow dislocations resulting from the lattice mismatch to the Si substrate to become reduced in concentration before beginning the growth of the upper subcells 14-17.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In another example, a SiGe substrate with the same lattice constant as GaP (5.451 A) can be used, having a Si mole fraction of ~0.91 and a bandgap of ~1.09 eV. The upper buffer layer 12 can again be formed from GaP, but in this example, the GaP buffer layer 12 is lattice-matched to the Si<sub>0.91</sub>Ge<sub>0.09</sub> substrate subcell 11. The transition layer 18 and the upper buffer layer 13 can then be as in the previous example.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In a further example, an active SiGe substrate 11 can be used, for instance with a composition of Si<sub>0.17</sub>Ge<sub>0.83</sub>, with a lattice constant of 5.619 A and a bandgap of ~0.92 eV. The buffer layer 12, the transition layer 18, and the buffer layer 13 can be composed, for example, of GaPAs or GaInP in order to transition from the 5.619 A lattice constant of the substrate 11 to the 5.653 A lattice constant of a GaAs upper subcell 14 - a mismatch of 0.60%. The upper subcell 17 can have a base composed of Ga<sub>0.52</sub>In<sub>0.48</sub>P and with the same lattice constant 5.653 A of GaAs and a bandgap of ~1.89 eV (the bandgap of GalnP can vary over a range of ~0.1 eV at the same composition depending on the degree of disorder on the group-III sublattice). There are no additional upper subcells 15, 16 in this particular example.

There is still ample photon flux in the energy range between the ~0.92 eV bandgap of the SiGe subcell 11 in this example and the 1.424 eV bandgap of the GaAs cell 14 to generate excess photocarriers in the SiGe subcell 11. The SiGe subcell 11 does not limit the current of the series-interconnected subcells in the multijunction cell 10, as long as photocarriers in the SlGe substrate 11 can be collected efficiently at the p-n junction.

However, it is also advantageous to keep the lattice constant of the substrate close to that of the upper subcells 14 to 17 in order to minimize the change in lattice constant that must be accommodated by the transition layer 18 and the buffer layers 12, 13. A trade-off exists between these competing influences on multijunction cell efficiency, and the difference in lattice constant at which the multijunction cell efficiency is maximized is a function of how well the transition layer 18 and buffer layers 12, 13 can accommodate the change in lattice constant.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The Si mole fraction of x ≈ 0.17 in Si<sub>x</sub>Ge<sub>1-x</sub> is a significant composition because for lower Si compositions the semiconductor band structure is Ge-like with the conduction band minimum occurring along the &lt;111&gt; axes (corresponding to the indirect L-transition).

The layers 12, 13, 18 may have different doping types if they are doped heavily enough to form a tunnel junction such that the series resistance and any opposing voltage formed by the junction is neligible compared to the voltage of the multijunction cell 10. Alternatively, different doping types can be used if the polarity of the p-n junction formed is such that its voltage supplements that of the multijunction cell 10, and the p-n junction formed does not limit or adds to the efficiency of the multijunction cell 10. Preferably, however, the layers 12, 13, 18 should all have the same doping type, as well as have the same doping type as the emitter of the active substrate 11, in order to avoid the formation of a p-n junction that could produce a voltage opposing that of the subcells 14-17 in the multijunction cell 10.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The upper subcells 14-17 can vary in number from 1 to n where n is an integer.

The polarity of the p-n junctions may either all be of the n-on-p polarity or all of the p-on-n polarity. In general, each of the upper subcells 14-17 is current matched to each other and to the substrate 11 by virtue of their chosen compositions, bandgaps, and thicknesses. The upper subcells 14-17 are typically characterized by an energy bandgap that is greater than that of the active substrate 11.

The GaInP/GaAs subcells may either be grown on a transition layer 18 on the active Si substrate, or bonded to the active Si substrate with no transition layer. In this multijunction cell, the GaAs subcell may be thinned significantly in order to transmit some light above the GaAs bandgap energy to the Si substrate, to achieve current matching of all subcells. Although the transmission of some light which could be used by the GaAs subcell to the lower-voltage Si subcell decreases the efficiency somewhat, the reduced thickness of the GaAs subcell is likely to increase radiation resistance of the GaAs subcell, important for space applications. The previous example solves this problem of current matching by shifting the bandgaps of both of the top two subcells higher, thus transmitting more light to the Si subcell, and preventing the Si subcell from current limiting the top two subcells.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In another example, current matching may be achieved with the top two subcells grown at the GaAs lattice constant, which may facilitate the growth of these subcells, by using a Si substrate 11 with a bandgap of 1.12 eV, a GaInPAs upper subcell 14 with a higher bandgap than GaAs to transmit more light to the Si subcell than would the use of GaAs, and a GalnP topmost upper subcell 17:

Therefore, the semiconductor layers making up each of the upper subcells 14-17 can vary. Each subcell 14-17 preferably includes a window layer at the top (the side at which light enters the cell 10) and emitter layer under the window, a base layer under the emitter, and a back-surface field (BSF) layer under the base. The window layer typically has a wider bandgap than the emitter layer. The emitter layer may have the same bandgap and composition as the base (i.e., homojunction cell design) or may have a wider bandgap and/or different composition than the base (i.e., heterojunction cell design). The BSF layer usually has a wider bandgap than the base layer, but may have the same bandgap and semiconductor composition as the base and simply be distinguished from the base by having a higher doping concentration than the base. The subcells 14-17 are usually designated by the composition of the semiconductor forming the base layer. The cells 14-17 may have either an n-on-p or a p-on-n configuration and provide 1 to j number of junctions where j is an integer.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">For instance, the GaPAs subcell 14 described in the example above has a GaPAs base layer. The emitter can be made of GaPAs of the same composition as the base, or of GaInPAs, GalnP, AIGaInP, AllnP, AlGaPAs, or AlGaAs. The BSF layer may also be made from these materials. Preferably, however, the emitter is made of GaPAs, GaInP, or GaInPAs because these materials can be lattice-matched to the GaPAs base, can be comparatively easily grown with high electronic quality (high minority-carrier lifetime), and can be fairly easily formed with a window layer on top that is made of semiconductors having the same lattice-constant and wider bandgap. Preferably, the BSF layer is made of GalnP or GalnPAs lattice-matched to the<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> GaPAs base, since these materials have a higher bandgap than the GaPAs base. In the example of a GaPAs-base subcell 11, the window layer can be made of GaInPAs, GaInP, AIGaInP, AllnP, AlGaPAs, or AlGaAs. Preferably, however, the window layer is made of GaInP, AlGaInP, or AllnP for a GaPAs or GalnPAs emitter, and AlGalnP or AllnP for a GalnP emitter.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The bases of the various upper subcells 14-17 in the multijunction cell 10 may have various compositions of semiconductors. The preferred compositions are based on their (1) bandgaps and their resulting ability to produce a multijunction cell 10 with current-matched subcells 14-17, including the Si or SiGe substrate 11; (2) lattice constant to achieve lattice matching among the subcells when possible; and (3) ability to grow the specific semiconductor materials with high electronic quality. Examples of the semiconductor materials that may form the bases of the subcells 14-17 are GaAs, InP, SiGe, GalnAs, GaAsSb, GaPAs, GaPSb, GalnP, AIGaAs, GaInPAs, and GaInPSb.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">As with the substrate 11, the particular dopant used in the upper subcells 14-17 can vary according to well-known methods in the art. If, as an example, the upper subcell 14 is made of a p-type GaPAs base and an n-type GaPAs emitter, then the base dopant can be Zn, C, Mg, Be, or other p-type dopants used in III-V semiconductors, but preferably Zn or C. The emitter dopant in this example can be Si, Ge, Sn, Se, Te, or other n-type dopants used in III-V semiconductors, but preferably Si or Te. The dopant concentration can also vary, but will typically be from about 1 × 10<sup>15</sup> to 5 × 10<sup>18</sup> (and preferably about 1 × 10<sup>16</sup> to 5 × 10<sup>17</sup>) in the p-type base layer.

In the example of an n-on-p configuration of the subcells 14-17 in the multijunction solar cell 10, and with the above ranges of the overall subcell thickness, the p-type base<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> thickness may range from about 0.05 to 100 µm, but preferably from about 0.2 to 3 µm.

A tunnel junction is placed between each pair of adjacent subcells 14-17, including between the upper subcell 14 and the active substrate 11. The tunnel junction 19 is shown immediately under upper subcell 14 and above buffer layer 13. The tunnel junction 19 may also be placed (1) under buffer layer 13 and above the transition layer 18; (2) under the transition layer 18 and above buffer layer 12; and (3) under buffer layer 12 and above the active substrate 11.

Nevertheless, the tunnel junctions 19-21 may include additional layers, for example, as dopant diffusion barriers. The doping concentration must be high enough and/or the band offsets of the semiconductor materials on either side of the tunnel junction must be such that the series resistance and the voltage across the tunnel junctions 19-21 that opposes the polarity of the rest of the multijunction cell 10 are kept to a minimum. Preferably, the bandgaps of the semiconductors in the tunnel junction are higher than or equal to that of the subcell above it. Thereby; light that is transmitted through the subcell above the tunnel junction is not absorbed or is only weakly absorbed in the tunnel junction and is thus available for photogenerating carriers in the subcell beneath the tunnel junction. The layers forming the tunnel junctions 19-21 can also be made very thin, preferably in the range from about 100 to 500 Å for each layer, to reduce light absorption in the<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> tunnel junction layers.

Thus, incident light will be received by the substrate 31 and then a plurality of lower subcells 34-37 that vary in number from 1 to m, where m is an integer.

The bandgap widths typically decrease as one progresses from the substrate subcell 31 to the lowermost subcell 37.

The relative % difference in performance between these two types of multijunction cells becomes even greater as the cell temperature increases to a more typical operating temperature of 70°C.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Modeling calculations for both types of multijunction cells is based on an ideal fill factor for each subcell with unity diode ideality factor, no series resistance losses, unity current collection efficiency for all photogenerated carriers in each subcell, and optically thin subcells where necessary for current matching. These ideal conditions are used in the cell modeling in order to compare the upper limit of performance for various multijunction cell structures. The requirement for current matching results in a Ga<sub>0.60</sub>In<sub>0.40</sub>P top subcell 1 and Si<sub>0.17</sub>Ge<sub>0.83</sub> subcell 3 in the 4-junction Ga<sub>0.60</sub>In<sub>0.40</sub>P /GaP<sub>0.17</sub>As<sub>0.83</sub> /Si<sub>0.17</sub>Ge<sub>0.83</sub> ISi<sub>0.17</sub>Ge<sub>0.83</sub> cell, and a Ga<sub>0.52</sub>In<sub>0.48</sub>P top subcell 1 in the conventional 3-junction Ga<sub>0.52</sub>In<sub>0.48</sub>P/GaAs/Ge cell, which are thin enough to transmit some photons with energy above the semiconductor bandgap of each subcell. In order to compare ideal multijunction cell performance for different technologies, the modeling calculations also take the optical loss at the top of each subcell to be zero. If this optical loss, which could be due to tunnel junction absorption, reflection, etc., is assumed to have a value of 5%, then the ideal energy conversion efficiency of the above example of a lattice-matched, Ga<sub>0.60</sub>In<sub>0.40</sub>P /GaP<sub>0.17</sub>As<sub>0.83</sub> /Si<sub>0.17</sub>Ge<sub>0.83</sub> /Si<sub>0.17</sub>Ge<sub>0.83</sub>, 4-junction cell 80 is -10 relative % higher at AMO, 28°C than the calculated ideal efficiency of a conventional Ga<sub>0.52</sub>In<sub>0.46</sub>P/GaAs/Ge 3-junction cell. The use of semi-conductors in each tunnel junction with bandgaps higher than those of the base semiconductor of the subcell<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> immediately above the tunnel junction can reduce the parasitic absorption of light in the tunnel junction, that could otherwise be used for useful current generation, to significantly less than 5% in practice.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">For a Si composition wherein x is below ~0.17, resulting in Ge-like band structure in the SiGe subcells of the GalnP/GaPAs/SiGe/SiGe multijunction cell 80, the requirement of equal photogenerated current density collected in both the SiGe substrate 81 and the SiGe upper subcell 83 is made more tractable by the nature of the absorption coefficient. In the band structure of Ge, a direct transition exists at about 0.8 eV, only slightly above the 0.67-eV indirect transition. For compositions of SiGe with low Si mole fraction x, such that this feature of a direct energy gap E<sub>g,d</sub> is slightly higher in energy than the indirect energy gap E<sub>g.i</sub>, this aspect of the band structure can be used to help balance the current in the two SiGe subcells with the same bandgap. Photons with energy greater than E<sub>g,d</sub> are absorbed very strongly by this direct transition, generating an electron-hole pair, and many of these photons could be absorbed by the optically-thin SiGe upper subcell 83. Photons between E<sub>g.i</sub> and E<sub>g,d</sub> in energy are much more weakly absorbed, since they must be absorbed by an indirect transition, but they can still be absorbed by a cell with a very thick base, such as the SiGe substrate subcell 81, along with some of the photons with energy &gt; E<sub>g,d</sub> that are transmitted through the optically-thin SiGe upper subcell 83, in order to achieve current matching.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">The following particular cases of 4-junction cells are also specific examples of the fourth embodiment of the invention:

A particular example includes a SiGe active substrate 111, an upper subcell group Uw consisting of one subcell of GalnAs with a lattice constant greater than that of the SiGe substrate and with a bandgap chosen to current match the GalnAs subcell to the other subcells in the multijunction cell 110; an upper subcell group U2 consisting of one GaPAs subcell with lattice constant less than that of the SiGe substrate and with a bandgap chosen to current match the GaPAs subcell to the other subcells in the multijunction cell 110; and an upper subcell group U1 consisting of one GalnP subcell with the same lattice constant as the SiGe substrate. The tensile strain of the GaPAs subcell thus acts to partially compensate the compressive strain of the GalnAs subcell with respect to the lattice constant of the SiGe substrate 111 and the GalnP top subcell, resulting in a sequence of layers in the multijunction cell 110 that is strain-balanced as a whole.

Further provided by the present invention is a photovoltaic cell that has increased efficiency and adaptability to different applications and incident light spectra. Higher efficiency photovoltaic conversion is extremely leveraging since for an application with a given power requirement, fewer cells are required, reducing the cost of the cells and supporting structures in the photovoltaic array. Higher efficiency energy conversion also results in less waste heat, lowering the array temperature and further improving power output. These advantages are important for space applications, as in satellite power arrays, as well as for terrestrial concentrating and non-concentrating photovoltaic systems, and for<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> thermophotovoltaics. For space, the reduced cell area and support structures required for a given power also result in the very significant advantages of reduced stowage volume, reduced extent of the array as deployed, and reduced weight of the array which reduces the cost of satellite launch. By virtue of the greater strength and lower density of Si substrates as opposed to Ge substrates, the multijunction cells described in the foregoing that have Si substrates can be made lighter, thinner, and with higher mechanical yield that for those made on conventional Ge substrates. To the extent that SiGe substrates also have greater strength and lower density than Ge substrates, multijunction cells with SiGe substrates can also be made lighter and thinner, with higher mechanical yield.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">It should be understood, of course, that the foregoing relates to preferred embodiments of the invention and that modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56987780" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Monolithische, mehrschichtige photovoltaische Zelle (50; 80), mit:
