In-urban areas many people keep their pets indoors for all or part of the day, particularly at night and prevent them going outside. This may be to prevent the animal from wandering and becoming lost, to prevent the animal killing native animals or for other reasons.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">This leads to the animal being unable to go outside to urinate or defecate. The usual solution to this is to provide a tray with absorbent material into which the animal may urinate or defecate. This has a number of disadvantages, including odour, the need to regularly remove faeces and the need to periodically replace the absorbent material.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">One of the aims of embodiments of the invention is to ultimately have an animal trained to use a human toilet pan to defecate and urinate. It will be appreciated that for a small animal, such as cat or a small dog, to initially use the aperture presented by a toilet or toilet seat is difficult and the animal must be slowly introduced to the concept of urinating or defecating through an aperture, rather than onto a layer of absorbent material.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">To achieve this, according to the invention, the animal is first trained to use a device in the manner of a conventional waste tray, in that there is a solid base overlaid with absorbent material onto which waste may be deposited. Once the animal is comfortable using the device, the device is placed on top of the toilet and the animal continues use a device in the manner of a conventional tray. The device is then a reconfigured so as to provide a relatively small aperture, preferably in its centre, through which the animal will defecate and urinate. Once the animal becomes comfortable urinating and defecating through the small aperture, the aperture is progressively increased in size until there is merely the surround upon which the animal supports itself whilst it urinates or defecates.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The size of the aperture is modified by inserts that selectively block part of a larger aperture. Preferably, an insert initially blocks the entire aperture to enable the device to be used as a simple waste tray with conventional absorbent material. The insert is then replaced with another of a series of inserts, each of which has a progressively larger opening.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The invention, as defined in claims 1 and 2, provides an animal toileting system including:

The base unit 10 has a generally planner horizontal wall 12 having a U-shaped perimeter 14. Extending downwards from the perimeter 14 is a peripheral wall 16. This wall 16 extends outwards at about 80° to the horizontal. This angle is not critical but aids in placing the base unit 10 over the rim of a toilet bowl, as described later. Located in the centre of the horizontal wall 12 is a well 19. This well 19 is defined by a downwardly extending wall portion 20 and a horizontally extending annular wall portion 22. The annular wall portion 22 also defines an aperture 18 in the base of the well 19. The wall 20 extends inwards at about 80° to the horizontal. This angle is not critical but aids in placing an insert in the well 19 of the base unit. The well 19 has semi-circular ends 15 and straight sides 17 but may be a true oval, circle or any other shape considered suitable. In the preferred embodiment the aperture 18 has a width of about 200 mm and a length of about 250 mm.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The wall 16 and wall portion 20 define a U-shaped channel 23. As best seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>, the free edge 24 of the perimeter wall 16 and the lower surface 26 of the annular wall 22 lie substantially in a common plane.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The base unit 10 is designed to fit over most conventional toilet pans, as seen in <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004">Figures 4 to 7</figref>. For clarity, the drawings showing the toilet pan only show the rim and upper surface of the toilet. The bowl itself is not shown. The aperture 18 is located within the opening 31 of the pan 21, with the perimeter wall 16 outside of the pan 21 and with the rim 28 of the bowl between the walls 16 and 20. The base unit is thus supported on the rim 28 by the upper wall 12. The unit 10 is supplied with a number of inserts that are designed to be placed into the well 19 and rest upon the horizontal wall 22. In the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> preferred embodiment there are three inserts, 30, 32 and 34, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref>. These inserts reduce or totally block the aperture 18.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0007 f0008">figures 14 to 16</figref>, the insert 30 has a base wall 40 and an upwardly extending perimeter wall 42. As seen in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref>, the insert 30 is sized to fit snugly within the well 19, with the perimeter wall 42 adjacent the wall 20 and with the outer portion of the base wall 40 resting upon the annular wall 22. It follows that the shape of the peripheral wall will correspond to the shape of the well 19. The height of the perimeter wall 42 is such that its upper edge 43 remains within the well 19 below the plane of the wall 12.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The insert 30 includes two concentric ridges 44 and 46. In the preferred embodiment the insert 30 is formed by a vacuum moulding process and the ridges 44 and 46 are defined by deforming the base of the insert against a V-shaped groove or projection in the mould. Whilst the two ridges 44 and 46 provide some rigidity to the base wall 40, they are not critical to the invention.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The inserts 32 and 34 are created by first vacuum forming an insert with a solid base as per insert 30 and then cutting an aperture in the base wall 40. The ridges 44 and 46 are desired for the inserts 32 and 34 and, accordingly, the ridges 44 and 46 are present in insert 30. The inner ridge 46 extends about 10 mm above the base wall 40 whilst the outer ridge extends about 5 mm above the base wall 40. If desired, the two ridges, 44 and 46 may be the same height.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">It will be appreciated that the base unit 10 and the three inserts may be formed by many other methods, such as a plastics injection moulding process. Further, separate moulds may be provided for manufacture of the different inserts. It will be appreciated that rigidity may be provided by forming the inserts with ridges or groove as appropriate and that any such ridges or grooves need not be circular, oval or concentric and may extend radially or in a simple grid. If desired any strengthening structures may be on either or both of the upper and lower surfaces of the base wall 40.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The second insert 32, shown in <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005">figures 8 to 10</figref>, is substantially the same as the first insert 30. However, the central portion 48 of the base wall 40, delineated by the inner ridge 46, has been removed, so as to define a relatively small aperture 54. As seen as <figref idrefs="f0005">figure 9</figref>, the aperture 54 extends from the base of the inner wall 56 of the ridge 46 and in the preferred embodiment there is no horizontal annular wall inside of the ridge 46. This is preferred and is not critical. In the preferred embodiment this opening 54 has a width of about 50 mm and a length of about 100 mm.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The third insert 34, shown in <figref idrefs="f0006 f0008">figures 11 to 13</figref>, is effectively the first insert 30 with the base wall 40 within the outer ridge 44 removed, so as to form an aperture 58. Thus the annular portion 50, the inner ridge 46 and the central portion 48 have been removed. As with the second insert 32, the aperture 58 extends from the base of the inner wall 60 of the ridge 44 and there is no horizontal wall inside of the ridge 44. Again, this is preferred and is not critical. In the preferred embodiment this opening 58 has a width of about 125 mm and a length of about 175 mm.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">It is relatively easy to train an animal to urinate or defecate into a tray placed on the ground that contains suitable absorbent material. The animal will urinate or defecate and, with cats, cover its waste with the absorbent material. For cats this is a semi-instinctive action to prevent the animal's waste being smelt by other animals. Accordingly, the initial step is to place the first insert 30 into the well 19 of base unit 10, as seen in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref>. This closes off the aperture 18 and presents a well having a solid base. Suitable absorbent material is placed in the well to a suitable depth, usually about one to two centimetres. The depth of the absorbent material is sufficient to cover then two ridges 44 and 46. The well is approximately 26 mm deep and so the side walls extend above the level of the absorbent material. This aids in retaining the material within the tray and preventing its escape.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The well is preferably not too deep to discourage the animal from supporting itself on the upper surface 12 rather than the absorbent material since at the end of the training process there is usually no insert and only the aperture 18. As such, the animal must support itself on the upper surface 12. The insert 30 fully closes the aperture 18 in the base unit 10 and so no absorbent material, urine or faeces can easily escape through the aperture 18. It will be appreciated that if the animal urinates on the side wall 22 then some urine may escape through the gap between the sidewall 22 of the base unit and the side wall 42 of the insert. However, this is only likely to occur infrequently. If this is of concern to the owner the unit 10 may be placed on some newspaper or the other disposable material.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The base unit 10 and its insert 30 are then placed on the floor, preferably next to the toilet that one wishes the animal to eventually use. The animal is introduced to the unit and trained to use the unit, urinating and defecating onto the absorbent material as with a conventional tray having a solid base. Once the animal is comfortable using the unit, the next step is to train the animal to use unit whilst the unit is located on top of a toilet pan, as seen in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref>. The toilet seat and lid (not shown) are raised and the base unit 10 is placed directly on the rim 28 of the toilet pan 21, with the rim 28 between the walls 16 and 20. The insert 30 remains within the well 19, fully closing the aperture 18, and the unit is used as before with absorbent material overlaying the base of the insert. Because the animal is already relatively comfortable with the unit and the unit has a solid base it is relatively easy to train the animal to use the unit whilst the unit is on the toilet as opposed to on the floor.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The next step is to replace the first insert with the second insert 32, which has the small aperture 54. As previously explained, this insert is substantially the same as the first insert 30 but with the aperture 54 in its centre.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Absorbent material is preferably placed in the insert between the outer peripheral wall 60 and the inner ridge 46. The ridge is about 10 mm high and so allows a reasonable dept of absorbent material to be put in the insert. This also covers the outer ridge 44, but this is not critical. The ridge 46 that surrounds the aperture 54 serves to limit the amount of absorbent material falling through the aperture but is not critical to the working of the invention. The base wall of the insert may be flat with no ridge or ridges and with an<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> aperture simply formed in the base wall. However this would make it relatively easy for the absorbent material to be knocked through the aperture.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Because the animal is still using the absorbent material, initially some waste may be deposited on the absorbent material rather than through the aperture 54. When waste is deposited on the absorbent material the animal may attempt to cover it with other absorbent material. The ridge 46 reduces the amount of absorbent material falling into the toilet bowl due to the animal moving the absorbent material. In addition, the absorbent material will need to be replaced and the inner ridge prevents spillage when doing so.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Because the animal is comfortable using the device on the toilet it is now relatively easy to train it to use the device with the insert 32 rather than insert 30. The animal will tend to sit on the outer portions 50, 52 of the insert or on the annular horizontal wall 12 of the base unit 10. The surface of the absorbent material is lower than the upper surface 12 and this also encourages the animal to support itself on the surface 12. Because the aperture 54 is in the centre of the insert, it is relatively easy for the animal to urinate or defecate through the aperture with its waste of falling into the water in the toilet pan rather than onto the absorbent material. As mentioned, above one of the reasons that animals cover their wastes is to prevent other animals smelling the smell of the waste and becoming aware of the first animal's existence. Since the animal's urine and faeces fall into the water of the toilet pan the smell from these wastes is eliminated or substantially reduced. Further, the waste is not present on the absorbent material of the tray for the animal to attempt to cover. Initially the animal may attempt to cover its waste by scraping at the absorbent material and some absorbent material will fall into the toilet pan. However, as the animal becomes used to using the aperture 54, this will be reduced.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Once the animal is comfortable using the unit with the second insert 32 the next step is to replace the second insert 32 with the third insert 34. The insert 34 has a larger aperture 58, again with a ridge 46 around its edge to prevent and/or limit absorbent material falling through the aperture 58 into the toilet pan. Because the aperture 58 in the third insert 34 is an incremental increase in size compared to the aperture 54 in the second insert 32, the size of the aperture should not discourage the animal from using the device. Accordingly the animal will adapt relatively rapidly to using the device with the larger aperture. Because the aperture is larger the proportion of waste falling into the toilet bowl will be higher and the animal's need to cover its waste will be further reduced.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Finally, once the animal is comfortable with the larger aperture 58, the third insert 34 may be removed totally and the animal will then use the device with just the bare base unit 10, without any absorbent material or other insert.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">It will be appreciated that other ways of varying the size of the aperture during the training process exist and may be used. The device may be provided with an iris arrangement, similar to that found in the lenses of cameras, by means of which the size of the aperture may be adjusted. Alternatively one or more horizontal trays or walls may be supported by slots in the base unit that partially or fully close the aperture. Initially the tray may be fully inserted to close the aperture in the base unit. By progressively<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> withdrawing the horizontal tray through the slot to one side, the size of the aperture it is increased until, eventually, the tray may be removed totally. It will be appreciated that such an embodiment would require the mounting for the adjustable tray to be located above the toilet pan.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Whilst the preferred embodiment provides a base unit into which inserts are.placed with differing size apertures, a single insert may be provided that allows for different sized apertures.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 17</figref> shows an insert 70 for use with the base unit 10 of <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>. The insert 70 is similar to the insert 30 and is provided with a solid base wall 72, side wall 74 and ridges 76 and 78. Located inwards of the two ridges are two concentric lines of weakness 80 and 82.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Initially the insert is used as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">figure 13</figref>, with the solid base wall, until an aperture is needed. At this point the inner portion 84 of the base wall 72 defined by the inner line of weakness 80 is removed. The line of weakness 80 may be configured that the user may merely press out the inner portion 84. Alternatively it may be necessary to cut along the line of weakness 80 to remove the inner portion 84. This transforms the insert into the functionally equivalent of the second insert 32, with an aperture through which waste may pass.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The insert 70 is used as described with the smaller aperture until it is time ti increase the aperture size. The annular ring 86 that is defined between the two lines of weakness 80, 82 is now removed and the insert is now functionally equivalent to the third insert 34. Finally, once the animal is comfortable using the device with the larger aperture, the inset may be removed totally.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The two lines of weakness 80, 82 are preferably provided with a plurality of "tabs" 88 and 90 respectively. These tabs are not essential but enable reuse of the inner portion 84 and the annular ring 86. When the inner portion 84 and annular ring 86 are removed corresponding cut-outs are formed in the outer edge of the pieces removed.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The inner line of weakness 80 has tabs 88. These tabs are spaced along the line of weakness so as not to be diametrically opposite another tab. Once the inner portion has been removed, if it is rotated 180° from its original position and placed into the remainder of the insert, the tabs remaining on the insert will not align with the cut-outs in the inner portion 84. Instead the tabs will lie under part of the inner portion 84 and support it. Whilst the cut-outs will each provide a very small aperture through which absorbent material may fall, effectively the opening is closed.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The tabs 90 are similarly arranged on the outer line of weakness 82 so that rotating the annular ring 86 enable it to be supported by the tabs 90.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">By enabling the removed pieces to be supported, the insert may be used to train another animal or to regress to a smaller aperture if the animal is not ready for the larger aperture.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0039" num="0039">It will be appreciated that the lines of weakness need not be continuous but may be discontinuous, with sections of full strength between the ends of adjacent sections of a line of weakness.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">As mentioned previously, the concept behind the invention is to provide a tray for the animal that initially has no aperture and to progressively increase the size of the aperture until there is merely a support upon which the animal may support itself whilst it defecates or urinates into the toilet. Whilst the invention utilises three replaceable inserts it will be appreciated that the number of inserts used may be varied. Further, for a small animal, it may not be practicable to utilise the base unit by itself. The third insert 34 may be used or an insert may be used that provides a substantially continuous horizontal surface to the animal with a smaller aperture.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041"><figref idrefs="f0010">Figure 18 and 19</figref> show an insert 120 located in the well 19 of base unit 10. The insert has an annular wall that defines an aperture 124. Extending downwards and inwards at about 80° to the horizontal is a peripheral wall 126. This wall 126 fits snugly against the wall 20 of the base unit and rests on the annular wall 22. The height of the peripheral wall 126 is such that the upper surface of the walls 12 and 122 are substantially coplanar.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">It will be appreciated that rather than using a separate insert with removable portions, the base unit 10 may be manufactured with a solid base wall 22 that extends across all of the "aperture" 18 and lines of weakness may be provided in the base wall 22 to allow removal of portions of the wall 22 to provide a series of progressively larger apertures.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many obvious modifications and variations may be made to the embodiments described herein without departing from the scope of the invention.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56986550" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Tiertoilettensystem, umfassend:
