mxw-id="PDES63961269" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to the production of compositions containing IgA for use as a food additive. More specifically, it relates to a process to prepare an IgA-enriched milk product extract composition according to the claims and to such compositions.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The present invention is to be understood in light of what has previously been done in the field. However, the following discussion is not an acknowledgment or admission that any of the material referred to was published, used or part of the common general knowledge in Australia as at the priority date of the application.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the dominant immunoglobulin in human secretions, including breast milk and provides the body with protection against pathogens, binding to disease-causing viruses, bacteria, fungi and their toxins. IgA provides infants essential protection against the aforementioned pathogens. IgA antibodies are effective when taken orally because they are resistant to degradation by enzymes in the gut, thus making them ideal as nutraceuticals or food supplements. IgA may be combined with probiotics to inhibit or reduce adverse effects due to pathogens. Applications include use of IgA as a nutraceutical ingredient to target pathogens which cause infections of human mucosal surfaces such as in the nose, eyes, ears, lungs, breast and vagina. Moreover, IgA-containing products are suitable for gut and oral health applications. Due to the low levels of IgA normally present in cows' milk, the established method to increase the yield of IgA on a commercial scale is by immunisation regimes to boost the levels in the milk. Typically, cow's milk contains IgA and IgG in a ratio of approximately 1:8.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Compositions containing IgA for food consumption are currently produced globally, using essentially the same process and in virtually the same manner. The most common production methodology is referred to as a hyperimmunisation process whereby generally a number of cows are administered an immunogenic substance such as a virus to produce a hyperimmune response. As a consequence of the hyperimmune response, milk produced by the immunised cows contains increased amounts of IgA, otherwise known as "hyperimmune<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> milk". The hyperimmune milk is then concentrated using standard membrane technology to produce a milk product extract containing around 5% w/w IgA, which can be used as a food supplement such as for infant milk formula.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An inherent problem with the procedure to produce the hyperimmune milk is that it generally takes up to three months for the immunisation regime to generate a hyperimmune response in the cows and then a further month to harvest the hyperimmune milk in sufficient quantities to produce a commercial amount of IgA-containing milk product extract. Additionally, this procedure is also expensive compared to the process of the present invention. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO0130168A"><text>WO 0130168</text></patcit> discloses a method of obtaining immunoglobulin-containing products from a dairy source and/or colostrum.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">IgA has an acidic isoelectric point, or pl, in the range of approximately 4.5-6.5 due to variable glycosylation, and is not generally considered to be able to adsorb to cation exchange resins in an amount that would be of commercial value. The process of the present invention surprisingly allows for the fractionation of IgA from milk products such as skim milk by cation exchange chromatography by modifying the loading and elution conditions. Such a process has not previously been achieved on a commercial scale.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Moreover, the process of the present invention may be included as part of an existing process for purification of other components of milk products, such as lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase or growth factors. An example of such a process is one where milk product is contacted with the cation exchange resin and an IgA-enriched fraction is eluted first, followed by an IgA-depleted lactoperoxidase fraction and then a lactoferrin fraction by sequential elution with mobile phases of increasing ionic strength.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The invention relates to a process to prepare an IgA-enriched milk product extract composition according to the claims that obviates the need for hyperimmunisation of cows and thus the time and costs involved therewith.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is thus an object of the present invention to provide an IgA-enriched milk product extract composition and process therefor, which process can be used on a commercial scale, which overcomes at least some of the disadvantages of the prior art. The term 'IgA-enriched' means the ratio of IgA:IgG in the eluted milk product extract is increased relative to the ratio of IgA:IgG in the milk product before fractionation.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process to prepare an IgA-enriched milk product extract composition according to the claims including IgA and IgG extracted from a milk product, wherein the relative IgA to IgG content is increased compared to that in the milk product, which process includes:

Preferably the flow rates used are in the range of 6-70 litres per litre of resin per<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> hour (linear flow 60-700 cm per h), more preferably 6-40 litres per litre of resin per hour (linear flow 60-400 cm per h). With these flow rates it has been found that for optimum fractionation of IgA the amount of milk product in contact with the cation exchange resin is in the range of 16-300 column (bed) volumes, preferably 16-200 column volumes, more preferably 16-40 column volumes.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In a further aspect of the invention, prior to elution of the IgA-enriched fraction, the cation exchange resin is rinsed with a buffer of low ionic strength, (&lt; 0.008 M salt or its equivalent) or water, to remove milk product remaining in the column.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The types of cation exchange resins employed in the present invention are Sepharose cation exchange resin beads, such as SP Sepharose Big Beads. Further preferred are resin beads in the size range 45-300 µm.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a process wherein the cationic exchange resin comprises Sepharose beads, preferably in the size range 45-300 µm.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The process of the invention may be employed as a continuous process or as a batch process, with continuous processing being preferred. The eluted IgA-enriched fraction may be subsequently treated to reduce the salt content therein.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Skim milk contains about 1-2.5% IgG w/w and 0.05-0.1% IgA w/w and bovine serum contains 20% IgG w/w and 0.4% IgA w/w. The inventors have found that with the process of the present invention the milk product extract concentrate (eluate) obtained surprisingly contains lower levels of IgG w/w than expected, with ratios of IgA:IgG typically in the order of 1:2 which equates to an eight- to sixteen-fold concentration of IgA. The quantitation of IgA and IgG was performed using an ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) kit. This increase in IgA:IgG ratio has significant implications for those wanting to provide increased levels of IgA in food substances or as neutraceuticals. The presence of IgA and the relative amounts (ratio) of IgA and IgG in cation exchange chromatography eluates was not previously known.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The invention provides for a process in which the resulting IgA-enriched milk product extract composition comprises an IgA:IgG ratio of at least 1:4, and more preferably at least 1:2.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The IgA enriched milk product extract composition may be further treated to reduce the amount of non-IgA proteins present. This may be achieved by membrane filtration, column chromatography, dialysis or other known means. Removal of such extraneous proteins may be considered important for the production of standardised food substances or nutraceuticals.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The invention provides an IgA-enriched milk product extract composition in which the IgA:IgG ratio is at least 1:4, and more preferably at least 1:2.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an IgA-enriched milk product extract composition, obtained by the process of the invention. Moreover, the milk product extract of the invention may be used as a food substance or nutraceutical, preferably as an infant food substance or nutraceutical.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The results of the present process are particularly surprising given that immunoglobulins are considered to belong to a class of proteins with an acidic isoelectric point and therefore unlikely to be retained on a cation exchange resin, or in a manner in which IgA is preferentially bound compared to IgG.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES</b></heading><p id="p0027" num="0027"><ul><li>Figs 2A-2C - Effect of Salt concentration and flow rate of elution on IgA elution.</li><li>Figs 3A-3E - Effect of milk product volume contacted with cation exchange resin.</li><li>Figs 4A-4C - Effect of skim milk product volume contacted with cation exchange resin.</li><li>Figs 5A-5D - Effect of mobile phase pH on the composition of IgA eluted.</li><li>Figs 6A-6C - IgA purification from whey protein concentrate (WPC).</li><li>Figs 7A-7E - A process to isolate IgA-enriched fraction, lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase; effect of mobile phase ionic strength on IgA in various fractions.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b></heading><p id="p0028" num="0028">The following is a detailed description of the preparation of an IgA-enriched fraction of the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Suitable sources of IgA may include milk products such as whole milk, skim milk, whey from a cow. In contacting the milk product with the cation exchange resin to allow the IgA to adsorb, the pH of the milk product is preferably about 6.5 although it is not necessary to adjust the pH of the milk product for the present invention.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The flow rates used to contact the milk product with the cation exchange resin can be varied over a wide range, such as from 6-90 litres per litre resin per hour (linear flow 60-900 cm per h), preferably, 6-70 litres per litre resin per hour (linear flow 60-700 cm per h), more preferably about 6-40 litres per litre resin per hour (linear flow 60-400 cm per h). The lower limit is determined by cost-effectiveness for an industrial process, whereby at very low flow rates the cost to run the process exceeds the return. High flow rates are suitable for IgA purification provided the total amount of milk product contacted with the resin is limited.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Whilst milk product volumes greatly exceeding the resin volume are suitable for purification of other milk products such as lactoperoxidase and lactoferrin, as described in Australian Patent no. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="AU613688"><text>613688</text></patcit>, the present inventors have found that a milk product volume to resin volume in the order of 1000 column volumes (litres milk product per litre resin) is unsuitable for IgA purification by the process of the invention. The inventors have found that milk product volume to resin volume in excess of about 400 column volumes result in little IgA binding to the resin and the IgA recovered will not be enriched relative to IgG in the starting material. The preferred upper limit according to the invention, in the case of skim milk, is 300 column volumes, preferably 200 column volumes, most preferably 34 column volumes. As the milk product to resin ratio increases the amount of IgA bound and the purity of the eluted IgA gradually decreases. As for the flow rate, the lower limit is set by commercial concerns rather than column-related factors.
