The introduction of an effective structural monitoring system capable of predicting the failure of load paths in a structure designed according to damage tolerance criteria would allow optimizing its design and, accordingly, reducing its weight.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Optical fiber sensors can be effectively used to measure thermomechanical deformation and even to detect damage events operating both alone in passive structural monitoring systems and in combination with other devices, forming an active monitoring system. One of their main advantages is their capacity to be embedded in composite structures, being intimately integrated into the structures.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5309533A"><text>US 5309533 A</text></patcit> discloses a composite material formed of a plurality of sheets forming plies, a casing formed between two of the plurality of sheets forming the composite material, the casing having an internal diameter, an optical fibre located within the casing and having an external diameter which is less than the internal diameter of the casing, the optical fibre also having a slow axis and a fast axis of propagation.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2006107278A1"><text>WO 2006/107278 A1</text></patcit> provides an optical fiber strain sensor with a composite structure, in which an aluminium caulplate is used as the base for the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> lay-up. The caulplate is wrapped with a layer of release fabric Teflon coated fiber glass or non-porous release film (Release Ease 234 TFNP) that has been cleaned with acetone to remove any contaminants that might affect the surface quality of the cured laminates before laying the carbon fiber prepregs. The composite laminate is prepared by layering prepregs onto the non-porous release film on the caulplate using a manual lay-up method. At this stage, the grating fiber containing the two fiber Bragg gratings is introduced in the prepregs with the grating fiber running parallel to the reinforced fiber of each. The completed laminate is covered with a layer of release fabric Teflon coated fiberglass or porous release film (Release Ease 234 TFNP), followed by a breather cloth (Airwaves Super) to absorb the excess resin. Finally, a layer of non-porous release film is placed on top of the breather cloth before the whole set-up is transferred to a composite-curing table (e.g. Heatcon 9500) or a vacuum oven (e.g. Salvis Lab Vacuum Oven Vacucenter VC-20).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, one of the drawbacks of this integration is the difficulty that the integration of the optical fiber has under real laminate manufacturing conditions and the repair of these same fibers once they are embedded. Optical fiber has extremely small dimensions and due to its fragility, it is difficult to handle during the handling operations associated to the integration processes during the manufacture of the laminate, the manufacture of the vacuum bag and curing in the autoclave (or any other alternative laminate consolidation process), the connectorization and subsequent maintenance and/or repair operations of the same optical fiber of the housing laminate. In particular, the scarce possibilities of accessing the optical fiber once it is embedded are very slim and even slimmer yet with regard to its successful repair, which is incompatible with the reparability requirements needed when the structural health and maintenance criteria are bound to the correct working of the network of sensors integrated in the structure.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention is aimed at solving this drawback.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">In a first aspect, the present invention proposes a composite structure comprising:<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> -->
<ol><li>a) a laminate structure formed by a plurality of layers;</li><li>b) an optical fiber for structural monitoring purposes which is at least partly embedded in said laminate structure, the embedded part of the optical fiber susceptible to requiring repair is integrated in a surface layer of the laminate structure; and</li><li>c) insulation means located at the optical fiber areas susceptible to repair with respect to the surface layer in which they are integrated; said insulation means including:
<ul><li>a bottom separating film positioned below the optical fiber between the optical fiber and the laminate structure so as to facilitate the separation of the optical fiber from the laminate structure,</li><li>a top separating film positioned on the optical fiber, and</li><li>a laminar protective cover arranged on the top separating film.</li></ul></li></ol></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">These insulation means protect the optical fiber during the structure manufacturing process and allow subsequent access thereto for its maintenance (connection, modification of the line or damage repair while in service) without significantly affecting the integrity of the structure.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In a second aspect the present invention proposes a process of repairing the optical fiber embedded in said composite structure comprising the following steps:
<ul><li>Removing the insulation means from the optical fiber area in need of repair.</li><li>Extracting the optical fiber area in need of repair from the composite structure.</li><li>Repairing the optical fiber.</li><li>Relocating the repaired optical fiber area in the composite structure.</li><li>Providing a new protective cover on the repaired optical fiber area.</li></ul></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The optical fiber integration techniques proposed in this invention allow embedding optical fiber in composite structures, assuring the continued existence of the former at the points of entry in the structure and allowing access to the fiber at these points of entry or at intermediate points for its maintenance (connection, modification of the line or damage repair while in service), all this without significantly affecting the structural integrity of the laminate.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Other features and advantages of the present invention will be understood from the following detailed description of an illustrative embodiment of its object in relation to the attached drawings.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows a schematic perspective view of a composite structure known in the art formed by six layers with an optical fiber embedded in one of its sides longitudinally to the reinforcement fibers and a cross-sectional view of area A of said structure.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the structure of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> in which, using conventional composite structure repair techniques, parts of the surface layer and the second surface have been removed by means of sanding until reaching the embedded optical fiber that has been damaged during the process.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> shows elevational, plan and cross-sectional views of a composite structure according to a first embodiment of the invention in which the optical fiber is embedded in a surface layer.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref> shows elevational, plan and cross-sectional views of a composite structure according to a second embodiment of the invention in which the optical fiber is embedded inside the structure, leaving only part of it in a surface layer.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref> shows similar views to those of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 3 and 4</figref> after the structure consolidation process, in which the optical fiber, the separating films and the outer protective layer are embedded in the structure.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 6</figref> shows the same view of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref> after removing the outer protective layer and the outer separating film, the optical fiber being left uncovered.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref> shows the same view as <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 6</figref> in which the previously cut ends of the optical fiber are reconnected after performing the required maintenance operations.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 8</figref> shows the same view as <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref> after the repair process has ended.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 9</figref> shows a similar view to that of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref> in which the embedded<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> optical fiber is repaired by means of an external optical fiber line.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 10</figref> shows the same view as <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 9</figref> after the repair process has ended.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows a composite structure 11 known in the art formed by a plurality of layers 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 with an optical fiber 25 embedded within it that can be part of both a sensor network and part of a data transmission element embedded within it. The integration of this fiber 25 in the structure 11 is a complex and delicate process, especially regarding the points of entry of the fiber 25 in said structure, required for its connection to the outside, and the continued existence of these points during the consolidation process.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Furthermore, if for any reason it were necessary to access said optical fiber 25 to proceed to the maintenance thereof (connection, modification of the line or damage repair while in service), it is possible to reach it by means of composite repair techniques consisting of the local removal of the reinforcement layers 13, 15 until accessing the fiber 25. However optical fiber 15 is a very fragile element and said operations for removing parts of the layers of the structure can damage it, as is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the invention, the structure 11 includes insulation means of the optical fiber 25 insulating it from the layers in which it is embedded, increasing its possibilities of continued existence and facilitating access thereto at those points susceptible to having maintenance operations (connection, modification of the line or damage repair while in service) performed thereon.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Therefore, and as is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">Figures 3-5</figref>, in the case of structures 11 with optical fiber 25 embedded in the surface layer 13, and at certain points such as the points of entry of the optical fiber 25 in the structure 11 through the surface, or at intermediate points chosen as suitable points for performing maintenance tasks, the following insulation means are incorporated:
