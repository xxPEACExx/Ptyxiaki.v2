Technical Field</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">This invention is directed to spark plugs and other ignition devices used in internal combustion engines and, more particularly, to ignition devices having high performance metal firing tips.</p><heading id="h0004">2. Related Art</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">Spark plugs are well known in the industry and have long been used to initiate combustion in internal combustion engines. In general, a spark plug is a device that extends into a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine and enables a spark to ignite a combustible mixture of air and fuel therein. Specifically, a spark plug typically includes a cylindrical metal shell having external threads that screw into a portion of the engine and further having a hook shaped ground electrode attached thereto at a firing end of the spark plug. A cylindrical insulator is disposed partially within the metal shell and extends axially beyond the metal shell toward a firing end and also toward a terminal end. A conductive terminal is disposed within the cylindrical insulator at the terminal end of the spark plug, opposite the firing end. At the firing end, a center electrode is disposed within the insulator and projects axially out of the insulator toward the ground electrode, whereby a spark plug gap is defined between the center electrode and the ground electrode.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Due to the very nature of an internal combustion engine, spark plugs are exposed to many extremes occurring within the engine cylinder, including high temperatures and various corrosive combustion gases, which have traditionally reduced the longevity of the spark plug. Spark erosion also reduces the longevity of spark plugs. Spark erosion is where the electrode and in particular the firing tip or a material next to or adjacent to the firing tip erodes away during operation due to localized vaporization due to arc temperatures. Spark plugs traditionally have<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> electrodes formed from Nickel or Nickel alloys which are susceptible to spark erosion. Recently manufacturers have been forming the firing end of the center electrode out of a precious metal such as Platinum, Iridium, or alloys thereof to minimize spark erosion. Platinum, Iridium, and alloys thereof are typically very resistant to spark erosion. However, Platinum, Iridium, and alloys thereof are generally very expensive and it is desirable to minimize the amount of material used to provide the spark portion.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In operation, ignition voltage pulses of up to 40,000 volts are applied through the spark plug to the center electrode, thereby causing the spark to jump the gap between the center and ground electrodes. The spark ignites the air and fuel mixture within the combustion chamber or cylinder to create high temperature combustion to power the engine. Unfortunately, the high voltage and high temperature environment within the combustion chamber can degrade the components of the spark plug, such as through spark erosion. As the spark plug becomes degraded, the characteristic of the spark may become altered thereby degrading the quality of the spark and resulting combustion. While Platinum, Iridium, or other previous metals and alloys thereof are less susceptible to spark erosion, if too small of a piece, either in length, width, or size is used for the precious metal firing tip, the spark may jump around the precious metal tip and arc between the base material of the center electrode and the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> ground electrode. As the base material is typically a Nickel alloy, it is susceptible to spark erosion which may cause the base material or center electrode to erode away until the precious metal tip falls off. Any degradation of the plug will affect the quality of the spark and any spark that does not originate from the spark surface on the spark portion but instead originates on the center electrode and passes around the precious metal firing tip will degrade the quality of the spark. The quality of the spark effects the ignition of the mixture of air and fuel (i.e., the combustion efficiency, combustion temperature, and combustion products) thus, the power output, fuel efficiency, performance of the engine, and the emissions produced by the combustion of the air and fuel mixture may be adversely affected. Due to the increasing emphasis on regulating emissions for motor vehicles, increasing fuel prices, and modem performance demands it is desirable to maintain a high quality spark for consistent engine performance and emission quality.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The longevity of the spark plug and thereby resistance of the spark plug to spark erosion is also important to manufacturers. Manufacturers are increasingly requiring longer service lifetimes from spark plugs such as 160,500 Km (100,000 miles), 241,350 Km (150,000 miles), and 281,575 Km (175,000 miles) service lifetimes. Many traditional Nickel spark plugs only have service lifetimes of 32,180 to 64,350 Km (20,000 to 40,000 miles) due to spark erosion and corrosion. Furthermore, many manufacturers are increasing the compression within an engine cylinder to provide a more fuel efficient engine. Any increase in compression also requires an increase in operating voltage of the spark plug to sufficiently allow the spark to jump the spark gap between the center and ground electrodes. Any increase in the operating voltage of a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> spark plug also increases the likelihood of spark erosion and therefore reduces the longevity of the spark plug. One method to combat spark erosion is to significantly increase the amount of precious metal material such as Iridium, Platinum, or alloys thereof forming the tip spark portion or size of the firing tip. However, Iridium, Platinum, and alloys thereof are extremely expensive and as manufacturers continually demand cost reductions, it becomes important to minimize the amount of Iridium, Platinum, or alloys thereof used in spark plugs.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Furthermore, in manufacturing spark plugs having spark portions formed out of Iridium, Platinum, or alloys thereof, attachment of the spark portion to the center electrode base material may be difficult. The Iridium and Platinum alloys tend to be dissimilar in properties and are sometimes difficult to reliably weld to the base material of the center electrode. Additionally Iridium and its alloys are often very brittle causing difficulty in processing and attachment to the base material.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US4853582A"><text>US-A- 4 853 582</text></patcit> discloses a spark plug for internal combustion engines having a pair of electrodes between which electric spark discharge is effected. The spark plug has a spark discharge portion bonded by, for example, resistance welding to at least one of the electrodes and made of a base metal containing at least 90wt % of chromium. A stress-relieving portion having a thermal expansion coefficient intermediate in value between those of the electrode and the spark discharge portion may be formed between the electrode and the spark discharge portion.</p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">In view of the above, the present invention is directed to multilayer firing tip for a spark plug that minimizes the amount of precious metal used while providing<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> sufficient resistance to spark erosion and corrosion, an intermediate material that is resistant to sparking.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The spark plug includes a firing tip having a discharge end and a weld end. The weld end is connected to a center electrode, and more specifically a base electrode on the center electrode.

More specifically, the weld end has a coefficient of thermal expansion which is greater than the coefficients of thermal expansion for the discharge end and base electrode. The spark plug includes a firing tip having a discharge end and a weld end. The weld end includes a material that is formed from Nickel and Chromium with a limited amount<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> of additional elements.

A spark plug 10 is illustrated in front elevational view in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. The spark plug 10 includes an outer metallic shell 12 secured to an insulator 14. The outer metallic shell 12 is attached to a ground electrode 20. The insulator 14 has a central bore (not shown) in which a center electrode assembly 40 is situated. The center electrode 40 extends at a firing end 44 beyond the insulator 14 and more specifically beyond the insulator core nose 18. At the firing end 44 of the center electrode assembly 40 a base electrode 42 is situated to which a firing tip 50 is attached facing the ground electrode 20.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The base electrode 42 as illustrated in the figures extends partially into the combustion chamber and therefore is formed from an alloy that is substantially resistant to corrosion and oxidation. Base electrodes are commonly formed from alloys that include Nickel. Additional elements may be added to the base electrode, such as Chromium, Silicon, Manganese, Titanium, Zirconium, Carbon, Iron, Yttrium, Aluminum, Manganese, Calcium, Copper, Sulfur, Vanadium, Niobium, Molybdenum, Tungsten, Cobalt, Phosphorus, and Lead. One such Nickel alloy includes less than 2% Silicon and Aluminum and less than 0.5% Yttrium, Iron, Chromium; Carbon, Titanium, Manganese, Calcium, Copper, Sulfur, Phosphorus, Vanadium, Niobium, Molybdenum, Tungsten, and Cobalt. Another acceptable Nickel alloy includes less than 3% Chromium and Manganese and less than 1% Silicon, Titanium, Zirconium,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> Carbon, and Iron. Another acceptable Nickel alloy includes less than 20% Chromium, less than 10% Iron and less than 1% Manganese, Silicon, Magnesium, Aluminum, Cobalt, Niobium, Carbon, Copper, Molybdenum, Phosphorus, Titanium, Sulfur and Lead.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The firing tip 50 is attached to the base electrode 42. The firing tip 50 faces the ground electrode 20 and during operation a spark is created in the spark gap 22 between the firing tip 50 and the ground electrode 20. The firing tip 50 is formed from two distinct materials. More specifically the firing tip 50 includes a discharge end 52 and a weld end 54. The discharge end 52 is welded to the weld end 54 at a weld 56. The firing tip 50 may also be welded to the base electrode 42 with a weld pool 58 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The discharge end 52 is formed from a material that is resistant to spark erosion and also typically resistant to corrosion. Materials resistant to spark erosion generally include Iridium (Ix), Platinum (Pt), Palladium (Pd), Rhodium (Rh), Ruthenium (Ru), Rhenium (Re), or alloys thereof. The inventors have found that Platinum and Iridium or alloys thereof due to their general availability and ease of manufacture as well as resistance to spark erosion and corrosion currently provide the best balance of desirable characteristics. Discharge ends 52 formed of Iridium alloys typically include other elements such as elements selected from the group consisting of Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium, Ruthenium, Rhenium, Copper (Cu), Chromium (Cr), Vanadium (V), Zirconium (Zr), Nickel (N), and Tungsten (W).</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">An exemplary Iridium alloy suited for use as the discharge end 52 generally includes at least 90% Iridium, Platinum, or a combination thereof with less than 5% Rhodium, less than 3% Tungsten, less than 3% Zirconium, and less than 10% other materials. Another exemplary Iridium alloy suited for the discharge end 52 includes more than 90% Iridium, less than 3% Rhodium, less than 1% Tungsten, and less than 1% Zirconum. The Iridium alloy as described above generally has a coefficient of thermal expansion of approximately less than 71/°C x 10<sup>-6</sup> at 20 °C.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The discharge end 52 is attached to the weld end 54 to form the firing tip 50. The discharge end 52 and weld end 54 are generally attached by a weld 56 or many other means. The weld end 54 is generally formed from a Nickel alloy and has a thermal expansion coefficient greater than the thermal expansion coefficients of the discharge end 52 and base electrode 42. The inventors have surprisingly found that<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> unlike the prior art which requires intermediate members, such as the weld end 54, to have a thermal expansion coefficient somewhere between the surrounding ends, such as the discharge end 52 and base electrode 42, that a thermal expansion coefficient higher than the surrounding members provides a material well suited for intermediate members and as a spark plug material well suited for use in the combustion chamber. The materials with the given relationships of coefficients of thermal expansion form welds that have acceptable longevity, have the desired characteristics of an intermediate member and the desirable characteristics to resist corrosion and spark erosion. The present invention has found that certain alloys with thermal expansion coefficients that are greater than the thermal expansion coefficients of the base member and discharge end by at least 5% provide desirable characteristics as an intermediate member. The thermal expansion coefficient of the weld end 54 is greater than 13.5, specifically greater than 14 and more specifically greater than 14.5. The inventors have found that an alloy of Nickel and Chromium having a thermal expansion coefficient of approximately 14.5-15 provides desirable characteristics for an intermediate member in a spark plug, specifically an intermediate member forming a portion of the firing tip 50 of the spark plug 10.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Alloys for the weld end 54 include Nickel and Chromium with at least one element selected from the group consisting of, Copper, Vanadium, Zirconium, Tungsten, Osmium (Os), Gold (Au), Iron (Fe), Cobalt (Co), and Aluminum (Al). Based upon testing of some combinations of the above elements, it is expected that all of the above potential combinations will provide sufficient corrosion resistance, longevity, and the ability to be securely welded to the base electrode and the discharge end 52 over the lifetime of the spark plug. Furthermore, it has been surprisingly found that the weld end 54 having less than 20% by weight of Platinum, Iridium, Ruthenium, Rhenium, and Rhodium, provides desirable characteristics of an intermediate member while reducing the amount of precious metals used. Furthermore, an alloy having less than 10% of Platinum, Iridium, Ruthenium, Rhenium, and Rhodium has been found to have acceptable characteristics. Even alloys with less than 5% and more specifically less than 3% of any elements selecting from the group consisting of Platinum, Iridium, Ruthenium, Rhenium, and Rhodium and less than 5% of any combination thereof provides desirable characteristics for an intermediate member while reducing to a minimum the amount of precious metals<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> used. The alloy for the weld end 54 generally includes both Nickel and Chromium with approximately less than 2% of any element selected from the group consisting of Iron, Platinum, Iridium, Ruthenium, Rhenium, Rhodium, Magnesium (Mg), Manganese (Mn), Aluminum, Silicon (Si), Zirconium, Tungsten, Vanadium, Osmium, Gold, Copper, and Cobalt.

The butted ends 81 and 83 are then further welded about the circumference of the butt so that a sufficient weld is provided to keep the discharge end 52 attached to the weld end 54 through the operational life of the spark plug 10. In the preferred embodiment, the complete circumference of the butted ends 81 and 83 are welded together such as by laser weld, resistance weld, EB weld, brazing, friction welding, stir welding, or any other method of attaching two materials together. In some embodiments, the tack welding step may be eliminated and the circumferential weld may be performed immediately. In other embodiments the two ends may be friction welded together such as by spinning one of the first and second materials 80 or 82 relevant to the other of the first and second materials 80 or 82 so that the butted ends 81 and 83 become welded together at the weld joint 56.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">After the butted ends 81 and 83 are welded together at the weld joint 56 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGS. 9B</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0008">12B</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0009">13B</figref>, a portion of the combined materials including the weld 56 is severed to form the firing tip 50. The process of severing may be done through a punch 90 and die 92 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGS. 9C and 9D</figref>, a cutting operation as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 12C</figref> and then a punch as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIGS. 12D and 12E</figref>, or a two part cutting operation as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 13C</figref>. While the cutting operation is illustrated as being performed by a saw blade 98, the combined material 84 may be severed by any means such as a laser, abrasion, diamond saw, metal band saw, or any other method of severing two metallic members from each other to form a discharge end 52 acceptable to be used as a spark surface in a spark plug and a weld end 54 with a surface acceptable for welding to the base electrode 42. While each of the drawings illustrates a single joined elongated material 84 such as a single joined wire 84 as being individually severed, although not illustrated, the inventors have found it preferable to join a multitude of elongated materials to form a bundle of a multitude of joined materials 84. The bundle may then be severed in bulk, such as by a diamond saw cutting through the bundle and severing one of the first and second materials 80 or 82 from the joined material 84. the firing tip then may be severed from the other material 80 or 82 such as by a punch or saw. While currently the inventors have found the most efficient way of assembling and manufacturing the firing tip 50 on a spark plug is to join and then bundle the joined materials 84 into a bundle of between fifty and one hundred individual joined wires 84 and then sever the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> firing tip from the joined material 84 with a diamond saw 98, it is believed that with additional manufacturing equipment specifically designed for handling the tiny firing tips 50, punching may be a more efficient method of assembly. For example, a single machine that performs the punching, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIGS. 9C and 9D</figref> as well as <figref idrefs="f0008">FIGS. 12D and 12E</figref>, and then grabs the firing tip 50 after being punched and automatically welds it in place on a spark plug 10 or center electrode assembly 40 may be a more efficient method of assembly.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">After the individual firing tips 50 have been severed so that the firing tip 50 includes a portion of the first material 80 and the second material 82, which respectively form the discharge end 52 and weld end 54 with the weld 56 therebetween, the welded piece (firing tip 50) is then grabbed for assembly to the base electrode 42. It should be recognized that while the drawings illustrate the weld 56 being approximately in the center of the firing tip 50, to reduce material cost the discharge end 52 may be made significantly smaller than the weld end 54. This would still allow a discharge end 52 to be provided that is sufficiently robust against spark erosion while providing a weld end 54 that is more resistant to corrosion.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Minimizing the size of the discharge end 52, not only reduces the material cost, but also minimizes the effect of corrosion on the discharge end 52. For example, an Iridium alloy discharge end 52 may be susceptible to specific types of corrosion in the combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine. As Iridium has a high melting point, it is also highly resistant to oxidation and corrosion. However, as vehicle manufacturers have been increasing compression and operating temperatures of engines to improve fuel economy, it has been found that Iridium has a very volatile oxidation state at high temperatures, such as at the upper end of the operating range of the spark plug. As higher compression engines require more power to be supplied through the plug to force the spark to jump the gap between the center electrode 40 and the ground electrode 20, the operational temperature of the spark plug 10 has been increasing. At high temperatures, an Iridium discharge portion 52 of a spark plug 10 may experience severe corrosion. This corrosion is believed to occur when at high temperatures Calcium and/or Phosphorus react with Iridium to cause corrosion and erosion of the discharge end 52. The presence of Calcium and Phosphorus in combustion materials is relatively a more recent development as many manufacturers attempt to increase fuel economy by allowing more oil to seep into the combustion<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> chamber to reduce friction. Calcium and Phosphorous are primarily present in engine oils and particularly in oil additives. It is believed that Calcium and Phosphorus in the presence of Oxygen during combustion within the engine cylinder react with Iridium to form a volatile compound that evaporates and results in a loss of Iridium on the discharge end 52. More specifically, it is believed that gaseous Calcium during the combustion and exhaust cycle condenses on the Iridium discharge portion of the spark plug and more particularly the sides of the discharge portion of the firing tip 50. It is known that molten Calcium dissolves Iridium and that Iridium is vulnerable to oxidation in the presence of Phosphorus. Therefore, the compound formed after the Phosphorus and oxygen react with the dissolved Calcium Iridium mixture is very volatile and subject to evaporation which results in the loss of Iridium on the discharge portion. Typically this erosion occurs on the sides of the discharge portion and not the spark surface thereby minimizing the amount of material used in the discharge end 52 provides a discharge end 52 that is highly resistant to spark erosion while yet having minimal surface area that is susceptible to corrosion. More specifically it is found that the sparking on the spark surface keeps the Iridium free of corrosion. Similar concerns occur with Platinum which may have various growths which eventually may interfere with the spark gap thereby reducing performance of the spark plug.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Thereby when the firing tip 50 is severed from the joined materials 84, the method of severing may allow for a very minute amount of Iridium discharge portion to be used that is welded onto the weld end 54. This allows for a much smaller quantity in height and length than would typically be able to be easily processed in a manufacturing setting when directly welding a small piece of precious metal such as Iridium to a firing tip. The method of the present invention also provides for a more secure weld than can typically be accomplished if a small piece of the discharge end is welded to the weld end, especially for hard to weld materials such as Iridium. More specifically, the firing tip 50 can be severed with a very minute portion forming then discharge end with the bulk of the firing tip 50 being formed from the weld end 54. By using the process of the present invention, the amount of Iridium used to form a discharge end 52 is much smaller than as if the firing tip 50 was individually welded as separate components. This also allows the effects of corrosion of Iridium to be minimized.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Once the firing tip 50 is severed from the joined materials 84, it is picked up and then assembled onto the spark plug. Of course before assembly onto the spark plug 10 certain optional assembly steps may occur. To provide a better bond between the base electrode 42 and the weld material 54, certain processing operations may be performed to the firing tip 50, such as adding a rivet head 60 to the weld end 54 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 10A</figref>. One way to add a rivet head 60 to the firing tip 50 is to line up the firing tip 50 with a heading die 96 and push the firing tip 50 into a heading die 96. The firing tip 50 is supported by a punch 94 which then pushes the firing pin 50 into the heading die 96 to form the rivet head 60. The punch 94 may also be formed in a hollow fashion with a kick out pin (not shown) which is pushed into the Iridium end to cause the weld end 54 to deform and be headed into a rivet 60. By supporting the Iridium portion with the punch 94, the discharge end 52 is prevented from shattering as Iridium and other precious alloys generally are very brittle. The firing tip 50 may then be attached as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 10B</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 11</figref> by placing the rivet head 60 into a cavity on the base electrode 42 and then welding such as by a laser 100. Other processing steps may also occur to further form the base electrode 42 and more specifically the firing end 44 of the center electrode assembly 40.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">If the firing tip 50 is not formed with a rivet head 60, the firing tip 50 may be directly attached to the base electrode 42 and welded thereto such as by resistance welding as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 9E</figref>. Of course laser welding and other methods of welding may be used.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 11</figref>, a noble metal chip 70 may also be added to the ground electrode 20.

More specifically, <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a secondary firing tip 50' with a riveted head 60 directly opposing the firing tip 50 attached to the center electrode. By putting two firing tips, one on the center electrode and one on the ground electrode with their discharge ends facing each other, the performance of the spark plug may be improved.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The foregoing discussion discloses and describes an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
