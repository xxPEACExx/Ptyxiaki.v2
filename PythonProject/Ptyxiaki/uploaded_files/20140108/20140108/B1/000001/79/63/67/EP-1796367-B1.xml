load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0002">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a technique for correcting image registration in an image forming apparatus employing an electrostatic recording system or an electrophotographic recording system.</p><heading id="h0003">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Recently users have demanded high speeds and high image quality as well as conformity with various kinds of recording sheets (recording media) for image forming apparatuses. This provides particular challenges for color image forming apparatus, where multi-color images are sequentially overlapped on a transfer member so as to form color images.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As a means for increasing speed, a tandem type of recording system is provided in which a plurality of image forming sections for each color are arranged in a row. The speed of the system can be further increased by reducing the gap between pages or recording sheets, i.e., between images continuously formed during continuous printing.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In order to improve image quality, in both the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> monochromatic and color image forming apparatuses, the displacement relative to a recording sheet is reduced by improving accuracies in position for forming images on the recording sheet. In a color image forming apparatus, high image quality is also achieved by improving accuracies in position when multi-color images are overlapped on one transfer sheet so as to reduce color misalignment. Furthermore, in the color image forming apparatus, high image quality is achieved by reducing density misalignment between desirable images and images formed by the image forming apparatus in practice. For correcting the position misalignment, the color misalignment, and the density misalignment, the image forming job can be stopped (interrupted) so as to form a mark train on a transfer member for detecting the misalignment based on the detected result. After adjustment, the image forming job can be resumed.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, since the job has been interrupted for correction (adjustment) in this method, the productivity is reduced. In addition, a problem arises in that image quality is different before and after the adjustment is made during the same job.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It has been suggested in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2005292760A"><text>2005-292760</text></patcit> that adjusting color misalignment without interruption can be achieved by performing the correction in<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the gaps (intervals) between images continuously formed during continuous printing.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">When images are formed on both sides (front and rear sides) of one recording sheet, the adjustment of size and position of the images on both sides (double-side registration) is demanded. When toner images formed on the recording sheet are fixed by heating, since part of the moisture contained in the recording sheet is evaporated due to the fixing heat, the recording sheet can contract after the fixing so as to generate dimensional change. This dimensional change is different for each type of recording sheet.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In a two-sided printing mode, after images are fixed on the front side (first side), images are formed on the rear side (second side) in a state that the recording sheet has contracted by about 0.1 to 0.5%. Hence, when the recording sheet by absorbs water after the images are formed on the rear side, the recording sheet and images expand, so that the image size of the front side is different from that of the rear side, resulting in poor front to back image registration. An image forming apparatus is proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2002014507A"><text>2002-014507</text></patcit> for improving image quality by solving the problems during the two-sided printing described above, by changing the rotational speed of a polarizer (rotary polygon mirror), which is scanning<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> means for writing images, to align the double-side image dimensions during two-sided printing.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">As described above, for speeding up and improving image quality, it is effective to align images in the space between continuously formed images. Also, in improving image quality during two-sided printing, a technique changing the rotational speed of the polarizer (rotary polygon mirror) is effective for the image dimensional alignment.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Accordingly, for speeding up and improving image quality, it may be effective to change the rotating speed of the polarizer (rotary polygon mirror) in conformity with the dimension of the continuously formed images (i.e., changing the image dimension) as well as to align the image in the space between continuously formed images.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A sequence of reference marks for detecting the misalignment needs to be formed at a known reference image size as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2005292760A"><text>2005-292760</text></patcit>. However, the size of the reference marks for detecting the misalignment for double sided images must be changed between the imaging of the first side and the second side. Therefore, the rotational speed of the polarizer must be changed so that the image dimension becomes 100%. That is, the rotational speed of the polarizer is changed for writing so that the image dimension at a first time (front<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> side) becomes 102%; after writing, the rotational speed of the polarizer is changed so that the image dimension becomes 100% so as to form the reference marks on the other side for detecting the misalignment. Furthermore, the rotational speed of the polarizer is changed for writing so that the image dimension at a second time (rear side) becomes 98%; after writing, the rotational speed of the polarizer is changed so that the image dimension becomes 100% so as to form the reference marks for detecting the misalignment. These operations are to be repeated.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">During changing the rotational speed of the polarizer, images cannot be formed. Also, the rotational speed of the polarizer is not stabilized until a predetermined time lapses after changing it, so that with increasing number of times of changing the rotational speed, the space between continuously formed images is increased, reducing the productivity of printing.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Accordingly, the number of times of changing the rotational speed of the polarizer is desirable to be as small as possible. That is, it is desirable that the reference marks for detecting the misalignment be formed without changing the rotational speed of the polarizer.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A known method of performing color displacement detection for an image forming apparatus is described in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US20020136570A"><text>US 2002/0136570</text></patcit>.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The present invention addresses these problems and others which will be understood from the following description.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">The present invention provides an image forming apparatus capable of forming high quality images at a high speed while suppressing misalignment to the minimum without interrupting continuous printing.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The above-mentioned features are achieved by the combination of the features described in claim 1, and dependent claims 2 and 3 define further advantageous embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a longitudinal sectional view of the schematic configuration of an image forming apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a block diagram of the image forming apparatus according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a block diagram of the configuration of an MFP control unit according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a drawing showing the configuration of a patch detection sensor according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5A</figref> is a schematic view of an operation panel;

Then, reflected light images from the manuscript are condensed on a full-color sensor (CCD) 217 with a lens 216 so as to have a color-separation image signal. The full-color sensor 217 uses a three-line CCD having filters R (red), G (green), and B (blue) arranged adjacent to each other. The color-separation image signal is processed in an image processor 218 and then, it is fed to the printer unit 201.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In the vicinity of the manuscript stand glass 211, an operation section 307 is provided, on which switches for setting various modes about copying sequences, display, and indicators are arranged.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In the printer unit 201, a control unit 59 is composed of a controller board having a CPU, a RAM, and a ROM. The image forming apparatus totally controls the operations of a sheet feed unit, an intermediate transfer unit, a conveying unit, a fixing unit and the operation panel on the basis of control programs stored in the ROM.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The image forming section is configured as follows.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> Photosensitive drums 11a, 11b, 11c, and 11d journaled on their axes are rotated as photosensitive image carriers in an arrow direction by a drive motor (not shown).
