Some missiles such as the one known as the "Arrow", manufactured by Israel Aircraft Industries, are capable of destroying enemy ground-to-ground ballistic missiles such as the "Scud" series manufactured by former Soviet Union and upgraded by other countries, or the "Shihab" series manufactured by the Islamic republic of Iran.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">During missile theatre defense, there is a need to know the real kill picture of the threat. For example, it may well be the case that the target flying object (threat) has been damaged, but not destroyed. Note that, as a rule, the encounter between the ballistic missile and the interceptor (kill site) occurs at large ranges. Such ranges facilitate a very low resolution of the ground sensors, such as cameras and radars which are physically displaced in remote sites relative to the kill scene site, and therefore it is difficult to provide accurate kill assessment. Moreover, clouds and other atmospheric interferences may adversely affect the ability to sense the kill site.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Accordingly, due to the insufficient kill assessment, the ground sensors may erroneously indicate on successful kill, whereas the threat is only partially damaged (e.g. the warhead is still active) and continues in its flight trajectory towards the friendly territory. It may well be the case that only when the threat approaches the friendly territory it is spotted by the sensors as still harmful, due to the fact that the sensors can now observe the threat in a higher resolution.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">At this stage it would be difficult to neutralize the threat since it is as a rule close to its destination in the friendly territory and has accumulated high velocity, thus hindering the prospects of another attempt of successful kill by launching one or a salvo of interceptors from the friendly territory.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20020166442A"><text>US 2002/0166442</text></patcit> discloses a weapon system and method to obtain damage assessment data immediately after impact of a missile. The missile releases the pod a short time before impact. The pod contains a parachute, a small camera and communications equipment. When released, the pod deploys the parachute to slow its descent and to direct the camera to the proper orientation so as to capture the impact and damage resulting from the impact. Using its communications equipment, the pod relays the impact and resulting damage data back to launch control. The system and method thus provide launch control with immediate battle damage assessments without requiring a launch platform to remain in the battle arena, or without requiring a reconnaissance platform to enter the arena to obtain the damage assessment data.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">There is thus a need to have substantially real-time indication (possibly visual indication) of the kill picture of the kill site, thereby affording among others better kill<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> assessment, discrimination between real threat and decoys and other functionalities, all as required depending upon the particular application.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">A method for obtaining a sky view of a battle site according to the present invention comprises the features defined in claim 1.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A device for obtaining a sky view of a battle site according to the present invention comprises the features defined in claim 11.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Embodiments of the present invention can comprise the features defined in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Disclosed herein is a method for obtaining a sky view of a battle site, comprising,

As shown, an interceptor <b>(2),</b> e.g. ground to air missile, such as the "Arrow" is launched towards detected threat <b>(3)</b> (e.g. of the Scud series), for intercepting the latter within a kill site <b>(4).</b> Note that the term kill site is not bound to the specific boundaries of the encounter between the interceptor and the threat, but rather is may be also at the vicinity and/or the surrounding area, all as required and appropriate.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Note that the flight trajectories of the threat and the interceptor are tracked, and on the basis of the estimated flight trajectories of threat <b>(5)</b> and the interceptor <b>(6),</b> the kill site <b>(4)</b> can be predicted. The tracking of the flight trajectories and the determination of the kill site by ground station and possibly other means fitted in the interceptor (or elsewhere) is generally known <i>per se</i> and therefore will not be expounded upon herein. Note that the invention is not bound by any specific trajectory tracking and estimation techniques.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Note that the kill site is normally observed by ground/satellite and/or other remote sensors (such as video cameras), however, due to the fact that the interception is encountered at a large distance from the interceptor's launching site, the resolution of observing the kill site is low and accordingly the kill assessment may be poor. In other words, it may well be the case that on the basis of the view obtained by the ground sensors, one may conclude that the threat has been destroyed and that only harmless fragments thereof continue to fly. However, as the fragments approach the defended area and the ground sensor(s) can view them in a better resolution, it may be noticed that one (or more) of "the fragments" is, in fact, the warhead which proceeds in its flight trajectory and may hit the defended area, giving rise to dire consequences. At this stage, when the undamaged threat (by this example the surviving warhead) approaches the defended area it would be difficult to destroy it, since it moves faster and the remaining time until hitting the targeted area is short, and consequently the prospects of successful hit by another launched interceptor (or salvo of interceptors) are considerably lower.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> -->Reverting now to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention a detachable vehicle <b>(7)</b> that includes sensor <b>(8)</b> (e.g. an image acquisition device such as a video camera) is released from the interceptor (2)as the latter approaches the estimated kill site <b>(4).</b> The calculation of the timing for releasing the detachable vehicle will be discussed in greater detail below, with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs 6</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">7</figref>.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Note that the invention is not bound by any specific manner of releasing the vehicle, and the latter can be launched, dropped or any other releasing manner, all depending upon the particular embodiment. A non-limiting embodiment describing the release of the detachable vehicle will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig 6</figref>. below.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Turning now to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, there is shown a general block diagram of a detachable vehicle <b>(20),</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. As shown, the vehicle is fitted with a sensor <b>(21)</b> at the front end thereof. By this specific example, the sensor is a camera of the CCD video type covering a predefined field of view. Note that the invention is not bound by the specific use of video camera<br/>
as the sensor and accordingly other sensors such as other image acquisition devices (e.g. IR camera, radar, etc.) may be employed.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The vehicle further includes known <i>per se</i> guidance and control system <b>(22)</b> for guiding the camera to observe the estimated kill site, and Telemetry and Antenna devices <b>(23)</b> (also known <i>per se</i>), for facilitating broadcast of the acquired image to the ground station, typically although not necessarily, through satellite communication. The vehicle further includes a propulsion system, by this specific embodiment Jet control and GAS bottle <b>(24)</b> for steering the vehicle in response to steering commands received from the guidance system <b>(22),</b> all as generally known <i>per se.</i> The invention is by no means bound by a detachable vehicle of the kind described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Turning now to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, there is shown a block diagram of the various modules employed in the vehicle of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. As shown, a power source <b>(31)</b> feeds a signal processor <b>(32)</b> configured to perform among others the following operations: receiving data acquired by the camera <b>(33)</b> through optics <b>(34).</b> The latter are capable of point control of the field of view of the camera, in a generally known <i>per se</i> manner. The camera, in its turn, can be configured to desired e.g. resolution, frame rate, colors and/or other parameters, all as generally known <i>per se.</i> The so obtained images are subjected to known <i>per se</i> compression techniques (by the signal processor <b>32</b>), and are sent through emitter <b>(35)</b><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> to antenna <b>(36)</b> for broadcasting to the ground station through the satellite(s), as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. Note that the various modules <b>33, 34, 32</b> and the digital video <b>37</b> are used to generate succession of video images, in a known <i>per se</i> manner. The invention is not bound by this approach.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Note that the overall sky view of the battle site (including the kill zone) can be constructed in the vehicle (using processor <b>32</b>) or in the ground station, or partially in the vehicle and partially in the ground station, all depending upon the particular application.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Those versed in the art will readily appreciate that the invention is not bound by the specific configurations of the modules as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> and accordingly some of the modules may be modified and/or others added, all depending upon the particular application.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Turning now to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 4A-B</figref>, there is shown schematically a respective top view and side view of detachable vehicle <b>(40)</b> (of the kind depicted in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>) accommodated within the interceptor <b>(41),</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. As shown, the vehicle is fitted at the external surface <b>(42)</b> of the interceptor.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">By one embodiment, two or more vehicles are fitted within the interceptor. A no-limiting use of two or more vehicles would be to release the first one to observe the estimated kill site between the interceptor and the threat (in the manner specified herein). The other vehicle would be released to view a different event in the sky, say a fireball of a previous kill. More specifically, when an interceptor encounters a threat, a fireball is generated in the sky. The fireball may exist for several seconds but sometimes minutes or more before disappearing. In the case of many threats launched towards the friendly territory, many interceptors are likely to be launched in order to intercept the threats. If, for example, an interceptor hits a threat giving rise to a fireball, and in the case that there are additional flying threats in the close vicinity to the so destroyed threat, it would-be desired to avoid a situation that the next launched interceptor (targeted another threat), would pass through or in close vicinity to the fireball that was generated as a result of the previous encounter. Now, the vehicle that was released from the previous interceptor can provide a good picture of the kill site and help to asses whether a successful kill has occurred and it can also provide a good quality picture of the resulting fireball, however, since the vehicle continues in its flight trajectory, the picture of the fireball can be provided only for a short period (up<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> to few seconds) following the encounter, whereas as specified before, the fireball may remain for minutes. Now, when the next interceptor is launched and targeted against another threat, one of its' vehicles can be pointed to the location of the fireball in order to asses the fireball's current state, enabling thus the ground station to plan a flight trajectory that does not pass through or in close vicinity to the fireball, if still active. The other vehicle would be used in a standard fashion to view the estimated kill site between the interceptor and its designated threat.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The latter scenario illustrates one out of many possible variants of using one or more of the vehicles to generate a picture of an event of interest.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig 5</figref> illustrates schematically the components that are employed for releasing the detachable vehicle, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The vehicle <b>(51)</b> is accommodated within a sabot <b>(52)</b> that is coupled to a charge <b>(53)</b> and igniter <b>(54).</b> The vehicle, sabot charge and igniter are all fitted in a canister <b>(55).</b> Once the vehicle is released (as will be explained below) the content of the canister is ejected and it remains empty as shown in <b>(56).</b> The ejection (being a non-limiting example of releasing the vehicle) is generally known <i>per se.</i> Thus, when receiving an eject command (as will be explained in greater detail below), the igniter <b>(51)</b> ignites the charge <b>(53)</b> which activates the sabot <b>(52)</b> giving rise to ejection of the vehicle in the direction pointed by arrow <b>(55)</b> (opposite the flight direction of the interceptor). Note, however, that whilst by this embodiment the vehicle is ejected in a direction opposite to the flight direction of interceptor <b>(2),</b> the cumulative vector velocity of the vehicle is nevertheless in the flight direction of the interceptor (and approaching the kill site), due to the velocity conferred to the vehicle when it was hosted by the interceptor, prior to the release.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Turning now to <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref>, there is shown a typical interception scenario, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Thus, the estimated interceptor's trajectory <b>(61)</b> is shown (the calculation thereof can be performed in either or both the on-board interceptor's processor and the ground processor, based e.g. on the position, velocity, and acceleration data). Also shown is the estimated threat trajectory <b>(62)</b> calculated by the remote stations, based on the threat tracked data.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The kill site <b>(63)</b> is illustrated at the intersection of the trajectories <b>(61</b> and <b>62).</b> Note, that as is generally known <i>per se</i>, for achieving a kill the interceptor does not necessarily have to collide with the threat, and depending upon the characteristic of<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> the interceptor and the threat, a successful kill can occur even when the interceptor passes in the vicinity of the threat.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Note that according to the invention, the timing (64) of the ejection of the vehicle from the interceptor is calculated in a manner that will allow the camera to fall in the basket sphere (65). The latter is defined in a manner such that at any point in the basket (e.g. 65) the field of view of the camera embraces the kill site. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref>, the field of view (67) of the camera that extends from point (66) within sphere (65) embraces the estimated kill site (63). Note that the manner of calculating the release timing is not bound by the specific manner described above, and accordingly other variants for calculating the release timing are applicable.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Turning now to <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 7</figref>, there is shown a block diagram of the computational tasks performed by the vehicle's on board processor <b>(71) (32</b> in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>), in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Thus, based on the target's estimated trajectory data <b>(72)</b> received from the ground station, as well as the interceptor's estimated trajectory <b>(73)</b> (as received from the interceptor) as well as the basket sphere (see <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref>) definition module <b>(74),</b> the processor is capable of calculating the timing of the release of the vehicle from the interceptor <b>(76),</b> as explained in greater detail above, with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref>. Note that the relative velocity module would take into account the relative velocity between the interceptor and the detachable vehicle. The relative velocity affects the timing that the vehicle will reach the sphere and therefore need to be taken into account when calculating the release timing.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Note that the calculations of each of the parameters <i>per se</i> (estimated flight trajectories, basket sphere and consequently the release timing) is generally known and therefore is not further expounded upon herein. As mentioned above, the invention is not bound by the specific manner of calculating the release timing as described with reference to the specific example of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 7</figref>.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Turning to <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 8</figref>, it illustrates a layout of camera's placement on the detachable vehicle, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. By this example, six cameras <b>(81</b> to <b>86)</b> are placed at the periphery of the vehicle <b>(87),</b> each covering a predetermined field of view, and all covering substantially 360 degrees. Using this layout can simplify the architecture of the vehicle (and thereby reduce costs) by obviating the use of guidance and steering means. The reason is simply that at any stage the kill site is observed by one or more of the cameras even if the vehicle is tumbling. Note that by this embodiment there is a need to construct the kill site<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> view from the distinct image obtained by the various cameras, and this can be achieved e.g. by the on-board processor of the vehicle, by the ground station or by task(s) assigned to both of them. Those versed in the art will readily appreciate that the invention is not bound by the specific configuration described with reference of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 8</figref>. Thus, by way of example, it is not bound by the number of cameras, their placement scheme (shown by this specific example at the vehicle's periphery) as well as the manner of constructing the picture of the kill site.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The so constructed kill site picture, in accordance with various embodiments of the invention, constitutes an advantage over the prior art solutions in that the high resolution picture facilitates substantially a real-time kill assessment. Thus, for instance, due to the so obtained high resolution picture it can be readily determined whether the threat's warhead has been destroyed, and if not, another interceptor or salvo of interceptors can be launched, leaving the newly launched interceptor ample time to have a second attempt to destroy the surviving threat's warhead.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Note also that the high quality kill scene would allow the ground station to identify decoys and if a decoy is encountered it may be necessary to readily launch another interceptor in order to kill the real threat.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Note that the use of detachable vehicle or vehicles in accordance with the invention is not bound to specific events in the sky and the operational scenarios described herein are provided by way of non-limiting examples only.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The present invention has been described with a certain degree of particularity, but those versed in the art will readily appreciate that various alterations and modifications may be carried out, without departing from the scope of the following Claims:</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56987036" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Ein Verfahren zum Erhalten einer Obenansicht eines Orts eines Kampfs, das umfasst:
