A saw blade is caused to reciprocate such that a work-piece is cut by the blade's action. Debris from the work-piece is thrown by the cutting blade onto work-piece. This debris can obscure to some extent the intended line of cut. As a result, an operator of the jigsaw has to blow or brush the debris off the work-piece before they can proceed with cutting the work-piece along the cut-line.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">This problem has been partially addressed by providing a flow of air to the area of the work-piece close to where the saw blade engages the work-piece.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="DE10338602"><text>DE 10338602</text></patcit> describes a jigsaw having airflow paths arranged such that a portion of air drawn into the body of the jigsaw by a fan on a drive motor is expelled from a nozzle disposed immediately behind the saw blade.

A suction tube is provided, which can be attached to a vacuum cleaner, on an opposite side of the blade to the bridge member.

The jigsaw comprises a body 12, having a handle portion 14, a motor housing portion 16 and a gearbox portion 18. A base plate 20 is coupled to the housing by a bridge component 21 and comprises an underside surface 22 which is arranged to engage with a top surface of a work-piece during use. A reciprocating shaft 24 extends from the gearbox portion of the housing and comprises a blade clamp 26 at one end of the shaft. A saw blade 28 is disposed in the blade clamp such that the blade extends through an aperture 30 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>) in the base plate. During use, the blade is in engagement with the work-piece, as is understood by the skilled person.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A motor is housed in the motor housing portion 16 of the body 12. The motor is coupled to a gearbox disposed in the gearbox portion 18 of the body12. Electrical power is supplied to the motor via a cord 31. Of course, electrical powered could also be supplied by batteries. A manually operable switch 32 is provided to allow an operator to interrupt electrical power to the motor. Power is supplied to the motor by depressing the switch into handle portion 14. When activated by the switch, rotorary motion of the motor is converted to linear reciprocating motion by the gearbox. The reciprocating shaft, and hence the blade coupled thereto, therefore move in a linear manner and perpendicular to the plain defined by the base plate.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">A fan is coupled to the motor and disposed between the motor and gearbox such that operation of the motor causes the fan to rotate. Rotation of the fan causes air to be drawn into the motor housing portion of the body<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> through louvered slots 34. Having entered the body of the jigsaw, the air passes over the motor to cool components of the motor during use. The air then enters a volume surrounding the fan. Rotation of the fan causes the air to in the volume to exit the volume via an exit conduit 40.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>, the jigsaw is shown disposed on a work-piece WP. The broken line 42 indicates the intended line along which the jigsaw is cutting, and arrow A indicates the cut direction. The work-piece is cut by the jigsaw in this manner.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The exit conduit 40 is disposed on a side face 43 of the jigsaw body. The conduit extends from the fan volume inside the body to a point where the conduit then forms an enclosed channel on the outer surface of the body. An outlet 44 of the conduit is formed such that an air stream exiting the conduit is directed towards a portion of the work-piece close to the point where the saw blade passes through the top surface of the work-piece. Preferably, the outlet is disposed close to the point where the body is coupled to the base plate 20. Thus, the direction of the air flow in the air stream is off-axis with respect to the line of cut 42. In other words, the air stream is angled with respect to the cut line 42 (the word "angled" being taken to mean that the air stream, or at least a component of the air stream in the plain of the work-piece, is neither parallel with or perpendicular to the cut line).</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Debris is thrown onto the top surface of the work-piece as the saw blade cuts through the work-piece. The air stream exiting the outlet 44 blows the debris away from area of work-piece being cut. Furthermore, because the air stream is angled with respect to the cut line 42, the debris is blown away from the cut line thereby keeping the cut line visible to the operator during use. Yet further, the air stream intercepting the debris is not interrupted by components of the jigsaw mechanism, such as a bell crank 46 used to impart pendulum motion on the saw blade during use. In other words, there is a clear line of sight between the outlet and the point on the work-piece<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> where debris is ejected by the action of the saw blade.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 3</figref>, a portion of the jigsaw embodying the present invention is shown in more detail. The outlet 44 comprises a nozzle member 48. The nozzle is arranged to direct the air stream passing through the outlet towards the area 50 of the work-piece WP where debris is ejected and may land or settle on the work-piece. This area 50 is within a 5-10 millimetres radius of the point where the cutting edge of the saw blade 28 engages with the work-piece. It can be seen that the air stream exiting the outlet and being directed by the nozzle is uninterrupted by components of the jigsaw on its path towards the work-piece area 50. It might be that the blade clamp 26 partially enters the air stream, but because of the clamps reciprocating motion, the air stream is only blocked or partially blocked for short periods of time.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As a result of the foregoing, it is possible to provide a simple and more compact arrangement for a jigsaw. The designer is no longer concerned with having to implement relatively complex arrangements of conduits or pipes from the motor fan to direct air to the work-piece. Furthermore, the bell crank and other jigsaw components can be located in positions which are more optimal to their operation without the need to compromise because of the need to provide sufficient airflow to the work-piece for the removal of debris therefrom. Yet further, angling the air flow with respect to the cut line 42 removes the debris from the cut line thereby improving the visibility of the cut line during use.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The jigsaw can be arranged such that all the air moved by the rotation of the fan passes through the outlet. In other words, the outlet is the only means by which air from the fan is able to be exhausted from the jigsaw's body.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The skilled person will envisage modifications to the embodiment of the present invention described above. For instance, the angle at which the air stream exits the outlet with respect to the cut line could be arranged to be<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> within 10° to 80° of the cut line in horizontal plane.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56987063" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Elektrisch angetriebenes, manuell betätigtes Werkzeug (10), das Folgendes umfasst:
