Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Recently, an air cleaner, in which an ion generator is incorporated, has been developed. In addition to an intrinsic function thereof to clean room air, such an air cleaner discharges cations and anions generated from the ion generator into the room air in accordance with a blowing operation to increase the concentration of ions in the room air, thereby meeting diverse requirements for user's health.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004138268A"><text>JP 2004-138268</text></patcit> refers to emitting electrons in a straight line from a needle electrode generated by corona discharge, and distantly delivering a generated ionic wind.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP1625890A2"><text>EP 1 625 890 A2</text></patcit> discloses an ion generating element and an ion generating apparatus that, by releasing positive and negative ions into a space, can decompose bacteria, mold spores, toxic substances, and the like floating in the air.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, a conventional ion generator, which may be incorporated in the above-mentioned air cleaner, is illustrated. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the ion generator includes a needle-shaped electrode 1, a ground terminal GND connected to a ground potential, and an AC power source 2 coupled between the needle-shaped electrode 1 and the ground terminal GND, wherein the AC power source applies to the needle-shaped electrode 1 an AC voltage having a sine waveform repeating an alternate polarity change at intervals of a certain time. When a positive sine waveform outputted from the AC power source 2 is applied to the needle-shaped electrode 1, charges are moved to air molecules in the air, thereby causing the air molecules to be ionized. As a result, cations are generated. Similarly, anions are<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> generated when a negative sine waveform from the AC power source 2 is applied to the needle-shaped electrode 1.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, such a conventional ion generator has a problem in that it is impossible to selectively generate cations or anions alone because an AC voltage having a continuous waveform which is alternately and periodically changed between positive (+) and negative (-) polarities is applied to the needle-shaped electrode 1. In other words, since cations alone have an effect capable of killing floating bacteria, and anions alone have an effect capable of providing comfortableness to the user, the conventional ion generator, which must generate both the cations and anions, may be inefficient.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In order to increase the amounts of cations and anions generated in the conventional ion generator, the AC voltage, which is applied to the needle-shaped electrode 1, must have a higher level. In this case, however, the peak-peak level of the AC voltage is excessively high, so that a separate insulation process is required. For this reason, there is a limitation on an increase in the amounts of generated cations and anions.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><p id="p0008" num="0008">The invention is defined according to independent claim 1.

The exemplary embodiments are described below to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, an ion generating apparatus according to a first illustrative example is illustrated. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the ion generating apparatus includes a power supply 20 to supply an AC voltage, a cation generator 30, an anion generator 40, switching units 50 and 60, and an ion generation controller 70.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The cation generator 30 generates cations, using the AC voltage supplied from the power supply 20, and includes a high-voltage transformer 31 to boost the AC voltage supplied from the power supply 20, a rectifying circuit 32 to rectify the boosted AC voltage<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> outputted from the high-voltage transformer 31 into a positive (+) DC voltage, and a cation generating element 11 to receive the positive (+) DC voltage from the rectifying circuit 32, and thus, to generate cations.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The anion generator 40 generates anions, using the AC voltage supplied from the power supply 20, and includes a high-voltage transformer 41 to boost the AC voltage supplied from the power supply 20, a rectifying circuit 42 to rectify the boosted AC voltage outputted from the high-voltage transformer 41 into a negative (-) DC voltage, and an anion generating element 12 to receive the negative (-) DC voltage from the rectifying circuit 42, and thus, to generate anions.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Each of the switching units 50 and 60 switches on/off the voltage supplied from the power supply 20 to an associated one of the cation generator 30 and anion generator 40.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The ion generation controller 70 selectively drives the switching unit 50 or switching unit 60 in accordance with an associated requirement, to selectively drive the cation generator 30 or anion generator 40. When it is required only to kill floating bacteria, this requirement may be satisfied by generating only cations (and ozone). On the other hand, where it is desired only to provide comfortableness to the user, this desire may be satisfied by only generating anions. Also, when it is required to eliminate factors which accelerate aging and factors harmful to the human body, this requirement may be satisfied by generating anions, together with cations (and ozone), to produce active hydrogen in accordance with coupling of the cations and anions. Thus, the user can control the ion generating apparatus to operate in a mode meeting the demands of the user.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Hereinafter, the structure of the cation generating element 11 included in the cation generator 30 and the structure of the anion generating element 12 included in the anion generator 40 will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0004">4a</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0005">4b</figref>. Both the cation generating element 11 and anion generating element 12 are mounted on an upper surface of a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> housing 10. A cover 13 is slidably engaged with longitudinal guide grooves 16 formed at the upper surface of the housing 10 so that the cover 13 is separably coupled to the housing 10. The cover 13 defines a diffusion range of ions generated from the cation generating element 11 and anion generating element 12 within a predetermined space.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The cation generating element 11 comprises a ceramic plate. The ceramic plate 11 is received in a recess formed on the upper surface of the housing 10 at one side of the housing 10, and then molded to be fixedly mounted to the upper surface of the housing 10. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4a</figref>, a discharge electrode 14 is provided at an upper surface of the ceramic plate 11 inside the ceramic plate 11. An induction electrode 15 is also provided at a middle portion of the ceramic plate 11 inside the ceramic plate 11 when viewed in a thickness direction of the ceramic plate 11. The portion of the ceramic plate 11 other than the discharge electrode 14 and induction electrode 15 is made of ceramic to form a protective layer.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A high positive (+) voltage is applied between the discharge electrode 14 and the induction electrode 15. The high positive voltage is preferably 3.9 kV to 4.3 kV, even though it may have other voltage ranges. When such a high positive voltage is applied between the discharge electrode 14 and the induction electrode 15, plasma discharge occurs at the ceramic plate 11, so that moisture (H<sub>2</sub>O) existing in the air around the ceramic plate 11 is ionized, thereby generating cations, that is, hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>).</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Meanwhile, the anion generating element 12 comprises a needle-shaped electrode. The needle-shaped electrode 12 is vertically protruded from the upper surface of the housing 10 at a position spaced apart from the ceramic plate 11 by a predetermined distance. It is desirable to appropriately determine the spacing between the ceramic plate 11 and the needle-spaced electrode 12, based on the size of the ceramic plate 11 and the height of the needle-shaped electrode 12, because the amount of hydrogen atoms formed from the hydrogen ions<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> generated from the ceramic plate 11 varies depending on the spacing between the ceramic plate 11 and the needle-shaped electrode 12.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A high negative (-) voltage is applied between the needle-shaped electrode 12 and a ground electrode 17. The high negative voltage is preferably -3.2 kV to -3.6 kV, even through it may have other voltage ranges. When such a high negative voltage is applied between the needle-shaped electrode 12 and the ground electrode 17, plasma discharge occurs at the needle-shaped electrode 12, so that a large amount of electrons are discharged from the needle-shaped electrode 12 into the air. The electrons discharged into the air are very unstable, so that they are coupled with oxygen molecules (O<sub>2</sub>) in the air, thereby forming super-oxide anions (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Heretofore, the configuration to generate cations and/or anions in accordance with the first illustrative example has been described.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Now, a configuration to control the amount of generated ions by increasing the power level of the driving voltage in accordance with a second illustrative example will be described.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 5</figref>, an ion generating apparatus according to the second illustrative example is illustrated.

The high-voltage transformer 31 has a primary coil, and a secondary coil to boost a voltage applied to the primary coil while maintaining the polarity of the applied voltage.

The high-voltage transformer 41 has a primary coil, and a secondary coil to boost a voltage applied to the primary coil while changing the polarity of the applied voltage to an opposite polarity.

In accordance with the selective driving of the cation generator 30 or anion generator 40 under the control of the ion generation controller 70', cations (and ozone) or anions are selectively generated.

In accordance with this control operation, the ion generation controller 70' varies the AC voltage supplied to each of the high-voltage transformers 31 and 41, to control the boosting voltage level of the associated high-voltage transformer 31 or 41, and thus, to control the amount of ions generated from the associated ion generating element 11 or 12.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Hereinafter, an air cleaning apparatus, in which the above-described ion generating apparatus according to an illustrative example is incorporated, will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 6</figref>.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 6</figref>, the air cleaning apparatus includes a body 110, in which the ion generating apparatus according an illustrative example is installed, an inlet 112 formed at a front wall of the body 110, and an outlet 111 formed at a top wall of the body 110.

When the ion generating apparatus operates to generate cations alone, anions alone, or both the cations and anions in accordance with a user's selection, the cations or anions generated from the ion generating apparatus or active hydrogen, which is produced in accordance with coupling of cations and anions occurring when both the cations and anions are generated from the ion generating apparatus, is discharged into the room space, together with the cleaned air.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">As apparent from the above description, in accordance with the present invention, it is possible to selectively control generation of cations and anions to meet the demands of the user while maximizing the amount of the generated ions. Accordingly, it is possible to actively kill floating bacteria, to provide comfortableness to the user, and to eliminate factors which accelerate aging and factors harmful to the human body.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56987051" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Luftreinigungsvorrichtung, umfassend:
