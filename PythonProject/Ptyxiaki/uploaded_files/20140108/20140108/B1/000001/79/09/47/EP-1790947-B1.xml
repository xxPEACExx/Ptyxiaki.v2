Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a navigation device that is mounted on an automobile or the like and is capable of managing path information including a destination and locations on a path. In particular, the present invention relates to a navigation device that is used for cooperating with a portable terminal such as a cellular phone or a PDA.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally, a navigation device is used for showing paths or roads to a user who is a car driver. When the user of the navigation device for a car designates one or more destinations (hereinafter, "destination" includes a location on a path since they have a similar meaning,) for setting path information, the user is usually required specific knowledge about the destination such as an address or a telephone number. If the user who is driving a car knows the destination well, it is not so difficult to do such setting in the car. However, there are many cases where the user has to set a location as a destination that is not familiar to the user because of the nature of the navigation device for a car. Therefore, in many cases, the user has to prepare information about a destination and take a memo of the information into a car. This is burdensome.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For this reason, it is proposed to utilize cooperation between a portable terminal such as a cellular<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> phone or a PDA and the navigation device for a car so that schedule information or address information registered in a schedule (a schedule book) or an address list (an address book) of the portable terminal can be used for setting a destination or searching an optimal path by the navigation device for a car (see Japanese unexamined patent publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2002107174A"><text>2002-107174</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">According to the above-mentioned patent publication, the navigation device for a car can specify a destination position for setting the destination or the location on a path by using information that indicates a destination name such as a person's name or a location name listed in the schedule information of the portable terminal and information for specifying the destination position such as a location, a postcode (ZIP code), an address or a telephone number listed in the address book of the portable terminal, for example.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, in order to set the destination or the like correctly by the above-mentioned method, the destination must be specified as a single one by the destination name such as a person's name or a location name. If there is a plurality of names that are the same in the address book, a plurality pieces of information that specifies the destination position may be obtained. In this case, the destination cannot be fixed. As a result, a desired result cannot be obtained, and the navigation device for a car cannot work properly. Furthermore, if the address book does not include information for specifying the destination position, a desired result cannot be obtained and the navigation device cannot work properly, either.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In addition, the conventional device such as the device described in the above-mentioned patent publication uses information of the portable terminal for setting a destination that is limited to an address list and a schedule book. Therefore, even if the portable terminal is provided with an additional service that is capable of setting a destination by cooperating with the navigation device for a car besides them, it is difficult to use the service.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO0217141A"><text>WO 02/17141</text></patcit> discloses a system and method which combine a mobile information device, a server computer and a task manager to provide the mobile information device user information corresponding to the user's current location over the internet.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO03063521A"><text>WO 03/063521</text></patcit> discloses a method and framework for providing route information comprising outputting a set of route schematics which together provide an ordered sequence of directions from a first location to a second location.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a navigation device that is capable of determining each destination included in a path and managing path information even if there is a plurality pieces of information for specifying a destination position.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The invention is defined in the independent claims, to which reference should now be made. Advantageous embodiments are set out in the sub claims.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A device according to an embodiment of the present invention is a navigation device that is capable of managing path information.

The navigation device 3 shows a path to a user in accordance with a set path. Such a navigation function itself is known well conventionally as a navigation system for a car.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The portable terminal 4 is a terminal device having a data processing function and a communication function such as a cellular phone, a PDA, a notebook computer or a smart phone. Here, a case where the portable terminal 4 is a cellular phone will be explained mainly.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The navigation device 3 and the portable terminal 4 can perform their functions independently of each other. However, it is possible that they communicate with each other so that more advanced function can be provided to the user. This will be explained in more detail below.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the navigation device 3 includes a cooperation terminal connection detection portion 11, a data transmission-reception portion 12, an available portable terminal service detection portion 13, a portable terminal active service detection portion 14, a cooperation managing portion 15, a destination specifying portion 16, a path managing portion 17, an interaction portion 18 and a service portion 19.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The cooperation terminal connection detection portion 11 detects whether or not the navigation device 3 is connected to the portable terminal 4. The navigation device 3 can be connected to the portable terminal 4 via a wireless communication such as Bluetooth, an infrared data communication or a wireless LAN, or a cable communication using a cable connection.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The data transmission-reception portion 12 performs<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> data communication with the portable terminal 4 after the communication is established. If Bluetooth is used for the communication, a standard protocol such as a synchronization profile or a generic object exchange profile is used so as to send and receive various data including an address list and a schedule list. In this way, transmission and reception of data can be performed without depending on a type or a manufacturer of the device on the other end of communication.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The available portable terminal service detection portion 13 detects a service that can be used by the navigation device 3 among services that are equipped with the portable terminal 4.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The portable terminal active service detection portion 14 detects a service that is currently performed on the portable terminal 4. This service is selected and started by the user at the portable terminal 4, and it is managed by the portable terminal 4. When the portable terminal 4 is performing a navigation operation, for example, the portable terminal active service detection portion 14 detects that the portable terminal 4 is under servicing the navigation operation. Thus, the navigation operation by the portable terminal 4 can be transferred to the navigation device 3 to be executed continuously. If the user is listening to music by the portable terminal 4, the portable terminal active service detection portion 14 detects it so that the reproduction operation of the music is transferred to the navigation device 3 to be reproduced continuously. If the user is talking on the portable terminal 4, the portable terminal active service detection<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> portion 14 detects it so that the telephone communication can be transferred to the handsfree device to be performed continuously. Thus, the services can be performed continuously without interruption by the cooperation between the navigation device 3 and the portable terminal 4 when the user walks from his or her home to a car in a parking lot, gets on the car, and walks to a customer after reaching a vicinity of a destination.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The cooperation managing portion 15 cooperates with the service of the portable terminal 4 detected by the available portable terminal service detection portion 13 and performs a process corresponding to the detected service on the navigation device 3 side.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">More specifically, the cooperation managing portion 15 includes an address list cooperation portion 21, a schedule cooperation portion 22 and a navigation cooperation portion 23. The address list cooperation portion 21 receives data of an address list 101 from the portable terminal 4 and manages the same so as to perform a process corresponding to the address list 101. Thus, the navigation device 3 can deal with the same address list 101 that is stored in the portable terminal 4 by function of the address list cooperation portion 21. Similarly, the schedule cooperation portion 22 and the navigation cooperation portion 23 also receive data about a schedule 102 and the navigation 104 from the portable terminal 4 and manage the same so as to perform processes corresponding to the schedule 102 and the navigation 104, respectively.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The destination specifying portion 16 selects and<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> specifies one of a plurality of candidates for setting a destination or a location on a path.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">More specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the destination specifying portion 16 includes a candidate location specifying information recording portion 41, a position specifying information obtaining portion 42, a selecting portion 43, a priority table 44, a priority rule 45 and a profile 46.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The candidate location specifying information recording portion 41 searches and extracts information for specifying a location that corresponds to one schedule item in a schedule list indicated in the schedule 102 such as a personal name, a company name, a section name, a place name, a station name, a postcode (ZIP code), a telephone number or a fax number from the address list 101, and records the extracted one or more pieces of information as candidate location specifying information KTJ. The position specifying information obtaining portion 42 obtains information for specifying a position on a map corresponding to each piece of candidate location specifying information KTJ as position specifying information TTJ.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The selecting portion 43 selects one piece of candidate location specifying information KTJ or position specifying information TTJ from one or more pieces of candidate location specifying information KTJ or position specifying information TTJ. When the selection is performed, the priority table 44, the priority rule 45, the profile 46 or the like is referred to. The priority table 44 records priorities of a plurality of candidate<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> locations indicated by the candidate location specifying information KTJ.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The priority rule 45 records a rule for narrowing candidate locations by determining priorities of a plurality of candidate locations. If the priorities are determined depending on types of a destination, for example, the rule may be adopted that describes "if the obtained candidate locations are a store and a home, the store is given higher priority." Such a rule can be stored as a knowledge database or can be learned while the device is used.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The profile 46 records an address, a work place, a responsible region or the like of the driver (user).</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Thus, if the candidate location specifying information recording portion 41 extracts a plurality of candidate locations, the selecting portion 43 selects one candidate location in various methods. Examples of the methods are as follows.
<ol><li>(1) The profile 46 is used for selecting one candidate location.</li><li>(2) A current place of the car or an estimated time of arrival is used for selecting one candidate location.</li><li>(3) Other methods may be used for selecting one candidate location.<br/>
More specific examples are as follows.</li><li>(4) A location that has the shortest distance from the current position is selected from a plurality of candidate locations.</li><li>(5) A location that has the shortset distance from a user' home is selected.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></li><li>(6) A location that has the earliest estimated time of arrival from the current position is selected.</li><li>(7) A location is selected in accordance with priorities. The priorities are preset in the priority table 44, for example. Alternatively, priorities that are set in the address list 101 of the portable terminal 4 are used.</li><li>(8) A location is selected in accordance with the priority rule 45.</li><li>(9) A location is selected in accordance with past history data. For example, a location that was visited the latest is selected with the highest priority. Alternatively, a location that is most frequently visited destination is selected with the highest priority. Such history data or frequency data may be recorded and stored in a destination setting portion 20.</li></ol></p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The path managing portion 17 manages path information. The path information includes one or more destinations, and at least positions of the destinations, an order of passing of the positions and staying period at the positions are recorded.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The path managing portion 17 includes the destination setting portion 20. The destination setting portion 20 sets a destination and locations on a path automatically in the navigation device 3. The address list cooperation portion 21, the schedule cooperation portion 22, the navigation cooperation portion 23 or the like may be used for the setting.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In addition, the path managing portion 17 includes a user setting portion 24 for the user to set a destination<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> manually. The user setting portion 24 modifies position information on a map that is displayed by the display portion 31, for example, in accordance with the position specifying information TTJ that complies with a setting input by the user. On this occasion, it is possible to show the candidate locations extracted by the candidate location specifying information recording portion 41 to the user so that the user can select one of them. In addition, it is possible to guide the user to input information for specifying a destination position such as an address or a telephone number if there is no candidate location. It is possible that the user operates a pointing device to designate a position on the map directly.
