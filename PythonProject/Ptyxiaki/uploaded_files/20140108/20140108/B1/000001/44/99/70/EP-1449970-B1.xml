Such dispensers typically comprise a reservoir in the form of an inverted bottle, which supplies the liquid to a wicking device, such as a porous pad.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">One known device of this type is described in published European patent application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP0785315A"><text>EP-A-0 785 315</text></patcit>. This application acknowledges the problem with such devices that as the liquid level in the bottle falls the rate at which liquid is dispensed falls with time and thereby renders the dispenser less effective.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The solution to this problem suggested by the above reference is to provide a structure between the mouth of the bottle and the wicking device so as to permit both the flow of the liquid from the bottle to the wicking device and also a return flow of air from outside the dispenser to the bottle.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, the proposed structure is complex and therefore expensive to manufacture. Furthermore, a given dispenser of the type described in this reference can function only with a lavatory system having a predefined relative position of the rim of the lavatory bowl and the stream of flushing water.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A further problem with prior-art liquid dispensers of this type is that, when the consumer causes the bottle to be opened, e.g. by inserting the inverted bottle in a dispensing unit, some of the liquid spurts out as a result of the liquid in the bottle being slightly above atmospheric pressure, possibly because the act of sealing the mouth of the bottle in the factory pressurises the liquid to some extent.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It would therefore be desirable to provide liquid dispensers and methods of filling bottles for such dispensers which overcome, or at least mitigate, one or more of the above disadvantages of the prior-art dispenser.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In accordance with the present invention there is provided a dispensing unit for dispensing a liquid from the rim of a lavatory bowl, the unit comprising the features of claim 1.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The wicking device is preferably provided with at least one venting aperture, which when the device is adjustable, are positioned such that there is at least one functioning venting hole for every possible functional position of the adjustable wicking device.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A spillage tray is advantageously positioned in use below the wicking device having formed therein a vent channel arranged in communication with the at least one functioning venting aperture.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The or each venting aperture may be in the form of a substantially circular hole or an elongate slit.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The unit is preferably so structured as to permit the position of the wicking device to be adjusted between different positions so as to function with lavatory bowls with different shapes and different flushing systems.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The dispensing unit preferably further comprises a conduit for conveying liquid from the reservoir to the wicking device. The conduit may comprise a cylindrical inlet portion of substantially circular cross-section for engaging the circular mouth of a bottle constituting the reservoir and preferably terminates obliquely so as to define a substantially elliptical aperture. The conduit may further comprise a substantially cylindrical outlet portion, e.g. of a D-shaped, circular or substantially rectangular cross-section, having a cross-sectional area substantially less than that of the inlet portion, and the inlet portion of the conduit may be laterally displaced from the outlet portion. Such an arrangement is geometrically particularly advantageous when an adjustable wicking device is provided. When the outlet portion has a D-shaped cross-section, the bar of the "D" can be arranged to coincide with a diameter of the substantially circular inlet portion of the conduit when viewed vertically. The outlet portion of the conduit bears against the wicking device so as to create a substantially liquid-tight seal therebetween.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The outlet portion is preferably at least partially surrounded by a barrier wall, which may be cylindrical and of rectangular cross-section. This serves to prevent ingress of flushing water into the reservoir.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The wicking device preferably comprises a first portion for receiving liquid from the reservoir and a second portion arranged to be positioned in use in a dispensing position. The second portion may be arranged to be positioned in use within the stream of<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> flushing water, in which case the second portion is preferably arranged to be positioned in use between the first portion and the rim of the lavatory bowl.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The dispensing unit is preferably structured such that the position of the wicking device can be adjusted by sliding the first portion thereof against the outlet portion of the conduit.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The wicking device is substantially laminar and may be formed with a depression for receiving the neck of a bottle constituting a said reservoir. The wicking device is formed with one or more elongate apertures and the housing comprises a corresponding one or more projections for engaging the elongate apertures so as to define the outermost possible operative position of the wicking device. In this case, the or each projection may comprises a spring finger which is arranged to engage its corresponding aperture in the wicking device when the wicking device is inserted into the housing.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The wicking device may comprise a projection for insertion in the mouth of a said reservoir in use, the projection having formed therethrough a vent channel.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The wicking device comprises a porous pad but may alternatively comprise a plate with channels or circular holes formed therein. The channels may be formed as elongate apertures or elongate channels within the plate and may be arranged in a splayed configuration thereby to convey the liquid from the reservoir in divergent paths.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The invention extends according to the appended claims to the combination of such a dispensing unit and means for suspending the unit from the rim of a lavatory bowl.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The invention extends according to the appended claims to the combination of such a dispensing unit, which is provided with a conduit having an inlet portion of substantially circular cross-section, and a bottle constituting the reservoir, the bottle comprising an opening for dispensing the liquid therefrom, the opening having a substantially circular cross-section greater than that of the inlet portion of the conduit, the opening and the inlet portion of the conduit<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> frangible seal to be so broken and retaining means for retaining the frangible seal in a position which does not block the mouth of the bottle.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The seal is preferably substantially rigid and arranged to be pivoted between open and closed positions about one side thereof, the angle through which the seal is moved between said open and closed positions being substantially 90 degrees. The opening means may comprise a projection arranged to bear on the side of the closure member generally opposite to this one side. The retaining means may comprise a further projection arranged to bear on a face of the closure member when in its open position.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The seal is preferably substantially circular, and the opening means and the retaining means may be disposed at diametrically opposed positions in relation to the seal. The opening means and the retaining means may be formed on a substantially circular obliquely truncated cylinder which is arranged to be inserted into the mouth of the reservoir to cause the seal to move into its open position. The opening means may comprise the end portion of the obliquely truncated cylinder. The retaining means may comprise a projection from the cylinder, such as a stud.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The invention extends according to the appended claim 45 to the combination of such a dispensing unit and bottle and means for suspending the unit and the bottle from the rim of a lavatory bowl.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In accordance with the present invention there is provided a dispensing unit for dispensing a liquid from the rim of a lavatory bowl, in combination with a reservoir bottle, the unit comprising a wicking device for conveying liquid to be dispensed from the reservoir bottle to a position within the stream of flushing water, wherein the reservoir bottle is provided with venting means for permitting ambient air to enter the bottle to displace liquid dispensed therefrom.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The venting means may comprise a one-way valve, such as a duck-bill valve.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Alternatively, the venting means may comprise a removable plug, and said unit may comprise a co-operating projection which is positioned so as to remove the plug when the reservoir bottle is placed by a user in its operative position in relation to the unit, thereby to create a venting aperture in the reservoir bottle.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In a further arrangement, the venting means may comprise a removable seal, and said unit may comprise a co-operating hollow projection which is positioned so as to remove the seal and project into the reservoir bottle when the reservoir bottle is placed by a user in its operative position in relation to the unit, the hollow projection constituting a venting channel.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In a yet further arrangement, the venting means may comprise an air vent in the reservoir bottle which is sealed by a cover portion which either can be removed by a user prior to use or is automatically removed by a projection arranged on the unit so as to remove the cover portion when the reservoir bottle is placed by a user in its operative position in relation to the unit.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The invention further extends according to the appended claims to a liquid-dispensing device comprising a liquid reservoir having a mouth and a closure member arranged, when in its closed position, to seal the mouth and which can be moved into an open position, in which liquid can be dispensed from the reservoir, the device further comprising opening means for causing the closure member to be so moved into said open position and means for retaining said closure member in its open position.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Such an arrangement enables liquid to be dispensed from the reservoir, once opened, while preventing the closure from returning to its closed position, e.g. by the weight of the liquid remaining in the reservoir in the case of an inverted reservoir.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The closure member is preferably substantially rigid and arranged to be pivoted between said open and closed positions about one side thereof. The angle through which the closure member is moved between said open and closed positions may be substantially 90 degrees. This reduces the force exerted by the weight of the liquid remaining in the reservoir on the closure member, in the case of an inverted reservoir.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The opening means preferably comprises a projection arranged to bear on the side of the closure member generally opposite to said one side, and the retaining means preferably comprises a further projection arranged to bear on a face of the closure member when in its open position.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The closure member may be substantially circular, and the opening means and the retaining means are then preferably disposed at diametrically opposed positions in relation to the closure member.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The opening means and the retaining means are preferably formed on a substantially circular obliquely truncated cylinder which is arranged to be inserted into the mouth of the reservoir to cause the closure member thereof to move into its open position. In this case, the opening means preferably comprises the end portion of the obliquely truncated cylinder, and the retaining means comprises a projection from the cylinder in the form of a stud.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The cylinder and the reservoir mouth are preferably so dimensioned as to form a substantially liquid-tight seal when the cylinder is inserted in the reservoir mouth.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The opening means and the retaining means conveniently form part of a housing for the reservoir, and housing may comprise means for suspending the device such that, when the opening means and the retaining means are inserted in the reservoir mouth, the reservoir is supported in an inverted position with the mouth lowermost, such that the liquid can be dispensed from the reservoir by gravity. For example, the device may be arranged to be suspended from the rim of a lavatory, and the liquid may be a cleansing and/or refreshing liquid.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The invention further extends according to the appended claims to a housing for a liquid reservoir having a mouth and a closure member arranged, when in its closed position, to seal the mouth and which can be moved into an open position, in which liquid can be dispensed from the reservoir, said housing comprising opening means for causing the closure member to be so moved into said open position and means for retaining said closure member in its open position.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

id="p0039" num="0039">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">Figures 1 to 7</figref>, a liquid dispenser 1 comprises a housing 2 and a sprung suspension hook 3 for suspending the housing 2 from the rim of a lavatory bowl (not shown). For ease of manufacture, the suspension hook 3 is formed as a separate component from the housing 2, and the housing 2 is formed with an integral guide channel 4 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>) of rectangular cross-section into which the lower end of the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> suspension hook 3 is inserted during manufacture. The lower end of the suspension hook 3 comprises a raised, chamfered portion 5, such that, upon insertion, the hook 3 remains engaged within the channel 4 by a snap-fitting arrangement.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Once the unit is thus suspended, a user inserts in the housing 2 a sealed inverted reservoir bottle 6 into the housing 2. The act of insertion causes the seal on the reservoir bottle 6 to break, in a manner to be described below. A wicking device in the form of a porous pad 7 is located in a slot within the housing 2, and this pad conveys liquid from the reservoir bottle 6 to a position within the stream of flushing water within the lavatory by capillary action.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The housing 2 includes a conduit 8 for conveying the liquid from the reservoir bottle 6 to the porous pad 7. The conduit 8 comprises an inlet portion 9 of circular cross-section which is sized so as to fit snugly within the circular mouth of the reservoir bottle 6. The inlet portion 9 terminates obliquely, as seen clearly in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0001">3</figref>, so as to form an elliptical mouth. The reservoir bottle 6 is sealed by a plastics or foil cap 6', and the act of inserting the inverted reservoir bottle 6 into the housing 2 causes the cap 6' to break, by virtue of the shape of the inlet portion 9 of the conduit 8 so as to permit liquid from the reservoir bottle 6 to fall under gravity into the conduit 8.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The inlet portion 9 is provide with a projection in the form of a stud 9' which serves to retain the cap 6' in its open position. It will be appreciated that, in the absence of such a stud, the cap 6' could be forced, but the weight of the liquid remaining in the reservoir bottle 6, to fall back into its original position, thereby preventing further liquid from being dispensed. As can be seen from <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0001">3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">4</figref>, the stud 9' extends parallel to the axis of the inlet portion 9 and adjoins the inlet portion 9 at its shortest point. The stud 9' is formed integrally with the inlet portion 9. Thus, the extreme end of the inlet portion 9 bears against one side of the cap 6' of the reservoir bottle 6, causing it to break and to pivot about an axis at the opposite side. On fully, inserting the inlet portion 9 into the reservoir bottle 6, the stud 9' is caused to bear against the outer face of the cap 6' so as to prevent it from falling back into its closed position. The stud 9' extends along the complete length of the cylindrical inlet portion 9, for ease of manufacturing, e.g. by moulding.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The conduit 8 further comprises an outlet portion 10 in the form of a cylinder which bears against the porous pad 7. The cross-sectional area of the outlet portion 10 is less than that of the inlet portion 9, and this helps to prevent, or at least minimise the amount of, flushing water entering the reservoir bottle 6.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As can be seen from <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 4(a) to 4(c)</figref>, the cylinder of the outlet portion 10 can be D-shaped, circular or rectangular in cross-section, and the outlet portion 10 is partially or totally surrounded by a cylindrical barrier wall 10' of rectangular cross-section, which further acts to prevent ingress of flushing water.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In the arrangements shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 4(a) and 4(b)</figref>, one of the two long sides of the rectangular cross-section of the barrier wall 10' coincides with a diameter of the circular cross-section of the inlet portion 8 when viewed vertically. This arrangement enables the position of the porous pad 7 to be adjusted so as to ensure that a portion is always in the stream of the flushing water for a wide range of different lavatory bowls, whilst ensuring that the outlet portion 10 of the conduit 8 is effectively closed by the porous pad 7.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In the arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4(c)</figref>, the centre of the rectangular cross-section of the outlet portion 10 coincides with the centre of the circular cross-section of the inlet portion 9 when viewed vertically.

The porous pad 7 is provided with two elongate guide slots 11 which are engaged by two corresponding spring fingers 12 in the housing 2. The guide slots 11 serve to define the two extreme positions of the range of possible positions of the porous pad 7 within the housing 2.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In order to allow air to replace liquid dispensed from the reservoir bottle 6, a series of small vent holes 13, typically 1.3 mm (50/1000 inch) in diameter, are formed in the porous pad 7 and arranged such that, in whatever position of the porous pad 7 within the range defined by the guide slots 11, there is always at least one vent hole 13 communicating air from beneath the porous pad 7 to the mouth of the reservoir bottle 6 via the conduit 8.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The housing 2 is also formed with a comb-shaped series of apertures 14 at the bottom of the front side which allow the flushing water to drain away from above the porous pad 7.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The housing 2 is additionally provided with a number of horizontal rib-like projections 15 for engaging a corresponding horizontal groove (not shown) at the top of the reservoir bottle 6 so as to retain the reservoir bottle 6 in the operative position within the housing 2 once it has been inserted by a user.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The functioning of the adjustable porous pad 7 will now be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0006">Figures 8 and 9. Figure 8</figref> illustrates the configuration of the dispensing device 1 when used with a lavatory with an open rim. With the dispensing device 1 suspended from the rim 16 of such a lavatory, it can be seen that the stream of flushing water, indicated by the thick arrow, passes through the porous pad 7 when the porous pad 7 is in the fully-inserted position. However, when used with a lavatory of the boxed-rim configuration, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 9</figref>, a longer porous pad is provided. However, it can be seen that, even if this longer porous pad 7 were to remain in its fully-inserted position, the stream of flushing water emanating from the boxed rim 17 would not contact the porous pad 7, and the device would not therefore function optimally. With such a boxed-rim configuration, a longer porous pad is provided, and this is withdrawn<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> to a fully-extended position, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 9</figref>, so as to expose a portion thereof to the stream of flushing water, indicated by the thick arrow, while ensuring that the outlet portion 10 of the conduit 8 is still closed by the inner portion of the porous pad 7. As described above, this is ensured by virtue of the guide slots 11 within the porous pad 7 abutting the spring fingers 12 within the housing 2.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The adjustability of the porous pad is of particular advantage when used either with open rim lavatories or with boxed rim lavatories, since there is a large range of geometries within each type, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 10</figref>, which illustrates examples of the various lavatory rim configurations for different countries, and thereby indicting the utility of being able to select the porous pad and also to adjust its position. More specifically, the drawing illustrates the distance between the position of the housing of the liquid dispenser and the stream of flushing water. The cross-hatched area indicates the limited range distances (up to 16 mm (0.625 inch)) for which prior-art liquid dispensers would be suitable, and the single-hatched area indicates the range of distances (up to 22 mm (0.875 inch)) for a single size of porous pad according to the preferred embodiment of the invention. With larger pad sizes, the distance of utility can be extended indefinitely, but in practice, the maximum distance required is about 48 mm (1.9 inches). The bars indicate the range of distances found in different countries, as follows: (a) Australia; (b) United Kingdom; (c) Malaysia; (d) South Africa; (e) France; (f) Italy; (g) Spain; (h) Japan; (i) Thailand; (j) Brazil, Argentina and Mexico; (k) Korea; (1) Philippines; (m) and (n) U.S.A.
