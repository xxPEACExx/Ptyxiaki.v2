mxw-id="PDES63961621" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><u>Field of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention is in the field of telecommunication encompassing all existing sorts of interaction multimedia technology, and pertains more particularly to a method and apparatus for providing communications between agent desktop applications and a call center software suite, such as an outbound call center suite, by utilizing dynamic data exchange functionality in the agent's desktop.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Background of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5655014A"><text>US 5,655,014</text></patcit> refers to a switching device independent computer-telephone integration system including a computer, an established set of telephone functions for commanding the computer, a library including a plurality of telephone switching device commands for a number of different types of switching devices, and a state machine, operable on the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> computer, for translating the switching device commands into equivalent established telephone functions for uniformly processing incoming telephone calls independent of switching device dependent commands.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the field of telephony communication there have been many improvements in technology over the years that have contributed to more efficient use of telephone communication within hosted call-center environments. Most of these improvements involve integrating the telephones and switching systems in such call centers with computer hardware and software adapted for, among other things, better routing of telephone calls, faster delivery of telephone calls and associated information, and improved service with regard to client satisfaction. Such computer-enhanced telephony is known generally in the art as computer-telephony integration (CTI). Generally speaking, CTI implementations of various design and purpose are implemented both within individual call-centers and, in some cases, at the telephone network level. For example, processors running CTI software applications may be linked to telephone switches, service control points (SCP), and network entry points within a public or private telephone network. At the call-center level, CTI-enhanced processors, data servers, transaction servers, and the like, are linked to telephone switches and, in some cases, to similar CTI hardware at the network level, often by a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> dedicated digital link. CTI processors and other hardware within a call-center are commonly referred to as customer premises equipment (CPE). It is the CTI processor and application software in such centers that provides computer enhancement to a call center.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In a CTI-enhanced call center, telephones at agent stations are connected to a central telephony switching apparatus, such as an automatic call distributor (ACD) switch or a private branch exchange (PBX). The agent stations are usually equipped with computer terminals such as personal computer/video display units (PC/VDU) so that agents manning such stations may have access to stored data as well as being linked to incoming callers by telephone equipment. Such stations may be interconnected through the PC VDU by a local area network (LAN). One or more data or transaction servers may also be connected to the LAN that interconnects agent stations. The LAN is, in turn, typically connected to the CTI processor, which is connected to the call switching apparatus of the call center.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In recent years, advances in computer technology, telephony equipment, and infrastructure have provided many opportunities for improving telephone service in publicly switched and private telephone intelligent networks. Similarly, development of a separate information and data network known as the Internet, together with advances in computer hardware and software have led to a new multimedia telephone system known in the art by several names. In this new systemology, telephone calls are simulated by multimedia computer equipment, and data, such as audio data, is transmitted over data networks as discrete data packets. In this system a broad term used to describe such computer-simulated telephony is Data Network Telephony (DNT).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The computer-simulated, or DNT systems are familiar to those who use and understand computers and data-network systems. Perhaps the best example of DNT is telephone service provided over the Internet, which will be referred to herein as Internet Protocol Network Telephony (IPNT), by far the most extensive, but still a subset of DNT.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In addition to IPNT calls, a DNT center may also share other forms of media with customers accessing the system through their computers. E-mails, video mails,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> fax, file share, file transfer, video calls, and so forth are some of the other forms of media, which may be used. This capability of handling varied media leads to the term multimedia communications center. A multimedia communications center may be a combination CTI and DNT center, or may be a DNT center capable of receiving connection-oriented switched telephony (COST) calls and converting them to a digital DNT format for management within the communication center environment. The term communication center will replace the term call center hereinafter in this specification in deference to multimedia capabilities.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Keeping contact histories, reporting statistics, creating routing rules and the like becomes more complex as newer types of media are added to communication center capability. Additional hardware implementations such as servers, processors, etc. are generally required to aid full multimedia communication and reporting. Therefore, it is desirable that interactions of all multimedia sorts be analyzed, recorded, and routed according to enterprise (business) rules in a manner that provides seamless integration between media types and application types, thereby allowing agents to respond intelligently and efficiently to customer queries and problems.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is important in a communication center environment that different types of applications are able to directly transact with each other for the purpose of efficient and seamless interoperability between customer and agent. This fact must be true in an agent desktop as well as over a network. One of the challenges facing a communication center, for example, is how to provide efficient agent scripting tools during an automated outbound call campaign. The agent involved in such a campaign must have reportable status for routing purposes; access to various communication center resources prior to and during a call connection; and knowledge of contact and call records.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A method of interprocess communication known in the art as Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is a feature of Windows® operating system (O/S) that allows two programs to share data or send commands directly to each other. DDE can be thought of as a direct conversation between two application programs. In most cases, one application is providing some form of data (such as either text or graphics) to another<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> application. The application that is the source of the data is called the "server" and the application that is receiving the data is called the "client". The process works through a shared memory and a software module termed a software wedge that enables data synchronization between a client and server application by DDE linking in real time. Generally a client application initiates a session to receive data from a server application.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In Windows®, DDE is used for data sharing and command application between word processing applications and data source applications such as with a spread sheet program and a database program. An extension to DDE known in the art as Net DDE allows two programs, each residing in separate computers, to transact over a data network.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In current art telephony applications, software developers create proprietary scripting applications for agent's desktops that interact with communication center telephony routing and communication software. These solutions are typically protocol-specific and are not easily integrated with other, and competing applications of different protocols without extensive re-engineering of software. It is desirable, however, that communication centers be able to build agent scripting applications and interaction tools using existing products wherein different command and state protocols are automatically mapped to one other, providing thereby communication in real time, and enabling seamless transaction between participating applications.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">A good example of a communication center situation where desktop functionality must interact seamlessly with center telephony software is an outbound call and connect campaign. A large outbound call campaign initiates automated calls to destinations on a target list, and upon connection, routes connected calls among a plurality of agents operating desktop applications. As a result, each desktop application must have communication with a transaction routing interface in order to receive calls an also to receive call information about the incoming calls.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Therefore, what is clearly needed is a method and apparatus for providing seamless agent scripting and interaction capability with an automated communication-center call campaign, wherein any DDE-enabled application may be used as a client application and wherein the DDE functionality is incorporated as an<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> agent-specific gateway, a multiplicity of which may simultaneously interact with a central transaction system.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Summary of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">In a preferred embodiment of the invention a dynamic data exchange (DDE) gateway for formatting and forwarding commands, request according to claim 1 and data between separate software suites operating under disparate protocols within a communication center is provided, comprising a DDE application for mapping data of disparate protocols to a common set of data topics, data items, and data commands, and a set of software controls for interface with the DDE application, the controls used to create and maintain the common set of data topics, data items, and data commands.

PSTN 125 may instead be a private telephone network or a corporate telephone network. The inventor chooses to illustrate PSTN 125 as a preferred example of a connected telephone network because of a high public access characteristic. PSTN 125 contains all of the equipment and connections to perform public switched telephony as is known in the art.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Internet network 124 represents a preferred data packet network for practicing the invention in an IPNT version, which is described further below. Network 124 may be a corporate or private wide area network WAN instead of the well-known Internet network.

Communication center 101 is dually capable, meaning that it can handle transactions from both PSTN 125 and from Internet 124. Communication network 100 represents an optimum network for customer service using a variety of IP and COST communication methods. COST is an acronym for connection-oriented, switched telephony, which is the conventional, as opposed to DNT, telephone system.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">A local telephony switch (LSW) 132 is illustrated within PSTN 132 and represents a local call switch with respect to communication center 101. Switch 132 is adapted, in this example, as a private branch exchange (PBX) telephony switch. However, switch 132 may be adapted as an automatic call distributor (ACD) or other known types of telephony switches. A CTI processor 133 is illustrated within PSTN 125 and has connection via a CTI link to switch 132. CTI processor 133 monitors<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> switch and transaction activity and provides intelligence to switch 132, wherein such intelligence may be controlled from within communication center 101.

Processor 117 within center 101 has connection to processor 133 implemented within PSTN 125 by way of a digital network 130 separate from the telephony trunk. In this way information about callers waiting at switch 132 to be routed through to switch 116 within center 101 may be forwarded to a selected agent along with or ahead of the routed call. Such data may include automated number identification (ANI), destination number identification service (DNIS), caller line ID (CLID) and other data provided by carrier services. Some caller information may be solicited by Interactive Voice Response (IVR) software (not shown) implemented within processor 133 at the PSTN level. Solicited information may include such as call reason, party requested, passwords, product codes, or any other customer input that may be deemed necessary to effectively route the call.

Such records are stored in an illustrated data repository (DR) 134 shown having a data connection to server 120. Server 120 also functions as a DDE application server (APS) enabled in the function by software of the invention. DDE applications are typically tooled for agents by an applications builder (not shown) and are served to appropriate agents at time of log-in.

These described applications are agent- specific in one embodiment, meaning that when an agent<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> logs in and receives his or her application, the records that can be retrieved thereto are pertinent to that agent's state and interaction. Thus, if more than one agent logs in to participate in an outbound campaign, each agent will retrieve his or her own call records into his or her own application. DDE applications served by server 120 are campaign-specific and may be stored and later redistributed for a repeat of a particular campaign.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">CRS 120 may be configured also to serve other communication-center related data, which may be stored in DR 134 without departing from the invention as defined by the appended claims.

In other embodiments other applications that are known and are DDE-enabled can be used. For example, Microsoft Excel™, a known DDE-enabled application, may be utilized. It is noted herein that ActiveX toolkit 204 is licensed from Genesys Telecommunications® as far as the building code or blocks used to create functionality for extending a DDE Topic set. The integration of ActiveX code with the DDE interface creates a unique DDE code set that functions to map telephony entities, commands and items to Magellan topics, commands, and items. For example, TInterface as a topic implements agent telephony function (CTI, TS, and OCS). CallRecord as a topic implements outbound protocol for preview/predictive call record chains and callback record chains. OBInterface as a topic implements outbound protocol for record-related conversations<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> to OCS.

An agent desktop application is enabled for Agent Login, Agent interaction, and Agent Logout through the same interface. In a preferred implementation the agent application interfaces on one side to the unique DDE gateway, which in turn interfaces with T-server software to implement telephony function. T-server is assumed to be compatible with the outbound telephony function and any other CTI function.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In logging in to conduct an outbound call campaign, an agent executes the following command: TagentLogin (DN, DNType, Login ID, Queue). The DDE gateway converts the command into T-server protocol and forwards the command to T-server as a request to register a client. At this point an open link is established by T-server response and the correct address information is transacted along with login information. DDE server sets agent state with T-server and the agent may begin operation.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Logout procedure is similarly handled beginning with a command sent to the DDE server from the agent desktop.

At step 301, an agent invokes a login command through his or her desktop interface. In one embodiment an application server may serve a pre-prepared agent scripting application complete with all of the attributes of an ensuing campaign. It may be assumed herein that an agent's login includes serving of an application created for an outbound call campaign as part of the login procedure. However, this should not be construed as a limitation of the present invention as login may also be executed from the point of receiving the appropriate application for the campaign.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">At step 302, the DDE server receives the agent's login command and maps the command to the appropriate T-server request for agent login. At step 303, the DDE server forwards the T-server request to the T-server, which manages all telephony function.<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> At step 304, the T-server establishes a link or connection through the DDE server, which is functioning as a proxy. Once a connection is active, the DDE server sets the prevalent agent states in step 305 and waits for further instruction. Agent states are dynamic and are reset according to most current state. States related to the level of agent availability are dynamically set by DDE server software based on agent interaction and command activation through the agents scripting application. These states are reported through T-server protocols to outbound telephony software and, in some cases to inbound routing protocols.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Step 306 is an ongoing step while the agent is logged in and actively participating in an outbound campaign. Call records pertaining to outbound connect results are logged. Call records pertaining to a callback list are also logged. This information may be automatically served to the agent during interaction or may be retrieved by request of the agent through his or her desktop application. At step 307, the agent invokes a logout command. At step 308, the DDE server receives and maps the logout request to T-server protocol equivalent.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">At step 309, the T-server receives the logout request from the DDE server and processes the command ultimately breaking the connection between the T-server and the DDE server. At step 310, the DDE server sets the agent's new state and the agent may close his or her desktop application. At this point the<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> agent is no longer working outbound telephony and may resume taking inbound calls or performing other duties.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that there will be many more subroutines associated with the basic process illustrated herein without departing from the present invention as defined by the appended claims. The interaction between the agent's desktop application and the outbound contact center through the DDE proxy follows a TCP/IP request and response protocol including appropriate error procedures and server timeout procedures. In one embodiment of the present invention, a group of agents may share a single campaign, such that when one agent is unavailable for an extended period, or must logout before his or her responsibilities of the campaign have been fulfilled, such responsibilities may be dynamically allocated through routing protocols to the other responsible agents working the campaign. Such functionality is not limited simply to call records and callback records, but may also be integrated with routing rules in dynamic inbound routing of successful outbound connections.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The method and apparatus of the present invention provides communication center administers with the capability of building dynamic applications for virtually any purpose, including but not limited to outbound calling, wherein such applications may interact with the same telephony protocols regardless of the application protocols used so long as the<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> applications are DDE enabled. Such flexibility eliminates requirements of proprietary desktop implementations for outbound automated telephony function.
