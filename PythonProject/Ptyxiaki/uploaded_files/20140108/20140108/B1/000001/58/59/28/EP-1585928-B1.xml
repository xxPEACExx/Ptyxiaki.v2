More particularly it relates to a magazine with a status indicator.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In modem firearms the magazine is used as a container for bullets, which are stored in it until use. A magazine also serves as a feeder of bullets into the firearm's muzzle.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Firearms are lethally dangerous, and many cases were inadvertent firing had caused injuries or deaths are reported. In many of these cases it appeared that the persons handling the firearms were unaware of the presence of bullets in the firearm's muzzle.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In order to address this problem in some new designs of firearms a pin was added to the body of the firearm, which protrudes when a bullet is present inside the muzzle, indicating the dangerous status of the firearm. This is indeed a good solution, but is only applicable in newly manufactured firearms, and renders the manufacture of such firearms more costly and complicated. However, this solution is not applicable in existing firearms, and not for all types and models of firearms, like rifles, machine guns, sub-machine guns etc.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4587756A"><text>US 4,587,756 (Jakubaschk et al.</text></patcit>) disclosed a magazine for small arms with indication for the loading status of the magazine, comprising a viewing opening through which the follower spring is visible, and by counting the number of coils visible, the number of bullets inside the magazine may be determined.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US4219953A"><text>US 4,219,953 (Musgrave</text></patcit>) a sonic indicator was provided in a magazine, indicating that the magazine is empty when rattling.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US4142313A"><text>US 4,142,313 (Musgrave</text></patcit>) disclosed a magazine with indicators indicating if the magazine is empty, if it contains only one bullet or if it is full.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5052139A"><text>US 5,052,139 (Marzzoco</text></patcit>) disclosed an indicator device incorporated with the barrel of a shotgun, indicating the presence of a cartridge in the cartridge chamber of the gun.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US4100691A"><text>US 4,100,691 (Wicklund</text></patcit>) an indicator is incorporated in the gun breech bolt indicating the presence of a bullet inside.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US5291679A"><text>US 5,291,679 (Wollack et al.</text></patcit>) there was disclosed a magazine with an elongated indicator member attached to the follower and projecting outside the body of the magazine so that the length of the indicator member indicates how many bullets remain in the aperture. The indicator member is provided with a series of knots at predetermined intervals so that the number of knots on the portion of the indicator member projecting outside the body of the magazine equals the number of bullets remaining in the magazine. This is indeed a nice way of finding out how many bullets are inside the magazine at a given time, yet this information is not really what interests the weapon bearer. It is by far more important for the gun bearer to get information concerning the presence of a bullet in the muzzle of the firearm. Moreover, the indicator member seems rather awkward and cumbersome, with a lengthy indicator hanging from the magazine that may inadvertently be pulled or engaged to the hand of the user or to other items, rendering the use of the magazine unsafe.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US784786A"><text>US 784,786 (Gottardi</text></patcit>) disclosed an indicator for a magazine having a number of projecting studs in the lateral wall of its chamber that are successively displaced upon successive ejection of cartridges.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Practically most weapon bearers keep their magazines filled with bullets, leaving no room for extra bullets.

This is an important characteristic of the present invention, as it provides the firearm bearer with indication to the probable (or certain) presence of a bullet inside his muzzle, making him more cautious and aware of the status of the firearm.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">It is asserted that most of the time a firearm and its magazines are kept idle (not in use), either stored or carried by the owner, whereas the time it is actually used is substantially shorter (accounts for only a tiny fraction of the idle time). Therefore, most of the time, the owner of the firearm is concerned whether there is a bullet inside the muzzle, rendering the firearm dangerous and ready to fire.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In order to tackle this problem the present invention introduces a magazine with a status indicator, which specifically addresses this problem by providing a status indicator, which informs the weapon bearer if the magazine is fully loaded or if a bullet is missing (especially the first bullet) - a fact that ought to raise a suspicion (or understanding) that a bullet is present in the weapon's muzzle.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">It is noted that the patents mentioned hereinabove are aimed at either providing information as to the exact number of bullets in the magazine or indication whether the magazine is empty or not. The present invention seeks to provide an indicator having particular value in terms of safety, by indicating the immediate status change between a fully loaded magazine, i.e. indicating that the weapon itself is not cocked, and a deficit of a bullet, indicating that there is a high probability that the weapon is cocked.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">A magazine 1 (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) generally comprises a housing 2 defining a cavity in which bullets 5 are stacked in an orderly manner. Housing 2 is provided with opening 6 through which bullets 5 are loaded into or discharged from housing 2. A follower 3 is provided inside magazine 1 resiliently pressing against opening 6, on which the first bullet rests, and as the bullets are loaded into the magazine (one by one), the follower retracts within the magazine to make room for the inserted bullets. Spring 4 provides a counter-force, pressing follower 3 towards opening 6. The last bullet to be inserted is positioned adjacent the opening, available for loading into the muzzle of the firearm. When the magazine is inserted into the magazine cavity of the firearm, the last bullet to be inserted into the magazine is the first one to be loaded into the muzzle of the firearm, when it is loaded.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The present invention is explained hereinafter with reference to some embodiments illustrated in the accompanying figures. Note, however, that the scope of the present invention is not limited to these embodiments alone.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> illustrating a firearms magazine with status indicator in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, partially loaded. Follower 3 is provided with a pin 7, the pin coupled to the follower and having an end 9, the length of the pin calculated to be a bit longer than the distance between the bottom of follower 3 and bore 8, provided at the bottom of housing 2 when the magazine is in full condition, so that when the magazine is fully loaded the pin is designed to protrude through matching bore 8. When the magazine is only partially loaded (i.e. when the magazine lacks one or more bullets from the maximum possible number of bullets that the magazine can contain) end 9 retracts and disappears inside the magazine. In other words, the last bullet to be charged into the magazine causes the indicator pin to protrude through bore 8, whereas when this<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> bullet is discharged it causes the indicator pin to retract and disappear into the magazine housing.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> illustrates a firearms magazine with status indicator in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, fully loaded. In this case tip 9 of pin 7 protrudes through bore 8, and is visible. Moreover, it is possible to feel the tip when passing a finger (or any other body part) over bottom of the magazine, and thus determine whether the magazine is fully loaded or not.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> depicts the magazine of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> after the first bullet (which was the last to be charged into the magazine) was discharged from the magazine into the muzzle, when all but one of the maximal number of bullets are present in the magazine. At the instance the first bullet is missing, follower 3 advances towards the opening 6 of the magazine, thus causing tip 9 of pin 7 to retract into the body of the magazine and disappear within the magazine, being no linger visible or noticeable. If the bottom of the magazine is felt it immediately becomes obvious that the magazine is no longer full with bullets, giving rise to the probable assumption that there is a bullet inside the muzzle of the firearm. If this status is undesired or unintentional, the carrier of the firearm will immediately perform check-up of his firearm to make sure there is no bullet in the muzzle, removing any bullet from the muzzle, if there was one.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref> illustrates a firearms magazine with status indicator, in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention, with a resilient levered indicator. Resilient lever 10 is pivotally attached to base 11, provided on the bottom of housing 2 of the magazine, the resilient lever 10 provided with prominence 12. The default position of the resilient lever is determined by spring 13 to be with prominence 12 protruding through bore 18, provided at the bottom of the housing of the magazine. When the maximum number of bullets is reached, follower 3 is retracted into the magazine and pin 15 presses against resilient lever 10 forcing prominence 12 to disappear into bore 18. The carrier of the magazine (and its corresponding firearm) can therefore determine if the magazine is full (when prominence 12 is invisible), or if one, or more, bullets is missing (when prominence 12 is visible), suggesting that a thorough examination of the muzzle ought to be performed on the firearm muzzle.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0045" num="0045"><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref> illustrates a firearms magazine with status indicator in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention, with two colored indication pins. Here a resilient lever 10 is provided with two prominences, 16, 17, each on either end of the resilient lever. The default position of the resilient lever is determined by spring 13 to be with prominence 16 protruding through bore 18, provided at the bottom of the housing of the magazine, whereas prominence 19 is retracted behind bore 19, at the bottom of the magazine. When the maximum number of bullets is reached, follower 3 is retracted into the magazine and pin 15 presses against resilient lever 10 forcing prominence 16 to disappear into bore 18, and pushing prominence 17 to appear through bore 19. The carrier of the magazine (and its corresponding firearm) can therefore determine if the magazine is full (when prominence 17 is visible), or if one, or more, bullets is missing (when prominence 16 is visible), suggesting that a thorough check-up of the muzzle be performed on the firearm muzzle. In a preferred embodiment of this arrangement the prominences are differently colored, so as to allow fast and reliable determination of the filling status of the magazine. In another preferred embodiment of this arrangement the prominences may be distinctly shaped (e.g. one prominence presenting a flat surface, whereas the second presents a rough surface, or one prominence roundly shaped whereas the other sharply shaped, etc.). In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the protruding lengths of the prominences may differ to allow fast and better distinction between the magazine states.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046"><figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref> illustrates a firearms magazine with status indicator in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention, with a resilient levered indicator.
