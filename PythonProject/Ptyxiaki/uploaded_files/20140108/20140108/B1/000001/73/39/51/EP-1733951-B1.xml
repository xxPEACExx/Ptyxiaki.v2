This is conducted in order not to vary a space (distance) between the two side portions of the hollow member or half hollow member due to a fastening force of the nut and bolt.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2000238657A"><text>2000-238657</text></patcit> discloses a connecting structure in which a through hole is provided at a predetermined point of a hollow member, and then a collar is inserted at the point of through hole and is fixed with the hollow member by means of welding. Under this situation, the hollow member is fixed with the other member by inserting a bolt into the collar. Alternatively under this situation, the hollow member is fixed with the other member, by inserting a bolt<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> into the collar through a pair of brackets which have concave cross sections and which are provided to straddle the hollow member and to sandwich the collar in an upper-lower direction, and then by tightening a nut on the bolt. In this case, the collar is simply shaped like a circular cylinder, and only one bolt is used for the fixing.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="DE10258108A1"><text>DE 102 58 108 A1</text></patcit> discloses a connecting structure according the preamble of claim 1 and a method of connecting a hollow member for reinforcement of hollow chamber profiles for motor vehicles. Thereby, a distance tube is inverted to a first aperture in the wall to be reinforced, of the hollow chamber profile. Further, a forming part of a tool is fitted into one end of the tube to expand it, and a further forming part is inserted to a second aperture into the other tube and, to act as a counter-bearing.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">However in the case of above Japanese Patent Application, an expense in time and effort is necessary at the time of attachment of the collar; since the collar is inserted through the hollow member or the brackets provided to straddle the hollow member, and then is welded. Moreover, the structure in which the hollow member is connected with the other member by inserting the bolt through the collar passing through the hollow member is not a structure constructed for solidly fixing the hollow member, since only the collar is in contact with the other member. Furthermore, since the collar is formed simply in a circular cylindrical shape, the collar can be used for only one bolt. Hence, a plurality of collars need to be welded in the case where the usage of a plurality of bolts is necessary.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Moreover, in related fields of motor vehicle; a suspension member constituting a suspension is connected with a supporting member for supporting the vehicle-body side of a suspension arm. Also, an engine, a transmission, and the like are mounted on the suspension member. It is conceivable that the usage of an aluminium<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> material is of benefit for the forming of suspension member, in view of weight reduction. For example, in the suspension member, an optimal connecting structure for a hollow member or a half hollow member is needed.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide a connecting structure for a hollow member or a half hollow member, devised to reduce constructional elements and to fix the collar easily and reliably.<br/>

III of <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7A</figref>. In this embodiment, a structural member having a rectangular and closed cross-section is employed as one example of the hollow member or the like.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The suspension member 1 mainly includes a suspension-member main body 10, an auxiliary (subsidiary) side-member 15 serving as the hollow member, and a first cross member 14, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">FIGS 1 to 3</figref>. A side member 11 is provided in suspension member 1 so as to extend in a<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> front-rear (i.e., longitudinal) direction of the vehicle (body). Suspension-member main body 10 includes a pair of side members 11, a center cross member 12 connecting intermediate (middle) portions of both side members 11 with each other, and a rear cross member 13 connecting rear-end portions of both side members 11 with each other. Moreover, suspension-member main body 10 is formed by integrally forming a pair of side members 11, center cross member 12, and rear cross member 13. In detail, suspension-member main body 10 is molded by a casting from aluminium alloy, so as to form a pair of side members 11, center cross member 12, and rear cross member 13 in one piece. Auxiliary side-member 15 is connected with an end portion of each of both side members 11 at the front side of side member 11, and extends in the front-rear direction of the vehicle. Moreover, auxiliary side-member 15 is formed by an extrusion of aluminium alloy (i.e., is formed from an extruded shape made of aluminium alloy). First cross member 14 is attached so as to hang first cross member 14 across end portions of both auxiliary side-members 15. Namely, first cross member 14 is connected with both auxiliary side-members 15 at both end portions of first cross member 14. In suspension-member main body 10, each combining (connecting) portion of two members among both side members 11, center cross member 12, and rear cross member 13 is formed in arc shape to avoid a stress concentration.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Auxiliary side-member 15 is formed as a different member from suspension-member main body 10, for the following reasons. First, the part having a simple shape<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> can be easily manufactured by the extrusion molding, as a different member from the main-body part having a complex shape which is formed by the casting molding. Next, when a minor (slight) collision occurs, auxiliary side-member 15 can constantly absorb an energy caused by the collision within a certain definite range in corporation with the vehicle body (i.e., a side frame). Thereby, it can be prevented that the minor collision affects suspension-member main body 10 and a drive unit, a steering unit, a brake unit, and the like respectively mounted on suspension-member main body 10.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Each side member 11 includes a connecting portion 16 for connecting side member 11 to side frame 2 of the vehicle body, at the rear end portion of side member 11 with respect to the front-rear direction of vehicle body. Also, side member 11 includes a connecting portion 17 for connecting side member 11 to side frame 2, at the portion shifted a little in the front-side direction from the center of side member 11. Hereinafter, connecting portion 16 and connecting portion 17 are respectively called a rear-end connecting portion (or a vehicle-interior side connecting portion) 16 and an intermediate connecting portion 17. A supporting portion 21 (also called, a first supporting portion 21) and a rupture inducing portion 20 are provided near rear-end connecting portion 16. At first supporting portion 21, suspension-member main body 10 supports a rear-end-side arm segment (or section) 3a of a lower arm 3. This lower arm 3 constitutes a suspension arm in an area located more in the front-side direction than rear-end connecting portion 16. Rupture inducing portion 20 is<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> provided so as to allow suspension-member main body 10 to rupture or break at its part between rear-end connecting portion 16 and first supporting portion 21 when receiving an impactive force from front in the case of collision of the vehicle. This rupture inducing portion 20 is formed e.g. by providing a step(s) (difference in width) to a suspension-member main body 10's part corresponding to rupture inducing portion 20. Accordingly, when the stress exceeds a constant level, the stress concentration is caused at rupture inducing portion 20 and thereby suspension-member main body 10 is ruptured. Side member 11 includes a supporting portion 22 (also called, a second supporting portion 22) at the intermediate portion of side member 11. At second supporting portion 22, suspension-member main body 10 supports a front-end-side arm segment 3b of lower arm 3.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Side member 11 includes an upper-surface portion 11a, side walls 11b each extending downwardly from a side edge of upper-surface portion 11a, and a stiffening rib(s) 30. Two side walls 11b extend perpendicularly from both side edges of upper-surface portion 11a, so that the cross section of side member 11 is substantially shaped like an inverted U as viewed from the front direction of vehicle. Stiffening rib 30 is provided so as to protrude from a reverse surface of upper-surface portion 11a, in an area at least including the area of rupture inducing portion 20. Namely, stiffening ribs 30 are formed in a protruding manner, so as to expand in the front-rear direction and along side member 11. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, rear-end connecting portion 16 includes a boss<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> 16b having (i.e., formed with) a connecting hole 16a. Intermediate connecting portion 17 includes a boss 17b having a connecting hole 17a. The strength of these bosses 16b and 17b is enhanced by continuously providing stiffening ribs 30 also on respective bosses 16b and 17b. Thereby, the strength of suspension member 1 which is needed during a normal running of the vehicle can be secured. Moreover as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, first supporting portion 21 includes two bosses 21b each having a mounting hole 21a. The strength of these bosses 21b is also enhanced by continuously providing stiffening ribs 30 to respective two bosses 21b.

At a front side from front-side bracket 22a (i.e., in an area subsequent to front-side bracket 22a in the front direction of vehicle), a stiffening rib 23a is provided (continuously formed) as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>.

In this example, respective front-side bracket 22a and rear-side bracket 22b are provided to continue into side wall 11b of side member 11. Side wall 11b's portion located between front-side bracket 22a and rear-side bracket 22b is cut so that the height of this portion of side<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> wall 11b is gradually lowered toward front from rear (i.e., toward front-side bracket 22a). The height (of protrusion) of stiffening rib 23a continuing into (i.e., joined to) front-side bracket 22a is designed to be lower than that of stiffening rib 23b continuing into rear-side bracket 22b. By so designing, front-side bracket 22a has a flexibility at some degree, while rear-side bracket 22b has a solidity. Namely when attaching front-end-side arm segment 3b of lower arm 3 to second supporting portion 22, front-end-side arm segment 3b provided with a bush is inserted between front-side bracket 22a and rear-side bracket 22b. Then, a nut 25 is screwed on a bolt 24 penetrating front-side bracket 22a, front-end-side arm segment 3b, and rear-side bracket 22b. At this time, front-end-side arm segment 3b can be solidly fixed or connected with second supporting portion 22 since front-side bracket 22a is bent moderately. Rear-side bracket 22b has an adequate stiffness against a force transmitted from lower arm 3 or the front of vehicle.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, each side member 11 is formed substantially in a crank shape, namely is formed so as to make a rear-side portion (or vehicle-interior-side portion) of side member 11 lower than a front-side portion of side member 11 in the vertical (upper-lower) direction of the vehicle.

Namely, bulging portion 65 is formed with through hole 62 penetrating bulging portion 65 substantially parallel to bolt hole 61 passing through both contact surfaces 67.

Then as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, one of two edges 15c and 15d<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> of auxiliary side-member 15 is deformed into the through hole 62 at an edge 15c's (or 15d's) position corresponding to the position of through hole 62, by using a tool such as a punch. By so-doing, namely by deforming auxiliary side-member 15 to sink into through hole 62; a caulk (caulked portion or staking portion) 70 is formed in one of two edges 15c and 15d, and thereby collar 60 is caulked and temporarily attached to auxiliary side-member 15.<br/>
Rotation preventing portion 68 prevents this temporarily joined collar 60 from rotating about the caulked portion inside hollow portion 15b, since rotation preventing portion 68 is in contact with linking edge 15e. Therefore, the position of bolt hole 61 does not deviate from the position of bolt (continuous-) hole 15a. In such a case, rotation preventing portion 68 is in contact with one of both linking edges 15e by means of surface contact, at a spot E-E' located ahead and behind the caulked portion, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 9A</figref>. Maybe in such a case, rotation preventing portion 68 is in contact with both linking edges 15e at two points D and D' of linking edges 15e and 15e, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7A</figref>.

Namely, it is only necessary that rotation preventing portion 68 makes a contact with linking edge(s) 15e so as not to allow collar 60 to rotate beyond a constant range, i.e., tolerance. Even if collar 60 rotates around the<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> caulked portion in some degree, the position deviation between bolt hole 61 and bolt hole 15a does not affect the fastening of bolt 51 and nut 52 in the case where this rotation area is small. Hence, rotation preventing portion 68 has only to become in contact with linking edge(s) 15e before the position deviation between bolt hole 61 and bolt hole 15a starts to affect the fastening of bolt 51 and nut 52.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Thereby, auxiliary side-member 15 can be equipped with collar 60 in advance. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to insert collar 60 into auxiliary side-member 15 and adjust these positions at the time of connecting operation for auxiliary side-member 15 and side member 11. Moreover, the risk of a loss of collar 60 can be remarkably reduced. Furthermore, a forgetting about the installation of collar 60 can be checked by determining whether the caulked portion is present as viewed from the outside.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The operating procedure for mounting this auxiliary side-member 15 to suspension-member main body 10 is as follows. At first, the end portion of auxiliary side-member 15 in which collar 60 was temporarily joined in advance is inserted within the side member 11's front-end portion shaped like inverted-U in vertical cross section. Next, an attachment segment (section) 41 of attachment bracket 40 is made to abut on the lower surface of auxiliary side-member 15. Then, bolt 51 is made to pass (or penetrate) through an attachment hole 41a provided in attachment segment 41, bolt continuous hole 15a provided in auxiliary side-member 15, bolt hole 61 provided in collar 60, and a through hole 11d provided in upper-surface<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> portion 11a of side member 11, from the lower direction of the vehicle. Under this situation, nut 52 is screwed on a projecting portion of bolt 51. At this time, auxiliary side-member 15 is prevented from being deformed due to fastening force (clamping pressure) by bolt 51 and nut 52, since both contact surfaces 67 of collar 60 respectively abut on the inner surfaces of the mutually-opposed two edges 15c and 15d of auxiliary side-member 15. Because of this fastening force, auxiliary side-member 15 is tightly supported by sandwiching auxiliary side-member 15 between upper-surface portion 11a of side member 11 and attachment segment 41. Next, a fixing bolt 53 is made to pass into bracket 19 which serves to mount stabilizer 6, through a slotted (or elliptical) hole 42a provided in a fixing segment (section) 42 of attachment bracket 40. Under this situation, a nut 54 is screwed on a projecting portion of fixing bolt 53. Thus, auxiliary side-member 15 is connected with suspension-member main body 10. It is noted that attachment bracket (or mounting hardware) 40 includes attachment segment 41 formed with attachment holes 41a and fixing segment 42 formed with slotted hole 42a, and upper-surface portion 11a is formed with the through holes 11d.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The suspension member 1 constructed as described above is fixed with side frame 2 of vehicle body by using bolts and nuts (not shown) at the points of front-end connecting portion 18, intermediate connecting portion 17, and rear-end connecting portion 16.

Base portion 69 is shaped like a circle in horizontal cross section, and is formed with one bolt hole 61. Rotation preventing section 68A is formed along a tangent of base portion 69 (i.e., in the tangential direction of base portion 69) shaped like a circular cylinder. Through hole 62 is provided along bolt hole 61 (i.e., substantially parallel to bolt hole 61), and defines a receiving portion of the caulking. Collar 60A includes contact surfaces 67 at the both end portions of collar 60A. Contact surfaces 67 can respectively abut on upper edge (upper-side portion) 15c and lower edge (lower-side portion) 15d of auxiliary side-member 15. Thus-formed collar 60A is inserted into hollow portion 15b of auxiliary side-member 15, in the same manner as collar 60. Then, collar 60A is temporarily connected with auxiliary side-member 15 by caulking one wall surface (edge 15c or 15d) of auxiliary side-member 15 at the wall surface's position corresponding to the position of through hole 62. Then, auxiliary side-member 15 can be coupled with side member<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> 11 by using collar 60A, bolt 51, and nut 52, in the same manner as the case of collar 60.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In the above-described embodiment, the case<br/>

Then, hollow member 15A is made to abut on an attachment surface 81 of another member 80 with which this hollow member 15A needs to be fixed. Under this situation, attachment bolt 51 is inserted through bolt continuous-hole 15a provided in hollow member 15A, bolt inserting hole 61 provided in collar 60A, and an attachment hole 82 provided in another member 80. Then, nut 52 is screwed on a projecting portion of attachment bolt 51, and thereby hollow member 15A can be connected or coupled with another member 80. Although collar 60A formed with one bolt hole 61 has been adopted in this example as shown in <figref idrefs="f0014">FIGS 16A and 16B</figref>, hollow member 15A can be connected with another member 80 also by using collar 60 formed with two bolt holes 61 instead of collar 60A.<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --></p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In this example as shown in <figref idrefs="f0014">FIGS 16A and 16B</figref>, collar 60A does not have chamfered portion 66, and therefore collar 60A is designed to make the width of collar 60A slightly shorter than the space between both linking edges 15e of hollow member 15A so that collar 60A is not in contact with linking edges 15e.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Next, the method of caulking collar 60 with auxiliary side-member 15 will now be explained with reference to a schematic exploded perspective view of <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 18</figref>.

The position-determining pins are installed on a lower die (not shown) in an upstanding state. A reference sign 92 denotes a punch, and the punch is fixed downwardly and perpendicularly on a lower surface of an upper die (not shown) capable of moving up and down.

Namely, each of the tip portions of two position-determining pins is cut in a slanting direction. Position-determining pin 91a is movable with respect to the A and B directions, and is being urged in the A direction by an elastic force of an elastic member (not shown) such as a spring. A positional relationship among punch 92 and position-determining pins 91a and 91b is determined so as to become same as the relationship among through hole 62,<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> an A-direction end portion of slotted bolt hole 61 located more in the A direction of collar 60, and a B-direction end portion of another slotted bolt hole 61.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">When conducting the caulking, collar 60 is disposed or inserted into the end portion of auxiliary side-member 15, and then auxiliary side-member 15 is moved to a position above position-determining pins 91a and 91b (in other words, position-determining pins 91a and 91b are fit into auxiliary side-member 15). Since the inclined (slanted) surface is provided at the tip portion (or upper-end portion) of each of position-determining pins 91a and 91b, auxiliary side-member 15 and collar 60 can be set on the lower die so as to conform the respective two (horizontal) positions of bolt continuous holes 15a and 15a to the corresponding positions of bolt inserting holes 61 and 61. By lowering the upper die under this situation, upper edge 15c of auxiliary side-member 15 is properly caulked toward through hole 62 by punch 92.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In the above-described embodiment, the case<br/>

However, the receiving portion for caulking may be defined by a recess portion formed by a machine work.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Advantages and effects according to the above-described first embodiment will now be explained.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">According to the first embodiment; in the connecting structure where the hollow member or the half hollow member (hereinafter simply called, hollow member) including two side portions (two walls 15c and 15d) opposed apart from each other is connected with or mounted on the other member(s) by the bolt passing through these two side portions, at least one of the collar's two contact surfaces adapted to respectively abut on the two side portions is formed with the receiving portion for caulking. When arranging the collar at a specified position between the two side portions, the caulked portion is formed from at least one of the two side portions toward this caulking-receiving portion. Thereby, the collar is temporarily joined with the hollow member. Then, the hollow member is connected with the other member by the bolt adapted to fasten the hollow member and the other member. Therefore, the hollow member can be strongly<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> connected with the other member without deforming the hollow member due to the fastening force. Furthermore, the collar can be fixed in the hollow member beforehand. Hence, even if the hollow member is beforehand assembled with the collar in one place (of a plant) and then the hollow member is fastened to the other member by the bolt in another place (of the plant), it can be easily conducted by making a visual inspection of the caulked portion to determine whether the collar has been installed. Therefore for example, it is not caused to forget to install the collar.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">According to the first embodiment; the collar includes the rotation preventing portion capable of becoming in contact with the linking portion(s) linking the two side portions of the hollow member with each other, so as to prevent the rotation of collar. Accordingly, the position deviation between the bolt-hole provided in the collar and the bolt continuous-hole formed in the two side portions, which is caused due to a free rotation of collar can be credibly avoided. Therefore, the execution of connecting work of the hollow member can be made easier. Moreover since the rotation preventing portion is designed to become in contact with the linking portion(s) by means of surface contact or two-point contact, the position deviation between the bolt-hole of collar and the bolt continuous-hole of two side portions, can be more credibly avoided.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">According to the first embodiment; the collar is formed by the extrusion of aluminium alloy, and both of the caulking-receiving portion (i.e., through-hole) and the bolt-hole of collar are formed by the extrusion molding without<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> some other particular process. Accordingly, the collar can be temporally joined within the hollow member, by disposing the collar between the two side portions of hollow member, and by deforming at least one of the two side portions of hollow member toward the caulking-receiving portion at the hollow member's part corresponding to the caulking-receiving portion by way of caulking executed by using a tool such as a punch. Therefore, the temporary joint of collar can be made easier and more reliable. Furthermore since both of the caulking-receiving portion (i.e., through-hole) and the bolt-hole of collar can be formed simultaneously at the time of extrusion forming of the collar itself, it is unnecessary to process these holes separately. Hence, the process for these holes can be made easier.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">According to the first embodiment; the collar is formed with a plurality of bolt-holes. Hence, only one collar can serve even in the case where the usage of a plurality of bolts is necessary. According to the first embodiment; the bolt-hole of collar is designed to become an elongated hole. Hence, an error in installation position of the collar or an error in relative position between the collar and the bolt continuous-hole can be adjusted or compensated for. Therefore, the execution of connecting work of the hollow member can be made easier and more reliable. Furthermore according to the first embodiment; at least two of the plurality of elongated bolt-holes are provided at positions shifted from the center position of each other, in the longitudinal direction of hollow member and also in the width direction perpendicular to the<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> longitudinal direction. Hence, the hollow member is fixed by at least two bolts located diagonally to each other, and thereby the hollow member is fixed steadily. Moreover, even a relatively small hollow member can be fixed by using a plurality of bolts.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">According to the first embodiment; the rupture inducing portion(s) is formed in the suspension member of vehicle. A suspension-arm supporting area of suspension member is originally designed to be reinforced in strength in order to support the suspension arm, and further comes to have a high stiffness in combination with the strength of suspension arm. However, the suspension-arm supporting area of suspension member is ruptured at the provided rupture inducing portion, between the suspension-arm supporting portion located near the vehicle interior and the vehicle-interior side (rear-end) connecting portion connected to the vehicle body, when receiving the collision energy exceeding a constant level.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Thereby, the collision energy is not transmitted into the vehicle interior (room) directly via the suspension-arm supporting area of suspension member. Namely, the collision energy is smoothly absorbed by the vehicle body (side frame).</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">According to the first embodiment; the side members of suspension member are formed substantially in a crank shape, namely are formed so as to make the vehicle-interior-side portion of side member lower than another-side portion of side member in the front-rear direction of vehicle. Moreover, the vehicle-interior side connecting portion and the rupture inducing portion are<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> provided at this lower side portion of side member. Therefore, the moment arises to act downwardly about a fulcrum defined by the vehicle-interior side connecting portion, when receiving an impactive force from front or rear in the case of vehicle collision or the like. At this time, the rupture inducing portion is ruptured and the side member is certainly displaced downwardly. Accordingly, the suspension-arm supporting area of suspension member, which is designed to be reinforced in strength in order to fix the suspension arm and further which is made to have a high stiffness in combination with the strength of suspension arm itself, can not be displaced toward the vehicle-interior (side) at the time of vehicle collision. Moreover at this time, the engine is also displaced downwardly without moving toward the vehicle interior (side), since the engine is supported by the suspension member at least at the vehicle-interior side portion of engine.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">According to the first embodiment; the suspension member is made of aluminium alloy. Therefore, the suspension member itself can be reduced in weight.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Inventors of the present invention suggest the following imaginative concepts in the first embodiment. Namely, suspension member's parts needed to have complicated shapes are molded by means of casting, and the other parts of the suspension member are formed by means of extrusion of aluminium alloy. Thereby, manufacturing of the suspension member is made easier. Furthermore, it is suggested that a pressure-break characteristic of the extruded material of aluminium alloy<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> in its axial direction is used by arranging the extruded material axially in the front-rear direction of vehicle. Thereby, a function of absorbing the collision energy can be effectively produced based on the pressure-break characteristic, at the time of vehicle collision.

As mentioned above, the gap having the same front-rear length as gap Ca is provided between stay-mounting hole 260a and first fastening member 120a on front side of stay-mounting hole 260a, and moreover the gap having the same front-rear length as gap Cb is provided between stay-mounting hole 260b and first fastening member 120b on front side of stay-mounting hole 260b. Therefore, stay 222 is displaced by residual energy Eol1, in the rear direction by the front-rear directional length of gap Ca or Cb. At the same time; stay-mounting hole 260a and first fastening member 120a slide in contact with each other so as to generate a friction (resistance) therebetween, moreover stay-mounting hole 260b and first fastening member 120b slide in contact with each other so as to generate a friction therebetween, and moreover stay 222 slides in contact with each of sub-frame 888 and enclosing member 180 so as to each generate a friction therebetween.

Sub-frame 888 is deformed, and thereby residual energy Eo3 is absorbed. In the case where the deformation of sub-frame 888 has failed to absorb all of residual energy Eo3, a residual energy (of residual energy Eo3) Eo4 which has not been absorbed by the deformation of sub-frame 888 is transmitted to connecting point P1.

As a result, the collision energy which is transmitted to side frame member 666 can be reduced. If the caused collision energy is low; the collision energy transmitted to side frame member 666 does not reach a degree to deform side frame member 666, and hence the deformation of side frame member 666 can be prevented. If the caused collision energy is still low; the<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --> collision energy transmitted to sub-frame 888 does not reach a degree to deform sub-frame 888, and hence the deformation of sub-frame 888 and side frame member 666 can be prevented.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">In the mounting (or connecting) structure according to this embodiment; for example when a pedestrian collides with the vehicle, the pedestrian receives an impact from the vehicle, namely from bumper supporting member 444, stay 222, stay mounting portion 100, stopper portion 200, and sub-frame 888 in this order. At this time, the impactive energy is successively absorbed in these parts, namely in bumper supporting member 444, stay 222, stay mounting portion 100, stopper portion 200, and sub-frame 888. Hence, "Compatibility" can be improved.
