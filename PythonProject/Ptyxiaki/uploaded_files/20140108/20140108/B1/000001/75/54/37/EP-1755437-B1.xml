More particularly, the invention relates to a multipurpose endoscopy suite to which different types of endoscopes may be connected for carrying out various types of endoscopy procedures.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>Background of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Endoscopes are in general rigid, semiflexible, or flexible instruments that are used to examine interior organs and to carry out various medical procedures inside a patient's body without the necessity of performing an open major surgery. A flexible endoscope usually consists of a control handle and an insertion tube having a manoeuvrable tip. On the tip are located various elements such as a lens for an imaging system, an ultrasound transducer, irrigation nozzle, a miniature camera, stapler, etc. Channels extend through the interior of the endoscope from the distal tip to the proximal end. Typically these channels are of two types: (1) working channels to allow the surgeon to employ medical instruments relevant to carrying out specific tasks during the procedure, e.g., biopsy forceps, other small diameter endoscopes, tools such as scissors, small diameter staplers or suture device, (2) tubes that are necessary for delivering air and irrigation, cables that carry the imaging system signals (e.g., CCD or CMOS signals), cables that carry the ultrasound signals, fibers that carry the illumination toward the distal tip from a proximal light source, and often suction and insufflation channels. Special controls that are normally connected to cables that also pass through the interior channels allow the operator to maneuver<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the tip of the endoscope through interior passages of the body and perform complex procedures.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Endoscopy has advanced in recent years to the stage where many different procedures which are related to a specific body system or organ have become commonplace and are carried out in large numbers. Examples of some of these procedures are: Colonoscopy to examine the lining of the colon; Gastroscopy (EGD), carried out through the esophagus to view the stomach and upper gastroenterological tract; ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) for examining and treating the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts and pancreas; Bronchoscopy for viewing the breathing passages; and Transgastric or Extragastric procedures in the abdomen. In Transgastric procedures a mother scope including two or more small diameter baby scopes is advanced into the stomach and is used to view the stomach. The stomach tissue is pierced with a tool that is extended from the working channel of the mother scope and then the distal tip of the motherscope is advanced through the incision into the abdomen where a procedure is performed using the babyscopes. If necessary the abdomen is inflated with air or Co2 gas. Transgastric procedures may include procedures such as Appendectomy, Cholecystectomy, Liver biopsy and excision, Gastric banding for morbid obesity, and implanting of medical devices, for example a device for tubal ligation or devices to be anchored on internal organs. Hence the endoscopy suite will need to support more than one endoscope, several pumps, various types of gas, and various types of optical, imaging, measurement, and control systems.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Each procedure has different requirements that are dictated by factors such as the diameter, curvature and complexity, of the passageways of the body through which the endoscope must be inserted. For example, the endoscope used in Gastroscopy procedures is typically designed for diameters of about<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> 8-14mm, while endoscopes used for carrying out bronchoscopy procedures are designed for passageways which are less than 6mm in diameter. Another example is Transgastric procedures. The endoscope used in a procedure for tubal ligation or Cholecystectomy is typically designed with a diameter of about 14-16mm and with three or more working channels. Two of the working channels contain small diameter endoscopes (baby scopes), each having a diameter of 3.9mm. Each baby scope contains a working channel of 1.2mm. In another option the endoscope comprises two 2.5mm diameter baby scopes that use an imager of "1/15". A stapling or suturing device is contained in a third channel or as a part of the mother scope. As can be understood from the above, the differing requirements of different procedures have resulted in the development of a large variety of specialized endoscopes.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The peripheral equipment and resources referred to hereinabove, e.g. illumination, irrigation, etc. required for operating the various types of procedure oriented endoscopes is essentially the same, however considerations such as the amount of illumination that must be supplied or the maximum amount of suction/insufflation/irrigation that can be safely applied vary from procedure to procedure. The peripheral equipment is packaged in units known as endoscopy suites and historically there has arisen a situation wherein each type of endoscope and/or endoscopic procedure comes together with a dedicated endoscopy suite.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The main advantage in the provision of endoscopy suites specifically suitable for carrying out a certain procedure is in the simplicity of its operation and in its safety. This is because the operator does not have to be concerned with the settings of the different procedure-related parameters (e.g., light intensity, insufflation and suction pressures, etc) since these are determined in advance, set during the production stage of the endoscopy<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> suite, and cannot be easily changed. The major disadvantage is that hospitals and clinics at which many different types of endoscopic procedures are routinely carried out must maintain a supply of endoscopy suites, often several in a single operating theater. In addition, the cost of a procedure oriented endoscopy suite is often linked to the particular medical procedure with which it is associated and not entirely to the actual manufacturing costs, thus the present practice of supplying a dedicated endoscopy suite for every type of procedure and endoscope leads to inefficient use of resources and ultimately to inflated cost of the medical procedure.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In view of the fact that most endoscopy procedures require more or less the same peripheral equipment and resources, and the main differences between different endoscopic procedures is the range of parameters within which the equipment must work, it would be advantageous to supply a single endoscopy suite that is capable of being used with many, if not all, types of endoscopes.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a multipurpose endoscope suite that can be adapted for carrying out a plurality of endoscopy procedures.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is another object of the present invention to provide a multipurpose endoscope suite for which the operator can select and or adjust the values of the operating parameters making them suitable for a particular endoscopy procedure.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is still another object of the present invention to provide an endoscope suite that can be easily calibrated utilizing programmable means through it's input keypad.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is still another object of the present invention to provide endoscopes suite that can simultaneously support more than two different types of endoscopes used during a single procedure.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent as the description proceeds.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5931808A"><text>US 5, 931, 808</text></patcit> teaches an endoscopy suite which, inter alia, has no ultrasound components and no programmable resistors in analog cut off circuits.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Summary of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention is defined in claim 1 and provides an endoscopy suite that is adaptable for carrying out a plurality of endoscopy procedures and/or for supporting several endoscopes being used simultaneously in a given procedure.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The endoscopy suite of the invention comprises one or more lamps adapted for providing light (generally white light) that can be conducted to the distal end of the endoscope/s. It also comprises one or more fans for cooling the lamp/s, additional power sources, which may include ballast means, for operating the lamp/s. The lamp/s may be selected from the group comprising: xenon lamps, halogen lamps, and metal halide lamps. One or more beam splitters can be provided to allow the light from one lamp to be used to supply light to two or more illumination channels. Other means of light can be used to illuminate the region in which the procedure is to be carried out. For example, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can be placed on the distal tip of the endoscope in which case the endoscopy suite will comprise a power source that will be connected to the LEDs by means of electrical cables. In another option the light from LEDs can be transmitted by fibers up to the distal tip of the endoscope. The endoscopy suite of the invention may comprise means linked to the memory for adjusting the amount of light delivered from the lamp according to a predetermined value selected from one or more predetermined values stored in the memory and selected by an input received from the input device. The means for controlling the amount of light delivered from the lamp may comprise an iris attached to a motor adapted to respond to signals for adjusting the opening of the iris. The motor can be a step motor. An optical sensor may be provided to sense the home position of the stepping motor.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The endoscopy suite of the invention comprises an ultrasound module for generating ultrasound signals to be emitted by an ultrasound transducer on the endoscope, detecting and processing ultrasound signals received by the transducer, and outputting the processed signals to a display device.

The sequence of events is as follows: the pump 116 builds up the pressure in the insufflation channel until the sensor 121 supplies a signal to the controller that will shut down the operation of the pump 116; now the pressure is reduced e.g., by user demand and than the sensor 121 signals that the pump 116 should be activated; the check valve 132 maintains the pressure in the distal part of the channel while the relief valve 130 is opened for a brief period, e.g. 10msec, to reduce the pressure in the section of the line between the pump 116 and the check valve 132 to zero; now, the pump can start to work against zero pressure and the relief valve is closed either before the pump is activated or immediately thereafter; allowing the pressure in the insufflation channel to rise.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The Lamp 103 is a white light source such as a halogen, metal halide, LED or xenon lamp, and the light source power supply should include means for operating the lamp 103. Such means are, for example, a ballast in the case of a xenon lamp, where the term "ballast" includes all the electrical components necessary to operate the lamp. Also preferably included in the power supply circuit is a case interlock to protect the eyes of the operator from the UV radiation emitted by the lamp when the console is open. The light intensity that is required depends not only the amount of light needed for a bright image at the distal tip, but also on factors such as the diameter, absorption coefficient, quality, etc of the optical fibers that are in the endoscope that is connected to the system. Additionally, the output of the lamps must be controlled to optimize the light intensity at the distal tip of the endoscope. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the output intensity of the lamp is controlled by adjusting the opening of iris 105 to<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> allow passage of the amount of light required for the procedure being carried out. The opening of iris 105 is adjusted by signals provided by the ISL board 110 to motor 104, which is preferably a step motor. An optical sensor may be provided to sense the home position of the motor that controls the iris. The light passing through iris 105 opening is delivered to the endoscope multi-connector 106 on the front panel of unit 150. When the connector at the proximal end of the endoscope is inserted into multi-connector 106 the light enters a light guide or optical fibers and travels through one of the endoscope's channels to the distal tip. The lamp is preferably mounted on a mechanical adjustable bracket that enables optimization of the coupling of the output of the lamp into the fiber, thereby increasing the amount of light that is gathered by the fiber and increasing the illumination at the distal end of the endoscope. Skilled persons will be aware of other arrangements to control the light intensity that can replace the iris and the motor in the ISL system. If several endoscopes are attached to the endoscopy suite, each through its own multiconnector 106, then multiple lamps, 103, ballasts, etc. may be provided in console 150. Alternatively an optical arrangement comprising one or more beam splitters can be provided to allow the light from one lamp to be used to supply light to two or more illumination channels. In either case, separate irises 105, each controlled by its own motor 104 are preferably provided to allow optimal adjustment of the light intensity for each endoscope. Other sources of light can be used illuminate the region in which the procedure is to be carried out. For example, LEDs can be placed on the distal tip of the endoscope in which case the endoscopy suite will comprise a power source connected to the LEDs by means of electrical cables.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The pressurized air supplied by insufflation pump 116 is delivered to the respective endoscope channel via the P+ connector 123 and suction created by vacuum pump 117 via the P- connector 124 on the front panel of the unit<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> 150. The vacuum pump is part of the endoscopy suite. The pressure supplied by the insufflation pump can also be used for supplying water to the endoscope tip via a separate irrigation channel in the endoscope. This is accomplished by connecting a "Y" connector at the outlet from the P+ connector 123. One branch of the "Y" being directly connected to the proximal end of the endoscope insufflation channel and the other branch connected to the inlet of a sealed water-filled container whose outlet is connected to the proximal end of the endoscope irrigation channel. In an alternative implementation, the "Y" connector may be connected to the insufflation pump from within the console 150, where one output of the "Y" is connected to the P+ connector 123 in order to generate the irrigation and the other output of the "Y" will be connected to the insufflation channel of the endoscope through the Multi-Connector 106.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The ISL Board 110 controls the operation of insufflation pump 116 and vacuum pump 117 in accordance with the pressure sensed by the respective pressure sensors 120 and 121. The suction and insufflation pressures are maintained within the required ranges by activating the respective pump 116 or 117 whenever the pressure sensed by the respective sensor 120 or 121 deviates beyond the lower limit of proscribed conditions, and by stopping the operation of the respective pump whenever the pressure sensed by the respective sensor is above the upper limits of the proscribed conditions. For example for a Gastroscopy procedure performed with a specific endoscope, the lower limit for suction pressure is preferably limited to -0.4bar, the upper limit for suction pressure is preferably limited to -0.6bar, the low limit for insufflation pressure is preferably limited to 1.0 bar, and the upper limit for insufflation pressure is preferably limited to 1.5bar.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The keypad and LEDs 112 allow the operator to manually activate/deactivate various components of unit 150 or to select the predetermined set of parameters required for the respective procedure, and also indicate the operator's selection via the LEDs. The keypad 112 includes keys for activating and deactivating the light source and the suction and insufflation control loops. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the operator may use keypad 112 to select a desired insufflation pressure from a set of alternatives designated e.g., low, medium, or high; wherein the exact value of pressure that corresponds to each of these alternatives has been preset according to the endoscopic procedure that will be carried out.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The ISL Board can display via the display 111 information including, but not limited to: alerts, the predetermined values of the parameters currently selected, the sensed pressures, and other information associated with the specific endoscopy procedure being carried out. The suction and insufflation pressure are preferably controlled by utilizing analog circuitries to avoid any possible software faults from interfering with the operation of pumps 116 and 117. Analog cut off circuits based on non-volatile programmable resistors (not shown) are utilized for this purpose. Implementation of such pressure control circuitries can be carried out in various ways that are well known to persons skilled in the art.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">When the operator selects a specific endoscopic procedure via the keypad 112, a predetermined set of parameters appropriate to that procedure are read from the memory of the ISL board 110 and written to the respective programmable resistors. The parameters of the set preferably are values of the upper and lower recommended pressure limits for suction and insufflation. Thus, the pressure control circuitries can provide analog control means for monitoring and adjusting the insufflation and suction pressures<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> according to the predetermined high and low bounds and establish a hysteresis loop for controlling operation of pumps 116 and 117.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The communication interface 113 is used for modifying the currently stored parameter set, i.e. calibrating the device, or for inserting new parameter sets, as may be required. However, only skilled and authorized technicians should preferably carry out these operations in order to prevent introducing unwanted and even unsafe changes in the sets of parameters stored in memory of the ISL board of unit 150.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The operation of other equipment, for which specific predetermined operating parameters are not required, is preferably controlled via an independent unit (Console) 250, as exemplified in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. In this exemplary embodiment, unit 250 comprise devices used for controlling the operation of video camera and ultrasound transducers located on the distal tip of the endoscope and connected to unit 250 via camera connector 211 and ultrasound connector 202, respectively. Unit 250 preferably comprises two power supplies 200 and 215.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The Ultrasound Power Supply 200 is used to power the ultrasound module 206 and one or more fans 201 in unit 250. Ultrasound module 206 comprises a signal generator, processing means, memory, and interfacing circuitries 205 required for emitting and acquiring ultrasound signals from the ultrasound transducer via the ultrasound connector 202. A keypad 204 is linked to the ultrasound module 206 and used by the operator to adjust various ultrasound settings (for example for calibration). The processing means provides the digital signal processing (DSP) capabilities required for processing and analyzing the acquired ultrasound signals. The results of the signal analysis are displayed on display 203, which is linked to ultrasound<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> module 206. The ultrasound signals can be used for measuring position, distance, and tissue thickness within the body.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The video board power supply 215 powers the video module 210, the keypad 212, the keyboard 212 and the communication interface 213. The video module 210 provides the required electrical supply and control for operating the camera, which is connected to it via the camera connector 211. The image data received form the camera is processed by the video module 210 and displayed on the video display 214. To enable it to display the images, the video module 210 should include means for acquiring the image signals from the camera and processing means capable of carrying out the DSP tasks involved in processing the acquired image data. The operator can change various image properties (e.g., color intensity, brightness, zoom, etc) by means of keypad 212. The communication interface 213 can be used to connect units 150 and 250 or to connect the ultrasound module 206 to the video module 210 thus allowing data inputs to be provided from one unit to the other. In addition to displaying the images and other information acquired by the system, they can be stored in memory, transmitted to a communication network, e.g. the internet, or sent to a printer.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">It should be noted that the display 203 of unit 250 is not necessarily required if the ultrasound module 206 and video module 210 are linked (broken line in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>). In that case modules 206 and 210 can be adapted to provide the information output produced by the ultrasound module 206 on the video display 214, which is directly linked to the video module 210.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> schematically illustrates one embodiment of the front panels, which fulfill the function of the user interface with units 150 and 250, which together comprise the endoscopy suite.

The instrumentation circuitries and the operation of the drivers 404 is controlled by the CPU 400 via the interface logic circuits of block 402. The CPU 400 is linked to memory 401 in which is stored the predetermined sets of parameters, the operation code, and other information. The ISL board is connected to the communication interface 113, which may simply be a suitable communication connector (e.g., RS232, IEEE 1394, USB or<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> similar).

The cut off circuits 430 and 431 respond to the signals for activating/deactivating the pumps by activating switching devices 421 and 420. The signals from the logic circuits in 402 are connected by the switches to the respective drivers in 404 whenever an activation signal is provided by the cut off circuits 430 and 431, to the switching devices 421 and 420 respectively. In this way the activation signals provided by the logic circuits in 402 to the drivers of the insufflation and suction drivers are conditional on the signals provided by the cut off circuitries 430 and 431.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The predetermined sets of parameters stored in the memory 401 are used by the logic circuits in 402 to set the values of the non-volatile programmable resistors in the cut off circuits.
