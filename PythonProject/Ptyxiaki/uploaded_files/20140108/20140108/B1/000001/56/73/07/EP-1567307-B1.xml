Such an apparatus is known from <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5826468A1"><text>US 5826468A1</text></patcit>.</p><heading id="h0002">Background of the Invention</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Previously known autofeed screwdrivers suffer the disadvantage that they must be adjusted or modified so as to be able to drive screws of considerably varying lengths. Previously known autofeed screwdrivers utilize a number of different mechanisms to hold the screw and/or strap of a screwstrip so as to locate a screw to be driven and supporting the spent strap on a forward surface of an exitway. However, previously known devices suffer the disadvantage that they do not utilize a combination of these features in a tool adapted to drive screws of different lengths.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Previously known devices suffer the disadvantage that the spent strap exiting from the tool is only engaged on a forwardly directed surface of the spent strap.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Another disadvantage with previously known devices is that some screwstrips have their straps located at different distances from their heads than other screwstrips. The relative position of the strap on the screw typically has been greater for screws such as 7,62 cm (3 inch) and 8,89 cm (3½ inch) lengths than with shorter screws. This arises since it is advantageous to have a strap for longer screws closer to a mid-point along the length of the screws to assist in stabilizing the screws held in the strap, however, this presents difficulties in adapting a tool to drive screwstrips with straps at different distances from the heads of the screws.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Another disadvantage with previously known devices is that they do not permit holding the screwstrip both by engagement of the next screw to be driven and support of the spent strip on a forward surface in the exitway.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Another disadvantage is that known devices do not provide a useful mechanism for driving screwstrips carrying indexing mechanisms on the strap.</p><heading id="h0003">Summary of the Invention</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">To at least partially overcome these disadvantages of the previously known devices, the present invention provides a combination comprising a screwdriver assembly, threaded screws from a screwstrip and a screwstrip as shown in claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The workpiece engaging nose body includes a nose portion and a rear portion with the nose portion slidably mounted on the rear portion for movement rearwardly when the nose is urged into a workpiece to drive a screw. An exitway is defined between the nose portion and rear portion through which spent strap from which screws have been driven exit the nose body. On urging the nose body into the workpiece, the nose portion slides rearwardly to engage the strap in the exitway and move it rearwardly into engagement with the rear portion in the exitway. The strap is preferably "pinched" or "clamped" in the exitway between the nose portion and rear portion to assist in locating a screw to be driven from the nose body.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The nose body is preferably used in combination with a screwstrip having a strap with rear surface disposed at a constant distance forwardly of the heads of the screws such that the rear surface of the strap may be engaged by the rear portion in the exitway to accurately locate the screwstrip in the nose body.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The nose portion may also carry, near a forwardmost surface of the nose portion to engage a workpiece, a rearwardly directed surface which is adapted when the nose portion moves rearwardly relative the rear portion to engage a tip of a screw next to the screw to be driven and "sandwich" the next screw between the nose portion and the rear portion to hold the screwstrip in a desired position to facilitate driving a screw.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Either "pinching" of the spent strap in the exitway or "sandwiching" of the next screw is adequate to locate the screwstrip to drive a screw. Enhanced holding of a screwstrip arises by simultaneously "pinching" and "sandwiching".</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The nose body is adapted to drive screws of considerably different lengths by holding screws of longer lengths by "sandwiching" without "pinching" and holding screws of shorter lengths by "pinching" without "sandwiching". An intermediate length screw may be held by simultaneously "sandwiching" and "holding".</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Pinching is advantageous to avoid feed drawback by which reciprocating screwstrip feed mechanism may tend to draw the screwstrip backwards when a strap is desired to not be moved.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Pinching is advantageous for use of screwstrips having indexing elements carried thereon for registry in complementary indexing elements in the exitway on the nose portion and/or rear portion.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Further aspects and advantages will become apparent

For example, after use in driving a 6,35 cm (3½ inch) screw from a screwstrip, that screwstrip may be withdrawn from the tool and<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> another screwstrip having screws of, say, 3,81 cm (1½ inch), may then be inserted into the tool and directed driven by the tool without the need for any adjustment of the tool whatsoever other than replacement of one screwstrip by another screwstrip.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">In the preferred embodiments as, for example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0015">Figure 19</figref>, the spent strap 13 is shown as being engaged both on its forward surface 222 by the forward locating surface 125 and on its rear surface 223 by the rear locating surface 432.

The tool will function merely by engagement of the forward surface 222 of the strap 13 by the front locating surface 125 without need for the rear surface 223 to be engaged by the rear locating surface 432 of the rear portion. It is preferred, however, if both the forward surface 222 and the rear surface 223 are engaged. Most preferably, it is advantageous that the spent strap 13 is pinched between the forward locating surface 125 and the rear locating surface 432. The strap 13 is preferably pinched and, to some extent, compressed between the forward locating surface 125 and the rear locating surface 432 when the nose portion 22 is proximate the rearward position relative to the rear portion. For example, it is within the skill of a person skilled in this art to provide for engagement of the strap 13 between the forward locating surface 125 and the rear locating surface 434 a small distance forward of the rearward position of the nose portion on the rear portion. Subsequently, to the extent that the strap 13 is being pinched and may be compressed axially, the extent of axial compression may be limited by the nose portion assuming the rearward portion relative to the rear portion.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">Insofar as the rearward surface 223 of the strap 13 is to be engaged by the forward locating surface 432 on the rear portion, the rear surface 223 of the strap on the rear portion should advantageously be located a constant distance forward from the heads of the screw, preferably, the top surface of the screw. As well, it is further preferred in accordance with the present invention that the strap 13 has a constant height as measured parallel to the axis of the<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> screws such that both the rearward surface 223 and the forward surface 222 are located at constant fixed distances of the head of the screw. The present invention provides in combination an autofeed screwdriver attachment for collated screws as described together with collated screws having at least with one of the forward surface 222 and the rear surface 223 at a constant distance from the head of the screw and preferably both at constant distances.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">As seen in the Figures, the rear surface 223 of the strap is engaged by the forward locating surface 432. Rather than have the entire rear surface 223 of the strap 13 be located at a constant distance from the heads, it is possible to merely have the portions of the strap between the screws which is to be engaged by the rear locating surface 432 to be at a constant distance from the heads. Similarly, the entirety of the forward surface 222 may be a constant distance from the heads or merely the portion to be engaged by the forward locating surface 125.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">With the preferred embodiment of the nose portion and rear portion, screws of a length less than 2½ inches are driven without the flange 434 functioning to hold the screws to be driven. The present invention includes embodiments in which the nose portion is provided without the flange 434 and no provision is made to hold the screwstrip by sandwiching the next screw between the nose portion and the rear portion. With the flange 434 removed, a screwstrip could be held in a similar manner as that described above in <figref idrefs="f0015">Figures 18 and 19</figref> without the next screw being sandwiched and with the strap 13 pinched by or engaged between both the rear locating surface 432.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">The preferred embodiment has been described with reference to a preferred shuttle arrangement for advancing successive screws in a screwstrip.

The spring to act between the nose portion and the rear portion would compress under less forces than that required to compress the spring between the rear portion 22 and the housing 18 such that the nose portion 25 would retract relative the rear portion before the rear portion retracted relative to the housing.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">The screw feed channel element 76 carried on the rear element 22 is best seen in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref> as providing a channelway 88 which extends radially relative the longitudinal axis 52 to intersect with the guideway 82 in the guide tube 75. In this regard, the channelway 88 opens to the guideway 82 through the screw access opening 86. The channelway 88 provides a channel of a cross-section similar to that of the screw access opening 86 from the screw access opening 86 to a remote entranceway opening 90. The channelway 88 is defined between two side walls 91 and 92 joined by a top wall 93. The major side wall 91 is shown as extending from the heads 17 of the screws 16 forwardly to at least partially behind the plastic retaining strap 13. The lesser side wall 92 is shown as extending from the heads 17 of the screws 16 forwardly to above the plastic strap 13. As seen in <figref idrefs="f0015">Figures 18 and 19</figref>, the forward surface 454 of the lesser side wall 92 is immediately above the rear surface 223 of the strap 13 and assists in locating the strap. In the preferred embodiment, the rear strap locating surface 432 is disposed at the same axial location as the forward surface 454 of the lesser side wall 92. Stopping the lesser side wall from extending down over the strap 13 assists in reducing friction between the strap 13 and the lesser side wall. The side walls 91 and 92 define the channelway 88 with a cross-section conforming closely to that of the screwstrip 14 and its strap 13 and screws 16 with an enlarged<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> width where the heads of the screws are located and an enlarged width where the retaining strap 13 is provided about the screws.

Whether in any position in a cycle the cam pin 502 will engage either the first camming<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> surface 508 or the second camming surface 510 will depend on a number of factors. Most significant of these factors involve the resistance to movement of the shuttle 96 in either direction as compared to the strength of the spring 69 tending to move the shuttle 96 towards axis 52. Under conditions in which the bias of the spring 69 is dominant over resistance to movement of the shuttle 96, then the bias of the spring will place the cam pin 502 into engagement with the first camming surface 508 with relative motion of the lever 48 and therefore the shuttle 96 relative the position of the slide body 20 in the housing 18 to be dictated by the profile of the first camming surface 508. Under conditions where the resistance to movement of the shuttle is greater than the force of the spring 96, then the cam pin 502 will either engage the first camming surface 508 or the second camming surface 510 depending on the direction of such resistance and whether the slide body is in the retracting stroke or the extending stroke. For example, in an extending stroke when the shuttle 96 is engaging and advancing the next screw to be driven and the resistance offered to advance by the screwstrip may be greater than the force of the spring 69, then the cam pin 502 will engage on the second camming surface 510.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">In the preferred embodiment shown, as best seen in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, the first camming surface 508 has a first portion 514, a second portion 516 and a third portion 518.

The cam member 114 is preferably provided with a ratchet-like arrangement to have the cam member 114 remain at any selected position biased against movement from the selected position and with circular indents or depressions in the cam surface 115 to assist in positive engagement by the rear end 117 of the nose portion 24. A set screw 119, as seen in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, is provided to lock the cam member 114 at a desired position and/or to increase resistance to rotation. The cam member 114 is accessible by a user yet is provided to be out the way and not interfere with use of the driver attachment. The depth stop mechanism controls the extent to which screws are driven into a workpiece and thus controls the extent of countersinking. Since the stop surface 117 is at a constant distance from the forwardmost surface 34 of the nose portion 24, and the bit 122 carried on the driver shaft 34 is in a constant position relative the housing, the depth stop mechanism will set the extent to which a screw is driven independent of the length of a screw and thus, when set, will drive or countersink the head of a screw of one length, say, 3 ½ inches, the same amount as the head of a screw of, say, 2 inches. While a rotatable cam member 114 is shown various other cam members may be provided to present a surface to be engaged by the rear end 117 of the front portion, including stepped members which can slide to present different surfaces.</p><p id="p0127" num="0127">The driver shaft 34 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref> as carrying a split washer 120 engaged in an annular groove near its rear end 121 to assist in retaining the rear end of the driver shaft in the socket 27 of the housing 18.<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> The driver shaft 34 is provided with a removable bit 122 at its forward end which bit can readily be removed for replacement by another bit as for different size screws.

As seen in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>, the screws 16 to be driven are collated to be held parallel and spaced from each other by the plastic retaining strap 13.</p><p id="p0129" num="0129">In operation, a screwstrip 14 containing a number of screws 16 collated in the plastic retaining strap 13 is inserted into the channelway 88 with the first screw to be driven received within the guideway 82. To drive the first screw into the workpiece 134, the power driver 11 is activated to rotate the driver shaft 34. The driver shaft 34 and its bit 122, while they are rotated, are reciprocally movable in the guideway 82 towards and away from the workpiece 134. In a driving stroke, manual pressure of the user pushes the housing 18 towards the workpiece 134. With initial manual pressure, the forward end of the nose portion 24 engages the workpiece 134 to compress spring 38 so as to move the nose portion 24 relative the rear portion 22 from the forward position shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> to a rear position. The nose portion 24 is moved rearwardly until either a screw becomes sandwiched between the nose portion and the rear portion or the nose portion moves to the rear position relative the rear portion. Subsequently, the nose portion and rear portion move rearwardly from the extended position of the rear portion relative the housing to a retracted position relative the housing. On release of this manual pressure, in a return stroke, the compressed spring 38 moves the rear portion 22 back to its extended position relative the housing and the nose portion to its forward position relative the rear portion thereby moving the housing 18 and the driver shaft 34 away from the workpiece.<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --></p><p id="p0130" num="0130">In a driving stroke, as the driver shaft 34 is axially moved towards the workpiece, the bit 122 engages the screw head 17 to rotate the first screw to be driven. As is known, the plastic strap 13 is formed to release the screw 16 as the screw 16 advances forwardly rotated by the driver shaft 34. In some cases with longer screws, the screw tip may engage in a workpiece before the head of the screw engages the strap such that engagement of the screw in the workpiece will assist in drawing the screw head through the strap to break the fragible straps, however, this is not necessary and a screw may merely, by pressure from the drive shaft, be released before the screw engages the workpiece. Preferably, on release of the screw 16, the plastic strap 13 deflects away from the screw 16 outwardly so as to not interfere with the screw 16 in its movement into the workplace. After the screw 16 is driven into the workpiece 134, the driver shaft 34 axially moves away from the workpiece under the force of the spring 38 and a successive screw 16 is moved via the screw feed advance mechanism from the channelway 88 through the access opening 86 into the guideway 82 and into the axial alignment in the guideway with the driver shaft 34.</p><p id="p0131" num="0131">The screw 16 to be driven is held in position in axial alignment with the driver shaft 34 with its screw head 17 abutting the side wall 83 in the guideway 82. As a screw 16 to be driven is moved into the cylindrical guideway 82, a leading portion of the strap 13 from which screws have previously been driven extends outwardly from the guideway 82 through the exit opening 87 permitting substantially unhindered advance of the screwstrip 14.</p><p id="p0132" num="0132">To assist in location of a screw to be driven within the guide tube 75, in the preferred embodiment with screws of certain lengths, the rear locating surface 125 and forward locating surface 432 engage the forward and rear surfaces 222 and 223 of the strap 13. Thus, on the bit 122 engaging the head of the screw and urging the screw forwardly, the screw may be axially located within the guide tube 75 by reason not only of the head of the screw<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> engaging the side wall 83 of the guideway but also with the forward and rear surfaces 222 and 223 of the strap 13 being engaged in the locating surfaces 125 and 432 of the exitway 87.</p><p id="p0133" num="0133">The driver attachment 12 disclosed may be provided for different applications. In a preferred application, the driver may be used for high volume heavy load demands as, for example, as in building houses to apply sub-flooring and drywall. For such a configuration, it is preferred that with the power driver 11 comprising a typical screw gun which inherently incorporates a friction clutch and thus to the extent that a screw is fully driven into a workpiece, the clutch will, on the forces required to drive the screw becoming excessive, slip such that the bit will not be forced to rotate an engagement with the screw head and thus increase the life of the bit.</p><p id="p0134" num="0134">The driver attachment may be constructed from different materials of construction having regard to characteristics of wear and the intended use of the attachment. Preferably, a number of the parts may be moulded from nylon or other suitably strong lightweight materials. Parts which are subjected to excessive wear as by engagement with the head of the screw may be formed from metal or alternatively metal inserts may be provided within an injection moulded plastic or nylon parts. The optional provision of the nose portion 24 as a separate removable element has the advantage of permitting removable nose portions to be provided with surfaces which would bear the greatest loading and wear and which nose portions may be easily replaced when worn.</p><p id="p0135" num="0135">The screw feed advance mechanism carried on the nose portion has been illustrated merely as comprising a reciprocally slidable shuttle carrying a pawl.

Feed pawl drawback may be intentionally designed to occur and be utilized as a vehicle for ensuring positive location of the notch 524 on the projection 536.</p><p id="p0170" num="0170">In the preferred embodiments shown, the forward locating surface of the exitway 87 comprises surfaces of the projection 536 to engage notch 524 in the strap. The provision of projection 536 and uniformly spaced notches 524 are advantageous to form a system for locating the strap. The projection 536 and notches 524 may have different configurations. For illustration the projection and notch have been shown to extend about 1/3 of the width of the strap. It is to be appreciated that smaller notches could readily be used. The notches and projections may have many other shapes than that shown.</p><p id="p0171" num="0171">The preferred embodiment shows forward locating surfaces of a projection 536 which is generally uniform in a direction transverse to the longitudinal of the strip. Forward locating surfaces and/or their projection 536 could be provided to vary in a direction transverse to the longitudinal to assist<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> in locating the strap in a desired position in this direction. However, in the use of a screwstrip, it is to be appreciated that latitude needs to be given for the strap to deflect transversely to the longitudinal of the strap in the head of the screw forcing itself through the sleeve and past the strap.</p><p id="p0172" num="0172">Feed pawl drawback is advantageously reduced by the use of screwstrips with locating members to engage complementary locating members on the forward and/or rear locating surfaces 125 and 432. While complementary locating members are preferably on the forward locating surface 125 and the forward strap surface 222, they may also be provided on the rear locating surface 432 and the rear strap surface 223, or on both.</p><p id="p0173" num="0173">Feed pawl drawback is, in any event, without locating members on the strap or locating surfaces, avoided or reduced in the embodiment, for example, shown in <figref idrefs="f0013 f0014 f0015">Figures 15 to 19</figref>, insofar as the strap 13 is pinched between the forward locating surface 125 and the rear locating surface 432 to prevent movement of the strap transverse to the axis 52. Movement of the feed pawl, while the strap is adequately pinched, will not cause feed pawl drawback.</p><p id="p0174" num="0174">Pinching of the strap 13 between the forward locating surface 125 and the rear locating surface 432 is advantageous since this permits the last screw in a screwstrip to be accurately driven.</p><p id="p0175" num="0175">In the preferred embodiments, the pinching of the strap 13 between the forward locating surface 125 and rear locating surface 432 is maintained while the pawl 99 is withdrawn as indicated by arrow 610 in <figref idrefs="f0018">Figure 24</figref> so as to reduce any tendency for the pawl 99, on being withdrawn, to draw back the screwstrip. Thus, preferably, "pinching" is maintained in a cycle of movement of the housing 18 and slide body 20 so as to maintain pinching not only during an advance stroke while holding the screwstrip so that the driver shaft 34 may engage a screw and while driving a screw but also in a retraction stroke to withdraw the pawl 99.</p><p id="p0176" num="0176">Control of the extent of compression of the strap 13 when it is pinched between the forward locating surface 125 and the rear locating surface<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> 434 is advantageous to prevent the strip from being bent out of holding the screws in axial alignment in the guideway 82.</p><p id="p0177" num="0177">While the invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, many modifications and variations will now occur to persons skilled in the art, within the limits of the appended claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56987432" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Kombination, umfassend eine Schraubendreheranordnung, um mit einem Leistungsantrieb mit einem Gewinde versehene Schrauben von einem Schraubenstreifen (14) einzudrehen, und einen Schraubenstreifen (14), welcher Schrauben (16) umfasst, die an einem Plastikband (13) beabstandet voneinander Seite an Seite angeordnet sind, wobei das Band Verbindungsbereiche aufweist, welche sich sowohl zwischen benachbarten Schrauben als auch axial relativ zu den Schrauben erstrecken, wobei sich jede Schraube entlang einer jeweiligen Schraubenachse (212) erstreckt,<br/>
