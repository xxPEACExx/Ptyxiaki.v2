load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to an air compressor system comprising an air/oil separator tank.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In conventional air compressor systems air is compressed in a compression chamber or airend of a compressor, for example, by a set of rotary screws, and a lubricant, such as oil, is injected into the compression chamber and mixes with the compressed air. The oil is generally injected into the compression chamber for a number of reasons including cooling the air compressor system, lubricating bearings, balancing axial forces and sealing the rotary screws. Although using oil is essential for operating these types of air compressor systems, the oil must be removed from the stream of compressed air before the compressed air may be used downstream for pneumatic equipment and/or other tools.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In such conventional air compressor systems, the compressed air and oil mixture discharged from the airend of the compressor flows with a high velocity into a separator tank where the air and oil of the air/oil mixture are caused to separate. The separator tank is usually cylindrical and the air/oil mixture is directed around an inner wall of a separation chamber. The combination of the centrifugal forces acting on the air/oil mixture and contact between the air/oil mixture and the inner wall of the separation chamber causes much of the oil to separate from the air/oil mixture, thereby allowing gravity to draw most of the oil downwardly into a lower portion of the separation chamber and also allowing the air to separate from the oil and flow upwardly into an upper portion of the separation chamber to achieve primary separation.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In these conventional air compressor systems, the compressed air, along with some fine oil droplets or mist entrained therein, passes through a separator element placed within the upper portion of the separation chamber, thereby coalescing most of the remaining oil in the air stream to achieve secondary separation before the compressed air is transferred out of the separator tank. The coalesced oil pools in a bottom portion of the separator element and is returned to the airend of the compressor by a scavenging line.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Conventional air compressor systems as described above typically include a lid mounted on the separator tank to hold the separator element within the separation chamber of the separator tank. The separator element must be held in place because there is an upward force on the separator element due to the pressure differential between the wet side (outer) and dry side (inner) portions of the separator element. Conventional air compressor systems include an air exit port in the lid, and typically, a minimum pressure check valve (MPCV) assembly is operatively connected to the air exit port in the lid. After passing through the MPCV assembly, the compressed air is typically sent to an aftercooler, and then the cooled compressed air may be conveyed to pneumatic equipment and/or other tools. As can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, it is generally necessary to service or replace separator elements from time-to-time. In the conventional air compressor systems described above, before a separator element can be serviced or replaced, the air discharge hose and MPCV assembly, which usually includes associated fittings, must be disconnected from the lid. This increases the time required to service or replace the separator element. Thus, there is a need for an air compressor system which eliminates the necessity of disconnecting the air discharge hose and MPCV assembly from the separator tank prior to servicing or replacing a separator element.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The conventional way to remove oil from inside a separator element of the air compressor systems described above is to pass an independent scavenge tube through the lid mounted on the tank and down into an open area of the separator element. The scavenge tube extends to the bottom of the separator element and draws off the excess oil to prevent saturation of the separating media of the separator element. Positioning the scavenge tube through the lid and down into the open area of the separator element can be problematic. If the scavenge tube is too long, it may puncture the bottom of the separator element. If the scavenge tube is too short, it may not be sufficiently effective in removing the oil. In addition, before the separator element is replaced, the scavenge tube must be removed from the separator tank lid. Thus, there is a need for a scavenging device which is easy to install, which does not adversely affect the servicing or replacing of a separator element, and which also effectively removes oil from the bottom of the separator element.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE3445400"><text>DE3445400</text></patcit> discloses the preamble of claim 1 and describes an oil separator having a cylindrical vessel in which a separating cartridge is disposed.

It should be understood that the present invention is capable of use in other compressor systems, and the air compressor system 10 is merely shown and described as an example of one such system.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The air compressor system 10 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> includes a compressor 14, a motor 18, and a separator tank 22. Although the separator tank 22 as disclosed herein is used to separate oil from an air/oil mixture, it is contemplated that the separator tank 22 may be used to separate a volume of gas from any mixed media combination, including any gas/liquid combination. In addition, it is contemplated that the compressor 14 may be any suitable compressor, such as an oil-flooded air compressor. However, for the purposes of describing the preferred embodiment, the compressor 14 is a rotary screw compressor.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The separator tank 22 may be constructed of any number of suitable materials. However, in a preferred embodiment, the separator tank 22 is a cast separator tank. Air enters the compressor 14 and is compressed by rotary screws (not shown) found within the compressor 14. Oil is injected into the compressor 14 to lubricate the rotary screws and a gearbox (not shown) which drives the rotary screws. The oil further serves as a sealing means for the compressor 14. The compressed air and some of the oil travel out of the rotary screws through an airend discharge opening of the compressor and into an airend inlet opening 26 (<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>) in the separator tank 22. The separator tank 22 serves to separate oil from the compressed air and also serves as an oil sump for the oil used to lubricate the rotary screws, the gearbox and other components. The compressed air and oil enter the separator tank 22 and are caused to undergo a cyclonic motion within the separator tank 22. As the compressed air and oil are flung around an inner surface of the separator tank 22, the oil will slide down the inner surface of the separator tank 22 and collect in the bottom of the separator tank 22, and the air will move up and out of the separator tank 22 for further filtering, cooling and ultimate use.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, the separator tank 22 includes a side wall 30 and defines a separation chamber 34 having a lower portion 38 and an upper portion 42. The lower portion 38 of the separation chamber 34 serves as an oil reservoir or sump for the oil that is separated from the air/oil mixture introduced into the separation chamber 34 via channel 46 (see also <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>) during the primary separation process. A channel 50 communicates with the bottom of the lower portion 38 of the separation chamber 34. Pressure within the separator tank 22 forces the oil collected in the lower portion 38 of the separation chamber 34 to flow through the channel 50 and back to the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> compression chamber of the compressor 14 to lubricate the rotary screws, the gearbox and other components.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004">FIGS. 3-6</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005">8-9 </figref>schematically illustrate separator elements 54 used in the secondary separation process. Although the illustrated separator elements 54 may have slightly different configurations, with reference to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 9</figref>, each separator element 54 generally has a cylindrical body comprising inner 55 and outer 56 perforate metal shells, filter media 57 sandwiched between the shells 55 and 56, an open top 58, a closed bottom 62, and an internal passage (represented by arrow 64) where substantially oil-free compressed air flows from the separation chamber 34 of the separator tank 22. During the secondary separation process, oil pooled in the bottom 62 of the separator element 54 will be piped back to the compressor 14 via a scavenging device as described in detail below. It should be noted that the present invention is capable of use with many different separator elements, and the separator elements 54 are merely shown and described as examples of such separator elements.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, the separator element 54 is placed within the upper portion 42 of the separation chamber 34. An annular flange 66 extends around the top portion 58 of the separator element 54. The separator tank 22 includes a ledge 70 which extends circumferentially around an inner surface 74 of the side wall 30 of the separator tank 22. The flange 66 of the separator element 54 rests on the ledge 70 of the side wall 30. It should be noted that when the separator tank 22 is a cast separator tank, it is preferable for the ledge 70 to be an integrally cast member of the separator tank. As previously explained, air from the air/oil mixture introduced into the separation chamber 34 will flow upwardly into the upper portion 42 of the separation chamber 34 and through the separator element 54.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The separator tank 22 includes an air exit port 78 in the side wall 30 of the separator tank 22 for the air from the air/oil mixture that flows through the separator element 54. An MPCV assembly 82 is operatively connected, preferably threadably connected, to the air exit port 78. Lid 86 is mounted on the separator tank 22. When it is desirable to service or replace the separator element 54, lid 86 is simply removed or pivoted out of the way to provide quick and easy access to the separator element 54, without having to first disconnect the MPCV assembly 82 from the air exit port 78.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In an alternative embodiment, a boss 90 (<figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>) having a channel 94 (<figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>) therethrough extends outwardly from the side wall 30 of the separator tank 22.

Thus, a separator element hold down mechanism 102 is provided between the separator element 54 and the lid 86 to position and hold the separator element 54 within the separation chamber 34. The separator element hold down mechanism 102, which is in the shape of an annular spacer ring, engages the flange 66 (or flange 66' as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 8</figref>) of the separator element 54 to hold the separator element 54 against the ledge 70 on the side wall 30 when the lid 86 is closed. The separator element hold down mechanism 102 positions the separator element 54 away from the lid 86, and it also includes a plurality of apertures 106 (or 106' as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 8</figref>) or holes which allow the air to flow through the separator hold down mechanism 102 to reach the air exit port 78 (or 78' as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 8</figref>) in the side wall 30 of the separator tank 22. The separator element hold down mechanism according to the present invention may comprise many different shapes and configurations, so long as it functions to position and hold the separator element within the separation chamber, and so long as it allows the air which travels through the separator element to reach the air exit port in the side wall of the separator tank.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">For example, with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref>, the separator element hold down mechanism 102' includes a plurality of bolts 110 which threadably extend through the lid 86' and which engage the flange 66' of the separator element 54 to hold the separator element 54 against the ledge 70 on the side wall 30. Each bolt 110 includes an O-ring seal 114 between itself and the lid 86' to better seal the air space provided between the bottom of the lid 86 and the top 58 of the separator element 54. Air<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> flowing up through the separator element 54 simply changes direction and flows out of the air exit port 78' in the side wall 30 of the separator tank 22.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">As another example, with reference to <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005">FIGS. 6-7</figref>, the separator element hold down mechanism 102" is a generally annular spacer ring 118 having a top ring 122, a bottom ring 126, and a plurality of columns 130 extending between the top 122 and bottom 126 rings, thereby defining a plurality of air passages 134. The spacer ring 118 engages the flange 66' of the separator element 54 to hold the separator element against the ledge 70 on the side wall 30 when the lid 86 is closed. Air flowing up through the separator element 54 passes through the air passages 134 on its way to the air exit port 78'. In an alternative embodiment, the annular spacer ring is a solid cast annular ring having an aperture therethrough to allow the air passing through the separator element to reach the air exit port.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Preferably, ledge 70 on the side wall 30 of the separator tank 22 includes an annular groove 138 for receiving an O-ring seal 142 (see, e.g., <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6</figref>). The O-ring seal 142 is positioned between the flange 66' (or flange 66 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>) of the separator element 54 and the ledge 70 of the side wall 30 to provide an appropriate seal and to accommodate stack-up manufacturing/assembly tolerances in the separator tank assemblies shown in <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004">FIGS. 3-6</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005">8-9.</figref></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As mentioned above and with reference to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 9</figref>, oil mist coalesced by the secondary separator element 54 is drawn inward towards passage 64, runs down inner shell 55 and collects at the bottom 62 of the separator element 54. The coalesced oil is drawn out of the bottom 62 of the separator element 54 by a separator element oil scavenge device 146. The scavenged oil is piped back to the compressor 14 for use by the compressor 14.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 9</figref>, the separator element oil scavenge device 146 includes a scavenge tube or pipe 150. The tube is preferably a metal tube but, may be made of other suitable materials, such as plastic. One end 154 of the tube 150 is located near the bottom 62 of the separator element 54. The tube 150 extends up through the passage 64 of the separator element 54, and along and above the open end 58 of the separator element 54. Although not shown, a support member may extend across the open end 58 of the separator element 54. The tube 150 would then extend through the support member. The tube 150 extends back through the flange 66' of the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> separator element 54. The tube 150 also suitably extends through the spacer ring 118. The tube 150 is preferably tack welded to either or both of the flange 66' and support member (not shown) to locate the end 154 of the tube 150 a predetermined distance from the bottom 62 of the separator element 54. Because the tube 150 is incorporated into the structure of the separator element 54, during assembly of the separator tank 22, no independent adjustment of the scavenge tube 150 is necessary to ensure that the tube 150 is spaced an optimum distance from the bottom 62 of the separator element 54. A channel 158 is provided in the side wall 30 of the separator tank 22. The channel 158 opens through the ledge 70 on the side wall 30 and is adapted to receive a portion of the tube 150. An O-ring seal 162 is placed around end 164 of the tube 150 which extends through the flange 66'. The channel 158 is also adapted to receive the O-ring seal 162 to provide an appropriate seal.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Upon assembly of the separator tank 22, the separator element 54 is placed within the separation chamber 34 such that the end 164 of the tube 150 extending through the flange 66' is received by the channel 158. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 9</figref>, the tube 150 may be used as a handle for placing and removing the separator element 54 into and from the separator tank 22. To replace the separator element 54, the lid 86 is opened and the separator element 54 is removed without having to first disassemble the scavenge device 146. To reinstall a separator element 54 into the separation chamber 34, a separator element 54 and its securely attached scavenge device is simply deposited within the separation chamber 34 as described above. Once the lid 86 is closed, the separator hold down mechanism will hold the separator element in place.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an alternative separator element oil scavenge device 146' which includes a scavenge tube 166, such as a Teflon tube.
