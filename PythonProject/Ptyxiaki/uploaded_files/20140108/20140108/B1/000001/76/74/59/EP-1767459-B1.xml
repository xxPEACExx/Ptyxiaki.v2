The tape includes: a release layer; and a recording medium. The release layer is elongated to extend in a lengthwise direction and has a pair of side edges that extend along the lengthwise direction. The pair of side edges are separate from each other in a widthwise direction that is substantially perpendicular to the lengthwise direction.

The tape printer includes: a feeding device that feeds a tape in a feeding direction; an optical sensor that optically detects the tape while the tape is being fed by the feeding device; and a printing device that performs printing on the tape while the tape is being fed by the feeding device. The tape includes: a release layer and a recording medium. The release layer is elongated to extend in a lengthwise direction and has a pair of side edges that are separate from each other in a widthwise direction that is substantially perpendicular to the lengthwise direction and that extend along the lengthwise direction. The release layer has a first surface and a second surface opposite to the first surface. The entire area of the second surface includes a pair of non-recording regions and a recording region. The pair of non-recording regions extend along both side edges of the second surface. The recording region is located between the pair of non-recording regions. The plurality of sensor marks are formed on the first surface. The sensor marks are arranged in the lengthwise direction. The entire part of each sensor mark is located on the first surface a region that corresponds to the recording region and that is shifted from the pair of non-recording regions. The feeding device feeds the tape while setting the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> lengthwise direction the same as the feeding direction and while allowing the first surface of the release layer to confront the optical sensor. The sensor detects the sensor marks. The recording medium is provided over the recording region of the second surface of the release layer via an adhesive layer. The recording medium is able to be peeled off from the release layer. The feeding device feeds the tape while allowing the recording medium to confront the printing device. The printing device performs printing on the recording medium.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">With this configuration, each sensor mark has a uniform amount of light reflectivity and a uniform amount of light transmittance, and therefore the tape printer can detect each sensor mark accurately.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><heading id="h0004"><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from reading the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in connection with the accompanying drawings in which:

In the sensing bar area 300s, the sensor marks 305 and inter-mark areas 307 are arranged in alternation in the lengthwise direction.

The characters and/or symbols 306 are for identifying the roll sheet 300. More specifically, the characters and/or symbols 306 indicate: the tape type, tape width, and the like of the roll sheet 300. The characters and/or symbols 306 are printed at a location that is apart from the sensor marks 305 by a sufficiently large amount of space (6 mm). This ensures that even though a great amount of ink is used for printing the sensor marks 305, the characters and/or symbols 306 can be printed with sufficiently a high density.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">In this way, the characters and/or symbols 306 are printed on the release paper 302.

In addition, the first and second peel-away areas 303 and 304 are formed on both side edges of the roll sheet 300 in the widthwise direction thereof by peeling off both widthwise edges of the recording paper 301 from the release paper 302 to allow the release paper 302 to be exposed at the both side edges of the roll sheet 300. The sensor marks 305 are printed on the release<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> paper 302 as being entirely shifted from the peel-away areas 303 and 304.

In this example, each sensor mark 345 has the shape of a rectangle with a longer side of 13 mm (lengthwise direction of the roll sheet 340) and a shorter side of 10 mm (widthwise direction of the roll sheet 340). An inter-mark area 347 is defined between each two adjacent sensor marks 345 in the feeding direction F.</p><p id="p0186" num="0186">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0034">Fig. 24(A)</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0035">Fig. 24(B)</figref>, each sensor mark 345 is located at such a position that no part of the sensor mark 345 is located on any parts of the peel-away<!-- EPO <DP n="64"> --> area 343 or 344, but the entire part of the sensor mark 345 is located on a corresponding recording label 341A.
