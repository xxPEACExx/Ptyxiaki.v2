Field of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to organic light emitting displays and more particularly to an emission control line driver for use in an organic light emitting display, the driver capable of being mounted on a panel, of improving display driving speed, and of minimizing display power consumption.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>2. Description of the Related Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Recently, various flat panel displays (FPDs) have been developed, having reduced weight and volume when compared to cathode ray tubes (CRTs).. The FPDs include liquid crystal displays (LCD), field emission displays (FED), plasma display panels (PDP), and organic light emitting displays.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Among the FPDs, the organic light emitting displays display images using organic light emitting diodes (OLED) that generate light as a result of the re-combination of electrons and holes. The organic light emitting display has high response speed and is driven with low power consumption. A common organic light emitting display supplies currents corresponding to data signals to an array of OLEDs using transistors formed in pixel circuits such that light is generated by the OLEDs.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A conventional organic light emitting display includes a data driver for supplying data signals to data lines, a scan driver for sequentially supplying scan signals to scan lines, an emission control line driver for supplying<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> emission control signals to emission control lines, and a pixel array including a plurality of pixels connected to the data lines, the scan lines, and the emission control lines.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The pixels included in the pixel array are selected when the scan signals are supplied to the scan lines and in response, the selected pixels receive the data signals from the data lines. The pixels that received the data signals generate light components of predetermined brightness corresponding to the data signals so as to display images. The emission duration of the pixels is controlled by the emission control signals supplied from the emission control lines.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In general, the emission control signals set the pixels into a non-emitting state during a period when the data signals are supplied to the pixels. Also, the emission control signal supplied to a previous emission control line and the emission control signal supplied to a current emission control line are supplied so as to overlap each other for a certain duration of time.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In addition to increased performance, the typically corresponding increase in display light weight and manufacturing cost is avoided by mounting the device on a panel. However, because the conventional emission control line driver is formed of a PMOS transistor and an NMOS transistor, the conventional emission control line driver cannot be easily mounted on the panel. Also, because the conventional emission control line driver generates an output signal every one or more periods of a clock signal, the conventional emission control line driver cannot be easily driven at high speed. In addition, because a certain static current flows through the conventional emission control line driver formed of the PMOS transistor and the NMOS transistor when the output signals are generated, a large amount of power is consumed in operation of the display.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20050018807A1"><text>US2005/0018807A1</text></patcit> discloses a shift register comprising a plurality of stages connected to each other in a cascade and scan in a bilateral direction.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20050036581A1"><text>US2005/0036581A1</text></patcit> discloses a shift register unit that outputs a shift register signal according to a clock signal, an inverse clock signal and a start signal.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US005633653A"><text>US005633653A</text></patcit> discloses a data driver circuit for an LCD including a switching circuit for transferring a data signal from a data channel to a first data line and a second data line.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US20040164978A1"><text>US2004/0164978A1</text></patcit> discloses a buffer circuit including first to sixth transistors and an active matrix display using the same.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">Accordingly, an emission control line driver capable of being mounted on a panel, of improving driving speed, and of minimizing power consumption is presented.

The emission control line driver 30 supplies the emission control signals so that the pixels 50 do not emit light while the data signals are supplied to the pixels 50 and so that the pixels 50 do emit light otherwise. The emission control line driver 30 supplies the emission control signals so that the emission control signal supplied to a jth (j is a positive integer) the emission control line Ej and the emission control signal supplied to a (j+1)th emission control line Ej+1 at least partially overlap.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> schematically illustrates the emission control line driver illustrated as part of the organic light emitting display of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>;</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the emission control line driver according to some embodiments includes n stages 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, ... configured to<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> supply the emission control signals to the n emission control lines E 1 to En. The stages 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, ... are connected to the emission control lines E and are driven by two clock signals.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In this embodiment, the timing controller 60 supplies four clock signals Clk1, Clklb, Clk2, and Clk2b and a start signal SP to the emission control line driver 30. The first clock signal Clk1 and the inverted first clock signal Clklb are supplied to the odd stages 321, 323, 325, ... and the second clock signal Clk2 and the inverted second clock signal Clk2b are supplied to the even stages 322, 324, .... The start signal SP is supplied to the first stage 321 and the second stage 322. The first clock signal Clk1 and the second clock signal Clk2 have the same period and are supplied so that the high level (or low level) of the first clock signal Clk1 and the high level (or low level) of the second clock signal Clk2 overlap each other by about 1/4 period, and accordingly are about 90 degrees out of phase.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The inverted output of an i th stage 32i (i is a positive integer) is supplied to an (i+2)th stage 32i+2 via an inverter INi. That is, the inverted output of the first stage 321 is supplied to the third stage 323 via the inverter IN1 and the inverted output of the third stage 323 is supplied to the fifth stage 325 via the inverter IN3. That is, each of the odd stages 323, 325, ... receives the inverted output of the previous odd stage. Similarly, the inverted output of the second stage 322 is supplied to the fourth stage 324 via the inverter IN2 and the inverted output of the fourth stage 324 is supplied to the sixth stage via the inverter IN4.

The stages 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, ... are driven by the two clock signals among the four clock signals supplied from the outside. That is, each of the clock signals is supplied to half of the stages in the emission control line driver 30. Accordingly, because the clock signals are supplied to only a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> portion of the stages included in the emission control line driver 30, the load for each clock driving circuit in the timing controller is reduced. For example, the load of the clock signals of this embodiment is reduced to about 1/2 the load for the case in which the clock signals are supplied to all of the stages.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> also shows that the clock inputs of every other odd stage are connected to the first clock signal Clk1 and the inverted first clock signal Clklb in the same arrangement, while clock inputs of the other odd stages are connected to the first clock signal Clkl and the inverted first clock signal Clklb in the opposite arrangement. For example, the first and second clock inputs of the first stage 321 and the fifth stage 325 are each connected to the first clock signal Clk1 and the third clock inputs of the first stage 321 and the fifth stage 325 are each connected to the inverted first clock signal Clklb. However, the first and second clock input of the third stage 323 is connected to the inverted first clock signal Clklb and the third clock input of the third stage 323 is connected to the first clock signal Clkl.
