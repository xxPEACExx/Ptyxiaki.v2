This process cartridge is provided with an electrophotographic photosensitive member, and a processing means which acts on the electrophotographic photosensitive member. As the processing means, there are, for example, a charging means for charging the peripheral<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member, a developing means for developing an electrostatic latent image formed on the electrophotographic photosensitive member, a cleaning means for removing the toner remaining on the peripheral surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the process cartridge 15 in this embodiment comprises: an electrophotographic photosensitive member 11 (hereinafter, "electrophotographic photosensitive drum") in the form of a drum; a charge roller 12 as a charging member; a developing apparatus comprising a development roller 18 as a developing member, and a development blade 26; a cleaning blade 14 as a cleaning member; and a housing in which the preceding components are integrally disposed.

In synchronism with the conveyance of this sheet S, the photosensitive drum 11 is exposed by an exposing apparatus 8 according to the image data. As a result, an electrostatic latent image is formed on the photosensitive drum 11. Thereafter, the developer (hereinafter, "toner") stored in a toner storage container 16 is triboelectrically charged by a development blade 26, and this developer is borne on the peripheral surface of the development roller 18. Then, as development bias is applied to the development roller 18 as a developing member, the toner is supplied to the photosensitive drum 11. As a result, an image formed of toner (hereinafter, "toner image") is formed on the photosensitive drum 11, correspondent to the electrostatic latent image. Next, this toner image is transferred onto the sheet S, as recording medium, by applying bias (voltage) to a transfer roller 9. Then, the sheet S is conveyed to a fixing apparatus 10, in which the toner image is fixed. Next, the sheet S is discharged by a discharge roller 1 into a delivery portion 2 provided on the top side of the apparatus. Meanwhile, the toner which remained on the photosensitive drum 11 after the image transfer is removed by a cleaning blade 14 as a cleaning member. The removed toner is moved rearward<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> of a removed toner storage bin 5 by a removed toner conveying member 115. It should be noted here that prior to the above described photosensitive drum exposure, the photosensitive drum 111 is charged by a charge roller as a charging member.</p><heading id="h0005">(Structure of Process Cartridge Frame)</heading><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref> are perspective views which show the structure of the process cartridge frame. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> shows the process cartridge frame prior to its assembly, and <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> shows the process cartridge after its assembly.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The process cartridge 15 comprises three pieces of frames: a cleaning means frame 13 as a drum frame which integrally supports the photosensitive drum 11, charge roller 12, and cleaning blade 14; a developing means frame 17 which integrally supports the development roller 18, and development blade (unillustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, and designated by a referential code 26 in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>); and a toner storage frame 16 provided with a toner storage portion 16d in which toner is stored. Further, the process cartridge 15 in this embodiment comprises a pair of side covers 19 and 20 which are fixed to the longitudinal ends of the cleaning means frame 13 and toner storage frame 16 to hold the frames 13 and 16 together. The development means frame 17 is supported by the cleaning means frame 13.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">To the cleaning means frame 13, the cleaning blade 14 is fixed with the use of small screws.

Referring again to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, in the cleaning means frame 13, the removed toner conveying member 115 for conveying the toner removed by the cleaning blade 14, into the removed toner bin 5, is rotatably disposed. In addition, in the cleaning means frame 13, the photosensitive drum 11 is rotatably supported, with the flange portions, that is, the longitudinal end portions, of the photosensitive drum 11, supported by a pair of bearings 22a and 22b. The toner storage frame 16 stores toner therein, and comprises a pair of toner conveying members 113 and 114 (<figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>) for conveying the stored toner toward the development roller 18. These toner conveying members may be provided with a toner stirring function.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The detailed description of the development means frame 17 will be given later.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The aforementioned side covers 19 and 20 are large enough to match in size the primary cross section (cross section at a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the photosensitive drum 11) of the process cartridge 15. They are positioned at the longitudinal ends of the process cartridge 15 (end portion in terms of the longitudinal direction of the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> photosensitive drum 11), one for one, covering, and being fixed to, both the cleaning means frame 13 and toner storage frame 16. With this arrangement, the side covers 19 and 20 integrally hold together the cleaning means frame 13 and toner storage frame 16. The holes 19a and 20a with which the side covers 19 and 20 are provided, respectively, are aligned with the rotational axis of the photosensitive drum 11 in the cleaning means frame 13. In the hole 13a of the side cover 19, that is, the side cover illustrated on the front side of the drawing, with which cleaning means frame 13 is provided, the bearing 22a is press fitted. Also, a shaft 25 is put through the hole 19a of the side cover 19, bearing 22a, and the center hole 11a1 of the flange 11a, to rotatably support one of the longitudinal ends of the photosensitive drum 11 by the cleaning means frame 13. With this arrangement, the side cover 19 is precisely positioned by the bearing 22a, improving the accuracy in terms of the positional relationship of the side cover 19 with respect to the photosensitive drum 11. Further, a positioning member 19b, with which the side cover 19 is provided, and which is located so that its position becomes as far away as possible from the photosensitive drum 11 after the attachment of the side cover 19, is engaged with a positioning portion 13b with which the side wall 13c of the cleaning means<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> frame 13 is provided. As a result, the position of the side cover 19, in terms of the rotational direction of the side cover 19 with respect to the center, or the axial line, of the photosensitive drum 11, is fixed. Then, the side cover 19 is fixed to the side wall 13c, that is, the wall at the longitudinal end, of the cleaning means frame 13. The toner storage frame 16 is provided with a pair of cylindrical positioning portions 16a and 16b, which project from one of the side walls 16d, that is, the wall at the longitudinal end, of the toner storage frame 16, in the longitudinal direction of the toner storage frame 16. These positioning portions 16a and 16b are fitted in the positioning portion 19c and 19d, that is, holes, respectively, with which the side cover 19 is provided, accurately positioning the toner storage frame 16 relative to the side cover 19. Then, the toner storage frame 16 and side cover 19 are fixed to each other. The other wide cover 20 is similarly fixed to the toner storage frame 16 and cleaning means frame 13, being accurately positioned relative to each other. The developing means frame 17 is positioned using a method which will be described later. The bearings 22 (22a and 22b) double as members for positioning the process cartridge 15 relative to the apparatus main assembly 27.</p><heading id="h0006">(Joining of Toner Storage Frame and Developing Means<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> Frame)</heading><p id="p0032" num="0032">In order to supply toner from the toner storage frame 16 to development roller 18, the toner storage frame 16 and development means frame 17 are provided with opening 16c (<figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>) and <figref idrefs="f0016">17a</figref>.

As described above, the position of the toner storage frame 16 is fixed relative to the side covers 19 and 20, whereas the position of the development means frame 17 is fixed relative to the cleaning means frame 13. Therefore, the frames 16 and 17 are attached to each other in a manner to allow them to pivot relative to each other to absorb the dimensional errors of the two frames. When installed into the apparatus main assembly 17, the position of the process cartridge 15 is fixed relative to the cartridge installation space of the apparatus main assembly 27, by the cleaning means frame 13 which supports the photosensitive drum 11. The toner storage frame 16 is substantially different in weight between the beginning of its usage when it contains toner, and the end of its usage when it is empty. Therefore, flexible material is used as the<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> material for the sealing member 21. With this setup, even if a deformation occurs to the toner storage frame 16, or one or both of the side covers 19 and 20, the deformation can be absorbed.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0017">Figure 18</figref> is a vertical sectional view of a process cartridge equipped with a flexible sealing member different from the above described sealing member 21.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">A sealing member 60 as a flexible sealing means is formed of elastic material such as foamed synthetic resin (for example, foamed urethane), rubber with a low degree of hardness, silicon rubber, or the like.

Therefore, even if the load which applies to the toner conveying system and toner stirring system increases due to he increase in the toner storage container capacity, it is unnecessary to increase the strength of the gears 105b and 107b for driving the development roller 18. Therefore, it is possible to use low module gears for driving force transmission. With this arrangement, it does not occur that an image suffering from the aforementioned<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> irregularities is produced due to the irregularity in the pitch which occurs as the drum gear 105b and sleeve gear 107b mesh with each other.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">Further, in this embodiment the cleaning means frame and toner storage frame are integrally fixed to each other by the side covers.

Within the cleaning means frame 13, the conveying member 115 for conveying the recovered removed toner toward the rear of the removed toner bin 5 is disposed. When the structural arrangement of the process cartridge 15 is such that the conveying member 115 receives the driving force from photosensitive drum 11, the rotational velocity must be reduced by a large ratio. However, if the arrangement is such that the driving force is transmitted from the toner conveying member 114, the velocity reduction by a large ratio is unnecessary. Therefore, it is easy to attain a proper rotational velocity. In this case, the gears 111b and 111c are disposed in the adjacencies of the photosensitive drum 11, penetrating the toner storage frame 16 and developing means frame 17 (<figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 8, (a)</figref>).</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">In this embodiment, in order to prevent the temperature increase in the adjacencies of the photosensitive drum, it is assured that an air passage 19f is secured in the side cover 16, in the adjacencies of the photosensitive drum (<figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 8, (b)</figref>).

The gear 111c is rotationally supported by a shaft 19G which extends inward from the inwardly facing surface of the side cover 19, perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the photosensitive drum 15; the shaft 19G is put through the center hole of the hub 111c1. The end portion of the shaft 19G is fitted with a retainer ring (unillustrated) to prevent the gear 111c from moving in the shaft direction. The outwardly facing surface 111c4 of the rim portion 111c2 is very close to the inwardly facing surface 19h of the side cover 19. The inwardly facing surface 19h of the side cover 19, and the outwardly facing surface 111c4 of the rim portion, are required to make the amount of the air flow between them as small as possible.

In a case that the teeth 24e and vanes 24g of the gear 111c are constructed so that they become the same in terms of in which direction they send air in terms of the axial direction of the gear 111c, a gap for allowing the air to pass is provided between the outwardly facing surface of the rim 111c2 and the inwardly facing surface of the side cover 119.

The method used to fix these connective portions 120a and 120b to the surfaces 116d and 117c<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> is thermal welding, or gluing. It is also possible to clasp the connective portions 120a and 120b with the use of clasping members (unillustrated), for example, a wear plate, and screw the clasping members to the surfaces 116d and 117c.</p><p id="p0105" num="0105">The flexible member 120 is uniform in terms of the shape of the cross section perpendicular to the surfaces 120a and 120b.

Further, the inward sheath portion 120d and outward sheath portion 120c overlap each other in terms of the direction parallel to the planes of the openings 116d and 117c. In other words, the flexible member 120 has two folds k. With the provision of this structural arrangement, even if the distance between the mutually facing surfaces 116d and 117c varies, or the surfaces 116d and 117c become displaced relative to each other in the direction parallel to their planes, or the surfaces 116d and 117c become nonparallel to each other, or the preceding displacements occur in combination, the flexible member 120 bends like a bellows, absorbing the displacements to keep sealed the passage between the openings 116c and 117d. Further, since the flexible member 120 is in the form<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --> of a bellows, it is very small in the resistance it generates as one or a plurality of the aforementioned displacements occur.

The flexible member 120 is capable of dealing with this type of a situation. This type of deformation changes as the amount of the toner within the frame 116 reduces. As a result, the positional relationship between the opposing surfaces 116d and 117c also changes.

When the process cartridge 115 is installed into the apparatus main assembly 27, the position of the process cartridge 15 relative to the apparatus main assembly 27 is fixed as these cylindrical projections engage with the positioning portions (unillustrated) of the apparatus main assembly 27. Since the frame 116 is relatively large, and the distance from the center of the photosensitive drum 111 to the center of gravity of the frame 116 is relatively large, a large amount of moment is generated in the direction to rotate the process cartridge 115 about the rotational axis of the photosensitive drum 111 in the clockwise direction.
