The first protrusion patterns 120 and the second protrusion patterns 130 are formed on an upper surface of the base plate 110.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The base plate 110 has a predetermined thickness. The base plate 110 includes a transparent material through which light generated by lamps 200 progresses. The lamps 200 are disposed adjacent to a first side of the base plate 110 and a second side of the base plate 110 opposite the first side. Examples of the transparent material include polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), etc. The base plate 110 may include a light diffuser diffusing the light progressing through the base plate 110.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The first protrusion patterns 120 are formed on a left portion of the base plate 110 with respect to a central line CL of the base plate 110. The first protrusion patterns 120 extend substantially parallel to one another in a first direction. The first direction may be, for example, a direction different from a longitudinal direction of the lamps 200, a direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the lamps 200, a direction substantially parallel with the longitudinal direction of the lamps 200, etc.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The first protrusion patterns 120 each have a cross-section of a trapezoidal shape as viewed in an extending direction. For example, as a<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> distance from the upper surface of the base plate 110 increases, a width of the cross-section of each first protrusion pattern 120 decreases. Each of the first protrusion patterns 120 includes an inclined surface which is inclined toward the central line CL in order to perpendicularly emit the light to the upper surface of the base plate 110.

When each of the third protrusion patterns 140 is viewed in the second direction, each of the third protrusion patterns 140 may have a cross-section<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> of a substantially equilateral triangle shape. For example, the third protrusion patterns 140 may be extended in a direction substantially perpendicular to a direction in which the first and second protrusion patterns 120 and 130 are extended and substantially parallel with the longitudinal direction of the lamps 200.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The first, second and third protrusion patterns 120, 130 and 140, and the base plate 110 may be formed using the same material.
