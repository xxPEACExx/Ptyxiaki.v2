load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><heading id="h0002">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">One or more aspects of the invention relate to an instant lettering tape.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Generally, lettering is carried out by pressing a transfer image such as characters and graphic symbols and the like, formed onto a ready-made transfer sheet (including transfer material) on a receiving surface of a random transfer body and then peeling off the transfer sheet to transfer the image. The transfer sheet which allows for such an easy lettering operation is also known as instant lettering sheet. Various arts employing this type of transfer sheet have been conventionally proposed.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Apart from these, arts are also known in which an ink ribbon for producing a dry transfer material is used in a thermo-sensitive-type printer, type writer, word processor and the like and enables transfer and printing even to a surface with poor wettability and strong releasing property. With this ink ribbon, a transfer image obtained by thermal transfer to a transfer body<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> (transfer sheet) is effectively retransferred onto a second transfer body which is the target of the transfer by applying pressure thereto.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Arts using a heat seal label which exhibits self-adhesive properties when heated include a technique that uses a belt-like heat seal label having a printing surface and an adhesive surface provided at the opposite side of the printing surface and having adhesive fixed thereon. According to these arts, after printing is performed onto a printing surface using an ink jet-type print method, the adhesive of the heat seal label is fused to an adhesive state and the ink printed onto the heat seal label is dried simultaneously.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">According to the above-described background arts, any user can use existing devices such as a thermal transfer printer or the like and moreover, the above-described ink ribbon for producing a dry transfer material to produce a desired tape or sheet, of their choice, for use in instant lettering, which thus allows for a high degree of freedom. However, with this tape/sheet for instant lettering, the image formed on the ink layer of the ink ribbon is transferred to the first transfer body (transfer sheet), and then, the image of the ink layer, including a coloring agent, a binding agent and a adhesive is simply transferred to the target second transfer body, by applying pressure to the image by use of a transfer tool. Here, although the ink layer contains adhesive, basically, it does not have an adhesive layer, which means that it has weak adherence. When a user transfers an image of the ink layer in a first transfer body (transfer sheet) by applying pressure to this image using a transfer tool, or the like, the application of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> pressure differs depending on each user. Thus, depending on the user, the image of the ink layer in the first transfer body (transfer sheet) is not always entirely transferred, which results in a transfer having so-called transfer flecks where minute omissions occur partially. Also, since even the same user cannot possibly always apply the same pressure to the image of the ink layer in the first transfer body (transfer sheet), a problem occurs that a transfer fleck-free transfer cannot always be obtained.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Also, the technique of the above-described heat seal label does not include the concept of producing a tape or sheet for instant lettering.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Here, if the user can not identify the contents to be printed on the lettering tape before transferring the lettering tape, transfer of unexpected wrong lettering tape may be occurred. Also, if the contents to be printed are printed on the release sheet or the like, new process in which the contents to be printed is the release sheet is required.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Also, although the user can identify the contents to be printed on the lettering tape, if the user can not identify the color to be printed on the lettering tape before transferring the lettering tape, transfer of wrong lettering tape may be occurred.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Also, when a printing operation is conducted onto a lettering sheet having an adhesive layer, the adhesive may overflow the sheet end and the adhesive may be transferred (adhered) to a head or a platen. In addition, when conducting a printing operation using an ink ribbon, the ink of the ink ribbon may be adhered to a head or a platen.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">From <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO9832594A1"><text>WO 98/32594 A1</text></patcit> a lettering tape according to the preamble of claim 1 can be taken. In particular, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO9832594A1"><text>WO 98/32594 A1</text></patcit> discloses a thermal transfer foil, which includes a carrier film and several layers including a thermally-activatable release coating, a lacquer layer adhered to the release coating, a specular matter layer adhered to the lacquer hayer, and a thermally activatable adhesive layer. The adhesive layer expends on the heat and pressure to fill voids in a substrate during thermal transfer of the lacquer, matter adhesively. Thereby enabling the matter layer to retains substantially its specular property after transfer. The thermal transfer foil is used to transfer and imaged to a raff substrate by delivering a selected amount of heat and pressure to a petten of pixels that form the image. This heat and pressure delivered to the foil thermally activates the relieves coating and the adhesive layer and courses expansion of the adhesive layer. The expansion, in turn, fills voids in the substrate while the matter layer substantially retains its specular property after the thermal transfer of the image.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">From <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5269865A"><text>US 5,269,865</text></patcit> a "self-correctable" thermal transfer material and a thermal transfer recording method using the transfer material are known.

A recorded image formed by the above-mentioned transfer material can be removed through lift of correction, by coursing the transfer material to adhere to recorded image under heating, and separating the transfer material from the recording medium without coursing separation of second ink layer.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP1462267A1"><text>EP 1 462 267 A1</text></patcit> discloses a tape printing apparatus which uses a tape cassette having two guide holes, the tape printing apparatus has a tape cassette holder including at least first and second guide members; the first guide member having a height that is shorter then a height of the second guide member; such that the second guide member is inserted into a second guide hole on the tape cassette before the first guide member is inserted into a first guide hole of the tape cassette.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">One of more aspects of the invention has been made in view of the above circumstances and has an object to overcome the above problems by providing an instant lettering tape that has a tape which is formed by sequentially stacking a base layer, an ink layer and a adhesive layer that exhibits self-adhesive properties when heated once, wherein a dedicated adhesive layer is exposed at a surface thereof at the time of transfer. The tape is heated to form an image on the ink layer and is stuck to the target transfer body after the adhesive layer becomes sticky. Then, the tape is removed. This self-adhesive property exhibited by the adhesive layer when heated enables any user to perform transfer fleck-free transfer at any time.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Also, one or more aspects of the invention has an object to provide instant lettering tape in which the user can identify the contents and/or the color to be printed on the lettering tape before transferring the lettering tape.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Also, one or more aspects of the invention have an object provide an instant lettering tape capable of preventing the adhesive of a lettering tape or the ink of an ink ribbon from adhering to a thermal head or a platen can be prevented.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">To achieve the above object, according to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a lettering tape (10) according to claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the above lettering tape, there is provided a lettering tape having an integrated layered configuration in which a base layer, an ink layer and a adhesive layer exhibiting self-adhesive properties when heated once are sequentially stacked, so that when this lettering tape is selectively heated by a heat generating body to form an image thereon, a heated portion of the ink layer onto which the image is formed is adhered to the heated portion of the adhesive layer, and simultaneously, the heated portion of the adhesive layer exhibits self-adhesive properties, thereby converting the lettering tape itself into a lettering tape enabling transfer to the target transfer body.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Accordingly, a desired lettering tape can be obtained by simply heating this lettering tape directly by means of the heat generating body. Thus, since it is no longer necessary to transfer the image formed by the ink layer of a different ink ribbon to the transfer sheet and then perform a second stage transfer of transferring the image to the target transfer body, as was done conventionally, handling of the lettering tape becomes easy. Also, since the second stage transfer is no longer required, the transfer quality can be improved.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to a second aspect of the invention, there is also provided a tape cassette (26) according to claim 7.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the above tape cassette, the tape cassette houses the roll of the lettering tape in a cassette case.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Accordingly, the tape cassette can be set to a print enable state by a simple operation of mounting the tape cassette in the cassette mounting part of the printer. Also, loading the roll of the lettering tape in the tape cassette in advance for provision to users can prevent incorrect setting of the lettering tape in the printer by the user that may mistake the front and back surface of the tape.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to a third aspect of the invention, there is also provided a tape printer (1) according to claim 9.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the above tape printer, a tape cassette including a lettering tape is detachable. Here, the lettering tape includes a base layer, an ink layer, and an adhesive layer exhibiting self-adhesive properties when heated, the base layer, the ink layer, and the adhesive layer being sequentially stacked. Also, a side<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> of the base layer in the lettering tape abuts on the thermal head when the tape cassette is mounted in the tape printer. When the lettering tape is selectively heated by the thermal head, a heated portion of the ink layer is adhered to a heated portion of the adhesive layer.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Accordingly, a desired lettering tape can be obtained by simply heating this lettering tape directly by means of the heat generating body. Thus, since it is no longer necessary to transfer the image formed by the ink layer of a different ink ribbon to the transfer sheet and then perform a second stage transfer of transferring the image to the target transfer body, as was done conventionally, handling of the lettering tape becomes easy.

As described in the above text, the lettering tape 10 has a layered configuration in which a base layer 58, an ink layer 59, an adhesive layer 60 and a release paper 61 are sequentially stacked. Since the adhesive layer 60 contains an adhesive that exhibits self-adhesive properties when heated once and maintains its self-adhesive properties after a drop in temperature as well, the<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> adhesive layer does not exhibit self-adhesive properties if not heated. This helps prevent the adverse effects caused by accidental adherence of the lettering tape 10 to various places, and helps make handling thereof easier.

The base layer 58 of the lettering tape 10 abuts on the thermal head 30 and the release sheet 61 abuts on the platen roller 33. By bringing the base layer 58 of the lettering tape 10 into contact with the thermal head 30, the ink layer 59 and the adhesive layer 60 are selectively heated without the danger of the adhesive exhibiting self-adhesive properties adhering to the thermal head 30. Also, by using a polyester film or the like with high heat resistance properties, slippage of the tape with respect to the thermal head 30 is improved, thereby reducing the load to the tape conveying pulse motor 41.

Up to here, the release sheet 61 has the role of preventing the lettering tape 10 exhibiting self-adhesive properties at the heated portion 69 of the adhesive layer 60 from adhering to and being caught in the platen roller 33, as described in the above text.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Next, at a right upper stage of <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref> is shown a completed lettering tape 10 obtained by subjecting the lettering tape 19 in the state shown at the left middle stage in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref> to an operation of inserting black spaces after printing has finished, then operating the tape cutter lever 22 to cut the lettering tape 10 by cutters 71 and 71 coupled to the tape cut lever 22 provided downstream the tape cassette 26. In the completed lettering tape 10, exposure of the adhesive is prevented by coating the adhesive layer 60 with the release sheet 61, thereby eliminating the need for immediate transfer to the target transfer body to protect the tape against foreign bodies and the like. Also, the release sheet may be peeled right before transfer, thereby enabling longer storage of the tape.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Next, the right middle stage of <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref> shows the state in which the release sheet 61 has been peeled off from the completed lettering tape 10 and the lettering tape 10 is adhered to the target transfer body 70. Since the heated portion 68 of the ink layer 59 is adhered to the heated portion 69 of the adhesive layer 60 only at a desired heated print portion in the ink layer 59 and the adhesive layer 60, and simultaneously, the heated portion 69 of the adhesive layer 60 exhibits self-adhesive properties, there is no need to rub the lettering tape while applying pressure from the back, as was done with the conventional lettering tape. The<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> surface of the release sheet 61 at the side contacting the adhesive layer 60 is subjected to treatment by a stripping agent to enable smooth peeling thereof from the heated portion 69 of the adhesive layer 60 exhibiting self-adhesive properties. Although the release sheet 61 is adhered in such a way as to prevent displacement thereof at the time of running the tape even in the state that electrostatic treatment is carried out with respect to the release sheet 61 and the adhesive layer 60 exhibits no self-adhesive properties, it can be smoothly peeled off by hand after printing.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Next, at the right lower stage in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref> is shown a state in which the lettering tape 10 in the state shown in the right middle stage of <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref> is peeled off.

Thus, transferring of an image formed on the ink layer of the ink ribbon to a first transfer body (transfer sheet), and then performing a second stage transfer of transferring the image to a target second transfer body, as was done conventionally, are omitted, and the lettering tape 10 itself that cannot be transferred as is, is converted to lettering tape 10 that can be<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> transferred through selective heating by the thermal head 30, without adding any extra components, whereby the transfer is made easy and the transfer quality is improved.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Here, in the configuration of the above-described <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref>, the adhesive layer 60 is protected by a release sheet 61.

Since the portions where a color was developed are identical with the transferred portions, the user can identify the contents to be printed by looking at the thermo-sensitive color fixing layer 73.

In this case, the overflow of the adhesive or the ink can be prevented, and the adherence of the overflowed adhesive or ink to the platen roller 33 can be prevented even if the adhesive or the ink overflows.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">As described in detail in the above text, according to the lettering tape 10 and the printer 1 in the present embodiment, a lettering tape 10 is formed comprising a base layer 58, an ink layer 59 and a adhesive layer 60 exhibiting self-adhesive properties when heated once, which are sequentially stacked into an integrated layered configuration. When this lettering tape 10 is selectively heated by the thermal head 30 to form an image, the heated portion 68 of the ink layer 59 onto which an image is formed is adhered to the heated portion 69 of the adhesive layer 60 and simultaneously, the heated portion 69 of the adhesive layer 60 exhibits self-adhesive properties, thereby converting the lettering tape 10 itself into the lettering tape 10 which enables transfer to the target transfer body 70. As a result, since a desired lettering tape can be obtained simply by heating the lettering tape 10 directly by a heat generating body, it is no longer necessary to transfer an image formed on the ink layer of a<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> different ink ribbon to a transfer sheet, and then, carry out a second stage transfer of transferring the image to the target transfer body, thereby making handling of the lettering tape 10 easier. Also, since the second stage transfer is no longer necessary, the transfer quality can be improved.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Since the adhesive layer 60 exhibits self-adhesive properties when heated but exhibits no self-adhesive properties in a normal state when it is not heated, handling of the lettering tape 10 is made easier in terms of "preventing adherence of foreign bodies to the lettering tape 10", "preventing accidental adherence of the lettering tape 10 to various places" and the like. Further, since the adhesive layer 60 exhibits self-adhesive properties only at the heated portions, but does not exhibit self-adhesive properties at portions that are not heated, the boundary of the portions exhibiting self-adhesive properties can be clearly determined so as to allow transfer of only portions exhibiting self-adhesive properties to the target transfer body 70.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Since the heated portion 68 of the ink layer 59 and the heated portion 69 of the adhesive layer 60 are adhered only at the desired print portions that were heated and simultaneously, the adhesive layer 60 exhibits self-adhesive properties, the heated portion 68 of the ink layer 59 can be easily transferred to the target transfer body 70 by a simple operation of peeling off the lettering tape 10 after it has been adhered to the target transfer body 70, without applying pressure and rubbing from the side of the base layer 58. As a result, any user can easily perform lettering, without any individual differences.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Also, since lateral sizes of the adhesive layer and/or the ink<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> layer is/are smaller than the lateral size of the lettering tape, the overflow of the adhesive and/or the ink from the lettering tape can be prevented. Also, since lateral sized o the thermal head and/or the platen roller is/are smaller than the lateral size of the lettering tape, the adherence of the adhesive and/or the ink to the thermal head and/or the platen roller although the adhesive and/or the ink overflow from the lettering tape.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">Since the lettering tape 10 is provided with a release sheet 61 at the side of the adhesive layer 60, the lettering tape 10 is easily handled without any adhesive being exposed at the surface of the lettering tape 10 even if the adhesive layer 60 exhibits slight self-adhesive properties. Thus, it is possible to prevent malfunctions in the printer 1 caused by the lettering tape 10 adhering to and getting caught in the platen roller 3 provided in the printer 1 and having a tape feed function, when the adhesive layer 60 exhibits self-adhesive properties when selectively heated by the thermal head 30. Since it is not necessary to consider the compatibility of the adhesive with respect to the material of the platen roller 33, the selection range of the material for the platen roller 33 can be expanded. Further, since the adhesive is not exposed, there is no need to immediately transfer the tape onto the target transfer body 70 to protect the tape against foreign bodies, and the release sheet 60 may be peeled right before transfer, thereby enabling storage of the tape as necessary.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">Since the lettering tape 10 is wound into a roll tape, folding and bending, and scratching of the lettering tape 10 can be prevented from occurring when the lettering tape 10 is mounted in the printer 1. Thus, since the lettering tape 10 to be<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> mounted is wound into roll 63, the mounting area can be minimized even in the case of mounting in the cassette case 52, and at the same time, mounting in the cassette case 52 can be made easier.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">Since the tape cassette 26 houses the roll 63 of the lettering tape 10 in a cassette case 52, the tape cassette 26 (lettering tape 10) can be set to a print enable state by a simple operation of mounting the tape cassette 26 in the cassette mounting part 27 of the printer 1. It is thus possible to do without complicated operations such as routing the lettering tape 10 to bring it in a print enable state with respect to the printer 1, in the case of the lettering tape 10 only. Loading the roll 63 of the lettering tape 10 in the tape cassette 26 in advance for provision to users can prevent incorrect setting of the lettering tape 10 in the printer 1 by the user that may mistake the front and back surface of the tape.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">Since in the cassette mounting part 27 of the printer 1 in which the tape cassette 26 is detachably mounted and which also comprises a thermal head 30 and a platen roller 33, the print position of the lettering tape 10 is clamped between the thermal head 30 and the platen roller 33, and simultaneously, the side of the base layer 58 in the lettering tape 10 abuts on the thermal head 30, the ink layer 59 and the adhesive layer 60 can be selectively heated without the adhesive adhering to the thermal head 30. At the same time, the use of a polyester film and the like having high heat resistance properties can improve slippage of the tape with respect to the thermal head 30 and can help reduce the load with respect to the tape conveying pulse motor 41<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> that drives the platen roller 33.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">A printer 1 clamps a lettering tape 10 having a layered configuration in which a base layer 58, an ink layer 59 and a adhesive layer 60 exhibiting self-adhesive properties when heated once are sequentially stacked, at a print position of the lettering tape 10 by means of a thermal head 30 and a platen roller 33 provided in the cassette mounting part 27, and brings the thermal head 30 into contact with the side of the base layer 58 of the lettering tape 10 to selectively heat the ink layer 59 and the adhesive layer 60 of the lettering tape 10 through the base layer 58 by means of the thermal head, whereby the heated portion 68 of the ink layer 59 is adhered to the heated portion 69 of the adhesive layer 60 in the lettering tape 10. By causing the heated portion 69 of the adhesive layer 60 to exhibit self-adhesive properties, the lettering tape 10 can be converted to a lettering tape 10 that can be transferred to the target transfer body 70. As a result; in the printer 1, transfer of the image formed on the ink layer of a different ink ribbon to the transfer sheet followed by a second stage transfer of transferring the image to the target transfer body, as was done conventionally, are no longer required. This makes handling of the printer 1 easier and makes it possible to produce a lettering tape 10 with an improved transfer quality.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">Since the adhesive layer 60 of the lettering tape 10 in printer 1 exhibits self-adhesive properties when selectively heated by the thermal head 30 but has no self-adhesive properties in a normal state when not heated, adherence of foreign bodies thereto and accidental sticking thereof to various places can be prevented, thereby making handling of the lettering tape easier.<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> Further, since the adhesive layer 60 exhibits self-adhesive properties only at portions thereof which are selectively heated by the thermal head 30, but exhibits no self-adhesive properties at portions that are not heated, it is possible to produce a lettering tape 10 in which boundaries of portions exhibiting self-adhesive properties are clearly identified and only portions thereof which exhibit self-adhesive properties can be transferred to the target transfer body 70.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">Since in the printer 1, the heated portion 68 of the ink layer 59 is adhered to the heated portion 69 of the adhesive layer 60 only at print portions thereof that are selectively heated by the thermal head 30 and simultaneously, the adhesive layer 60, from amongst the ink layer 59 and the adhesive layer 60 of the lettering tape 10, exhibits adhesive properties, it is possible to produce a lettering tape 10 in which heated portions of the ink layer can be easily transferred to the target transfer body simply by removing the lettering tape after passing to the target transfer body 70, without the need to apply pressure and rub from the side of the base layer 58.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Then, since the printer 1 is provided with cutters 71 and 71 downstream the tape discharging part 67 of the tape cassette 26 in a tape conveying direction for cutting the lettering tape 10, the post-print lettering tape 10 does not have to be cut by scissors or the like, thereby making it possible to reduce the length of the lettering tape from the print position at least one end in the longitudinal direction of the tape.
