Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a medical apparatus including plural cooling fans, and, more particularly to a medical apparatus used together with an ultrasound endoscope.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In recent years, an ultrasound diagnostic method for irradiating ultrasound into a body cavity and imaging a state in a body from an echo signal of the ultrasound to perform diagnosis is wide spread. Examples of a medical apparatus used for such an ultrasound diagnostic method include an ultrasound echo apparatus that can image a state in a body from a body surface and an ultrasound endoscope that includes an ultrasound vibrating unit for transmitting and receiving an ultrasound at a distal end portion thereof and can be inserted in a body cavity to image a state in a body.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The ultrasound endoscope is connected to an ultrasound observation apparatus that is a medical apparatus for imaging an echo signal. The ultrasound observation apparatus outputs an electric signal for causing a monitor connected thereto to display an ultrasound image in the body cavity received by the ultrasound endoscope.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In such an ultrasound observation apparatus, as is well known, plural electronic components, a CPU, and the like are built in an armor housing of a box shape. When driven by electric power received from the outside, the electronic components, the CPU, and the like are changed to heat elements and heated by wiring resistance, driving resistance, and the like due to the electric power. Therefore, cooling fans are provided in not only the ultrasound observation apparatus but also a large number of electronic apparatuses.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For such electronic apparatuses including the cooling fans, various proposals have been made in order to improve cooling efficiency. For example, Japanese<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2006156871A"><text>2006-156871</text></patcit> discloses a technique for controlling, in a cooling apparatus in a locker-type housing, interference of cooling fans provided in plural units and efficiently cooling the units.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, the technique for the cooling apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2006156871A"><text>2006-156871</text></patcit> is a technique for improving cooling efficiency in a state in which the plural units are superimposed rather than cooling efficiency of a single unit. In one unit, plural heating elements such as electronic components are arrayed in a limited space. Therefore, optimum cooling cannot be performed depending on arrangement positions of the heating elements.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Document <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2001340337A"><text>JP 2001 340337</text></patcit> discloses ultrasound medical apparatus having a box body separated by a bulk head and cooling fans provided on front and rear surfaces.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5707401A"><text>US 5,707,401</text></patcit> discloses a medical apparatus having a plurality of cooling fans for cooling an interior of the medical apparatus. A plurality of the cooling fans are arranged in parallel on a first side of the device, and air inlets are arranged on sides of the device adjacent to the first side. Air is drawn by the fans through the air inlets and into the apparatus, and is further exhausted by the fans through air outlets disposed in the vicinity of the fans. A further fan may be disposed in the vicinity of a light source, and may draw air specifically through the light source to be exhausted in the same direction as the air exhausted by the plurality of cooling fans arranged on the first side of the device.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US5402312A"><text>US 5,402,312</text></patcit> discloses a mechanism to cool different parts of an apparatus using different air cooling streams which are separated from each other and which differ from each other with regard to their flow direction. That is, an airflow used to cool chips is used which is different form an airflow used to cool a memory board located below and separated from the chips.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Moreover, in a medical spot, positions of medical apparatuses arranged in an operating room may be restricted in relation to a condition of positions of use in terms of distances to a patient and a surgeon in a limited operating room space. Under such a condition of use of the medical apparatuses, a smaller exhaust volume from the cooling fans is better. The cooling fans have to be arranged to prevent an exhaust direction from the cooling fans from being directed to the patient and the surgeon as much as possible.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention has been devised in view of the circumstances described above and it is an object of the present invention to realize a medical apparatus in<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> which cooling efficiency is improved and that reduces an unpleasant feeling given to a patient and a surgeon because of exhaust from cooling fans.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><p id="p0012" num="0012">A medical apparatus according to claim 1 is provided.
