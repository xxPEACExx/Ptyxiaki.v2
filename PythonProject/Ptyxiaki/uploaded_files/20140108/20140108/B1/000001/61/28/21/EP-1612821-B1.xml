load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a switch configuration for key-entry operation and, more particularly, to a key-entry switch device (hereinafter referred to as a key switch) preferably used for a keyboard incorporated, as an input device, in electronic equipment. The present invention also relates to a keyboard provided with a plurality of key switches. The present invention further relates to an assembling jig usable for assembling a key switch.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In a thinner or low-profile-type keyboard for a portable electronic apparatus, such as a notebook or palm-top personal computer, it is required to reduce the height of a key switch for a key-entry operation as well as to improve the operability of the key switch. The key switch usable in the low-profile keyboard generally includes a support plate (e.g., a metal sheet, a bottom panel of a keyboard, etc.), a key top arranged above the support plate, a pair of link members interlocked to each other to support the key top above the support plate and direct the key top in a vertical or up-and-down direction, and a switch mechanism capable of opening and closing a contact section of an electronic circuit in accordance with the vertical or up-and-down movement of the key top. The key top is movable substantially in the vertical direction relative to the support plate, through an interlocking action of the link members, while keeping a predetermined posture of the key top. Key-entry operability of the key switch is affected by the amount of stroke (the vertical movement) of the key top and by key-entry operation properties accompanying a so-called "click feeling" during the vertical movement.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Conventionally, in the above key switch, several types of link-member pairs have been used. For example, the first type of link members, which may be referred to as a gear-link type, are assembled together into a reverse V-shape as seen in a lateral direction (or in a side view) and meshed at toothed end regions thereof with each other (see, e.g., Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2003031067A"><text>2003-031067</text></patcit> (<patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2003031067A"><text>JP-A-2003-031067</text></patcit>)). The second type of link members, which may be referred to as a pantograph type, are assembled together into an X-shape as seen in a lateral direction (or in a side view) and are rotatably or slidably joined at the intersections thereof with each other (see, e.g., Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2002231090A"><text>2002-231090</text></patcit> (<patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2002231090A"><text>JP-A-2002-231090</text></patcit>)). Also, a widely-used switching mechanism is configured from the combination of a sheet-like switch including a pair of flexible circuit boards respectively carrying contacts in a mutually facing arrangement (referred to as a membrane switch sheet, in this application), and an actuating member disposed between the key top and the membrane switch sheet and acting in accordance with the downward motion of the key top to close the contacts.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In a key switch disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2003031067A"><text>JP-A-2003-031067</text></patcit>, a base panel shaped as a flat frame is disposed on a membrane switch sheet spread and placed on a support plate. Each of a pair of link members combined in the reverse V-shape as seen in a side view is provided at one end thereof with one or more teeth constituting a meshing structure and a pivoting part pivotally joined to the key top, and at another end opposite thereto with a sliding part slidably engaged with a guide section formed in the base panel. During the period when the key top moves in the vertical direction, the link members pivot about the pivoting part in a mutually interlocking manner through the meshing structure, and the respective sliding parts slide along the upper surface of the membrane switch<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> sheet under the guidance of the guide section of the base panel. A dome-shaped actuating member formed of a rubber is used in the switch mechanism. The actuating member is fixed to the membrane switch sheet in the opening of the base panel, with a dome-top thereof facing toward the key top. On the inner surface of the dome-top of the actuating member, a protrusion is formed to be aligned with the contact section of the membrane switch sheet, which acts to press and close the contact section as the key top is lowered. In this key switch, a click feeling in a key-entry operation is ensured by the buckling or elastic deformation of the rubber-made dome-shaped actuating member.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In a key switch disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP2002231090A"><text>JP-A-2002-231090</text></patcit>, a through-hole is formed in the membrane switch sheet spread and placed on the support plate, so that a guide section and a pivot-support section, provided on the support plate, extend through the through-hole to project from the membrane switch sheet. In the pair of link members combined in the X-shape in a side view, one link member is provided at one end thereof with a pivoting part joined pivotally to the key top and at another end with a sliding part slidably engaged with the guide section of the support plate, while the other link member is provided at one end thereof with a pivoting part pivotally joined to the pivot-support section of the support plate and at another end with a sliding part slidably engaged with the key top. During the period when the key top moves in the vertical direction, the link members pivot in a mutually interlocking manner through a generally center pivoting structure, and the respective sliding parts slide along the key top and the support plate. The link members are also connected together through a return spring shaped in a plate spring, and a plate-spring shaped actuating member separated from the return spring extends from one link member. At the end of the actuating member, a protrusion<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> is formed to be aligned with the contact section of the membrane switch sheet, which acts to press and close the contact section as the key top is lowered. In this key switch, a click feeling in a key-entry operation is ensured by the buckling or elastic deformation of the return spring.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Incidentally, it has been known that a keyboard including a plurality of key switches is configured in such a manner that, in order to improve a key-entry operability of the key tops disposed in a predetermined array on the upper surface of the keyboard housing and to thereby reduce fatigue of an operator, an operator can put his both hands on the keyboard in a natural position where the finger tips of both hands generally converge toward each other and, while maintaining this natural position, can perform a key-entry operation by his finger tips on the top surfaces (i.e., key-operating surfaces) of the respective key tops (see, e.g., Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) No. <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP8234882A"><text>8-234882</text></patcit> (<patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="JP8234882A"><text>JP-A-8-234882</text></patcit>)) without sensing any incongruity. The keyboard disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="JP8234882A"><text>JP-A-8-234882</text></patcit> has a configuration wherein the normal parallel arrangement of the plural key switches is maintained, and wherein the key-operating surfaces of the respective key tops are formed so as to show, in a right-hand key switch group as seen from the operator, a rectangular profile with the right end thereof descending in a plan view, and to shown, in a left-hand key switch group as seen from the operator, a rectangular profile with the left end thereof descending in a plan view. With this configuration, it is possible to prevent the increase in dimension (or occupying area) of the keyboard, in comparison with a configuration in which the respective key switches are arranged obliquely to conform to the natural converging postures of the hands.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The key switch disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="JP2003031067A"><text>JP-A-2003-031067</text></patcit> is configured such that, in the key-entry operation, the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> gear-link type pair of link members slides at the respective sliding parts along the upper surface of the membrane switch sheet. Therefore, the thicknesses of the support plate and the membrane switch sheet are included in the dimension in the height direction of the key switch. Also, at an instant when the key top reaches the lowermost position of the vertical movement, the link members are disposed to be substantially in contact with the upper surface of the membrane switch sheet at regions between the sliding and pivoting parts thereof, which determines the amount of stroke of the vertical movement. Thus, it is necessary to reduce the thickness of the membrane switch sheet, in countermeasures for height reduction and operability improvement of the key switch. In practice, however, it is considered that the thickness of the membrane switch sheet has been reduced to a physical limit.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In contrast, the key switch disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="JP2002231090A"><text>JP-A-2002-231090</text></patcit> is configured such that, in the key-entry operation, the sliding part of one link member of the pantograph type pair of link members slides, inside the through-hole of the membrane switch sheet, along the guide section of the support plate. Therefore, it is possible to eliminate the influence of the thickness of the membrane switch sheet on the height dimension of the key switch. Also, at an instant when the key top reaches the lowermost position of the vertical movement, the link members are received inside the through-hole of the membrane switch sheet at regions between the sliding and pivoting parts thereof. Therefore, it is also possible to eliminate the influence of thickness of the membrane switch sheet on the amount of stroke of the vertical movement of the key top. Contrary to this, the support plate is also provided with a through-hole at a location corresponding to the through-hole of the membrane switch sheet, so that the link members are supported on the support plate, during the key-entry operation, by only<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the guide section and the pivot-support section provided locally in the support plate. As a result, the stability of the interlocking movement of the link members (especially, of the sliding motion of the sliding part) may be degraded, and thus the key-entry operability of the key top may be impaired.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">On the other hand, in the keyboard disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="JP8234882A"><text>JP-A-8-234882</text></patcit>, the plural key switches are arranged such that the profiles of the key-operating surfaces of the key tops in the right-hand group are generally symmetrical to those in the left-hand group as seen from the operator. Therefore, in order to operate the key switches without sensing incongruity at the finger tips, the operator is required to use both hands in correspondence with the positions of the key switches. This configuration may be difficult, especially for an inexperienced operator. Further, the plural key tops having substantially same size and different shape are used in the above keyboard, so that the assembling process of the keyboard may become complicated and thus may lead to increase in the manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Further, as the height reduction of the key switch is facilitated, the dimensions, especially of the link members, is decreased. Also, the assembling process of the key switch has often been performed manually, and it becomes difficult to manually assemble the small-sized link members accurately on the support plate, without causing damage or loss of the link members. Thus, it has been required to develop an assembling jig usable in the process for assembling the low-profile key switch.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Document <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="US5758763A"><text>US 5758763</text></patcit> discloses a device according to the preamble of claim 1.</p><heading id="h0001">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">It is an object of the present invention to provide a key switch adapted to be subjected to a key-entry operation, which is capable of increasing the amount of stroke of the vertical movement of the key top, and of decreasing the height dimension of the key switch, while ensuring the stable key-entry operability of the key top.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">It is another object of the present invention to provide a low-profile keyboard having an excellent operability and including a plurality of key switches as described above.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a keyboard, as an input device for an electronic apparatus, which has the normal parallel key-arrangement for eliminating the increase of the mounting area, which improves the key-entry operability of the plural key switches to reduce fatigue of the operator, irrespective of the skill of the operator, and which also facilitates assembling process.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is still another object of the present invention to provide an assembling jig permitting the low-profile key switches to be assembled safely and accurately.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In order to accomplish the above objects, the present invention provides a key switch comprising a support plate; a key top arranged above the support plate; a pair of link members interlocked to each other to support the key top above the support plate and direct the key to in a vertical direction; and a switch mechanism capable of opening and closing a contact section of an electric circuit in accordance with a vertical movement of the key top; wherein the switch mechanism includes a membrane switch sheet carrying the contact section at a position corresponding to the key top and placed on the support plate; wherein each of the pair of link members includes a sliding part slidably engaged with the support plate; and wherein the membrane switch sheet is provided with a through-hole in a region where the sliding part of each link member is engaged with the support plate, the sliding part of the link member being slidably placed on the support plate through the through-hole in the membrane switch sheet; wherein<br/>

Further, on one arm 32 of each link member 16, a tooth 42 is provided on the distal end surface of the second end region near the pivoting axis 40, and on the other arm 34, two teeth 44 are provided on the distal end surface of the second end region near the pivoting axis 40. In each link member 16, the end regions (or the first end region) of the arms 32, 34, including the sliding axles 38, constitute a sliding part 46 and are engaged with the support plate 12 and the base panel 26 as will be described later.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The base panel 26 is a flat frame-like member formed from, e.g., an integrally molded unitary piece of resinous material, and includes a generally rectangular<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> opening 48 adapted to be concealed by the key top 14. The base panel 26 is provided at the four corners of the opening 48 with two pairs of guide sections 50 having a mutually identical structure. Each guide section 50 includes a wall portion 50a extending from the major surface 26a of the base panel 26, internally, into the opening 48 like an overhang, and a guide groove 52 extending generally parallel to the major surface 26a along each of a pair of opposing inner edges 48a defining the opening 48 is formed inside the wall portion 50a (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>). Two guide sections 50 constituting each pair are spaced apart from each other by a distance permitting the first end region of each link member 16 to be inserted therebetween (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>). The sliding part 46 of the first end region of the link member 16 is slidably engaged at the sliding axles 38 with the guide grooves 52 of the guide sections 50.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Each of the link members 16 is disposed between the support plate 12 and the key top 14 with, as described above, the sliding axles 38 provided in the first end region slidably fitted into the guide grooves 52 of the respective guide sections 50 of the base panel 26, and with the pivoting axles 40 provided in the second end region pivotally fitted into the bearing holes 30 of the respective pivot-support sections 28 of the key top 14. The pair of link members 16 are configured to be rotatable in a mutually interlocking manner, through an interlocking structure formed by intermeshing one tooth 42 of the respective one arm 32 with two teeth 44 of the respective other arm 34 thereof, about respective pivot axes 54 defined by the pivoting axles 40 of the arms 32, 34 (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>).</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Thus, when the link members 16 synchronously rotate in opposite directions about respective pivot axes 54 and the respective sliding parts 46 slide in a generally horizontal direction under the guiding action of the corresponding guide sections 50 on the base panel 26<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> (i.e., under the sliding engagement of the sliding axle 38 with the guide groove 52), the key top 14 is subjected to a parallel displacement in a generally vertical direction relative to the base panel 26, while keeping a predetermined, generally-horizontal posture of the key top 14 wherein the operating surface 14a is substantially parallel to the major surface 26a. More specifically, the uppermost position of the keying stroke (i.e., the stroke of the vertical movement) of the key top 14 is determined at the instant when the sliding motion of the sliding axles 38 of the link members 16 toward each other is stopped by the wall portions 50a of the associated guide sections 50 of the base panel 26. As the key top 14 descends from this uppermost position, the sliding parts 46 of the link members 16 slide, under the guiding action of the associated guide sections 50, away from each other in a direction generally perpendicular to the direction of vertical movement of the key top 14. When the key top 14 reaches the lowermost position of the keying stroke, the contact section 18 of the switch mechanism 20 is closed as will be described later.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The membrane switch sheet 22 of the switch mechanism 20 includes a pair of flexible circuit boards respectively carrying contacts to face to each other (not shown), and a sheet-like spacer supporting these circuit boards with a predetermined gap defined therebetween to maintain the contacts in an opened state. The contacts formed on the surfaces of the film substrates of the circuit boards constitute the above-described contact section 18. The membrane switch sheet 22 is spread and placed on the support plate 12 under the base panel 26, and the contact section 18 is positioned generally at the center of the opening 48 of the base panel 26 (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>).</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The actuating member 24 of the switch mechanism 20, which is a dome-shaped member integrally molded into a unitary piece from a rubber material, is disposed in the opening 48 of the base panel 26 with the dome top 24a<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> facing toward the key top 14, and is fixed to the membrane switch sheet 22 at the bottom dome-opening end 24b thereof. When no load is applied to the actuating member 24, the dome top 24a of the actuating member 24 is upwardly spaced from the membrane switch sheet 22. On the inner surface of the dome top 24a of the actuating member 24, a protrusion (not shown) is formed to be aligned to the contact section 18 of the membrane switch sheet 22 for pressing and closing the contact section 18 when the key top 14 is depressed.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In the key switch 10, when no external force is applied to the key top 14, the actuating member 24 of the switch mechanism 20 biases the key top 14 toward, and supports it, by the dome top 24a, in the uppermost position of the stroke vertically above the base panel 26. At this time, the contact section 18 of the membrane switch sheet 22 is in an opened state. When the key top 14 is depressed by an key-entry operation, the actuating member 24 is deformed while exerting an elastic biasing force to the key top 14 in an upward direction and, just before the key top 14 reaches the lowermost position of the stroke, the actuating member 24 presses the membrane switch sheet 22 from the outside thereof with the protrusion on the inner surface so as to close the contact section 18. When the depressing force upon the key top 14 is released, the actuating member 24 is elastically restored so as to return the key top 14 to the uppermost position and, thereby, the membrane switch sheet 22 is restored to open the contact section 18.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The actuating member 24 is elastically deformed in a buckling mode due to the dome shape thereof, in accordance with a key-entry operation, whereby an elastic biasing force is exerted to the key top 14, which assumes non-linear relationship with a displacement of the key top 14. As a result, the key switch 10 can establish unique key-entry operating properties, accompanied by a so-called click feeling, such that at the instant when<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> the amount of depression of the key top 14 exceeds a predetermined value, the biasing force in a return direction, which has been gradually increased until that time, is sharply reduced.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In the key switch 10, the membrane switch sheet 22 is provided with through-holes 56 at regions corresponding to the two pairs of guide sections 50 of the base panel 26. In the illustrated embodiment, rectangular shaped through-holes 56 are formed, each of which is defined continuously in regions covered by the two guide sections 50 provided along one inner edge 48a of the base panel 26 and in a region extending between the guide sections 50. The sliding part 46 of each link member 16 (i.e., portions around the sliding axles 38 of the arms 32, 34) passes through the associated through-holes 56 of the membrane switch sheet 22, and are placed slidably on the upper surface 12a of the support plate 12 (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>). Each link member 16 operates in a sliding manner, over the entire stroke of the vertical movement of the key top 14, and the sliding part 46 passes through the through-hole 56 of the membrane switch sheet 22 and slides along the upper surface 12a of the support plate 12. Thus, each through-hole 56 is formed, in the membrane switch sheet 22 along the sliding path of the sliding parts 46 of a pair of link members 16, into dimension and shape so as not to prevent the sliding movement.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Each link member 16 is provided in its trunk 36 with a recess 58 capable of receiving the membrane switch sheet 22 (<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>). The recess 58 is defined by the lower surface 36a of the trunk 36 facing to the membrane switch sheet 22, which is depressed with a step difference at least equal to the thickness of the membrane switch sheet 22 relative to the lower surface 32a, 34a of the arms 32, 34 also facing to the membrane switch sheet 22. Over the entire stroke of the vertical movement of the key top 14, each link member 16 moves for rotation in a state where<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> the portion extending between the through-holes 56 of the membrane switch sheet 22 is received in the trunk 36. At the instant when the key top 14 reaches the lowermost position of the vertical movement, each link member 16 is disposed such that the trunk 36 extending from the sliding part 46 is superimposed on the membrane switch sheet 22 at the recess 58, while the sliding part 46 is maintained in contact with the support plate 12 through the associated through-holes 56 of the membrane switch sheet 22 (<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5A</figref>).</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Further, each link member 16 is constructed such that, when the key top 14 reaches the lowermost position of the vertical movement, the sliding part 46 and the arms 32, 34 extending from the sliding part 46 are in contact with the support plate 12 through the associated through-holes 56 of the membrane switch sheet 22. In the illustrated embodiment, each link member 16 is constructed such that, when the key top 14 is in the lowermost position of the vertical movement, the lower surfaces 32a, 34a of the arms 32, 34 are uniformly in contact with the upper surface 12a of the support plate 12 (<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5B</figref>).</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In the key switch 10 having the above-described configuration, a gear-link type pair of link members 16 are constructed such that, during the key-entry operation, the respective sliding parts 46 pass through the corresponding through-holes 56 of the membrane switch sheet 22 and slide along the upper surface 12a of the support plate 12, so that it is possible to eliminate the influence of thickness of the membrane switch sheet 22 on the height dimension of the key switch 10. Therefore, it is possible to increase the amount of stroke of the vertical movement of the key top 14 or to decrease the height dimension of the key switch 10, by an amount equivalent to the thickness of the membrane switch sheet 22, without requiring a further reduction in thickness of the membrane switch sheet 22. More specifically, if the<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> lower profile of the key switch 10 is required, it is possible to reduce the height dimension of the key switch 10 while maintaining the amount of stroke of the vertical movement of the key top 14. On the other hand, if the improvement of keying operability of the key switch 10 is required, it is possible to increase the amount of stroke of the vertical movement of the key top 14 while maintaining the height dimension of the key switch 10. Furthermore, over the entire stroke of the vertical movement of the key top 14, the sliding parts 46 of the link members 16 slide on the upper surface 12a of the support plate 12 while being supported thereon, so that it is possible to improve the stability of the interlocking movement of the link members 16 (in particular, the sliding movement of the sliding parts 46), and thus to ensure a stable keying operability.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Further, in the key switch 10, when the key top 14 reaches the lowermost position of the vertical movement, the link members 16 are superimposed on the membrane switch sheet 22 while receiving the membrane switch sheet 22 in the recess 58 formed in the trunks 36, so that it is possible to suppress the stroke of vertical movement of the key top 14 from decreasing due to the abutment of the link members 16 to the membrane switch sheet 22 at portions other than the sliding parts 46. Also, when the key top 14 reaches the lowermost position of the vertical movement, the arms 32, 34 of the respective link members 16 pass through the corresponding through-holes 56 of the membrane switch sheet 22 and come into contact with the upper surface 12a of the support plate 12, so that it is possible to surely eliminate the influence of thickness of the membrane switch sheet 22 on the amount of stroke of the vertical movement of the key top 14. The dimensions and shapes of the link member 16 and the actuating member 24 may be suitably set such that the actuating member 24 can stably close the contact section 18 of the membrane switch sheet 22 when the key top 14<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> reaches the lowermost position of the vertical movement.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046"><figref idrefs="f0005 f0006 f0007">Figs. 6 to 9B</figref> show a key switch 60 according to a second embodiment of the present invention.

More specifically, the uppermost position of the keying stroke (i.e., the stroke of the vertical movement) of the key top 14 is determined at the instant when the sliding motion of the sliding axles 38 of the link members 16 toward each other is stopped by the edges of the guide holes 66 of the associated guide sections 64 of the support plate 62. As the key top 14 descends from this uppermost position, the sliding parts 46 of the link members 16 slide, under the guiding action of the associated guide sections 64, away from each other in a direction generally perpendicular to the direction of vertical movement of the key top 14. When the key top 14 reaches the lowermost position of the keying stroke, the contact section 18 of the switch mechanism 20 is closed by the actuating member 24.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In the key switch 60, the sliding part 46 of each link member 16 (i.e., portions around the sliding axles 38 of the arms 32, 34) passes through the associated through-holes 56 of the membrane switch sheet 22, and are placed slidably on the upper surface 62a of the support plate 62 inside a pair of guide sections 64 (<figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 8</figref>). The sliding part 46 of each link member 16 extends through the through-holes 56 of the membrane switch sheet<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> 22, and slides along the upper surface 62a of the support plate 62, over the entire stroke of the vertical movement of the key top 14.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Also, over the entire stroke of the vertical movement of the key top 14, each link member 16 moves for rotation in a state where the portion extending between the through-holes 56 of the membrane switch sheet 22 is received in the trunk 36. At the instant when the key top 14 reaches the lowermost position of the vertical movement, each link member 16 is disposed such that the trunk 36 extending from the sliding part 46 is superimposed on the membrane switch sheet 22 at the recess 58, while the sliding part 46 is maintained in contact with the support plate 62 through the corresponding through-holes 56 of the membrane switch sheet 22 (<figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 9A</figref>).</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Further, each link member 16 is constructed such that, when the key top 14 reaches the lowermost position of the vertical movement, the sliding parts 46 and the arms 32, 34 extending from the sliding parts 46 are in contact with the support plate 62 through the associated through-holes 56 of the membrane switch sheet 22. In the illustrated embodiment, each link member 16 is constructed such that, when the key top 14 is in the lowermost position of the vertical movement, the lower surface 32a, 34a of the arms 32, 34 are uniformly in contact with the upper surface 62a of the support plate 62 (<figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 9B</figref>).</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In the key switch 60 having the above-described configuration, the same operative effect can be obtained as in the above-described key switch 10. In particular, the base panel 26 is omitted in the key switch 60, so that it is possible to reduce the weight and the number of components in the key switch 60. Also, by using the thinner link members 16 as illustrated, it is possible to increase the amount of stroke of the vertical movement of the key top 14. Alternatively, when the link member 16<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> used in the key switch 60 has a configuration identical to that in the above-described key switch 10, it is possible to increase the height dimension of the key top 14 by the amount equal to the thickness of the base panel 26. In this case, in spite of the low height of the key switch 60, it is possible to ensure the stable feeling of key-entry operation, which is similar to that in a deep-dish type key top used in a key switch having a normal height.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056"><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 10</figref> schematically shows a keyboard 70 according to an embodiment of the present invention, in which a plurality of key switches 10, each according to the above-described first embodiment, are disposed in a predetermined arrangement.

As illustrated, the plural key switches 84 are arranged in accordance with a conventional side-by-side arrangement, and thus the frame 86 exhibits a rectangular shape in a plan view, which significantly eliminates an idle space between the adjacent key switches 84.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">As shown by enlarged views in <figref idrefs="f0010">Figs. 12 to 13D</figref>, the key top 82 of each key switch 84 includes an operating surface 88 adapted to be subjected to the key-entry operation and a skirt surface 90 depending from the operating surface 88 along the outer edge of the operating surface 88. The operating surface 88 is a flat surface (<figref idrefs="f0010">Figs. 13B to 13D</figref>), and is provided with a first profile 92 as a substantially equilateral trapezoid as seen in a plan view in a vertical direction (<figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 13A</figref>). The skirt surface 90 extends, with a suitable angle defined relative to the operating surface 88, along the entire outer circumferential edge defining the first profile 92 of the operating surface 88. The skirt surface 90 is provided, at its bottom edge away from the operating surface 88, with a second profile 94 as a substantially rectangular shape in a plan view identical to the plan view specifying the first profile 92 (<figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 13A</figref>).</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 11</figref>, the plural key switches 84 are arranged in the frame 86 with the operating surface 88 of each key top 82 being disposed in such a manner that a shorter side 92a of generally parallel opposing sides 92a, 92b defining the first profile 92 (<figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 13A</figref>) is positioned nearer to the front edge 96a of the frame 86 and the longer side 92b of the opposing sides 92a, 92b is positioned nearer to the rear edge 86b of the frame 86. In the keyboard 80, in addition to the key switches 84 including the key tops 82 having the above characteristic<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> shapes, key switches 98 including key tops 96 having conventional normal shapes (i.e., in each key top, a first profile of an operating surface is substantially similar to a second profile of a skirt surface) are provided in a suitable arrangement. More specifically, the key switch 84 including the key top 82 having the above-described characteristic shape is used for keys representing frequently used characters or symbols, while conventional key switch 98 is used for infrequently used functional keys.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">In the keyboard 80 having the above-described configuration, the key top 82 of the individual key switch 84 includes the operating surface 88 formed such that the width thereof increases gradually and symmetrically from a near side to a far side, as seen from an operator during the key-entry operation. As a result, the operator can perform the key-entry operation on the operating surface 88 of the individual key top 84 with his both hands put in a natural position where the finger tips of both hands generally converge toward each other, without sensing incongruity at the finger tips (i.e., hardly sensing, by touch, the outer edge of the operating surface 88). Further, the shapes of the key tops 82 are not distinguished for right-hand and left-hand uses, and thus the plural key switches 84 having the key tops 82 of identical shape are used, so that it is possible to eliminate the requirement for an operator to select either hand depending upon the location of the key switch 84 and, therefore, it is possible to easily operate the keyboard 80 even for an operator having little skill.

In this case, the guide hole 66 in the shape of a groove or a through-hole is formed in each guide section 64 on the support plate 62 into a predetermined shape using a predetermined molding surface of a mold (not shown). With this configuration, it is possible to establish the required weight reduction while ensuring the required strength of the support plate 62 by freely and suitably selecting the resinous material, and to form the plural guide sections 64 respectively including the guide holes 66 in a high precision.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">In a keyboard configured by arranging a plurality of key switches 60, each of which being the above-described<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> key switch 60, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0016">Fig. 23</figref>, a large size support plate 62' common to all key switches 60 can be integrally molded into a unitary member from a resinous material by, e.g., an injection molding process. With this configuration, it is possible to easily and accurately form a multiplicity of guide sections 64 at predetermined locations on the support plate 62'. Further, it is possible to form components (not shown) required to construct a keyboard (e.g., bolts, nuts, fittings, etc., for fixing the support plate 62' to a not-shown housing) integrally on the support plate 62' in the same process for forming the guide sections 64.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Alternatively, it is possible to provide general metal bolts or nuts on the support plate 62' by means of caulking, bonding, integral (insert or outsert) molding, etc., as the components required to construct a keyboard.

When an electro-conductive resinous material containing electro-conductive filler is adopted as the material of the support plate 62' and the support plate 62' is connected to a ground potential, it is possible to additionally provide the function of electromagnetic shielding to the support plate 62'.

The extraction hole 68 is disposed to be generally aligned with the corresponding through-hole 56 of the membrane switch sheet 22.

The assembling jig 130 includes an aligning member 134 (<figref idrefs="f0022">Fig. 29A</figref>) including a plurality of containing sections 132 for containing respectively pairs of link members 16 in predetermined arrangements, a guiding member 138 (<figref idrefs="f0022">Fig. 29B</figref>) assembled with the aligning member 134 and including a plurality of guiding surfaces 136 (<figref idrefs="f0024">Fig. 31A</figref>) individually engageable with the sliding axles 38 of the link members 16 contained respectively in the containing sections 132, and a pressing member 142 (<figref idrefs="f0023">Fig. 30A</figref>) assembled with the aligning member 134 and the guiding member 138 and including a plurality of pressing sections 140 for pressing the plural link members 16 relative to the guiding member 138 in such a manner that the sliding axles 38 of each link member 16 are engaged with the corresponding guiding surfaces 136 of the guiding member 138 and are thereby resiliently displaced under pressure toward each other.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">The aligning member 134 is a rectangular plate-like member having high rigidity and is not easily deformed by an external force. Each containing section 132 of the aligning member 134 is formed as a recess having an profile capable of stably (or with substantially no fluctuation) containing a pair of link members 16 in relative arrangement at the time of completion of the assembling process. In the aligning member 134, a pair of through-holes 144 are formed to be in communication with the respective containing sections 132 (<figref idrefs="f0024">Fig. 31A</figref>).</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">The guiding member 138 is a rectangular frame-like member having high rigidity and is not easily deformed by an external force, and is provided with a plurality of center openings 146 each having a profile corresponding<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> to the profile of each containing section 132 of the aligning member 134. Two pairs of guiding surfaces 136 formed in each opening 146 of the guiding member 138 are provided at predetermined positions respectively corresponding to the sliding axles 38 of the link members 16 contained in the corresponding containing section 132 when the guiding member 138 is properly assembled to the aligning member 134 (<figref idrefs="f0024">Fig. 31A</figref>). Each guiding surface 136 of the guiding member 138 has an inclined surface shape similar to the guiding surface 116 of the guiding member 118 of the above-described assembling jig 110.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">The pressing member 142 is a rectangular plate-like member having high rigidity and is not easily deformed by an external force. A plurality of pressing sections 140 of the pressing member 142 are pin-like elements individually received in a plurality of through-holes 144 of the aligning member 134. Each pressing section 140 of the pressing member 142 is abutted at the distal end thereof to the first end region including the sliding part 46 of the corresponding link member 16 disposed in each containing section 132 of the aligning member 134. Thereby, the pressing section 140 can exert a pressing force to each link member 16 at the first end region, and force it into each opening 146 of the guiding member 138 (<figref idrefs="f0024">Fig. 31B</figref>).</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">The assembling jig 130 having the above-described configuration can be used substantially in the same manner as the above-described assembling jig 110. However, after the guiding member 138 is assembled to the aligning member 134 containing plural pairs of link members 16, and a stack obtained by properly stacking the switch mechanism 20 (<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>) on the support plate 62 is placed on the guiding member 138 to cover the plural openings 146 (<figref idrefs="f0022">Fig. 29C</figref>), the aligning member 134 and the guiding member 138 are not inverted. In the assembling jig 130, without detaching the aligning member 134 from the guiding member 138, the aligning member 134 is<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> assembled with the pressing member 142 with the support plate 62 placed thereon (<figref idrefs="f0023">Fig. 30B</figref>). Then, a pressure P is applied to the support plate 62 in such a manner that the pressing section 140 of the pressing member 142 is forced into the containing section 132 of the aligning member 134 and the opening 146 of the guiding member 138 (<figref idrefs="f0024">Fig. 31A</figref>). As a result, the sliding axles 38 of each link member 16 are subjected to pressure from the corresponding guiding surfaces 136 of the guiding member 138 so as to be resiliently displaced toward each other, and are finally snap-fitted into the guide holes 66 of the corresponding guide sections 64 of the support plate 62. In this manner, the plural pairs of link members 16 are simultaneously assembled to the support plate 62 safely and accurately (<figref idrefs="f0024">Fig. 31B</figref>).</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">The present invention is not limited to the above-described illustrated embodiment, but various modifications may be made thereto. For example, the configuration of a key switch of the present invention, in which the sliding part of the link member passes through the through-hole in the membrane switch sheet and thus is placed on the support plate, is applicable not only to the gear link type link member as in the illustrated embodiment, but also applicable to a key switch having other types of link members, such as pantograph type link members.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56987378" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Tastschalter mit:
