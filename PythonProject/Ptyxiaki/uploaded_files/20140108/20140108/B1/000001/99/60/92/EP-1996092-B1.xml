systems including cannulas and, more specifically, to trocars having a cannula stabilization seal.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Trocar systems have been of particular advantage in facilitating less invasive surgery across a body wall and within a body cavity. This is particularly true in abdominal surgery where trocars have provided a working channel across the abdominal wall to facilitate the use of instruments within the abdominal cavity.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Trocar systems typically include a cannula, which provides the working channel, and an obturator that is used to place the cannula across a body wall, such as the abdominal wall. The obturator is inserted into the working channel of the cannula and pushed through the body wall with a penetration force of sufficient magnitude to result in penetration of the body wall. Once the cannula has traversed the body wall, the obturator can be removed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">With the cannula in place in the body wall, various instruments may be inserted through the cannula into the body cavity. One or more cannulas may be used during a procedure. During the procedure, the surgeon manipulates the instruments in the cannulas, sometimes using more than one instrument at a time. The manipulation of an instrument by a surgeon may cause frictional forces between the instrument and the cannula in which the instrument is inserted. These frictional forces may result in<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> movement of the cannula in an inward or outward direction within the body wall If the cannula is not fixed in place, there is a potential that proximal or distal motions of the instruments through the cannula may cause the cannula to slip out of the body wall or to protrude further into the body cavity, possibly leading to injury to the patient.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The surfaces of the cannula associated with a trocar are generally smooth. The smoothness of a cannula surface makes placement of the cannula through a body wall relatively easy and safe. However, a smooth cannula may not have.desired retention characteristics once the cannula has been placed through a body wall. This may present problems as instruments and specimens are removed from a body cavity through the cannula and the associated seal systems of the trocar It is highly desirable for a cannula to remain fixed in the most appropriate position once placed.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Many solutions to the issue of trocar-cannula fixation or stabilization have been formed. These include an inflatable balloon attached to the distal portion of a cannula, raised threads or rings associated with the outer surface of the cannula, mechanically deployable enlarging portions arranged at the distal end of a cannula and suture loops or hooks associated with the proximal end of the trocar. These solutions have provided some degree of fixation or stabilization. However, there remains a need for a fixation or stabilization device that may be used with a variety of trocar-cannulas and addresses the additional requirements associated with developing laparoscopic surgical procedures and techniques. More particularly, the cannula must provide retention means to prevent the cannula from slipping out of the body cavity and provide sufficient sealing force to provide a gas-tight seal against adjacent tissue in the body wall.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20050165432A"><text>US-2005/0165432</text></patcit> discloses a stabilization seal having the features of the preamble of claim 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0002"><u>Summary of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">This invention relates generally to access devices for providing access through a body wall and, more specifically, to the control, stabilization, fixation and sealing of such access devices. An object of the invention is to provide a cannula stabilizing and sealing system that may be used in conjunction with a wide variety of cannulas and access ports.. In one embodiment, the invention as claimed in claim 1 includes a stabilization seal for placement on the outer surface of a surgical cannula for preventing the cannula from slipping out of a body cavity during use and to provide a substantially gas-tight seal between the cannula and adjacent tissue in the body wall. The stabilization seal includes an inflatable elongate tube having a proximal end, a distal end, a first, inner surface and a second outer surface, with the elongate tube having a substantially cylindrical shape. The stabilization seal also includes a sealing cuff at the proximal end of the elongate tube for sealing the proximal end of the tube to the cannula. The sealing cuff includes a substantially annular shape. A central region of the elongate tube includes a first thickness and a distal-end region of the elongate tube includes a second thickness that is thinner than the first thickness of the central region. The distalend region of the elongate tube is inflatable In one aspect, the sealing cuff includes a substantially annular seal portion. In another aspect, the seal portion includes an o-ring having an inner diameter smaller than the inner diameter of the central region of the elongate tube and adapted to form a seal with the outer surface of the cannula. In another aspect, the seal portion includes a substantially circumferential flange that is integrally formed into the seal portion with the inner diameter of the flange being smaller than the inner diameter of the central region of the elongate tube and adapted to form a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> seal with the outer surface of the cannula. In another aspect, the stabilization seal also includes an inflation port that is formed integrally with the sealing cuff. In another aspect, a check valve is positioned within the inflation port. In another aspect, the central region is formed to expand to a first expanded profile as inflation pressure is applied, and the distal-end region is formed to expand to a second expanded profile as inflation pressure is applied. The second expanded profile of the distal-end region is larger than the first expanded profile of the central region. In another aspect, inflation pressure applied to the stabilization seal expands the distal-end region into a substantially toroid shape. In another aspect, the central region is more rigid than the distal-end region and is substantially non-inflatable, In another aspect, the stabilization seal also includes means for coupling the distal end of the elongate tube to the distal-end region of the cannula.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><u>Description of the Drawings</u></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref> is a side view of a laparoscopic surgical procedure;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a top view of a laparoscopic surgical procedure showing placement of trocars;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of a prior art assembled trocar and obturator;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is a perspective view of a prior art assembled trocar without an obturator;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view of a prior art cannula;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view of a prior art assembled threaded trocar and obturator;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 7</figref> is a perspective view of a prior art threaded cannula and housing;<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 8</figref> is a perspective view of a prior art threaded cannula;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 9</figref> is a perspective view of a prior art cannula having an uninflated balloon at the distal end;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 10</figref> is a perspective view of a prior art cannula having an inflated balloon at the distal end;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a prior art trocar-cannula having a distal retention balloon placed through a body wall in a first position;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a prior art trocar-cannula having a distal retention balloon placed through a body wall in a second position;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 13</figref> is a perspective view of a cannula stabilization seal;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 14</figref> is a side view, partially in cross-section, depicting a cannula stabilization seal;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 15</figref> is a plan view of a cannula stabilization seal;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 16</figref> is a side view of a cannula stabilization seal;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 17</figref> is a section view of a stabilization seal taken from line 17-17 in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 15</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 18</figref> is a perspective view of a trocar-cannula having an inflated helical stabilizer-seal;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 19</figref> is a perspective view of a trocar-cannula having a helical channel;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 20</figref> is a perspective view of a trocar-cannula having a helical track fitted with an expandable member in an un-inflated condition;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 21</figref> is a perspective view of inflatable threads in an inflated condition on a cannula;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 22</figref> is a distal end view of the un-inflated expandable member;<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0013">FIG. 23</figref> is a distal end view of the inflated expandable member forming inflated threads;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 24</figref> is a perspective view of the expandable member in an uninflated condition;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0014">FIG.. 25</figref> is a perspective view of the expandable member in an inflated condition;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 26</figref> is a perspective view of the expandable member in an inflated condition and in association with the cannula</li></ul></p><heading id="h0004"><u>Description</u></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURES 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, a typical laparoscopic procedure is illustrated where a plurality of trocars 100 are placed through a body wall 50, such as an abdominal wall, and into a body cavity 52, such as an abdominal cavity. The body cavity 52 is insufflated, or inflated with gas, to distend the body wall 50 and provide a working space for the laparoscopic procedure. The trocars 100 each include a cannula 110 and a seal 150. Positive pressure is maintained within the body cavity 52 by the seal 150 associated with the cannula 110. In addition, the cannula 110 must fit tightly through the incision through the body wall 52 and maintain a gas-tight seal against adjacent tissue. If positive pressure is lost, either through the seal 150 associated with the cannula 110 or the seal between the cannula and the adjacent tissue, the procedure may be compromised.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As the body cavity 52 is inflated, the body wall 50 may be greatly distended The access sites may tend to enlarge under the distention of the body wall 50 and compromise the positioning and sealing of the cannula 110. As stated above, the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> manipulation of instruments 190 used through the trocars 100 may result in movement of the cannulas 110 in either a proximal or distal direction and/or rotation of the cannulas 110 within the access site through the body wall 50. As this occurs, some liquefaction may take place and the preferred relationship between the cannula 110 and the body tissue may be compromised.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, a typical assembled trocar 100 is shown having a cannula 110, a seal housing 150 and an obturator 160. The cannula 110 typically has a smooth exterior surface 102 so that it may be inserted through the body wall 50 easily. The seal housing 150 contains a seal system that prevents retrograde gas-flow. The obturator 160 may be a cutting or piercing instrument that creates the pathway through the body wall 50 through which the cannula 110 follows. Alternatively, the obturator 160 may be a blunt-tip obturator that passes through an incision made when using the cut-down or Hassan technique to gain access to the body cavity 52. Surgical obturators 160 may be sized and configured to create a defect in tissue that is appropriate for the associated cannula 110. However, the defect may have a tendency to enlarge during a surgical procedure as the trocar 100 or cannula 110 is manipulated. As an instrument 190 is urged distally and proximally, or inserted and withdrawn, the cannula 110 may move or even be inadvertently withdrawn due to the friction between the instrument 190 and the seal 150 of the trocar housing.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS.. 6-8</figref>, a trocar 100 or access device is shown where the outer surface 102 of the cannula 110 includes a plurality of raised features 115. These raised features 115 are sized and configured to increase resistance to proximal and distal motion as instruments 190 are maneuvered and especially as specimens are<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> removed through the trocar 100. The prior art includes either sequential raised rings or a raised coarse-thread 115. While the rings or threads 115 of the prior art may stabilize the cannula 110 to some degree, they do not necessarily seal the cannula 110 against the adjacent tissue of a body wall 50. There may be gas loss associated with the use of these systems. The raised rings or threads 115 also increase the insertion force required to penetrate a body wall 50. The insertion force may be reduced in the instance of a continuous coarse thread 115 in comparison to a sequence of discrete raised rings or features as a threaded cannula 110 may actually be "screwed" into the tissue defect in accordance with the thread direction and pitch, rather than pushed through without appropriate rotation.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">FIGS 9-12</figref>, a surgical access device 100 according to prior art includes a cannula 110 having an inflatable balloon 120 associated with the distal-end portion 120 of the cannula The balloon 120 is sized and configured to fit snugly around the cannula 110 in the uninflated condition. The balloon 120 is inflated after the cannula 110 is properly placed through the body wall 50 and into the body cavity 52. The balloon 120 is generally held against the interior surface 54 of the body wall 50 by a counter-force that is associated with a sliding counter-force member 180. The sliding counter-force member is associated with the proximal portion of the cannula 110. The balloons 120 associated with the devices of the prior art are typically "thick-walled" structures constructed as part of the cannula 110. The balloon 120 is generally bonded to the distal-end portion 122 of the cannula 110 and an inflation channel or lumen is provided within the wall of the cannula 110. This construction can be complicated and<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> expensive. Additionally, this construction requires that the cannula 110 and associated balloon 120 be inserted whether or not the balloon is required or used.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0007 f0008 f0009">FIGS. 13-17</figref>, one embodiment of the stabilization seal 200 of the present invention includes a substantially cylindrical inflatable elongate tube 210 having a proximal end 212, a distal end 214, a first, inner surface 216, a second, outer surface 218 and a graduated wall-thickness. The proximal end 212 of the elongate body 210 includes a substantially annular sealing cuff 220 or enlargement that is sized and configured to seal around an associated cannula 110 in a gas-tight arrangement. A portion of the "sealing-cuff" 220 may include an integrally formed, substantially annular, elastomeric seal portion 221 resembling an o-ring or flange that exhibits strong "hoop-force" upon the cannula 110. The inner diameter of the o-ring or flange may be smaller than the inner diameter of the central region of the elongate tube and adapted to form a seal with the outer surface of the cannula. The sealing-cuff 220 may be formed having an inflation port 230 through which positive gas-pressure may be applied or withdrawn. A central region 222 of the inflatable elongate body 210 may be formed to expand slightly as inflation pressure is applied. A distal-end region 280 of the elongate body 210 includes a region where the wall-thickness 224 is greatly reduced from the wall thickness 226 of the central portion 222. The reduced wall-thickness 224 of the distal-end region 280 of the elongate body 210 allows gas pressure to greatly expand the distal end portion 280 to form a retention feature or toroid-shaped balloon 120. (See <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 16</figref>.) The combination of a retention balloon 120 and a slightly enlargeable central portion 222 provides retention at the distal end 214 of the elongate body 210 and a gas-tight occlusion along the elongate body. There is, therefore, no requirement for a<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> proximal-end retention member 180 to urge the retention balloon 120 toward the inner body-wall surface 54. (See <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 10</figref>.) Additionally, the unitary construction of the stabilization seal 200 allows for very smooth, thin-walled sections and inexpensive processing.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The stabilization seal 200 may be manufactured as a single molded elastomeric component having a retention-cuff 220 with an integral inflation-port 230, a semi-inflatable central region 222 of the elongate body 210 and a fully inflatable distal toroid-balloon 280. Alternatively, the stabilization seal 200 may be manufactured as a single molded non-elastic, inflatable component having a retention cuff 220 with an integral inflation port 230, a semi-inflatable central region 222 of the elongate body 210 and a fully inflatable distal toroid balloon 280. Such non-elastic materials may include polyethylene, polyurethane, polyolefin or the like. These materials may be processed to form inflatable or expandable, non-distensible, components that differ from elastomeric or distensible components. The inflation-port 230 may include a one-way seal or check-valve 240 that is interruptible for inflation and deflation of the inflatable portions 222, 280.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">One embodiment of the stabilization seal 200 may be used with existing trocars 100 and cannulas 110 without alteration to the cannulas. The stabilization seal 200 may be packaged separately and placed onto a cannula 110 as needed. A distinct advantage can be seen in that if a stabilization seal 200 is broken or begins to leak, it can be easily replaced. However, if the retention balloon 120 is constructed as part of the trocar 100, as in the prior art, the entire trocar 100 must be replaced if a failure of the balloon 120 occurs, potentially resulting in elevated risk and cost..<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">There are many materials suitable for manufacturing the stabilization seal 200, including elastomerics such as silicone rubber, polyisoprene rubber, nitrile, latex, vinyl, styrene block co-polymer, polyurethane or the like.

The second inflatable region 280 may form a retention member 120 for retention of the associated cannula 110.

However, use of the Hassan or cut-down technique often leaves a defect larger than the trocar that will be located through the incision. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a means to seal the incision after the trocar has been inserted in order to insufflate the patient's abdominal cavity. The stabilization seal 200 of the present invention provides such sealing means.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Once an incision is made in the body wall 50 to gain entry to the body cavity 52, such as the abdominal cavity, a cannula 110 having a stabilization seal 200 coupled to it is inserted through the incision until the second inflatable region 280 of the stabilization seal is within the body cavity. A syringe 400 may be inserted into the port 230 and used to inflate the first and second inflatable regions 215, 280 by injecting gas or fluid into the port 230. With the incision sealed, the body cavity 52, such as the abdominal cavity, may be insufflated with CO<sub>2</sub> or a similar gas. To deflate the stabilization seal 200 for removal from the body cavity 52, the check valve 240 within the port 230 may be depressed to release the gas or fluid from the stabilization seal The syringe 400 may be used to depress the check valve 240 within the port 230 and the syringe used to pull the gas or fluid from the stabilization seal, thereby deflating the stabilization seal.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0010 f0011 f0012 f0013 f0014">FIGS. 18-26</figref>, an example of a stabilization seal 350 not according to the present invention is depicted having an inflatable thread 360. This example may be used with a trocar cannula 300 having an elongate body 310, a<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> proximal end 312, a distal end 311, a lumen 316 extending between the proximal end 312 and the distal end 311, and a continuous, coarse, helical channel 340 formed by ridges 320 on the outer surface of the elongate body.. The helical channel 340 extends from a proximal-end region 323 of the elongate body 310 to a distal-end region 321 of the elongate body. A thin-walled inflatable tube 359 is wound into the helical channel 340, such that it is nested between the ridges 320, from the distal-end region 321 of the elongate body 310 to the proximal-end region 323 of the elongate body. A distal end 361 of the tube 359 terminates in a substantially gas-tight seal.. A distal-end portion of the inflatable tube 359 is coupled to the distal-end region 321 of the cannula 300, such as by bonding or other methods that are well known in the art. A proximal end 363 of the tube 359 is terminated with a fitting 362, such as an inflation port, that is sized and configured to allow inflation of the tube with gas, air or fluid. A proximal-end portion of the inflatable tube 359 is coupled to the proximal-end region 323 of the cannula 300, such as by bonding or other methods that are well known in the art.

In<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> addition, the inflatable tube 359 is stretched longitudinally as it is wound into the helical channel 340 so that during inflation it does not expand radially away from the cannula as the length of the inflatable tube increases under inflation pressure to form the inflated thread 360. Adjacent loops of the inflatable tube 359 are separated by the ridges 320 of the cannula when the inflatable tube is in an uninflated state. Once the cannula 310 has been placed through a body wall 50, the nested tube 359 may be inflated so that the cannula is substantially enlarged so as to fit securely within the defect in the body wall 50 through which it was inserted. Adjacent loops of the inflatable tube 359 are in contact with each other when the inflatable tube is in an inflated state. A gas-tight relationship is formed between the enlarged cannula 360 and the adjacent tissue in the body wall 50. This is especially important when the procedure for inserting the cannula 310 through a body wall 50 includes a "cut-down" technique, such as the "Hassan technique," which produces a much larger and looser fitting defect than techniques that include a simple piercing of the body wall..</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The inflatable thread 360 of the stabilization seal 350 of the present invention provides improved "trocar mobility" over prior art trocars.

A large abutment (see <figref idrefs="f0006">FIGS. 11 and, 12</figref>), such as an inflated balloon 120 at the distal end of the cannula 110, may present a restriction to such movement and restrict "trocar mobility."
