That is, a substantially L-shaped pipe is provided.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The L-shaped cylinder 620 has one hole acting as a gas supply port 621 connected to an inflator 660, and the other hole acting as a straight moving guide hole 622 through which a piston 630 reciprocates.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In accordance with the present invention, the straight moving guide hole 622 vertically extends downward beyond a position of a sealing part 640 in an initial assembly state. The initial assembly state means a state in which the piston 630 is raised by a gas<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> pressure to be appropriately meshed with a gear member 618. In the initial assembly state, a rack 633 of the piston 630 is hooked by a hooking means 670 formed at the sealing operation member 680. Therefore, a gap (or a marginal space) is formed between the sealing part 634 and a lower end of the straight moving guide hole 622.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The sealing part 634 may be formed of an O-ring or a plastic coating part In addition, since the piston 630 has a length of no more than 6-8cm, in order to extend the straight moving guide hole 622 more than the conventional art, a specific constitution is required in the hollow part For example, as shown, the straight moving guide hole 622 is formed to partially and vertically cross the gas supply port 621.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Further, the L-shaped cylinder 620 has a first thick part 623 disposed at an inner corner to form the straight moving guide hole 622, and an intermediate passage 624 formed between the first thick part 623 and the gas supply port 621. A gas passes through the intermediate passage 624 to press a lower end of the piston head 628 formed at a lower end of the piston 630.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Eventually, since the first thick part 623 causes the straight moving guide hole 622 to be deeper, a space between the lower end of the piston head 628 and an intermediate inner wall of the cylinder 620 becomes wider.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Moreover, a partially spherical rotation space 625 is connected between a lower end of the straight moving guide hole 622 and the gas supply port 621. Therefore, the gas passed through the gas supply port 621 and the intermediate passage 624 can be smoothly introduced into the moving guide hole 622.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A second thick part 626 may be formed around the partially spherical rotation space 625. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the outer corner part of the cylinder 620 from being broken by a high pressure gas.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The second thick part 626 may have a thickness gradually thinned from around the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> spherical rotation space 625 to both sides of the cylinder 620. Therefore, it is possible to reduce a volume of the cylinder 620 while maintaining its strength.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the drawings, a structure of a pretensioner 610 including a cylinder 620 in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is partially illustrated.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As shown, the pretensioner 610 in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a torsion bar 614 on which a webbing is wound, a gear member 618 connected to the torsion bar 614, a cylinder 620, a piston 630 moved along the moving guide hole 622 formed at a portion of the cylinder 620, and having a rack 633 formed at a side surface thereof in a longitudinal direction, a cylindrical sealing operation part 632 integrally formed with a bottom of the piston 630 and projecting therefrom, a sealing part 634 coupled to an outer periphery of the sealing operation part 632 to seal between the piston 630 and an inner wall of the cylinder 620; and a hooking means 670 for hooking the piston 630 at an initial hooking position. In the drawings, reference numeral 660 designates an inflator 660 installed at a gas supply port 621 of the cylinder 620.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the drawings, the sealing part 634 is an O-ring but the sealing part 634 may be a plastic coating part.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The hooking means 670 is a position fixing piece 672 connected to the gear member 618, formed at a base member 680 through which the torsion bar 614 passes, and having a shape meshed with the rack 633 of the piston 630.<br/>
That is, the position fixing piece 672 is formed of a plate that is shaped to form the rack 633. Reinforcement plates vertically extend upward and downward from upper and lower ends of the shaped plate.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Meanwhile, the base member 680 has a guide piece 674 opposite to the position fixing piece 672 with the piston 630 interposed therebetween. As shown, a surface of the guide piece 674 opposite to the piston 630 is parallel to the piston 630.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Moreover, a guide cover 690 is fixedly installed at the cylinder 610 to guide the piston 630. A guide surface parallel to the piston 630 is formed inside the guide cover 690.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As a result, when the vehicle is abruptly decelerated, e.g. due to collision, a gas is supplied into the cylinder 620 to move the piston 630 upward. Therefore, movement of the rack 633 formed at one side of the piston 630 causes rotation of the gear member 618 meshed with the rack 633 in a winding direction of the webbing.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">When the gear member 618 is rotated in the winding direction of the webbing, the webbing is rewound on the torsion bar 614 to closely adhere a passenger to a seat.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Here, since a gas pressure is applied to an O-ring 634 when the piston 630 is moved by the gas pressure, the O-ring 634 is pushed by the piston 630 to be held at the sealing operation part 632. Therefore, the O-ring 634 seals between the piston 630 and the inner wall of the cylinder 620 to improve sealing performance between the piston 630 and the cylinder 620.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In addition, an insert groove (not shown) may be installed around the sealing operation part 632 to securely install the O-ring 634 therein.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Further, since the straight moving guide hole 622 extends downward beyond the O-ring in an initial assembly state, a space for temporarily storing a gas introduced into the moving guide hole of the piston is expanded to provide marginal time to sufficiently apply an upward force. Therefore, the gas discharged from the gas supply port 621 causes an increase in the upward force by the gas pressure applied to the piston head 628.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">As can be seen from the foregoing, since a straight moving guide hole in a cylinder, through which a piston reciprocates, extends downward beyond an O-ring in an initial assembly state, it is possible to maintain a wide space in the moving guide hole under a piston head.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Therefore, it is possible to secure marginal time for providing a sufficient upward<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> force due to a temporary storage space for a gas introduced into the moving guide hole of the piston.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In addition, the conventional step in the moving guide hole can be removed to increase a pressure receiving area, thereby maintaining the sufficient upward force against the piston.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Further, a thick part is formed at an outer corner of a cylinder to maintain durability when a high pressure gas is injected.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56986205" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Straffer für einen Sicherheitsgurtaufroller eines Fahrzeugs, der Folgendes umfasst:
