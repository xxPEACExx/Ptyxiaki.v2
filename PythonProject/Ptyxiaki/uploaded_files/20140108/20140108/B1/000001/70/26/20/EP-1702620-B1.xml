More specifically, the invention of this application relates to an immunopotentiator using a nucleic acid containing a special nucleic acid base, a derivative thereof or a plasmid having the nucleic acid containing the special nucleic acid base, and a method for enhancing an immunoactivity using the same.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>Background Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">An immunoreaction in mammals such as mice, rats and rabbits is one of bioreactions important for preventing invasion of foreign matters, e.g., microbes such as bacteria and viruses, pollens and chemicals into the living body and infection thereof. In the immunoreaction, "adaptive immune" has an immunoreaction that mainly conducts an action of immune antibodies which are specifically bound to these foreign matters in a diversified manner to make them non-toxic. Further, in recent years, it has been reported that "natural immune" which is likewise one immunoreaction recognizes a difference between self-cells and foreign matters (for example, a constituent of bacteria) and an immunoreaction<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> occurs on the basis of this difference (for example, <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Werling, D., and Jungi, W. T., Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 91: 1-12, 2003</text></nplcit> and <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Poltorak, A., et al., Science, 282: 2085-2088, 1998</text></nplcit>). As one of such foreign matters, there is a CpG dinucleotide sequence (CpG sequence) contained in a bacterial DNA (for example, <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Hemmi, H., et al., Nature, 408: 740-745, 2000</text></nplcit> and <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Kreig, A., et al., Nature, 374: 546-549, 1995</text></nplcit>).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In a chromosomal DNA of mammals, this CpG sequence is contained only at such a quite low frequency that its ratio is from approximately 1/50 to 1/60 a statistically expectable value, and the 5-position of most of cytosine bases of the CpG sequence is methylated with cytosine 5-methylase specific to the CpG sequence. Meanwhile, it has been reported that the ratio of the CpG sequence contained in a chromosomal DNA of bacteria (microbes) is approximately 1/16 which is almost equal to the statistically expectable value and it is a CpG sequence free from methylated cytosine like mammals (non-methylated CpG sequence) because there is no cytosine 5-methylase specific to CpG (for example,<nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text> Bird, A. P., Trends Genet., 3:342-347, 1987</text></nplcit>). That is, the natural immune system of mammals is considered to be an immunoreaction that the system recognizes methylation or non-methylation of the CpG sequence to induce an inflammatory reaction (namely, enhancement of an immunoactivity) so as to be able to efficiently prevent the living body from invasion or infection of bacteria.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A natural immune-stimulating composition (gazette of <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2003527352T"><text>JP-T-2003-527352</text></patcit> (the term "JP-T" as used herein means a published Japanese translation of a PCT patent application)), cancer immunotherapy (for example, <nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>Whitmore, M., Li, S., and Huang, L., Gene Ther., 6:1867-1875, 1999</text></nplcit>) and efficient DNA vaccines against infectious diseases (for example, gazette of <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2002511841T"><text>JP-T-2002-511841</text></patcit>, <nplcit id="ncit0007" npl-type="s"><text>Brunner, C., et al., J.

For example, N<sup>6</sup>- methyladenine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is mentioned. For example, adenine (A) of a GATC sequence in E. coli DNA is methylated with a DNA adenine methylase (Dam) which is an enzyme specifically acting on this adenine to give m<sup>6</sup>M. The inventors have considered that not only the non-methylated CpG sequence but also methylation of adenine in the GATC sequence (Gm<sup>6</sup>ATC sequence) functions as one mechanism of recognizing non-self foreign matters which mechanism has evolutionarily been stored by the natural immune. To study and elucidate what immunoactivity (biodefense reaction) is induced in the living body by this Gm<sup>6</sup>ATC sequence is considered to give quite an important knowledge in future when establishing gene therapy or the like using plasmids derived from bacteria such as E. coli.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Studies or reports on induction, promotion and enhancement of the immunoactivity (biodefense reaction) with a sequence containing a specific nucleic acid base except the non-methylated CpG sequence have been little made at present. As far as the inventors know, regarding induction and enhancement of the immunoactivity using the DNA containing the Gm<sup>6</sup>ATC sequence, for example, it has been proposed that a vaccine-like composition is formed with pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella attenuated by applying variation influencing DNA adenine methylase (Dam) and this is administered to the living body to increase an immunological effect and is used for prevention or therapy of infection of pathogenic<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> bacteria (refer to gazette of <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2002536339T"><text>JP-T-2002-536339</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, since the vaccine-like composition described in gazette of <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2002536339T"><text>JP-T-2002-536339</text></patcit> is made of pathogenic bacteria attenuated by applying variation of DNA adenine methylase, its effect is to increase the immunoactivity (biodefense reaction) against pathogenic bacteria as the origin of the vaccine-like composition. Accordingly, it is effective only against specific infectious diseases, and cannot enhance the immunoactivity of the overall living body to bring forth effects against various infectious diseases. That is, it is still unknown that a nucleic acid containing a specific nucleic acid base including a microbial nucleic acid-specific modified base, a plasmid having the nucleic acid or the like is administered to induce and enhance the immunoactivity.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Under these circumstances, the invention of this application has been made, and it aims to provide, upon solving the problems associated with the ordinary art, an immunopotentiator of mammals which comprises as an active ingredient a nucleic acid containing a special nucleic acid base or a plasmid having such a base, which is administered to mammals to be able to enhance the immunoactivity of the overall living body of mammals and which can be applied to cancer immunotherapy, gene therapy, DNA vaccines effective against various infectious diseases and the like, and a method for enhancing an immunoactivity using the same.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The invention of this application aims to provide cultured cells with an immunoactivity enhanced as model cells for studies on induction, enhancement or the like of an immunoactivity in vitro using the foregoing immunopotentiator.

id="p0024" num="0024">The invention of this application has the foregoing characteristics, and the embodiments thereof are described in detail below.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The immunopotentiator of mammals in this application is characterized by comprising as an active ingredient the nucleic acid containing the special nucleic acid base, a derivative thereof or any plasmid having the nucleic acid containing the special nucleic acid base.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The "special nucleic acid base" in the invention of this application means a special base as an ingredient of a nucleic acid, such as a special base as a DNA ingredient or a special base as an RNA ingredient. Specifically, it is a base except adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine and uracil, such as a microbial nucleic acid-specific modified base. Through a nucleic acid such as a DNA or RNA having the special base, an immune system of mammals can distinguish and recognize non-self to enhance and promote the immunoactivity. More specific examples are bases which are subjected to various modifications such as hydroxylation and methylation. Examples thereof include 8-oxoguanine, 8-oxoadenine, 2-oxoadenine, 5-hydroxyuracil, 5-formyluracil, 5-formylcytosine, 8-nitroguanine, thymine glycol, cytosine glycol, hypoxanthine, oxanine, pyrimidine dimer, O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine, O<sup>4</sup>-methylthymine and the like. These may be used<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> either singly or in combination of two or more.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Further, the "plasmid" may express or may not express each gene that the plasmid carries in cells of mammals, and its type is not particularly limited. For example, pQBI63 and pcDNA are available.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The "microbial nucleic acid-specific modified base" means the foregoing special base which is carried specifically in microbes. Through the microbial nucleic acid-specific modified base, the immune system of mammals can distinguish between self (mammals) and non-self (microbes such as bacteria) to enhance and promote the immunoactivity. The type of the microbial nucleic acid-specific modified base of the invention of this application is N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenine. Other examples thereof can include 5-hydroxymethyluracil, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and the like. These may be used either singly or in combination of two or more.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Especially when the microbial nucleic acid-specific modified base is N6-methyladenine, the base sequence containing the base to be modified in this N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenine is preferably a GATC sequence for preferentially selecting the "GATC sequence" to methylate the N-6 position of adenine (A). Specifically, a base sequence indicated in SEQ ID NO: 4 is more preferable.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Regarding the microbial nucleic acid-specific modified base, a nucleic acid such as a natural DNA or RNA which is isolated from microbes such as bacteria including Escherichia coli and viruses by a known method can be used. For example, a nucleic acid (artificial oligonucleotide) formed by artificially adding a modified base in a known manner may be used (for example,<nplcit id="ncit0009" npl-type="s"><text> Cowdery, J. S., et al., J. Immunol., 156, 4570-4575, 1996</text></nplcit>).<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the invention of this application, the derivative of the nucleic acid containing the special nucleic acid base may be used. This "derivative" is a substance whose phosphoric acid moiety or sugar moiety is modified in using a chemical synthetic product, a substance with a structure other than a base moiety changed or the like. For example, a phosphorothioate-modified substance, a 2'-O-methyl RNA or a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) can be used.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As noted above, in mammals, the nucleic acid is almost free from the CpG dinucleotide sequence (CpG sequence). Or even though it has the CPG dinucleotide sequence, the 5-position is methylated with the CpG sequence-specific cytosine 5-methylase. Accordingly, the bioimmune system recognizes the difference to enhance and induce the immunoactivity. Thus, the immunopotentiator in the invention of this application can more enhance the immunoactivity of mammals by further comprising as an active ingredient the nucleic acid containing the microbial nucleic acid-specific non-methylated CpG sequence or the plasmid having the nucleic acid containing the microbial nucleic acid-specific non-methylated CpG sequence. Specifically, the nucleic acid having the non-methylated CpG sequence is preferably a base sequence indicated in, for example, SEQ ID NO: 2.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The "microbe" in the invention of this application is a virus or a bacterium, and Escherichia coli whose handling method or knowledge has been abundantly accumulated is especially preferable as the bacterium.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Also described are cultured cells. The immunopotentiators described above are administered to the cultured cells by a known method such as a method of administration along with a cationic lipid, a microinjection method or an electroporation method so as<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> to be able to enhance the immunoactivity of the cultured cells and efficiently produce the inflammatory cytokine. The cultured cells are available as model cells for experiment on the in vitro immunoactivity. The inflammatory cytokine can efficiently be produced and obtained by using the cultured cells. The resulting inflammatory cytokine can be used in various applications such as therapeutic agents by extraction, purification and the like in a usual manner.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">For further enhancing the immunoactivity, it is also possible to simultaneously administer to any cultured cells a combination of the foregoing immunopotentiator and a composition comprising the nucleic acid containing the microbial nucleic acid-specific non-methylated CpG sequence or the plasmid having the nucleic acid containing the microbial nucleic acid-specific non-methylated CpG sequence as the active ingredient.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The type, the origin and the like of the "cultured cells" are not particularly limited. For example, tissues or cells of individual organisms are available. Specific examples thereof include plant cells, insect cells, mammalian cells and the like. Various constituents of these tissues are also available. In particular, since the invention of this application is to enhance and promote the immune system of mammals, the cultured cells used are preferably derived from mammals including humans. For example, cultured cells derived from humans, monkeys, horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, mice, rats , rabbits and the like can be used.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Also described is a method for enhancing the immunoactivity of individual mammals in which the immunoactivity of mammals can be enhanced by administering the above-described immunopotentiators to mammals.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">When the immunopotentiator of the invention of this application is administered to mammals, it can be administered in the form of a nucleic acid. It is preferable that the immunopotentiator is administered by containing therein various pharmacological ingredients according to the dosage form to enhance the immunoactivity. The "pharmacological ingredients" first mean various carriers which are used in ordinary preparation of agents. The carriers can properly be selected from the wide range according to the type of the disease and the dosage form of the agent. A unit dosage form capable of oral administration or administration by injection is preferable. Especially, in the administration by injection, local injection, intraperitoneal administration, selective intravenous injection, intravenous injection, subcutaneous injection, organ infusion liquid injection and the like can be employed.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Oral liquid preparations such as suspensions and syrups can be prepared using water, sugars such as sucrose, sorbitol and fructose, glycols such as polyethylene glycol, oils such as sesame oil and soybean oil, preservatives such as alkyl p-hydroxybenzoate, flavors such as a strawberry flavor and peppermint, and the like.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Powders, pills, capsules and tablets can be prepared using excipients such as lactose, glucose, sucrose and mannitol, disintegrants such as starch and sodium alginate, lubricants such as magnesium stearate and talc, binders such as polyvinyl alcohol, hydroxypropyl cellulose and gelatin, surfactants such as fatty acid ester, plasticizers such as glycerin, and the like. When preparing tablets and capsules, solid pharmaceutical carriers are used.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The injection solution can be prepared using a carrier made of a<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> salt solution, a glucose solution, a mixture of a salt solution and a glucose solution, various buffer solutions or the like. The injection solution may be prepared in a powdery state and mixed with the liquid carrier when used.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Attention has to be drawn to the fact that the dose of the immunopotentiator in the invention of this application varies with the weight of mammals as an administration subject, the condition of diseases, the administration route and the like.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The second pharmacological ingredients are ingredients by which the immunopotentiator is formulated in a dosage form capable of introduction into cells. For example, a composition can be formed by mixing the nucleic acid containing the microbial nucleic acid-specific modified base as the active ingredient of the immunopotentiator or the plasmid containing the same with a pharmacologically acceptable solution without changing the structure or the function of the nucleic acid or plasmid. Such a composition can also be introduced into target cells by a method of introduction into cells via microinjection, a method of introduction into cells using lipids (for example, BioPORTER (Gene Therapy Systems, U.S.A.)) or peptide reagents (for example, Chariot (Active Motif, U.S.A.)), or through a gene gun by adhesion to gold particles.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As described above, the immune system of mammals distinguishes between the methylated CpG sequence of mammals and the microbe-specific non-methylated CpG sequence to enhance and induce the immunoactivity of mammals. Accordingly, the immunoactivity can be more enhanced by simultaneously administering to mammals the foregoing immunopotentiator and the composition comprising as the active ingredient the nucleic acid containing the microbial nucleic acid-specific<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> non-methylated CpG sequence or the plasmid having the nucleic acid containing the microbial nucleic acid-specific non-methylated CpG sequence in combination.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Examples of the "mammals" in the invention of this application can include mammals such as humans, monkeys, horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, mice, rats, rabbits and the like, and the immunopotentiator can be administered thereto.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Thus, applications to cancer immunotherapy, gene therapy, development of DNA vaccines effective against various infectious diseases, and the like can be expected by enhancing the immunoactivity of mammals according to the immunopotentiator of mammals and the method for enhancing the immunoactivity using the same which are provided by the invention of this application.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Also described are model animals for study on the immunoactivity induced or enhanced in vivo by the nucleic acid containing the specific nucleic acid base, the derivative thereof, the plasmid containing the nucleic acid or the like. In this case, it is important that the mammals are non-human mammals except humans. Examples thereof can include monkeys, horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, mice, rats, rabbits and the like. Especially, mice for which an abundant knowledge or the like has been accumulated and which have been used in many laboratories as experimental model animals are preferable in view of its easy handling. The experimental model animals can contribute to elucidation of a mechanism of inflammation induction (immunoactivity) with a specific nucleic acid base (modified base) such as a Gm<sup>6</sup>ATC sequence.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The strength of the inflammatory reaction induced by preparing a synthetic nucleic acid (oligonucleotide) containing or not containing m<sup>6</sup>A and a plasmid containing the same and administering each thereof to a Balb/c mouse is examined using inflammatory cytokines as an index, and is demonstrated as Example to illustrate the invention of this application more specifically.

The resulting solution was intraperitoneally administered to a Ba1b/c mouse (male, 6 weeks old; Sankyo Labo-Service). Two hours later, concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-α) in the serum were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; AN'ALIZA, Genzyme TECHNE corp.).</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Two hours after the administration, the blood was collected from the heart of the mouse, and allowed to stand overnight at 4°C.

That is, the measured values in GATC-m<sup>6</sup>A were IL-6:39 pg/ml, IL-12:160 pg/ml and TNF-α:150 pg/ml, and the measured values in GATC-dA were IL-6:14 pg/ml, IL-12:48 pg/ml and TNF-α:92 pg/ml. This indicates that the inflammatory cytokines are specifically induced by methylation of adenine (m<sup>6</sup>A). Further, the immune inducibility of the non-methylated CpG sequence differs depending on the sequences before and after the very sequence (<nplcit id="ncit0011" npl-type="s"><text>Kreig, A., et al., Nature, 374: 546-549, 1995</text></nplcit> and the like).
