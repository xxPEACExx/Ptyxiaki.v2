Technical Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a surveillance video camera, and more particularly to a surveillance video camera to be operative in combination with a surveillance system for watching an object such as for example unqualified people and other intruders, and adapted to take an image indicative of the object at a relatively high quality without being affected by an illumination intensity.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Up until now, there have been proposed a wide variety of surveillance video cameras of this type one typical example of which is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laying-Open Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPH08307774B"><text>H08-307774</text></patcit> (paragraph 0026, <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The above mentioned conventional surveillance video camera comprises three image sensors for respectively sensing color component images collectively indicative of an object to selectively take sensitivity enhancing modes such as for example a long exposure mode and a pixel synthesis mode.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In order to enhance the sensitivity of the image sensor, the exposure period of the image sensor is generally extended in reduced illumination. However, the resolution of the motion of the object is deteriorated by reason that the field number of the images to be taken per unit time are decreased when each of the images is taken over the extended exposure period. In the pixel synthesis mode, the image can be taken at relatively high quality by reason that the color components respectively sensed by the image sensors are not mixed with each other.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">On the other hand, in the single image sensor type-surveillance video camera, the image cannot be taken at relatively high quality by reason that the color components sensed by the image sensor are mixed with each other. It is, however, not always essential that the image can be taken in color in reduced illumination such as for example a night.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The conventional surveillance video camera thus constructed as previously mentioned, however, encounters such a problem that the three image sensors type is not simple in construction, and produced at a relatively expensive cost in comparison with single image sensor type.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Further art is disclosed by the documents <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO03043316A"><text>WO 03/043316</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6570613B"><text>US 6570613</text></patcit>.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a surveillance video camera which can enhance the sensitivity of the image device to produce image information at relatively high quality without being affected by the illumination intensity.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is another object of the present invention to provide a surveillance video camera which can be simple in construction in comparison with the conventional surveillance video camera.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a surveillance video camera which can be produced at a relatively low cost in comparison with the conventional surveillance video camera.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a surveillance video camera to be operative in combination with a surveillance system for watching an object having a light produced thereon, comprising: imaging information producing means for producing image information indicative of the object; video signal producing means for producing a video signal on the basis of the image information produced by the image information producing means; and controlling means for controlling each of the imaging information producing means and the video signal producing means to ensure that the object is watched by the surveillance system through the video signal produced by the video signal producing means, wherein the image information producing means includes: an optical section having passed therethrough the light to be provided as an image indicative of the object; a converting section having a sensitivity to the light, the converting section being constituted by a plurality of pixel units to be exposed to the light provided through the optical section over an exposure period to sense the image; and a plurality of sensitivity enhancing unit each for enhancing the sensitivity of the converting section to have the converting section sense the image, and the controlling means includes an executing section for allowing the sensitivity enhancing unit to start in a predetermined sequence to enhance the sensitivity of the converting section, and to stop in an inverse order of the predetermined sequence enhancing the sensitivity of the converting section.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the surveillance video signal according to the present invention, the pixel units are classified into a plurality of pixel groups each to be constituted by two or more pixel units adjacent to each other.

The executing section may be adapted to allow each of the sensitivity enhancing units to start in the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> predetermined sequence to enhance the sensitivity of the converting section, and to stop in the inverse order of the predetermined sequence enhancing the sensitivity of the converting section on the basis of the judgment of the illumination level monitoring section.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The imaging information producing means may further include an adjusting section for adjusting an optical black level and a gain of the electric signal produced by the converting section.

<ol><li>(1) In the pixel synthesis mode, the pixel units of the converting section 112 are classified into a plurality of pixel groups, each of which is constituted by two or more pixel units adjacent to each other. When, for example, each of the pixel groups is constituted, as a picture element, by two pixel units adjacent to each other, each of pixel groups has a sensitivity twice as much as the sensitivity of each of the pixel units.<br/>
On the other hand, the more the number of the pixel units of each of the pixel groups is increased, the more the resolution of the image taken by the converting section 112 is dropped.<br/>
In the single image sensor type - surveillance video camera, the two or more pixel units adjacent to each other is designed to sense respective color components<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> different to each other. This means that the image information is deteriorated by reason that the color components sensed by the pixel units of each of the pixel groups are mixed with each other in the pixel synthesis mode.<br/>
It's preferred that the image is taken in monochrome in the pixel synthesis mode to avoid the mixture of the color components in the single image sensor type - surveillance video camera.</li><li>(2) In the long exposure mode, the sensitivity of the converting section 112 is increased in proportional relationship with the extended exposure period.<br/>
On the other hand, the resolution of the images to the motion of the object is deteriorated by reason that the field number of the images to be taken per unit time are decreased in the long exposure mode.</li><li>(3) In the infrared addition mode, the sensitivity of the converting section 112 is enhanced by reason that the converting section 112 is exposed by not only the visible light but also the infrared light.
