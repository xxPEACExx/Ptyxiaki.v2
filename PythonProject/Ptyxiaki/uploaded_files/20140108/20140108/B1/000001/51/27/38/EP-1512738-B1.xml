load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">Technical Field</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for producing fatty acid alkyl ester composition capable of being utilized effectively as a diesel fuel (particularly, bio-diesel fuel) by treating fats and oils containing a fatty acid glyceride and/or fatty acid, more specifically, to a method for solving a problem of separation and recovery of catalysts present in an alkali metal catalytic method currently often used, a problem of excess consumption of a catalyst by a free fatty acid in a raw material, and a problem of solving a decrease in reactivity due to water in a raw material and using a large excess amount of alcohol in a conventional supercritical methanol method, and producing a fatty acid alkyl ester composition at high yield in a reaction system containing water and free fatty acid present.</p><heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">It has been long known that a fatty acid alkyl ester is obtained by transesterification of an alkyl alcohol with a mono-glyceride, di-glyceride and tri-glyceride (these are<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> generically called fatty acid glyceride) which are main components of vegetable oils, animal fats and used fats and oils of them (for example, "<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>Organic Chemistry Handbook, " Gihodo Publication, 1988, pp. 1407 to 1409</text></nplcit>). Furthermore, various investigations have been made on a technology of producing a fatty acid alkyl ester which can be used as a diesel fuel from fats and oils, utilizing this reaction.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As a method for industrially producing a fatty ester from a fatty acid glyceride, there are long known methods in which a fatty acid glyceride is once hydrolyzed to be converted into a fatty acid, then, in the presence of an acid catalyst or enzyme catalyst, the fatty acid is further subjected to a dehydration reaction (esterification reaction) with alcohols under an anhydrous condition to be converted into a fatty acid alkyl ester, however, these are scarcely used as an industrial production method due to low reaction rate. Currently, in industrially often used methods, a fatty tri-glyceride is subjected to a transesterification under an anhydrous condition in the presence of an alkali metal catalyst under normal pressure at ambient temperature or temperatures near the boiling point of an alcohol with shorter alkyl chain. However, since, in this reaction, an alkali metal catalyst is dissolved in the reaction solution, there is a problem that the alkali metal catalyst<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> is dissolved in a solution of the product and separation and recovery thereof are difficult.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Further, waste oils and the like often contain water, consequently, removal of water in a raw material is inevitable as a pre-treatment, in use of the above-mentioned alkali metal catalyst method. It is general that natural fats and oils contain a free fatty acid, and the content of a free fatty acid differs depending on the origin of a raw material and its treatment method. For example, a waste edible oil contains 3% or more of fatty acids and palm oil from an oil pressing process contains 5% or more of fatty acids. When an alkali metal catalyst is used under a condition of inclusion of a large amount of free fatty acids, an alkali soap becomes a by-product and an alkali metal catalyst in an excess amount is necessary, alternatively, there occurs a problem that separation of a fatty acid ester layer and a glycerin layer is difficult due to a by-product alkali soap, and the like. Because of these reasons, when a transesterificationof a fatty acid glyceride is conducted in the presence of an alkali metal catalyst, a pre-treatment process is necessary for removing a free fatty acid.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">From the standpoint of avoiding such a problem, for example, Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPS6114044B"><text>S61-14044</text></patcit> discloses also a method of converting into an ester of a free<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> fatty acid with the aid of an acid catalyst, as a pre-treatment process. In this method, a free fatty acid is converted into an ester as a pre-treatment for conducting a transesterification of a fatty acid glyceride in the presence of an alkali metal catalyst, however, there is a problem that removal of an acid catalyst is necessary before performing the next transesterification of a fatty acid glyceride and when an acid catalyst remains, it is neutralized, consequently, the use amount of an alkali metal catalyst increases corresponding to the neutralization amount.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As a method for producing a fatty ester not requiring the above-mentioned pre-treatment process, there are also suggested methods using a solid acid catalyst (for example, Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JPH6313188B"><text>H6-313188</text></patcit>). However, an acid catalyst has a critical defect that the reactivity thereof for a transesterification of fats and oils is lower as compared with that of an alkali metal catalyst, and there is a problemthat a large amount of catalyst is necessary in a transesterification using an acid catalyst.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">On the other hand, there are recently also suggested so-called supercritical methanol methods in which a transesterification of fats and oils is conducted under supercritical conditions for alcohol without using a catalyst<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> (for example, Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2000204392A"><text>2000-204392</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2000109883A"><text>2000-109883</text></patcit>). However, in the supercritical methanol method, there is a disadvantage that a large excess amount of alcohol should be present and higher temperatures of 300°C or more are necessary, for efficient progress of a transesterification. Further, in this method, an effect of the presence of water in the reaction system has not been confirmed.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US5908946A"><text>US5908946</text></patcit> discloses the production of linear monocarboxylic acid esters with 6 to 26 carbon atoms.

(wherein, n represents 1, 2 or 3, and R represents a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon group.).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As shown in the above-mentioned reaction formula, in the first process, a fatty acid glyceride in fats and oils used as a raw material is reacted with water, to produce a fatty acid (R<sup>n</sup>COOH) liberated from the glyceride. This free fatty acid is subjected to the second process described later.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The above-mentioned reaction formula shows a fatty acid glyceride as an example, and additionally, when a fatty di-glyceride and/or fatty mono-glyceride are contained in fats and oils as a raw material, they are also hydrolyzed in the same manner.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the second process, the free fatty acid produced in the hydrolysis reaction in the first process is, or, when a fatty acid is contained from the first in fats and oils as a raw material, this fatty acid and the above-mentioned free fatty acid are reacted with alcohol, to produce a fatty acid alkyl ester by an esterification reaction.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In the second process, esterification is conducted by thus reacting a fatty acid and alcohol. It has been clarified by the present inventors that the reaction speed of this esterification reaction is larger than the transesterification of conversion into a fatty acid alkyl ester by a reaction of a fatty acid glyceride and alcohol (see, <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1). Fig. 1</figref> is a graph showing a difference in the relation between the reaction time and the yield when an esterification reaction and transesterification are conducted at 300°C and 30 MPa.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Here, unreacted substances in the transesterification include mainly partial transesterified substances such as mono-glycerides. This partial transesterified<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> substance leads to an increase in the total glycerol amount causing an engine trouble when utilized in engine fuel oil. Therefore, it is inevitable to effect complete conversion into a fatty acid alkyl ester, however, a large amount of energy (longer reaction time) is necessary for this.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In the second embodiment of the present invention, it is particularly preferable that the first process is conducted at a temperature of 150 to 300°C, particularly 250 to 300°C and a pressure of 5 to 25 MPa, particularly 15 to 25 MPa for 15 to 25 minutes, and the second process is conducted also at a temperature of 250 to 300°C and a pressure of 15 to 25 MPa for 15 to 25 minutes.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In the production method of the present invention, the above-mentioned fats and oils contain a fatty acid glyceride and a fatty acid, it is preferable to use water in an amount 30 to 400 mol per mol of the fatty acid glyceride from the standpoint of effectively progressing a hydrolysis reaction for conversion into a fatty acid, and it is preferable to use alcohol in an amount of 30 to 400 mol per mol of the fatty acid glyceride from the standpoint of effectively converting the fatty acid glyceride into a fatty acid alkyl ester directly by a transesterification, further, effectively converting the fatty acid produced by the above-mentioned hydrolysis reaction into a fatty acid alkyl ester.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The above-mentioned fats and oils contain a fatty acid glyceride and a fatty acid, it is preferable to use alcohol in an amount of 10 to 130 mol per mol of the fatty acid from the standpoint of effectively converting the fatty acid into a fatty acid alkyl ester by an esterification reaction.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In the production method of the present invention, the reaction time is not particularly restricted provided the reaction is conducted within the above-mentioned range of the reaction temperature and reaction pressure, and the reaction<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> time is appropriately set corresponding to the conditions of the reaction temperature and reaction pressure. In one example, when the reaction temperature is 250 to 300°C and the reaction pressure is 15 to 30 MPa, for example, the reaction time is preferably 4 to 60 minutes, further preferably 30 to 50 minutes.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The raw material fats and oils used in the production method of the present invention include vegetable oils, animal oils and used waste oils thereof. The vegetable oils include natural vegetable fats and oils such as coconut oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, soybean oil and rapeseed oil. The animal oils include natural animal fats and oils such as beef tallow, lard and fish oil. The waste oils include waste oils obtained after use of these vegetable oils and animal oils for a specific object. These fats and oils can be used singly or in admixture.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">As the alcohol used in the production method of the present invention, alcohols having 1 to 10 carbon atoms are useful. It is preferable to use, particularly, lower alcohols having about 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, propyl alcohol, i-propyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, 2-butyl alcohol, i-butyl alcohol, t-butyl alcohol, pentyl alcohol and the like, from the standpoint of producing a lower alkyl ester excellent as a diesel fuel oil, particularly, a bio-diesel fuel<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> oil. Of them, particularly methyl alcohol is preferable since the cost thereof is low and recovery thereof is easy. Of course, higher alcohols having 6 or more carbon atoms such as decyl alcohol can also be used.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">As the reaction apparatus used in the production method of the present invention, any apparatus can be used provided it can stand a high pressure and high temperature. When a hydrolysis reaction is conducted without a catalyst, alcohol and/or water works as an acid catalyst under the conditions according to the present invention.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The fatty acid alkyl ester composition obtained by the production method of the present invention can be used in various applications, and is particularly useful as a diesel fuel, among others, as a bio-diesel fuel.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The present invention will be illustrated further in detail by examples and comparative examples below.
