When the impact speed is accelerated, and impact energy is increased, the circulating tube or the screw groove (including both shoulder portions of the screw groove) is destructed to hamper high speed formation and therefore, there is proposed a ball screw apparatus in which a direction of scooping up the ball by the circulating tube is inclined substantially in a tangential direction of the screw shaft and substantially in a direction of a lead angle.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">However, when the ball is intended to scoop up in the tangential direction of the screw shaft and in the direction of the lead angle of the screw shaft, the circulating tube is constituted by a complicated shape (Z type instead of simple channel-like type), and when holes opened at the flat face of the nut are simple spot facing holes, the both end portions of the circulating tube cannot be fitted thereto.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Hence, in the prior art, as shown by <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 18</figref>, there is adopted a method of subjecting the hole 7 formed that the flat face of the nut 6 to spot facing to a considerable degree or<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> working the hole 7 skewedly (in tangential direction) (refer to, for example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP63132156A"><text>JP-UM-A-63-132156</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Incidentally, in a general ball screw, a circulating tube made of a metal is used as a member of circulating a ball, the ball is scooped up to outside of a nut at a tongue portion provided at an end portion of the circulating tube and therefore, there is a difficulty of bringing about vibration, noise or the like when the ball is impacted to the tongue portionof the circulating tube.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Hence, there isproposedaball screwof a type (hereinafter, referred to as "tangential scooping up type") using a ball circulating member made of a resin as a member for circulating a ball and scooping up the ball rolling between ball screw grooves of a screw shaft and a nut in a direction of a tangential line brought into contact with a center track circle of a ball by a tongue portion of the ball circulating member to circulate at outside of the nut (refer to <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2003232421A"><text>JP-A-2003-232421</text></patcit>)</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Further a ball screw device as defined in the preamble of claim 1 is described in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="EP0930450B1"><text>EP 0930450B1</text></patcit><b>.</b></p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to the ball screw apparatus described in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP63132156A"><text>JP-UM-A-63-132156</text></patcit>, mentioned above, there poses a problem that working of the hole 7 formed at the flat face of the nut 6 becomes complicated, further, since the hole 7 is large, a screw groove having a small lead or a small pitch as in a multi-streak screw is interfered with a contiguous screw groove.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Although the ball screw described in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2003232421A"><text>JP-A-2003-232421</text></patcit> can restrain vibration, noise or the like from being brought about in comparison with that of the above-described tube circulating system. In recent years, it is requested to promote high speed formation and durable life of a ball screw and therefore, in order to meet the request, it is necessary to increase strength of a tongue portion by thickening a thickness (thickness along a longitudinal direction of the ball screw groove) of the tongue portion of the ball circulating member. However, when the thickness of the tongue portion is thickened, a hole diameter of a circulating member inserting hole formed at the nut is increased to interfere with the ball screw groove of the nut and therefore, when a pitch of the ball screw groove is small or when the ball screw groove is a multi-streak screw groove, it is difficult to thicken the thickness of the tongue portion.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The invention has been carried out in order to resolve such drawbacks.
