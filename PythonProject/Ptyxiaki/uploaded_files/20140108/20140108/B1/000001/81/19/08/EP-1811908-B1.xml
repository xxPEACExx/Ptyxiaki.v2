id="p0001" num="0001">This application relates to a rotational thrombectomy wire for clearing thrombus from native vessels.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Background of Related Art</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In one method of hemodialysis, dialysis grafts, typically of PTFE, are implanted under the patient's skin, e.g. the patient's forearm, and sutured at one end to the vein for outflow and at the other end to the artery for inflow. The graft functions as a shunt creating high blood flow from the artery to the vein and enables access to the patient's blood without having to directly puncture the vein. (Repeated puncture of the vein could eventually damage the vein and cause blood clots, resulting in vein failure.) One needle is inserted into the graft to withdraw blood from the patient for transport to a dialysis machine (kidney machine); the other needle is inserted into the graft to return the filtered blood from the dialysis machine to the patient. In the dialysis machine, toxins and other waste products diffuse through a semi-permeable membrane into a dialysis fluid closely matching the chemical composition of the blood. The filtered blood, i.e. with the waste products removed, is then returned to the patient's body.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Over a period of time, thrombus or clots may form in the graft. Thrombus or clots may also form in the vessel. One approach to break up these clots and other obstructions in the graft and vessel is the injection of thrombolytic agents. The disadvantages of these agents are they are expensive, require lengthier hospital procedures and create risks of drug toxicity and bleeding complications as the clots are broken.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5766191A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,766,191</text></patcit> provides another approach to breaking up clots and obstructions via a mechanical thrombectomy device. The patent discloses a basket having six memory wires expandable to press against the inner lumen to conform to the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> size and shape of the lumen. This device could be traumatic if used in the vessel, could denude endothelium, create vessel spasms and the basket and drive shaft could fracture.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6090118A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,090,118</text></patcit> discloses a mechanical thrombectomy device for breaking up clots. The single thrombectomy wire is rotated to create a standing wave to break-up or macerate thrombus. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US20020173812A"><text>U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0173812</text></patcit> discloses another example of a rotational thrombectomy wire for breaking up clots. The thrombectomy wire has a sinuous shape at its distal end and is contained within a sheath in a substantially straight non-deployed position. When the sheath is retracted, the distal portion of the wire is exposed to enable the wire to return to its non-linear sinuous configuration. The wire is composed of stainless steel. Actuation of the motor causes rotational movement of the wire, creating a wave pattern, to macerate thrombus. The device of the '812 patent publication is effective in atraumatically and effectively breaking up blood clots in the graft and is currently being marketed by Datascope, Inc. as the Pro-Lumen* thrombectomy catheter. In the marketed device, the wire is a bifilar wire, composed of two stainless steel wires wound side by side with a metal tip and an elastomeric tip at the distalmost end.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Although the sinuous wire of the '812 publication is effective in proper clinical use to macerate thrombus in dialysis grafts, it is not suited for use in native vessels. The device is indicated for use in grafts, and if improperly used the wire can kink or knot, and perhaps even break. The wire can also bend, making it difficult to withdraw after use, and can lose its shape. Additionally, the wire would be abrasive to the vessel and the vessel could get caught in the interstices of the wire. It could also cause vessels spasms which can cause the vessel to squeeze down on the wire which could break the wire. Similar problems would occur with the use of the device of the '118 patent in native vessels.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The need therefore exists for a rotational thrombectomy wire which can be used to clear clots or other obstructions from the native vessels. Such wire could advantageously be used not only in native vessels adjacent dialysis grafts but for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US2002173812A"><text>US2002173812</text></patcit> discloses a thrombectomy apparatus for breaking up thrombus or other obstructive material in a lumen of a vascular graft or vessel comprising a flexible sheath, and a wire positioned within the flexible sheath wherein the wire and flexible sheath are relatively movable.

The thrombectomy wire, designated generally by reference numeral 10, includes a core 20, a bifilar wire (coil) 30, and shrink wrap 50. The bifilar wire 30 is formed by two stainless steel wires 32, 34, wound together. As shown they are wound side by side so the cross-sectional area or diameter "a" of the wire fills the space between adjacent turns of the other wire. For example, turns 32a and 32b are filled by respective turns 34a, 34b as shown. Preferably the bifilar wire 30 has a length of about 760 mm (about 30 inches) and a diameter of about 0.76 mm (about .030 inches) to about 1.02 mm (about .040 inches) and more preferably about 0.89 mm (about .035 inches). When used in deeper native vessels, e.g. deep veins of the legs or pulmonary circuit, the wire 30 can have a length of about 1320 mm (about 52 inches). Other dimensions are also contemplated.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The distal region 16 of the bifilar wire 30 is formed into a sinuous or s-shape to contact the vessel wall as the wire rotates.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Although in the preferred illustrated and described embodiments, the outer wire is a multifilar wire in the form of a bifilar wire (two wires), a different number of wires could be wound to form the outer wire component of the thrombectomy wire of the present invention. In yet another embodiment the outer wire can comprise a single wound wire.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The bifilar wire 30 is preferably cold formed into an over-formed s-shape. The bifilar wire is heated, for example at about 354 degrees Celsius (about 670 degrees Fahrenheit), which removes residual stresses and changes the shape of the "s" so it warps back to its desired shape. This stress relief process makes the wire more dimensionally stable.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A tip 80, preferably composed of rubber, Pebax, or other elastomeric materials, is mounted at the distalmost tip of the wire 10 to provide the wire 10 with an atraumatic distal tip to prevent damage to the vessel wall during manipulation and rotation of the wire. A metal tip 60 is attached by laser welding or other methods to the distal end of the bifilar wire 30. The metal tip 60 has an enlarged dumbbell shaped head 62 to facilitate attachment to tip 80. The flexible tip 80 is attached by injection molding over the machined tip. Other attachment methods are also contemplated.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref>, a core 20 is positioned within the bifilar wire 30 and preferably has an outer diameter E substantially equal to the inner diameter D of the coil. The core at a distal portion has a sinuous shaped portion within the sinuous shaped portion of the outer wire 30, corresponding to and formed by the sinuous shape of outer wire 30. In one embodiment, the core extends the entire length of the bifilar wire 30 and this is shown in the schematic drawing of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>. The core 20 can alternatively have a length of about 100-127 mm (about 4-5 inches) so it extends through the distal linear portion and sinuous portion of the wire 30. That is, in such embodiment, the core extends through the portion of the wire that is exposed from the sheath and used to macerate thrombus. It is also contemplated that the core can extend within a shorter or longer length of the bifilar wire.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The core 20 is composed of a flexible material which will limit the compressibility of the wire 30 during use. The core in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> is composed of Nylon, and preferably a drawn Nylon monofilament. Other possible materials include, for example, Teflon, polypropylene, PET, and fluorocarbon. The Nylon provides a non-compressible material to limit the compressibility of the wire 30 during use. That is, as noted above, the Nylon core preferably has a diameter E to fill the inside of the coil 30, e.g. a diameter of about 0.20 mm (about .008 inches) to about 0.33 mm (about .013 inches), and preferably about 0.30 mm (about .012 inches). (Other dimensions are also contemplated.) This enables the coil (bifilar wire) 30 to compress only to that diameter. By limiting compressibility it strengthens the wire as it reduces its degree of elongation if it is under torque. It also prevents bending or knotting of the wire which could otherwise occur in native vessels. It increases the torsional strength of the wire and also strengthens the wire to accommodate spasms occurring in the vessel. An enlarged distal head, such as ball tip (not shown), can be provided on the core 20 to fit in a recess of machined tip 60. As an alternative, core 20 can be attached by adhesive at the tip, welded, crimped, soldered or can alternatively be free floating.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The shrink wrap material 50 covers a portion of the bifilar wire 30 proximal of the flexible tip 80 to block the interstices of the coil and provide a less abrasive surface. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref>, the distal end of the shrink wrap abuts the proximal end of the tip 60. The shrink wrap can be made of PET, Teflon, Pebax, polyurethane or other polymeric<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> materials. The material extends over the exposed portion of the wire 30 (preferably for about 3 inches to about 4 inches) and helps to prevent the native vessel from being caught in the coil and reduces vessel spasms. Alternatively, instead of shrink wrap, a coating can be applied to the coil formed by the bifilar wire to cover the interstices</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 5 and 6</figref> illustrate an alternate embodiment of the thrombectomy wire of the present invention, designated generally by reference numeral 100. Wire 100 is identical to wire 10 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, except for the inner core 120. It is identical in that it has a bifilar wire 130, a shrink wrap 170, an elastomeric tip 180 and metal, e.g. stainless steel, tip 160.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In this embodiment, the core 120 is composed of a shape memory material, preferably Nitinol (a nickel titanium alloy), which has a memorized configuration of a sinuous or s-shape substantially corresponding to the s-shape of the bifilar wire 130. In the softer martensitic state within the sheath, core 120 is in a substantially linear configuration. This state is used for delivering the wire to the surgical site. When the wire is exposed to warmer body temperature, the core 120 transforms to its austenitic state, assuming the s-shaped memorized configuration. Cold saline is delivered through the catheter during delivery to maintain the core 120 in this martensitic state; the warming occurs by exposure to body temperature to transform the core 120 to the memorized state. Such memorized s-shape helps maintain the s-shape of the bifilar wire 130 during use. Cold saline can also be delivered to the core 120 at the end of the procedure to facilitate withdrawal.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The Nitinol core 120, like the Nylon core 20, is not compressible so it will also limit the compressibility of the bifilar wire 130. The Nitinol core 120 also will increase the stiffness of the wire 100, thereby reducing the chance of knotting and kinking and increase the strength of the wire to accommodate any spasms in the vessel. Its shape memory helps hold the amplitude of the bifilar wire 130 during use to maintain its force against the clot for maceration upon rotation. It preferably extends about 100-127 mm) (about 4-5 inches) so it extends through the distal linear portion and sinuous portion of the wire 130, terminating at end 122. Alternately it can extend a shorter or longer length within the wire 130, or even the entire length as shown in the schematic view of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref>. It preferably has an outer diameter of about 0.20 mm (about .008 inches) to about 0.33<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> mm (about .013 inches), and more preferably about 0.30 mm (about .012 inches), corresponding to the inner diameter of the coil. Other dimensions are also contemplated.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In another embodiment, a stainless steel braid, cable, or strand of wires twisted together provides the inner core member to limit compressibility of the coil (bifilar wire)<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> and provide increased stiffness, strength and other advantages of the core enumerated above. This is shown in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 7 and 8</figref> where wire 200 has inner core 220 of seven twisted stainless steel wires. A different number of twisted wires is also contemplated. The other elements of the wire 200, e.g., outer bifilar wire 230, metal tip 260, tip 280 shrink wrap 250, etc., are the same as in wires 10 and 100 described herein.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The rotational thrombectomy wires 10, 100 and 200 of the present invention can be used with various thrombectomy catheters to macerate thrombus within the vessel. The rotational thrombectomy wire 10 (or wire 100 or 200) is contained within a flexible sheath or sleeve C of a catheter as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. Relative movement of the wire and sheath C will enable the wire 10 to be exposed to assume the curved (sinuous) configuration described below to enable removal of obstructions, such as blood clots, from the lumen of the vessel.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">A motor powered by a battery is contained within a housing to macerate and liquefy the thrombus into small particles within the vessel lumen. This is shown schematically in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>. Wire 10 (or 100 or 200) is operatively connected to the motor. Operative connection encompasses direct connection or connection via interposing components to enable rotation when the motor is actuated. The curved regions of the wire 10 or (100 or 200) are compressed so the wire (including the distal region 16, 116 or 216, respectively) is in a substantially straight or linear non-deployed configuration when in the sheath C. This covering of the wire 10 (or 100 or 200) by sheath C facilitates insertion through an introducer sheath and manipulation within the vessel. When the flexible sheath C is retracted, the wire is exposed to enable the wire to return to its non-linear substantially sinuous configuration for rotation about its longitudinal axis within the lumen of the vessel.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Fluids, such as imaging dye can be injected through the port D into the lumen of the sheath C in the space between wire 10 (or 100 or 200) and the inner wall of the sheath C, and exiting the distal opening to flow into the vessel. This imaging dye provides an indication that fluid flow has resumed in the vessel. The lumen of the sheath can also receive cold saline to cool the Nitinol core 120 as described above.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The rotational thrombectomy wires 10, 100 and 200 of the present invention can also be used with the thrombectomy catheters having one or more balloons such as the balloon described in the '812 publication. The wires 10, 100 and 200 can further be used with other thrombectomy catheters.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">While the above description contains many specifics, those specifics should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the disclosure, but merely as exemplifications of preferred embodiments thereof. Those skilled in the art will envision many other possible variations that are within the scope of the claims appended hereto.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56986667" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Drehbarer Thrombektomiedraht zum Aufbrechen von Thrombus- oder anderem obstruktivem Material, wobei der Draht Folgendes umfasst:
