Examples of agents that perturb the EGF signaling pathway include agents that target HER-2.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">After lung cancer, breast cancer is the.second leading cause of cancer deaths in women. According to the World Health Organization, more than 1.2 million people will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year worldwide, and The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2004, over 200,000 women in the United States will be diagnosed with invasive breast<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> cancer (Stages I-IV), and about 40,000 women and almost 500 men will die from breast cancer in the United States in 2004.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The incidence rate of breast cancer (number of new breast cancers per 100,000 women) increased by approximately 4% during the 1980s but leveled off to 100.6 cases per 100,000 women in the 1990s.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Standard treatments include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and hormonal therapies. Each of these treatments has drawbacks including loss of breast tissue, illness associated with radiation or chemotherapy, reproductive and hormonal side effects, and unreliable survival rates.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Thus breast cancer is a serious disease, fatal in many cases, and requires improved treatments to reduce fatalities and prevalence.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Clusterin or "TRPM-2" is a ubiquitous protein, with a diverse range of proposed activities. In prostate epithelial cells, expression of clusterin increases immediately following castration, reaching peak levels in rat prostate cells at 3 to 4 days post castration, coincident with the onset of massive cell death. These results have led some researchers to the conclusion that clusterin is a marker for cell death, and a promoter of apoptosis. On the other hand, Sertoli cells and some epithelial cells express high levels of clusterin without increased levels of cell death. Sensibar et al., (1995)[1] reported on <i>in vitro</i> experiments performed to more clearly elucidate the role of clusterin in prostatic cell death. The authors used LNCaP cells transfected with a gene encoding clusterin, and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> observed whether expression of this protein altered the effects of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), to which LNCaP cells are very sensitive. Treatment of the transfected LNCaP cells with TNFα resulted in a transient increase in clusterin levels for a few hours, but these levels had dropped by the time DNA fragmentation preceding cell death was observed.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">United States published patent application <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US20030166591A"><text>US 20030166591</text></patcit> discloses the use of antisense therapy which reduces the expression of clusterin for the treatment of cancer of prostate and renal cell cancer.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6383808B"><text>US Patent No. 6,383,808</text></patcit> discloses compositions, particularly oligonucleotides, and methods for modulating the expression of clusterin.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">United States published patent application <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US2004096882A"><text>2004096882</text></patcit> discloses RNAi therapeutic probes targeting cancer associated proteins including clusterin.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">United States published patent application<patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US2004053874A"><text> US2004053874</text></patcit> discloses antisense modulation of clusterin expression.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">United States published patent application <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US2003166591A"><text>US 2003166591</text></patcit> discloses cluserin antisense therapy using an oligonucleotide having 2'-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl modifications.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">United States published patent application <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US2003158130A"><text>US 2003158130</text></patcit> discloses the use of chemotherapy-sensitization and radiation-sensitization of cancer by antisense clustgerin oligodeoxynucleotides.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">Applicants have found that agents that perturb the HER-2 signalling pathway and that are known to be useful in the treatment of cancer can result in increased expression of the protein clusterin.

The EGFr family comprises EGFR, HER-2, HER-3 and HER-4. The EGFr family lies at the beginning of a complex signal transduction/communication pathway that modulates cell proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As used herein, the phrase "an agent that perturbs the HER-2 cell signalling pathway" refers to any agent which is capable of disrupting the HER-2 cell signal, and includes a monoclonal antibody specific for HER-2, a small molecule inhibitor of normal binding to HER-2, an antisense oligonucleotide that specifically inhibits expression of HER-2, or a peptide capable of interfering with the signalling function of HER-2.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">As used herein, the term "clusterin" refers to the glycoprotein originally derived from ram rete testes, and to homologous proteins derived from other mammalian species, including humans, whether denominated as clusterin or an alternative name. The sequences of numerous clusterin species are known. For example, the sequence of human clusterin is reported by Wong et al., (1994) [2], and in NCBI sequence accession number NM_001 831 and is set forth in Seq. ID No. 1. In this sequence, the coding sequence spans bases 48 to 1397.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As used herein, the term "amount of clusterin" refers to the amount of clusterin which is present in a form which is functional to provide anti-apoptotic protection. The effective amount of clusterin may be reduced through restricting production of clusterin (at the transcription or translation level) or by degrading clusterin at a rate faster than it is being produced. Further, it will be appreciated that inhibition occurs when the clusterin would otherwise be present if the antisense oligonucleotide had not been administered.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As used in the specification, "antisense oligonucleotide" refers to stretches of single-stranded DNA, usually chemically modified, whose sequence (3' → 5') is complementary to the sense sequence of a molecule of mRNA. Antisense molecules thereby effectively inhibit gene expression by forming RNA/DNA duplexes, and offer a more targeted option for cancer therapy than chemotherapy or radiation. Antisense is believed work by a variety of mechanisms, including physically blocking the ability of ribosomes to move along the messenger RNA, and hastening the rate at which the mRNA is degraded within the cytosol. The abbreviation ASO may also be used to refer to an antisense oligonucleotide.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As used in the specification and claims of this application, the term "combination" refers to an assemblage of reagents for use in therapy either by simultaneous or contemporaneous administration. Simultaneous administration refers to administration of an admixture (whether a true mixture, a suspension, an emulsion or other physical combination) of the agent that perturbs the HER-2 cell signaling pathway and the oligonucleotide. In this case, the combination may be the admixture or separate containers of the agent and the oligonucleotide that are combined just prior to administration. Contemporaneous administration refers to the separate administration of the agent and the oligonucleotide at the same time, or at times sufficiently close together that a synergistic activity relative to the activity of either the agent or the oligonucleotide alone is observed. In this, the combination comprises separate containers of the agent and the oligonucleotide<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><heading id="h0007"><u>Agents that Perturb the HER-2 signalling pathway</u></heading><p id="p0025" num="0025">As noted above, the present invention makes use of an agent that perturbs the HER-2 cell signalling pathway. This agent can be any agent which is capable of disrupting the HER-2 cell signal, and includes an antibody specific for any of the members of the HER-2, a small molecule inhibitor of normal binding to HER-2, an antisense oligonucleotide that specifically inhibits expression of HER-2, or a peptide agent capable of interfering with the signalling function of HER-2.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The agent is one that perturbs the EGF signalling pathway by interaction with HER-2. HER-2, also known as ERBB2, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, helps control how cells grow, divide, and repair themselves. There has been extensive research done on the HER-2 gene and the role of the HER-2 protein in cancer dating from the 1980s. The HER-2 gene directs the production of special proteins, called HER-2 receptors. HER-2 is overexpressed in about a third of all breast cancers and is the target of trastuzumab.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">One type of agent that can be used to interact with the HER-2 receptor and perturb the EGF signalling pathway is a pharmaceutical monoclonal antibody. The antibody may be specific for, and bind to, the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> HER-2 receptor. Alternately the antibody may bind to a related receptor and affect the HER-2 pathway in that way. This antibody may be trastuzumab, which is believed to block the HER-2 receptors when there is overexpression, and thereby block tumor growth and development. Trastuzumab, sold under the brand name Herceptin™, is a recombinant monoclonal antibody administered intravenously to treat breast cancer. Trastuzumab is currently used in combination with paclitaxel and is indicated for treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors over-express the HER-2 protein.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Other agents capable of perturbing the HER-2 cell signaling pathway include antisense agents capable of blocking <i>HER-2</i> expression. <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US2003105051A"><text>US Patent publication 2003105051</text></patcit> discloses nucleic acid therapeutics for conditions related to levels of HER-2, and <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="US5910583A"><text>US patent nos. 5,910,583</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="US6365345A"><text>6,365,345</text></patcit> disclose antisense nucleic acids for the prevention and treatment of disorders in which expression of c-erbB or erbB2 play a role</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The examples below demonstrate that increased clusterin expression is observed when trastuzumab is used to target HER-2 in breast cancer cells.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Small molecules capable of acting as the agent to perturb HER-2 cell signaling include, for example, those disclosed<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> in published patent documents <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="US5721237A"><text>US 5, 721, 237</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="WO03035843A"><text>WO 03035843</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0014" dnum="EP1131304A"><text>EP1131304</text></patcit>.

Double stranded RNA, or dsRNA directs gene-specific, post-transcriptional silencing in many organisms, including vertebrates. RNAi involves mRNA degradation, but many of the biochemical mechanisms underlying this interference are unknown.

Alternatively, RNAi may be effected via directly introducing into the cell, or generating within the cell by introducing into the cell a suitable precursor (e.g. vector, etc.) of such an siRNA or siRNA-like molecule.

Using the same treatment schedule described above, apoptosis (shown as the annexin V<sup>+</sup>/PI<sup>-</sup> region of the dot plot panels) was observed only after combined treatment of Clusterin ASO plus trastuzumab.
