In connection with such a technique, there has been a demand for a technique which, when forming a modified region within a substrate formed with a multilayer part including a plurality of functional devices along a line to cut, makes<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> it possible to cut the multilayer part with a higher precision in particular from the modified region acting as a start point.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In view of such circumstances, it is an object of the present invention to provide a laser processing method which, when cutting a substrate formed with a multilayer part including a plurality of functional devices, makes it possible to cut the multilayer part with a high precision in particular, and a semiconductor chip cut by using such a laser processing method.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">For achieving the above-mentioned object, the laser processing method in accordance with the present invention is a laser processing method having the features of claim 1.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">This laser processing method forms a modified region within the substrate along a line to cut such as to generate a fracture reaching at least the front face of the substrate from a front-side end part of the modified region. Attaching an expandable member such as expandable tape, for example, to the rear face of the substrate and expanding it while in the state generating such a fracture can cut not only the substrate but also the multilayer part along the line to cut with a favorable precision in particular. Therefore, when cutting a substrate<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> formed with a multilayer part including a plurality of functional devices, this laser processing method makes it possible to cut the multilayer part with a high precision in particular.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The functional device refers to semiconductor operating layers formed by crystal growth, light-receiving devices such as photodiodes, light-emitting devices such as laser diodes, and circuit devices formed as circuits, for example. The modified region is formed by irradiating the substrate with laser light while locating a converging point therewithin, so as to form multiphoton absorption or light absorption equivalent thereto within the substrate.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The above-mentioned laser processing method may generate either a fracture reaching the inside of the multilayer part from the front-side end part of the modified region or a fracture reaching the front face of the multilayer part from the front-side end part of the modified region.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Preferably, in the laser processing method, the modified region is formed such that the front-side end part of the modified region extends like a streak to the front face of the substrate.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">This laser processing method forms a modified region within the substrate along a line to cut such that the front-side end part<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> of the modified region extends like a streak to the front face of the substrate.

present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the drawings. In the laser processing method in accordance with the embodiment, a phenomenon known as multiphoton absorption is used for forming a modified region within an object to be processed. Therefore, to begin with, a laser processing method for forming a modified region by the multiphoton absorption will be explained.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A material becomes transparent when its absorption bandgap E<sub>G</sub> is greater than photon energy hv. Consequently, a condition under which absorption occurs in the material is hν &gt; E<sub>G</sub> However, even when optically transparent, the material generates<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> absorption under a condition of nhv &gt; E<sub>G</sub> (where n = 2, 3, 4, ...) if the intensity of laser light becomes very high. This phenomenon is known as multiphoton absorption. In the case of pulsed waves, the intensity of laser light is determined by the peak power density (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) of laser light at its converging point. The multiphoton absorption occurs under a condition where the peak power density is 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) or greater, for example. The peak power density is determined by (energy of laser light at the converging point per pulse)/(beam spot cross-sectional area of laser light × pulse width). In the case of continuous waves, the intensity of laser light is determined by the field intensity (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) of laser light at the converging point.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The principle of the laser processing method in accordance with the embodiment using such multiphoton absorption will be explained with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006">Figs. 1 to 6</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, on a front face 3 of a planar object to be processed 1, a line to cut 5 for cutting the object 1 exists. The line to cut 5 is a virtual line extending straight. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the laser processing method in accordance with this embodiment irradiates the object 1 with laser light L while locating a converging point P therewithin under a condition generating multiphoton absorption, so as to form a modified region 7. The converging point P is a position at which the laser light L is converged. The line to cut 5 may be curved instead of being straight, and may be a line actually drawn on the object 1 without being restricted to the virtual line.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Then, the laser light L is relatively moved along the line to cut 5 (i.e., in the direction of arrow A in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>), so as to shift the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> converging point P along the line to cut 5. Consequently, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">Figs. 3 to 5</figref>, the modified region 7 is formed along the line to cut 5 within the object 1, and becomes a starting point region for cutting 8. The starting point region for cutting 8 refers to a region which becomes a start point for cutting (fracturing) when the object 1 is cut. The starting point region for cutting 8 may be made by forming the modified region 7 either continuously or intermittently.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In the laser processing method in accordance with this embodiment, the modified region 7 is not formed by the heat generated from the object 1 absorbing the laser light L. The laser light L is transmitted through the object 1, so as to generate multiphoton absorption therewithin, thereby forming the modified region 7. Therefore, the front face 3 of the object 1 hardly absorbs the laser light L and does not melt.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Forming the starting point region for cutting 8 within the object 1 makes it easier to generate fractures from the starting point region for cutting 8 acting as a start point, whereby the object 1 can be cut with a relatively small force as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>. Therefore, the object 1 can be cut with a high precision without generating unnecessary fractures on the front face 3 of the object 1.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">There seem to be the following two ways of cutting the object 1 from the starting point region for cutting 8 acting as a start point. One is where an artificial force is applied to the object 1 after the starting point region for cutting 8 is formed, so that the object 1 fractures from the starting point region for cutting 8 acting as a start point, whereby the object 1 is cut. This is the cutting in the case where<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> the object 1 has a large thickness, for example. Applying an artificial force refers to exerting a bending stress or shear stress to the object 1 along the starting point region for cutting 8, or generating a thermal stress by applying a temperature difference to the object 1, for example. The other is where the forming of the starting point region for cutting 8 causes the object 1 to fracture naturally in its cross-sectional direction (thickness direction) from the starting point region for cutting 8 acting as a start point, thereby cutting the object 1. This becomes possible if the starting point region for cutting 8 is formed by one row of the modified region 7 when the object 1 has a small thickness, or if the starting point region for cutting 8 is formed by a plurality of rows of the modified region 7 in the thickness direction when the object 1 has a large thickness. Even in this naturally fracturing case, fractures do not extend onto the front face 3 at a portion corresponding to an area not formed with the starting point region for cutting 8 in the part to cut, so that only the portion corresponding to the area formed with the starting point region for cutting 8 can be cleaved, whereby cleavage can be controlled well. Such a cleaving method with a favorable controllability is very effective, since the object 1 to be processed such as silicon wafer has recently been apt to decrease its thickness.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The modified region formed by multiphoton absorption in the laser processing method in accordance with this embodiment encompasses the following cases (1) to (4):</p><heading id="h0009">(1) Case where the modified region is a crack region including one crack or a plurality of cracks</heading><p id="p0032" num="0032">An object to be processed (e.g., glass or a piezoelectric material<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> made of LiTaO<sub>3</sub>) is irradiated with laser light while locating a converging point therewithin under a condition with a field intensity of at least 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) at the converging point and a pulse width of 1 µs or less. This magnitude of pulse width is a condition under which a crack region can be formed only within the object while generating multiphoton absorption without causing unnecessary damages on the front face of the object. This generates a phenomenon of optical damage by multiphoton absorption within the object. This optical damage induces a thermal distortion within the object, thereby forming a crack region therewithin. The upper limit of field intensity is 1 × 10<sup>12</sup> (W/cm<sup>2</sup>), for example. The pulse width is preferably 1 ns to 200 ns, for example.

The molten processed region may also be referred to as a region in which a certain structure changes to another structure among monocrystal, amorphous, and polycrystal structures. For example, it means a region having changed from the monocrystal structure to the amorphous structure, a region having changed from the monocrystal structure to the polycrystal structure, or a region having changed from the monocrystal structure to a structure containing amorphous and polycrystal structures. When the object to be processed is of a silicon monocrystal structure, the molten processed region is an amorphous silicon structure, for example.

The lines to cut 5 are virtual lines assumed for cutting the object 1 into a plurality of chip-like parts.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0017">Figs. 17</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0018">18</figref>, the object 1 comprises a substrate 4 having a thickness of 30 µm to 150 µm made of silicon, and a multilayer part 16, formed on the front face 4a of the substrate 4, including a plurality of functional devices 15. Each functional device 15 has an interlayer insulating film 17a laminated on the front face 4a of the substrate 4, a wiring layer 19a formed on the interlayer insulating film 17a, an interlayer insulating film 17b laminated on the interlayer insulating film 17a so as to cover the wiring layer 19a, and a wiring layer 19b formed on the interlayer insulating film 17b. The wiring layer 19a and the substrate 4 are electrically connected to each other by a conductive plug 20a penetrating through the interlayer insulating film 17a, whereas the wiring layers 19a and 19b are electrically connected to each other by a conductive plug 20b penetrating through the interlayer<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> insulating film 17b.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">While a number of functional devices 15 are formed like a matrix in directions parallel and perpendicular to an orientation flat 6 of the substrate 4, the interlayer insulating films 17a, 17b are formed between the functional devices 15, 15 adjacent to each other so as to cover the front face 4a of the substrate 4 as a whole.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Thus configured object 1 is cut into the functional devices 15 as follows.

Subsequently, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0019">Fig. 19(b)</figref>, the object 1 is fixed onto a mount table (not depicted) of a laser processing apparatus such that the rear face 4b of the substrate 4 faces up. Here, the protective tape 22 prevents the multilayer part 16 from coming into direct contact with the mount table, whereby each functional device 15 can be protected.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Then, lines to cut 5 are set like grids (see broken lines in <figref idrefs="f0017">Fig. 17</figref>) so as to pass between the functional devices 15, 15 adjacent to each other, and the substrate 4 is irradiated with laser light L under a condition generating multiphoton absorption, while using the rear face 4b of the substrate 4 as a laser light entrance surface, locating a converging point P within the substrate 4, and moving the mount table so as to scan the light-converging point P along the lines to cut 5. This forms a modified region 7 to become a starting point region for cutting within the substrate 4 such that the distance between the position of its front-side end part 7a and the front face 4a of the substrate 4 (referring to the distance in the thickness direction of the substrate 4 unless<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> otherwise stated) is 3 µm to 40 µm.

Subsequently, the protective tape 22 is irradiated with UV rays as shown in <figref idrefs="f0020">Fig. 20(b)</figref>, so as to lower its adhesive force, and then is peeled off from the front face 16a of the multilayer part 16 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0021">Fig. 21 (a)</figref>.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">After peeling off the protective tape 22, the expandable tape 23 is expanded as shown in <figref idrefs="f0021">Fig. 21 (b)</figref>, so as to cause a break from the modified region 7 acting as a start point, thereby cutting the substrate 4 and multilayer part 16 along the lines to cut 5 and separating semiconductor chips 25 obtained by cutting from each other.
