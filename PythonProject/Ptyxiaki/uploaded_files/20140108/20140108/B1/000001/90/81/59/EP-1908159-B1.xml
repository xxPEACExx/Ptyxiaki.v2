mxw-id="PDES63961239" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to rechargeable batteries for use in portable electronic devices, and in particular to a battery circuit and structure for use in a device intended to be used with a planar inductive charging platform.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Portable electronic equipment such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDA) usually use rechargeable batteries. Power adaptors (or AC-DC power converters) are traditionally used to charge the batteries in the electronic equipment. Due to the wide range of portable electronic products, many people nowadays have a wide range of power adaptors because there is no standard for charging different types of portable electronic equipment.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Recently, two proposals for planar inductive charging platforms have been proposed. The first one proposed in patent application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="GB2399225A"><text>GB2399225A</text></patcit> and also described in related patent application <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20050116683A1"><text>US 2005/0116683 A1</text></patcit> generates an AC electromagnetic flux with the flux lines flowing "horizontally" along the charging surfaces as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1a</figref>. A distributed winding is used in this charging platform for generating the AC flux. This principle is in fact similar to the AC electromagnetic flux generated in a cylindrical moter, except that the cylindrical structure is compressed into a flat pancake shape. As the flux needs to flow horizontally along the upper and lower surfaces, two inherent limitations arise.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Firstly, an electromagnetic flux guide must be used to guide the flux along the bottom9. surface. This is usually a layer of soft magnetic material such as ferrite cr amorphous alloy. In order to provide sufficient flux, this layer must be "thick" enough so that the flux can pass along the layer of soft magnetic material without magnetic saturation. Secondly, a similar problem applies to the secondary device that has to pick up flux (and energy) on the upper surface of the charging platform. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1b</figref> shows the device required for the charging platform of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1a</figref>. This consists of a magnetic core 104 and a winding 106. In order for the winding to sense the AC flux, the flux must flow into the cross-sectional area 108 (shaded in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.1b</figref>). Therefore, this cross-sectional area inust be large enough so that enough flux and energy can be picked up by the secondary device. It should be noted that this secondary device must be housed inside the electronic equipment to be charged on the charging platform. The thickness of the secondary device is crucial to the applicability and practicality of the device. If it is too thick, it simply cannot be housed in the electronic equipment.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Another planar inductive battery charging platform was proposed in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO03105308A"><text>WO03/105308</text></patcit>. Unlike <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="GB2399225A"><text>GB2399225A</text></patcit>, the charging platform proposed in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO03105308A"><text>WO03/105308</text></patcit> uses a multilayer planar winding array to generate an AC flux that has almost uniform magnitude over the entire charging surface. The lines of flux 204 of this charging platform flow "perpendicularly" in and out of the charging surface 200 (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.2</figref>). This perpendicular flow of flux is very beneficial because it allows the energy transfer over the surface on which the electronic equipment (to be charged) is placed.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For both planar charging platform described above, it is necessary to use an electromagnetic shield on the bottom surface. If the charging platform is placed on a metallic desk, the AC flux generated in the charging platform may induce currents in the metallic desk, resulting in incorrect energy transfer and even heating effects in the metallic desk. <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US6501364B"><text>US 6,501,364</text></patcit> describes an effective electromagnetic shield for this type of planar charging platform. The electromagnetic shield of <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US6501364B"><text>US 6,501,364</text></patcit> simply consists of a thin layer of soft magnetic material (such as ferrite) and a thin layer of conductive material (such as copper).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Regarding energy transfer from the planar surface, one coreless printed-circuit-board (PCB) transformer technology pioneered by Hui and Tang has been proven to be an effective technique (see for example: <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="EP935263A"><text>EP935263A</text></patcit>: <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Hui, S.Y.R.; Tang, S.C.; Chung, H., 'Coreless printed-circuit board transformers for signal and energy transfer', Electronics Letters, Volume: 34 Issue: 11, 28 May 1998, Page(s): 1052-1054</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Hui, S.Y.R.; Henry Shu-Hung Chung; Tang, S.C., 'Coreless printed circuit board (PCB) transformers for power MOSFET/IGBT gate drive circuits', IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, Volume: 14 Issue: 3, May 1999, Page(s): 422-430</text></nplcit>;<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Tang, S.C.; Hui, S.Y.R.; Henry Shu-Hung Chung, 'Coreless printed circuit board (PCB) transformers with multiple secondary windings for complementary gate drive circuits', IEEE Transaction on Power Electronics, Volume: 14 Issue: 3, May 1999, Page(s): 431-437</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Hui, S.Y.R.; Tang, S.C.; Henry Shu-Hung Chung, 'Optimal operation of coreless PCB transformer-isolated gate drive circuits with wide switching frequency range', IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, Volume: 14 Issue: 3, May 1999, Page(s): 506-514</text></nplcit>; and <nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>Tang, S.C.; Hui, S.Y.R.; Henry Shu-Hung Chung,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> 'Coreless planar printed-circuit-board (PCB) transformers - a fundamental concept for signal and energy transfer', IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, Volmne: J 5 issue: 5, Sept. 2000, Page(s): 931-941</text></nplcit>.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Based on two planar windings 300,302 on two parallel planes as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.3</figref>, it has been shown that both energy and signal can be transferred from one planar winding to another.

It should be noted that the primary circuit is based on the resonant circuit described by Hui and Tang, while the front power stage of the secondary circuit is a standard winding with a diode rectifier that provides the rectified DC voltage for the charging circuit.

Such high switching frequency leads to high switching loss in the primary inverter circuit, high AC resistance in the PCB copper tracks and more importantly high electromagnetic interference (EMI) emission.</li></ol></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Problem (1) can be solved by using a planar inductive charging platform based on a multilayer planar winding array structure, which allows the charged electronic equipment to be placed anywhere on the charging surface as described in <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="WO03105308A"><text>WO03/105308</text></patcit>.

When the power adaptor is plugged into the electronic equipment (to be charged), the two outputs DC+ 602 and DC- 600 are connected to the mechanical contacts of the charger socket of the electronic equipment.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.7</figref> shows a diagram of a battery pack 700 with several external mechanical contacts that are accessible. Inside the battery pack are the electric "cells"' 704 and a "charging protection circuit" 706 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig.8</figref>. Two mechanical contacts 702, 708 are connected to the positive and negative terminals of the battery through the charging protection circuit 706. The cells form the battery and the charging protection circuit ensures that the battery is charged in a specified manner. <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig.9</figref> shows the functional block diagram of a battery pack. The input positive 902 and negative 904 terminals of the charging protection circuits are labeled as IN+ and IN-, respectively. The output positive 906 and negative 908 terminals of this circuit are named OUT+ and OUT-, respectively. OUT+ and OUT- are connected to the battery as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig.10</figref>. If the mechanical connector of the power adaptor is inserted into the charging socket of the electronic equipment, the equivalent block diagram 1000 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig.10</figref>. Essentially, DC+ and DC- are connected to IN+ and IN-, respectively.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to a preferred embodiment of this invention, an energy receiving element in the form of a simple planar device is introduced to this battery pack structure so that this battery pack can be charged inductively by the planar charging platform of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.2</figref> (which has the magnetic flux lines flowing into and out of the charging surface perpendicularly). Using a mobile phone as an example, the battery pack is usually accommodated inside the mobile phone and is covered by the back cover of the mobile phone If a mobile phone is placed on the planar inductive battery charging platform of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.2</figref>, one side of the battery pack will face the charging surface of the charging platform. This side will be called the "active side" of the battery pack in this specification because it is closest to the charging surface of the charging platform and will be used for inductive charging purposes. There will be only the back cover (usually made of plastic) of the mobile phone between the active side of the battery pack and charging surface of the charging platform.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In a first embodiment of the invention the energy receiving element consists of a winding 1 wound around and within the thickness of a thin soft magnetic sheet 2 a small AC capacitor 3, a diode rectifier 4 and a DC link capacitor 5. The soft magnetic sheet 2 may be square, rectangular or other polygonal shapes as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig.11(a)</figref>, or may be circular or oval as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig.11(b)</figref>. Winding 1 and soft magnetic sheet 2 form an energy pick-up coil or inductor as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig.11(a) or 11(b)</figref>, which then forms a resonant tank with the small resonant capacitor. When sensing a high-frequency AC magnetic flux flowing perpendicularly (or vertically) from the surface of the planar inductive battery charging platform, the energy pick-up coil will, develop a n AC voltage<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> by Faraday's law and picks up the energy transmitted from a planar charging platform. This coil enclosing the soft magnetic sheet (as a low-profile magnetic core) is essentially a planar inductor. This planar inductor and the series-connected AC capacitor form a series resonant tank that can amplify the AC voltage for the diode rectifier. The diode rectifier and the DC capacitor rectify the AC voltage into a DC voltage that can be fed to a battery charging circuit. Preferably a voltage regulator can be used to provide a stable DC voltage from the output of the rectifier. The following sections describe the proposed low-profile device in more detail.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In order to effectively pick up the perpendicular AC magnetic flux generated by the planar inductive charging platform of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.2</figref>, a planar winding 1 with a certain number of turns (eg 12 turns) in the secondary module is wound around a thin sheet of soft magnetic material 2 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figs.11(a) and 11(b)</figref>. The height of this winding is less than the thickness of the soft magnetic sheet. This thin or low-profile structure can be placed or glued on the active side of the battery inside the battery pack. The thin soft magnetic sheet 2 serves as a magnetic core for the winding 1 and guides the perpendicular AC magnetic flux (generated by the charging platform) through the winding. It should be noted that the thickness of the soft magnetic sheet 2 can be very small (eg 0.5mm) because the cross-sectional area for the magnetic flux to flow is the large flat surface of the soft magnetic sheet (as the magnetic flux lines flow perpendicularly into and out of this flat surface). This highlights the huge advantage of the perpendicular flux generation of the inductive battery charging platform of <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="WO03105308A"><text>WO03/105308</text></patcit> over the horizontal flux generation of <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="GB2399225A"><text>GB2399225A</text></patcit>. The "thin" structure of the proposed device of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> invention makes it easy to modify existing battery packs without increasing substantially the thickness of the battery pack. This makes it attractive for "low-profile" portable electronic equipment such as mobile phones.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">It should be noted that while the present invention is particularly suited for use with the battery charging platform of <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="WO03105308A"><text>WO03/105308</text></patcit> it is not limited to use with that platform and could be used with any battery charging platform in which the lines of flux extend generally perpendicular to the charging surface.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">An important alternative to the planar winding structures of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figs. 11(a) and 11(b)</figref> is shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figs.12(a) and 12(b)</figref>. A secondary energy receiving element 1200 may be added to the first energy receiving element. In particular, additional spiral windings 1200 can be added (connected in parallel) to the pick-up coil 1207 (i.e. the first winding that encloses the soft magnetic core) by printing one or more spiral windings 1200 on a printed circuit board (PCB) 1202 that is placed on top of the magnetic sheet 1204. PCB 1202 is placed on the side of the magnetic sheet 1204 that in use would face the primary winding(s). It should also be noted that the PCB 1202 can also be very thin (eg 0.2mm) so the combination of the PCB 1202 and the magnetic sheet 1204 is still very thin. By connecting terminal 1208 of the additional winding to the corresponding terminal 1206 of the first winding, and terminal 1212 of the additional winding to the corresponding terminal 1210 of the first winding, the two windings are connected in parallel as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig.12(b)</figref>. The extra planar winding(s) can improve the energy pick-up in the secondary module.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">It should also be noted that a coil formed on a printed circuit board in addition to acting as a secondary energy receiving element in the above described embodiment, may alternatively serve as a single energy receiving element on its own.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The secondary circuit used by Choi in the prior art can only pick up a sufficiently large voltage from the primary circuit at high frequency (950 kHz). The use of such high frequency leads to many shortcomings such as high AC resistance in the windings, reduced energy efficiency, high switching losses and high EMI emission in both primary and secondary circuits. Unlike the standard secondary winding used in this prior art, the winding in this invention (<figref idrefs="f0005">Figs.11(a) and (b)</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">Figs.12(a) and (b)</figref>) serves as both an energy pick-up coil and a resonant inductor (<i>Lr</i>). A small AC capacitor (1306, <i>Cr</i>) is connected in series (or possibly in parallel) with the coil 1302 (an inductor) as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig.13</figref> to form a resonant tank, which is then connected to the diode rectifier 1308 with a DC capacitor 1310 (<i>Cdc</i>). The diode rectifier turns the resonant AC voltage picked up by the resonant tank into a DC voltage and the DC capacitor reduces the voltage ripple in order to maintain a fairly stiff DC voltage for the charging circuit. It should be noted that the diode rectifier can be of a standard type as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig.13(b)</figref>, or it can be of a type with voltage doubling (sometimes called voltage doubler) as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig.13(c)</figref>. The use of a voltage regulator can ensure a stable DC voltage for charging the battery</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The use of the small resonant capacitor (Cr) is very important. The resonant frequency (<i>fr</i>) of the resonant tank formed by <i>Lr</i> and <i>Cr</i> can be expressed as:<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>r</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>π</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msqrt><msub><mi>L</mi><mi>r</mi></msub><mn>.</mn><msub><mi>C</mi><mi>r</mi></msub></msqrt></mrow></mfrac></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="33" he="16" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The use of this additional resonant capacitor offers the designer a freedom to select the appropriate operating frequency for the entire charging system in order to optimize the system performance for meeting various requirements and international standards. It has been explained in <patcit id="pcit0014" dnum="WO03105308A"><text>WO03/105308</text></patcit> that the primary circuit (i.e. equivalent circuit of the inductive battery charging platform) is essentially a L-C resonant circuit. By choosing the resonant frequencies of both primary and secondary resonant circuits to be identical or as close as possible, energy transfer between them can be optimized. With the use of a core-based planar inductor in this proposal, the inductance value of <i>Lr</i> can be much greater than that of a coreless spiral winding as in the prior art. Therefore, according to the above equation, the resonant frequencies of both of the primary and secondary circuit can be selected at a relatively low frequency range (e.g. 100kHz to 45kHz) instead of 950 kHz as in the case of the prior art.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">When placed on the charging platform, the charged electronic equipment has the active side of the battery pack near and parallel to the charging surface of the charging platform, which produces a magnetic flux flowing in and out of the charging surface perpendicularly. By Faraday's law, an AC voltage will be induced in the secondary winding. In this invention, the two terminals of the secondary resonant tank are connected to a diode rectifier and a capacitor as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig.13</figref>. The use of this diode rectifier and a smoothing capacitor is important. Firstly, the diode rectifier turns the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> induced AC voltage in the winding into a rectified DC voltage and the DC capacitor reduces the AC voltage ripple so that a fairly constant DC voltage can be made available for the charging protection circuit. Secondly, the diode rectifier prevents any current from flowing into the secondary resonant tank formed by <i>Lr</i> and <i>Cr</i> when a traditional battery charger is plugged into the charged equipment. This feature can be explained with the use of the block diagram as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig.14</figref>. As the introduction of the proposed inductive charging device should not affect the use of a traditional power adaptor, it is important that the new circuit should allow the electronic equipment to be charged by both a planar inductive charging platform and a traditional power adaptor. If a traditional power adaptor is plugged into the charging socket of the electronic equipment, the terminals DC+ 1404 and DC- 1406 will be connected to terminals IN+ 1408 and IN- 1410 of the battery pack through the mechanical contacts in the charging socket. The presence of the diode rectifier is crucial here because it prevents any current from the traditional power adaptor from flowing into the "secondary winding".</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A further proposal in this invention is to incorporate the resonant capacitor Cr, the diode rectifier and the DC capacitor Cdc into the existing charging protection circuit as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig.15</figref>. In this way, the two terminals of the secondary winding can simply be connected to the inputs 1510, 1512 of the modified charging protection circuit. The DC power terminals 1506, 1508 of a traditional power adaptor or charger, if used, will be connected to IN+ and IN- of the modified circuit as usual (<figref idrefs="f0009">Fig.15</figref>). This arrangement further simplifies the manufacturing process of the battery pack that will now become compatible with the inductive battery charging platform of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig.2</figref> with perpendicular<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> magnetic flux as well as a traditional power adaptor. <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig.16</figref> shows the essential component parts of the proposed battery pack including a battery pack casing 1600, battery 1602, a soft magnetic sheet 1604 with winding 1606 placed on top of the battery 1602, a cover 1608 for the active side of the battery pack, and a modified charging and protection circuit 1610 including the extra diode rectifier and capacitors. <figref idrefs="f0011">Figs.17(a) and 17(b)</figref> show the simple assembling process of these parts for a battery pack.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As long as the "active side" of the battery pack faces the surface of the charging platform, the electronic equipment 1800, 1802 can be charged by the planar inductive charging platform 1804 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig.18</figref>. It should be noted that the proposed device in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 11</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig.12</figref> can be a separate device or can be integrated into a battery pack (<figref idrefs="f0011">Fig.17</figref>) as explained above. When used as a separate device (<figref idrefs="f0007">Fig.13</figref>), it can be used to make existing electronic equipment compatible with the inductive charging platform.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The equivalent circuit of this invention when used with the planar inductive charger is shown in <figref idrefs="f0013">Fig.19</figref>. Unlike that reported by Choi (<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig.5</figref>), the multilayer winding array that generates a uniform magnetic field over the charging surface (primary system) can be represented as groups of windings that can be connected to the high-frequency AC inverter in series, in parallel or a combination of both. When the secondary loads are placed on the charging surface, near field coupling and therefore energy transfer occur between the charging platform and the secondary loads.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In summary, at least in its preferred forms this invention has the following advantageous features. The use of the proposed inductive charging device is simple and consists of only a thin sheet of soft magnetic material, a winding, a small AC capacitor, a diode rectifier and a DC capacitor (and an optional voltage regulator). The invention is particularly useful for use with any charging platform (such as that shown in <patcit id="pcit0015" dnum="WO03105308A"><text>WO03/105308</text></patcit> but not limited thereto) which provides magnetic flux "perpendicular" to the charging surface, the entire area of the proposed device can be used to pick up the AC flux. For the same reason, the structure of the proposed device can be of low-profile (i.e. very thin, less than 1mm), making it easy to mount the proposed planar device on the active side of the battery inside a battery pack without increasing the overall thickness of the battery pack substantially. This low-profile device can be used as a separate circuit to make existing batteries compatible with the planar inductive battery charger or can be integrated into new battery packs. The secondary resonant tank allows a relatively low switching frequency to be chosen so as to optimize the charging performance such is improved energy efficiency and energy transfer; reduced AC resistance and EMI emission. The proposed device can be added to existing battery pack externally or integrated into existing charging protection circuit inside the battery pack. If a voltage doubler is used as the diode rectifier, a high voltage generated for the charging circuit can be higher than that of a standard diode bridge.</p></description><claims
