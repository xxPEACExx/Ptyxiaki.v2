In particular, in vertical axis carousel-type machines, the weight of the rotating equipment is parallel to the vertical axis of rotation, creating a bending moment with respect to the axis of rotation and the bearings and shaft that support the carousel.

The vertical wheel molding machine preferably includes a wheel mounted for rotation around a horizontal axis and a plurality of angularly spaced molds disposed around the wheel. Each of the molds preferably includes a first mold segment and a second mold segment disposed radially outwardly of the first mold segment. One of the first and second mold segments, preferably the second mold segment, is a female mold segment that includes a nest for receiving a premade closure shell. The other of the first and second mold segments, preferably the first mold segment, is a male mold segment that includes a core for engaging and compression molding the mold charge of liner material within the shell. In two disclosed embodiments of the invention, the mold charge of liner material either is placed within the premade closure shell prior to placement of the shell within the nest, or is placed within the shell after placement of the shell in the nest, preferably by placing the mold charge in a pocket on the mold core. The second mold segments preferably are moved radially inwardly and outwardly by at least one cam disposed adjacent to the wheel for engaging the second mold segments as the wheel rotates around its axis.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A method of compression molding sealing liners within premade closure shells, in accordance with another aspect of the invention, includes providing a wheel mounted for rotation around a horizontal axis and a plurality of angularly spaced molds disposed around the wheel. Each of the molds includes a first mold segment and a second mold segment disposed radially outwardly of the first mold segment. As the wheel is rotated around its horizontal axis, the second mold segments are moved in sequence radially with respect to the associated first mold segments between a radially inner closed position and a radially outer open position spaced from the associated first mold segment. With the mold segments in the open position, closure shells with compression molded sealing liners are removed from the mold, and a premade closure shell and mold charge of liner material are placed in the mold. The mold segments are then closed as the wheel rotates to compression mold the mold charge of liner material between the mold segments.

Machine 30 includes a wheel 32 mounted on a shaft 34 (<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) between spaced supports 36. Shaft 34 is coupled by a pulley 38, a belt 40 and a gear box 42 to a motor 44 for rotating shaft 34 and wheel 32 around a horizontal axis. Other suitable wheel drive means can be employed. Wheel 32 includes a hub (which may be part of shaft 34) and a support 46 (<figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>) extending radially from the hub.

Plate 48 has a plurality of radially outwardly opening peripheral pockets 49 in an equally spaced circumferential array. A rod 50 is slidably supported by sleeve bearings 52 within each pocket 49. A pair of cam rollers 54, 55 are rotatably mounted on a shaft 56 at the outer end of each rod 50 and receive lubricant through a fitting 58. Each shaft 56 is carried by a mounting block 62 secured at or adjacent to the outer end of rod 50. A stabilizer bar 60 extends from each mounting block 62 and cooperates with spaced rollers 64, 66 (<figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref>) on plate 48 for preventing rotation of rod 50 within pocket 49.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A pair of radially spaced external supports 68,70 are provided on support plate 48.

A plurality of angularly spaced molds 72 are disposed around wheel 32, preferably adjacent to the periphery of the wheel. Each mold 72 includes a radially inner first mold segment 76 and a second mold segment 78 in radially outward alignment with an associated first mold segment 76. In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the radially inner first mold segment 76 is a male mold segment, and the radially outer second mold segment 78 is a female mold segment, although these mold segments could be reversed in accordance with the broadest principles of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> invention.

Core assembly 82 includes a core tip 84 mounted on an inner pin 90, which is secured by screws 91 to a core manifold block 92 by springs 93 within pockets on the manifold block. Springs 93 cut through pins 95, which extend through openings in the base of inner pin 90, to engage the edge of collar 86. Pins 88 in collar 86 extend into slots on the skirt of tip 84 to limit outward movement of collar 86 with respect to tip 84. A coolant tube 94 extends from a first coolant fitting 96 on manifold block 92 through the hollow interior of pin 90 to a position adjacent to the inner face of tip 84. Coolant tube 90 is retained between the inner face of tip 84 and a counterbore in the end of pin 90. An annular passage 98, between pin 90 and the outer surface of tube 94, extends to a second coolant fitting 100 on block 92. Thus, coolant may be circulated from fitting 96 through tube 94 to the inner face of tip 84, and thence through passage 98 to fitting 100 (or in the opposite direction). A third fitting 102 (<figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>) is carried by manifold block 92 for selectively applying either vacuum or air under pressure through a passage 104 in block 92, through a passage 106 in pin 90, and then between sleeve 86 and tip 84. Fitting 102 may selectively be connected to vacuum for withdrawing air from the mold cavity during the compression molding operation to help reduce the occurrence of bubbles within the liner, and to air under pressure to assist removal of the closure and compression molded liner from the core assembly.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">A spring 108 (<figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0013">18</figref>) is disposed between manifold block 92 and support 68 on support plate 48.

Head<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 112 is adjustable with respect to base 114 by means of a screw 116 for adjusting the force applied by spring 110. Base 114 is mounted on support 68 by means of a screw 118. Head 112 is in abutting engagement with the radially inner end of manifold block 92. A stop 120 is mounted on manifold block 92 for engagement with outer support 72 to form an outer stop to movement of mold core assembly 76 under the force of spring 108. As noted above, female second mold segment 78 is in the form of a nest, in which preformed closure shells 122 are placed on a platform 74 that is carried by block 62. A guide 124 is mounted on platform 74 for holding the shell in position. Guide 124 includes an opening for receiving core assembly 80 of male first mold segment 76 during radial inward motion of female second mold segment 78. Rollers 54, 55 on rod 50 and support block 62 engage cams 126, 128 (<figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">FIGS. 1-3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>) that are disposed adjacent to the periphery of wheel 32. Cam 126 extends around the periphery of wheel 32 to move female second mold segments to the closed position (<figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>) and hold the mold segments closed. Cam 128 is disposed adjacent to the lower portion of wheel 32 to pull second mold segments 78 open.
