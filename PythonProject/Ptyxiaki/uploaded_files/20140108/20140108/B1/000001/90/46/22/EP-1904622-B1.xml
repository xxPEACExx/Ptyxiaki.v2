<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US60697628B"><text>Application No. US 60/697,628</text></patcit>, filed on July 8, 2005.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The invention relates generally to the field of molecular biology, biochemistry and agriculture. More particularly, the invention relates to polynucleotides suitable for regulating constitutive gene expression in plants and generation of improved transgenic plants.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">Modification of a plant trait through genetic engineering depends upon the insertion into the plant genome of a polynucleotide construct containing the gene of interest, operably linked to a promoter that is functional in the transgenic plant. Within a plant genome, any single gene is, in general, operably linked to a promoter that will determine when and where, within the plant tissues and organs, the gene should be expressed. Sometimes, it is of interest to use a promoter capable of directing the expression of the operably linked gene to most tissues of the plant. These promoters are known in the art as constitutive promoters. To be most useful, a constitutive promoter should be able to direct the expression to all cells, tissues and organs of the plant. Constitutive promoters should also preferably be able to determine the expression of the operably linked gene to the same high level in all tissues and organs, throughout the plant's life cycle. Therefore if one wants to express a gene of interest in several or all tissues or organs within a transgenic plant, constitutive promoters must be used.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In a number of situations the expression of particular genes in most or all tissues or organs confers a phenotype of interest to the plant For example, if one wants to improve the plant's disease resistance, a gene that confers such phenotype linked to a constitutive promoter is inserted, rather than using tissue-specific promoters that would allow the gene to be expressed in selected plant tissues, causing in some cases undesirable phenotypes.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Thus far, the production of genetically engineered plants expressing useful and/or desirable traits requires the availability of promoters that permit the gene or genes<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> of interest to be expressed constitutively. Thus, isolation and characterization of constitutive promoters that can serve as regulatory regions for expression of heterologous nucleotide sequences of interest in most or all tissues and organs is essential for the genetic engineering of plants.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention relates to isolated regulatory nucleic acid molecules, initially isolated from the genome of <i>Populus</i> sp, and methods for regulating constitutive expression of heterologous nucleotide sequences. It is an object of the invention to provide isolated nucleic acid molecules which function as promoters that are able to direct constitutive expression of genes of interest. The regulatory nucleic acid molecules of the present invention correspond to promoter sequences of a polyubiquitin gene, which are expressed at high and constitutive levels in tissues of <i>Populus</i> sp. When these promoters are associated in a transgenic plant with a gene, such as a heterologous gene, the gene in question is constitutively expressed at high levels in most if not all tissues of said transgenic plant Methods of using the constitutive promoters disclosed herein, for regulating expression of heterologous nucleotide sequences in a constitutive manner in a plant, are provided.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The promoters disclosed herein were identified through the analysis of a collection of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) from <i>Populus</i> sp, representing apical shoot, bark, cambium, seed, xylem, leaf and root tissues. Based on the expression profile of those ESTs among the different tissues, three polyubiquitin genes were shown to be highly and constitutively expressed in several tissues of <i>Populus.</i> The promoters of these three genes are referred to hereinafter as PdUBQ1, PdUBQ2, and PdUBQ3, respectively.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The PdUBQ promoter of the invention is set forth at SEQ ID NO.: 1. The invention further comprises nucleotide sequences having at least 95% identity to the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO.: 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">"Stringent conditions" as used herein, refers to parameters with which the art is familiar, such as hybridization in 3.5xSSC, 1xDenhardt's solution, 25mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.5% SDS, and 2mM EDTA for 18 hours at 65°C, followed by 4 washes of the filter at 65°C for 20 minutes, in 2xSSC, 0.1% SDS, and a final wash for up to 20 minutes in 0.5xSSC, 0.1% SDS, or 0.3xSSC and 0.1% SDS for greater stringency, and 0.1xSSC, 0.1% SDS for even greater stringency. Other conditions may be substituted, as long as the degree of stringency is equal to that provided herein, using a 0.5xSSC final wash.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Other facets of the present invention include constructs, such as expression vectors, comprising the promoter of the invention operably linked to a nucleotide sequence of interest, which may encode a desired protein.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA</text></nplcit>). Some of these methods are described in Example 1 <u>infra</u>, and all are incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The disclosed nucleic acid molecules typically span 2.7 kb starting at the ATG start codon for the coding region of the polyubiquitin genes in question. The isolated nucleic acid molecules are referred to herein as promoters. Promoters correspond to the nucleic acid molecules whose function is to regulate the expression of a gene. A promoter generally comprises specific signaling sequences called boxes, arranged along the promoter sequence, such that its composition determines the temporal and spatial expression of a gene that is under its regulatory control. "Promoter" or "transcriptional initiation region" means a regulatory region of DNA usually comprising a TATA box capable of directing RNA polymerase II to initiate RNA synthesis at the appropriate transcription initiation site for a particular coding sequence. A promoter may additionally comprise other recognition sequences, generally positioned upstream, or 5', to the TATA box, referred to as upstream promoter elements, which influence the transcription<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> initiation rate. It is recognized that, having identified the nucleotide sequences for the promoter regions disclosed herein, it is within the state of the art to isolate and to identify additional regulatory elements in the 5' untranslated region upstream from the particular promoter regions identified herein.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Thus the promoter regions disclosed herein are generally further defined by additional upstream regulatory elements such as those responsible for tissue and temporal expression of the coding sequence, enhancers and the like. In the same manner, the promoter elements, which enable expression of the downstream gene in most or all tissues, can be identified, isolated and used with other core promoters to confer constitutive expression.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The promoter that directs the expression of genes in most or all tissues was identified and isolated from <i>Populus</i> sp.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The native polyubiquitin genes from <i>Populus</i> sp. encode isoforms of hexameric polyubiquitin, a protein involved in the controlled degradation of cellular proteins. The polyubiquitin genes whose promoters are disclosed herein are expressed at high levels in most tissues of <i>Populus</i> sp (<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>).</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The constitutive promoter sequence of the present invention drives the expression of operably linked nucleotide sequences in a constitutive manner. Thus, the constitutive promoter sequence disclosed herein can be used to express an operably linked sequence of interest in most tissues of a plant. Since the promoter sequence disclosed herein was isolated from a dicot species, it is useful in directing the constitutive expression of operably linked genes when transformed in dicot species, although its use in monocots and gymnosperms is also contemplated, as is the resulting recombinant plants and plant parts.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In addition, the promoter of the invention can be used to inhibit the expression of genes when used in constructs together with DNA fragments from a gene of interest in the antisense orientation or in a configuration that promotes hairpin post-transcriptional gene silencing, as is known to one of skill in the art.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">"Variants" is intended to include substantially similar sequences. Naturally and non-naturally occurring "variants" of the PdUBQ promoter sequence of the invention are nucleic acid molecules having at least 95% sequence identity with SEQ ID NO: 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">"Stringent conditions", as used herein, refers to the parameters set forth <u>supra</u>.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">For purposes of the present invention, sequence identity to the promoter sequence disclosed herein may be determined, e.g., using known methodologies such as the BLAST program, or any sequence alignment program that allows the alignment of identical nucleotides and verification of mismatches between non-identical nucleotides so that the percentage of identity of compared sequences can be estimated.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The promoter of the invention may be used to constitutively express a gene of interest. For example, by using the promoter of the invention, the constitutive expression of native and/or non-native genes can be accomplished in desired tissues of a plant. The native and/or non-native genes include those encoding enzymes, transporters, cofactors, transcription factors and a number of other genes that would affect a desirable trait in plants.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">For the present invention, it is recognized that any gene of interest can be operably linked to the promoter of the invention and expressed in a plant</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The promoter of the present invention, when operably linked to a gene of interest and stably incorporated into a plant genome, drive constitutive expression of said gene of interest in all plant tissues, at high levels. It is to be recognized, of course, that the promoter disclosed herein may drive the expression of genes in some tissues more prominently than to others.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Constructs containing the promoter of the present invention and an operably linked gene of interest may be provided in expression cassettes or vectors, as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>. Such expression cassettes or vectors comprise the promoter of the present invention, operably linked to a gene of interest. Such an expression cassette or vector may contain, e.g., restriction sites for insertion of the gene of interest under the transcriptional control of the constitutive PdUBQ promoter. The expression cassette or<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> vector may additionally contain a number of other nucleotide sequences, including selectable marker genes, transcriptional and translational initiation sequences, and plant transcriptional and translational termination sequences. The termination region may be from the same group as the DNA sequence of interest or may be from the Ti-plasmid of <i>A. tumefaciens,</i> such as the octopine synthase and nopaline synthase termination regions (<nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>Gielen et al., EMBO J., 3:835-846 (1984</text></nplcit>), <nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>Depicker et al., Mol. and Appl.
