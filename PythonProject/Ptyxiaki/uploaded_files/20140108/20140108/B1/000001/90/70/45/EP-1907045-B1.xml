mxw-id="PDES63961243" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to implantable medical devices and, more particularly, to a locking connector for coupling a catheter to a device such as a drug infusion pump.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Treatment of diseases and ailments of the body often benefit from short- or long-term infusion of drugs and/or other fluids. While such medications may be administered extracorporeally, e.g., via transcutaneous injection, many patients benefit from the consistent and repeatable dosage provided by an implanted drug infusion pump. Such pumps may be used in a variety of applications such as control of pain and/or spasticity. They are well-suited to deliver infusate fluids to a targeted delivery site such as an epidural or intrathecal space of the spinal canal, or a particular location within the brain.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Drug infusion pumps are typically implanted subcutaneously, e.g., in the chest or abdominal cavity. The pump may incorporate a chamber to hold the infusate fluid. A needle-penetrable septum may also be provided and is preferably located generally directly beneath the skin. The septum allows drugs or other fluids to be introduced into the infusate chamber by transcutaneous injection. The pump may also include a fluid discharge outlet or stem through<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> which the drug is directed during delivery. The outlet is typically connected to flexible medical tubing, e.g., a catheter, leading to the targeted delivery site.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A secure and leak-free connection of the catheter to the pump outlet is beneficial to ensure correct dosage delivery to the targeted delivery site. If the connection should somehow fail, the intended infusate dosage may not reach the delivery site and, moreover, some (or all) of the infusate could undesirably be dispensed in the vicinity of the pump outlet.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As may be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the connection of the delivery catheter to the discharge outlet may be subjected to various stresses attributable to movement of the patient, as well as to other variables in patient physiology (e.g., weight changes, etc.). These factors may result in separating and/or twisting forces applied at the outlet/catheter connection that, over time, may degrade connection integrity.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Various devices have sought to improve the strength of this connection. For example, raised circular barbs provided on the outlet may resist longitudinal movement of the catheter away from the outlet. In other systems, a suture is provided in place of, or in addition to, the barbs. The sutures may cinch the catheter against the outlet, thereby providing additional resistance to relative catheter motion.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">While effective, these catheter connections have drawbacks. For example, barbed stems may not be able to withstand the tensile forces exerted on the catheter due to movements of the patient, or may result in tearing of the catheter in the vicinity of the barb. Moreover, with regard to sutured connections, inherent variability in physician suturing techniques may result in a suture that is incorrectly placed relative to the catheter and connector. As a result, the suture may occlude or otherwise interrupt normal catheter flow. Even when the suture is correctly placed, it may be cinched too tightly -- potentially cutting the catheter - or, alternatively, too loosely -- potentially reducing the , suture's ability to retain the catheter relative to the outlet. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2005030316A"><text>WO 2005/030316</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP0505930A"><text>EP 0505930</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5000614A"><text>US 5,000,614</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5423775A"><text>US 5,423,775</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US2002079696A"><text>US 2002/079696</text></patcit> disclose clip-type connectors for medical, devices such as catheters.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">Embodiments of the present invention provide connectors, methods, and systems for connecting medical tubing to medical devices, such as implantable infusion pumps, that may overcome these and other problems.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In one aspect, a connector for removably coupling a catheter to a medical device is provides as defined in claim 1.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The lock opening in the housing of certain embodiments of the invention may form at least one receiving slot configured to accommodate the locking leg of the locking member.

When the stem 202 is adequately engaged with the catheter 20 and connector 100, the pin 104 may be moved, relative to one or more lock openings 103, from an unlocked position (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2A</figref>), to a locked position (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2B</figref>). Lock openings 103 may extend generally from the exterior surface of the housing 102 to the interior surface of the housing. The lock openings 103 may form at least one receiving slot 118 that is configured to accommodate a locking leg of the locking member, whereby the locking member (e.g., pin 104) engages a groove 206 formed in the stem 202, axially securing the catheter and connector relative thereto when the locking member is in the locked position. The optional cover member or boot 106, configured to at least partially surround the housing 102, may then be<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> placed, e.g., slid, over the housing 102 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2B</figref>. The cover member 106 may be configured to reduce stress on surrounding tissue by providing a relatively smooth transition surface around the connector. It may also limit tissue growth into the connector components.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> is an enlarged perspective view of the optional cover member 106. In the illustrated embodiment, the cover member 106 forms a sleeve defining a central opening 107 to receive the catheter 20 (not shown) and the housing 102 (also not shown). The cover member may include features to assist the physician in grasping and sliding the cover member relative to the catheter 20. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the cover member includes a protruding lip 108 that provides a raised surface to assist in manipulation.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The cover member 106 may, in one embodiment, be made of silicone rubber, e.g., white ETR silicone, and may optionally be loaded (e.g., 12.5% Barium Sulfate loaded, 2% Titanium Dioxide loaded) to give the connector a degree of radiopaqueness. The use of silicone rubber provides the connector with certain benefits, e.g., a soft, impact-absorbent exterior. Alternatively, other materials may be used to provide, for example, a desired degree of rigidity to assist in holding a locking member in place.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref> illustrates the catheter 20 as it may be configured in an exemplary embodiment of the invention. As described above, the proximal end of the catheter 20 (the end that attaches to the pump 200) may include a seal 21 attached thereto, e.g., via adhesive, press fit, mechanical capture, or the like. Alternatively, the seal 21 could be over-molded with the catheter or otherwise formed as an integral portion thereof.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Suitable materials for the seal 21 may include molded silicone or polyurethane. Preferably, the seal is relatively flexible (as compared to the housing 102 described further below). However, other materials, including those that are more rigid, are certainly possible without departing from the scope of the invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In the illustrated embodiment, the seal 21 has a head or flange portion 34 defined by a generally cylindrical surface, and a body portion 32. The flange portion 34 may be substantially normal (perpendicular) to a longitudinal axis of the catheter 20. The body portion 32 may be defined by a conical or tapered surface extending from the flange portion. The catheter 20 may extend through the body portion 32 and into the flange portion 34 of the seal. A seal lumen 36, which may also be tapered, may extend from a face 38 of the seal 21 to a lumen 22 of the catheter 20. As a result, when the seal 21 is coupled to the stem 202 (see <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 7B</figref>) as further described below, the lumen 22 of the catheter 20 is in fluid communication with an infusate output of the pump 200.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The flange portion 34 of the seal 21 may form a contact surface 40 opposite the face 38. The contact surface 40 may abut or contact an abutting surface located on an interior surface of the tubular housing 102, as further described below, when the connector 100 is correctly placed.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 5A-5D</figref> illustrate various views of the exemplary housing 102 of the connector illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2A-2B</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 5A-5D</figref>, the housing 102 may form a generally bell-shaped component that may slide over the catheter 20 and seal 21, and at least partially surround and hold the catheter and seal in place relative to the stem 202 of the pump 200.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5A</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the housing 102. A stepped lumen 110 (visible in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5B</figref>) may extend through the housing, wherein the lumen includes a first inner diameter 112 and a second inner diameter 114. The first and second inner diameters correspond generally to the outer diameters of the flange portion 34 and body portion 32 of the seal 21, respectively. The transition between the two diameters may form an abutting surface 116 that selectively abuts the contact surface 40 of the flange portion 34, as further described below.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The housing 102 may also include one or more lock openings which may take the form of passageways, cutouts, or receiving slots 118 (the latter shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 5A-5D</figref>) configured to accommodate the locking member. In the illustrated embodiment, two receiving slots 118 are provided in the housing 102<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> (see e.g., <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5C</figref>) to accommodate two locking legs which may together form a substantially U-shaped locking member (e.g., pin 104).

For example, the housing may be made, e.g., machined or molded, from a material that is relatively rigid compared to the seal 21. Materials such as titanium, stainless steel, and rigid plastic are contemplated.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 6A-6D</figref> illustrated an exemplary locking member, e.g., a resilient U-shaped pin 104.

The legs 122, when moved into the locked position, may each define a secant with respect to a cross section of the lumen 110 of the housing 102. As a result, the legs may engage the stem 202 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6C</figref>. Further, each leg 122 may include a protruding foot 124 (see <figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 6A-6C</figref>) that engages the window 119 (see <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 5A-5D</figref>). The foot 124 may assist in guiding the pin 104 during movement. Moreover, the foot 124 may contact stop portions 126 located on the interior surface of the housing 102 as the pin 104 is withdrawn from the receiving slot (see <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6B</figref>), thereby limiting or preventing the pin from separating from the housing once the pin and housing are assembled (e.g., the pin may be captivated by the receiving slot).</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In the illustrated embodiment, the pin 104 may also include one or more first lock tabs 128 and one or more second lock tabs 130 that assist in maintaining or securing the pin 104 in the locked position (see <figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 6C and 6D</figref>). For example, once the connector 100 is coupled to the stem 202 of the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> pump 200, the pin 104 may be moved from the unlocked position of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6B</figref> to the locked position of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6C</figref>. When in the locked position, the legs 122 of the pin 104 engage the groove 206 of the stem 202, thereby securing the connector 100 to the stem. To maintain the pin in the locked position, the first lock tabs 128 are configured to contact the stop portions 126 of the housing 102 when the pin is moved from the locked position. Similarly, the second lock tabs 130 are configured to contact the stem 202 when the pin 104 is moved from the locked position. As a result, the first and second lock tabs may assist in keeping the pin 104 from inadvertently moving from the locked position. While illustrated with both first and second lock tabs, alternative embodiments may achieve locking of the pin with only one set of lock tabs, e.g., the first lock tabs 128 or the second lock tabs 130 may be optional.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The pin 104 may move between the unlocked position and the locked position by deflecting sufficiently for the lock tabs 128 and 130 to move past the stop portions 126 and stem 202, respectively. Stated another way, the pin 104 may have snap-fit engagement with the housing 102 and stem 202. As a result, full engagement of the pin 104 may be indicated by tactile or even auditory feedback to the physician.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">While the pin 104 may be made from most any bio-compatible material, it is preferably made from a material that provides it with adequate rigidity to remain in the locked position of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6C</figref>. Yet, it is preferably flexible enough to permit the snap-fit interrelation with the housing 102 and the stem 202. Suitable materials may include titanium, stainless steel, and rigid plastic.

With reference to <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 7B</figref>, the pin 104 is shown with the legs 122 engaged with the groove 206 of the stem 202. When the pin 104 is so engaged, the tip of the stem 202 preferably extends into the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> catheter 20 to form a substantially leak-free seal directly therewith. Moreover, the abutting surface 116 of the housing 102 is preferably positioned to abut the contact surface 40 of the seal 21. As a result, the flange portion 34 of the seal 21 is biased against the stem 202 to form a compression seal. Moreover, the second inner diameter 114 (see <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5B</figref>) of the housing 102 and the opening 107 (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>) of the cover member 106 may engage the tapered surface of the body portion 32 with interference fit. However, in other embodiments, these components may provide a clearance fit.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">While the connector assemblies illustrated herein may be scaled for use with most any size catheter, an exemplary infusion pump/catheter connector as shown herein may utilize a catheter 20 having an outer diameter of about 1 mm.
