Most of the plasticizing compounds are produced from petroleum-derived feedstocks that are expensive and non-renewable. Certain plasticizer compounds are prepared from reviewable raw materials such as triglycerides of vegetable oils, typically by epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acid fragments. However, epoxidized triglycerides have significant limitations and cannot be satisfactorily used as primary plasticizers, because their compatibility with poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) polymers is limited.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Certain esters of aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as esters of sebacic and azelaic acids are produced from various unsaturated fatty acid compounds.

The ester compounds are produced from abundant and inexpensive renewable materials such as unsaturated fatty acid esters and levulinic acid esters. Epoxide groups of monoepoxidized unsaturated fatty acid esters are reacted with levulinic esters in the presence of a suitable catalyst, typically a protic acid or a Lewis acid, to form ketals of levulinic esters of dihydroxylated fatty acid esters. Similarly, levulinic acid esters react with bis-epoxidized and tris-epoxidized unsaturated fatty acid esters derived from unsaturated fatty acid esters having two or three double bonds, thereby yielding corresponding bis-ketals and tris-ketals. Additionally, levulinic acid and angelicalactone can be used in combination or in place of levulinic acid ester in reactions with epoxidized unsaturated fatty acid esters.

<ul><li><u>Unsaturated fatty acids</u> mean linear monocarboxylic acids having from 10 to 24 carbon atoms and at least one double bond. The double bonds can be in any position, conjugated with each other or non-conjugated, but not in allenic arrangements, and any of the double bonds can be independently cis or trans. Preferably, unsaturated fatty acids have one to three double bonds. Fatty acids can also be composed of a mixture of various unsaturated and saturated fatty acids, for example, as in the triglycerides of various vegetable oils, fish oils, and palm oils.</li><li><u>Esters of unsaturated fatty acids</u> mean esters of the above-described fatty acids with monohydiic or with polyhydric alcohols.</li><li><u>Monohydric alcohols</u> are linear or branched primary or secondary alkanols or alkoxyalkanols having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Preferred examples of alkanols are methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, secondary butanol, isobutanol, isoamyl alcohol, 2-ethylhexanol. Preferred alkoxyalkanols are primary or secondary alcohols having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, wherein a linear, branched, or cyclic alkoxy group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms is located at a vicinal position to the hydroxyl group. Such alkoxyalkanols are typically derived by opening an alkyl oxirane with an alkanol. Another suitable example of an alkoxyalkanol is tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol readily accessible via hydrogenation of furfural. The most preferred are monohydric alcohols due to their availability, cost and satisfactory stability of their esters.</li><li><u>Polyhydric alcohols</u> are linear or branched polyhydroxylated alkanes having from 1 to 6 hydroxyl groups. Typical examples are ethylene glycol, propylene 1,2-and 1,3-diols, butylene glycol isomers, glycerol, 1,2,4-trihydroxybutane, pentaerythritol, xylitol, ribitol, sorbitol, mannitol, and galactitol. Polyhydric alcohols can optionally contain one or more ether bonds, and suitable examples of such polyhydric alcohols are isosorbide, sorbitane isomers, and diglycerol.</li></ul></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">It is preferred that substantially all hydroxyl groups of the polyhydric alcohol are esterified with an unsaturated fatty acid group. It is understood that in<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the industrial practice it may not be practical to achieve a full esterification. It is also understood that in the industrial practice, where mixed fatty acid compositions are used, not all of the fatty acid groups can be unsaturated and some fully saturated fatty acid groups can be present. In fact, it is cost-advantageous to use mixtures of unsaturated and saturated fatty acid esters such as present in triglycerides of typical vegetable oils (e.g. soybean oil, linseed oil, canola oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, castor oil, their blends and the like). It is preferred, however, that the mixed fatty acid esters contain predominantly unsaturated fatty acid esters. It is also preferred that a fatty acid ester with a high content of mono-unsaturated fatty acid ester is used, such as compositions found in high oleic canola oil. Esters of 10-undecylenic acid are also preferred. Another preferred starting material is a mixture of methyl esters of fatty acids derived by trans-esterification of vegetable oils (e.g., of soybean oil, canola oil and other unsaturated triglycerides commonly used in the industrial production of various biodiesel fuels).</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Various unsaturated fatty acid esters can be optionally blended, mixed, partially hydrogenated, or otherwise isomerized to change position or stereochemistry of the double bonds.
<ul><li><u>Epoxidized unsaturated fatty acid ester</u> means that at least one of the double bonds of the unsaturated fatty acid ester is oxidized to an epoxy group. Such oxidations are well known in the art and can be readily accomplished in an industrial scale, e.g., by using hydrogen peroxide and a carboxylic acid (e.g., formate or acetate), or by the halohydrin method. It is preferred, however, that epoxidation of a majority or all of the double bonds present in the unsaturated fatty acid ester is accomplished. It is understood that in practice, epoxidized fatty acid esters may contain various quantities of by-products arising from hydrolysis or rearrangement of epoxides and from cross-linking of the fatty acid chains. Use of epoxidized fatty acid esters containing small quantities of epoxidation by-products and epoxide decomposition by-products is fully within the scope of the present disclosure.</li><li><u>Levulinic esters</u> are esters of levulinic (4-oxopentanoic) acid and a monohydric alcohol. However, the monohydric alcohol fragment in the levulinic<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> ester is selected independently from the monohydric alcohol fragment of the unsaturated fatty acid esters, and thus can be the same or different. Levulinic esters can optionally be mixtures of levulinic esters with more than one monohydric alcohol.</li><li><u>Polymers</u>. Poly(vinyl chloride) polymers, PVC, are homopolymers or copolymers of vinyl chloride. Many PVC compounds of various degree of polymerization, cross-linking and co-polymer composition are known in the art and are produced industrially.</li></ul></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates), PHA, are polyester homopolymers or copolymers of 3-hydroxyalkanoic acids. Preferably, PHA is composed of linear 3-hydroxyalkanoic fragments having from 3 to 18 carbon atom atoms. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), PHB, is a homopolymer that is produced biologically, for example by various microorganisms. A pure PHB polymer is a brittle polymer having a narrow range of processing temperatures, and it decomposes readily at temperatures that are only 20-30 °C above its melting temperature.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Poly(lactate), or poly(lactide), PLA, is a known polyester homopolymer comprising repeat units of lactic acid of various stereochemistry.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Polysaccharides are homopolymers and co-polymers, linear or branched, comprising hexose or pentose fragments connected via glycosyl linkages. The polysaccharides may optionally contain various additional groups such as acylamido groups, sulfate ester groups, carboxylic ester groups, alkyl and hydroxyalkyl ether groups and the like. Such additional groups may be present in polysaccharides derived from natural sources or can be artificially introduced (i.e., by acylation of cellulose). Examples of polysaccharides include acylated derivatives of cellulose and starch, as well as native or acylated chitin and pectin.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><u>Plasticizers</u> are chemical compounds added to a base composition comprising one or more of the above polymers with the purpose of lowering the glass transition temperature of the polymer composition, thereby making the composition more flexible and amenable to processing, e.g., by melt extrusion or molding. Plasticizers are typically used at various effective concentrations, and depending on the polymer used and desired properties of the compounded polymer<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> formulations, plasticizers can be used at concentrations between 1 and 80% by weight of the unplasticized polymer. It is understood that, depending on the polymer and the plasticizer used, plasticizers can also confer other changes in physical and mechanical properties of the compounded polymer, as well as changes in barrier properties of the compounded polymer in respect to its permeability for various gases, water, water vapor, or organic compounds. It is also understood that one or more different plasticizers can be used in various blends with additional compounds for the preparation of an extrudable or moldable polymer composition. Such additional compounds can include various inorganic and organic filler compounds, wood dust, reinforcing fibers, dyes, pigments, stabilizers, lubricants, anti-microbial additives, and the like.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The plasticizers are typically mixed with polymer and other optional components of the base composition by mixing in various compounding equipment well known in the art at the temperatures that are above or below of the melting temperature of the polymer. The plasticizers can also be introduced with the help of an optional volatile solvent.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Ketal derivatives of levulinic acid are prepared by reacting an epoxidized unsaturated fatty acid ester with a sufficient quantity of levulinic ester in the presence of a suitable catalyst, thereby resulting in a variety of compounds that are covalent adducts between the fatty acid ester fragments and levulinic fragment.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to one such reaction, a ketal ester compound of formula (3) is readily formed:
<chemistry id="chem0007" num="0007"><img id="ib0007" file="imgb0007.tif" wi="125" he="28" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry>
wherein (2) is a levulinate ester, (1) is an epoxidized unsaturated fatty acid ester showing the epoxy group, (3) is the ketal ester adduct, and R<sup>1</sup> is a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>10</sub> linear or branched alkyl or alkoxyalkyl.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">For example, according to this reaction, a readily available ester of 9,10-epoxidized oleic ester is converted to the ketal of formula (4):

wherein R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>2</sup> are each independently a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>10</sub> linear or branched alkyl or alkoxyalkyl.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Typically, catalysts for reacting various epoxides with ketones include various acids. Such conditions are generally applicable to the reactions of levulinate esters with the epoxidized unsaturated fatty acid esters. Non-limiting examples of such catalysts include strong mineral acids, such as sulfuric, hydrochloric, hydrofluoroboric, hydrobromic acids, <i>p</i>-toluenesulfonic acid, camphorosulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, and like. Various resins that contain protonated sulfonic acid groups are also useful as they can be easily recovered after completion of the reaction. Examples of acids also include Lewis acids.

However, the temperature of the reaction mixture is not critical for succeeding in making a quantity of the levulinic ketal product, as even with less active catalysts the reaction still proceeds to yield the desired compounds. Amount and type of catalyst depends on the specific chemical composition of the epoxide and levulinate ester used in the reaction and can be readily established by one skilled in the art. The reaction can be carried out in the presence of an optional cosolvent that is inert under reaction conditions and is typically removed at the end of the reaction by distillation. Typically, it is desired to use sufficient quantity of a cosolvent (or a sufficient excess of levulinate ester) to minimize cross-linking of the epoxidized fatty acid esters via ether bond formation. Non-limiting preferred examples of suitable co-solvents include saturated hydrocarbons, ethers, and carboxylic esters of simple alkanols and alkanoic acids.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Similarly to mono-epoxides, bis-epoxides of unsaturated fatty esters are converted to a mixture of stereoisomers comprising bis-ketals of levulinic ester.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">When mono- or bis-epoxides of unsaturated fatty acid esters react with ethyl levulinate, the reaction of bis-epoxides of fatty acid may be accompanied by other competing reactions.

Depending on the specific conditions used, the liquid comprises the levulinic ketals of vicinal dihydroxy derivatives of unsaturated fatty acid esters and/or mixtures of the alkyloxy- levulinoyl- compounds. These latter compounds can comprise ether bonds connecting two carbon atoms of the unsaturated fatty acid chain (thereby forming a tetrahydrofuran or a tetrahydropyran ring).</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The levulinic adducts are useful as plasticizer compounds for PVC, poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates), poly(lactate), and various polysaccharide polymers.

Such removal is typically accomplished by distilling out the esters of saturated fatty acids under reduced pressure and elevated temperature sufficient to commence distillation of the saturated esters but not the ketal adducts. Such conditions for distillation may vary,<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> depending on temperature and vacuum used, as well as on type of distillation hardware known in the art. It has been found that ketal adducts, such as compounds (4), (11), (12), and (13) have high boiling temperatures that are typically 25-100° C higher than those of the corresponding saturated fatty esters, and such large difference in the boiling point allows for efficient removal of saturated fatty esters using simple distillation equipment such as falling film columns or other distillation columns with a relatively low number of theoretical plates. It has been found that partial or substantial removal of the saturated fatty esters from the mixtures of adducts of levulinic esters with epoxidized unsaturated fatty acid esters results in the formation of a mixture of ketal adducts with improved plasticizing properties, improved compatibility and minimized or negligible exudation, and reduced or absent odor. It has also been found that monoketal adducts of levulinic esters with epoxidized unsaturated fatty acid esters (typically, exemplified by the ketals of formula (4)) can be effectively distilled out of the reaction mixtures comprising bis- and tris-ketal adducts (typically, exemplified by ketals of formulae (11)-(13)). Such distillations are typically performer under vacuum or under reduced pressure, and can provide for a high purity monoketal compound in practically colorless and odorless form.

PVC compatibility and exudation properties were also found to be superior to that of epoxidized soybean oil and bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate at the plasticizer concentrations tested.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">An optimal combination of the plasticizing efficacy and compatibility was observed under the conditions tested when mixtures of the plasticizer compound<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> comprised predominantly monoketal (4) and/or diketal (11) having R<sup>1</sup> = R<sup>2</sup> = ethyl or n-butyl. Furthermore, the samples of the mixtures of plasticizers comprising monoketal (4) and diketal (11), wherein the concentration of alkyl hexadecanoate and alkyl octadecanoate was at about 5% or less by weight of the plasticizer, exhibited better compatibility of the plasticizer with PVC and showed virtually no exudation as compared to those samples in which the concentration of alkyl hexadecanoate and alkyl octadecanoate was in excess of about 5%.</p><heading id="h0021"><i>EXAMPLE 42</i></heading><p id="p0062" num="0062">Samples of plasticized PHB, (poly(3-hydroxybutyrate, natural origin, Tm 172 °C, supplied by Sigma-Aldrich Cat.
