been proposed a method of controlling a braking force of an electromagnetic brake to set a deceleration of a car at an emergency stop to a predetermined value based on a deceleration command and a speed signal (for example, see Patent Document 1). By this method, the elevator can stop at the deceleration neither too high nor too low even at the emergency stop to prevent a human body from being affected by an excessive deceleration. Therefore, even on the end floor, the elevator can stop within an allowable stop distance.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP7157211A"><text>JP-A-07-157 211</text></patcit>.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Disclosure of the Invention</u></heading><heading id="h0004"><u>Problem to be Solved by the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The conventional example has a problem in that the high reliability of a control system or a state sensor is not ensured, and therefore the control system or the state sensor cannot be adapted to a product.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention is devised to solve the problem as described above and has an object to provide an emergency stop system for an elevator, which compares two-or-more-system state sensors and control systems to detect a failure in the control systems or the state sensors without fail to stop braking force control at the occurrence of the failure or to use a normal system, thereby safely braking an elevator even at the occurrence of the failure to cause the elevator to make an emergency stop.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0005"><u>Means for solving the Problem</u></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">An emergency stop system for an elevator according to the present invention includes: a state sensor for detecting an operation of a car; a brake device for braking the car; a brake controller for outputting a signal for operating the brake device based on a signal detected by the state sensor; and an uninterruptible power supply device for supplying electric power to the state sensor, the brake device, and the brake controller, in which: the brake controller includes: a signal processing/ calculating unit for calculating a deceleration of the car based on the signal detected by the state sensor; a command value calculating unit for calculating a command value for operating the brake device based on the deceleration of the car, which is calculated by the signal processing/calculating unit; and a power monitoring device for monitoring a state of the uninterruptible power supply device; and at least any one of the state sensor, the signal processing/calculating unit, and the command value calculating unit has a plurality of independent systems.</p><heading id="h0006"><u>Effects of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The emergency stop system for an elevator according to the present invention detects a failure in a control system or a state sensor without fail through the comparison between the results output from multiple detection means and calculation means to stop braking force control or to use a normal system at the occurrence of a failure.

In each of the drawings, the same reference numeral denotes the same or equivalent part.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, in an elevator, a main rope 13 which connects a car 15 and a counterweight 14 is looped around a sheave 12. Normally, the sheave 12 is rotated by a hoisting machine 11 to move the main rope 13 and the car 15 and the counterweight 14, which are connected to the main rope 13, by a friction force between the sheave 12 and the main rope 13. A speed governor 16 is a device which pulls up a speed governor rope 17 moving in tandem therewith to operate a safety device to stop the car 15 when the car 15 is lowered at an excessively high speed. During a normal operation, the speed governor 16 rotationally operates in tandem with the movement of the car 15.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Since the emergency stop system for an elevator has an object to control a deceleration, a speed, and a position of the car 15 according to determined<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> target values, the emergency stop system for an elevator includes a state sensor for detecting a deceleration, a speed, or a position of a part moving in tandem with the car 15 or a load applied to the counterweight 14 or the car 15.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The emergency stop system for an elevator according to the first embodiment has independent two-system encoders corresponding to a first speed governor encoder (first state sensor) 1 and a second speed governor encoder (second state sensor) 2, and estimates the movement of the car 15 based on the decelerations detected by the speed governor encoders or the like. Signals detected by the two-system speed governor encoders 1 and 2 are input to a brake controller 31.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The brake controller 31 outputs signals for operating the brake to a first brake coil 23 and a second brake coil 24 based on the signals detected by the speed governor encoders 1 and 2. In this first embodiment, a so-called electromagnetic brake is supposed as a brake device. The brake device pushes braking members (first brake plunger 21 and second brake plunger 22) against a member to be braked (brake pulley 25) with an elastic force of an elastic member to brake the member to be braked with a friction force.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">When the circuits (first brake coil 23 and second brake coil 24) are energized, an electromagnetic force acts on the braking members 21 and 22 in a direction reacting against the elastic force to separate the braking members 21 and 22 from the member to be braked 25. When a power supply from the power source is shut off, the brake device brakes the car 15 with the maximum braking force.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> illustrates an example showing a configuration of the brake controller 31 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig 1</figref>. The brake controller 31 includes a sensor signal processing unit 41 for processing the signals received from the speed governor encoders 1 and 2, a command calculating unit 42 for calculating command values based on the processed sensor signals to output the calculated command values to the brake coils 23 and 24, and a power monitoring device 43 for monitoring a state of an uninterruptible power supply device 32 to output a command according to the monitored state. In the drawing, each dotted arrow indicates the transfer of the signal, whereas each solid arrow indicates the power supply.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Next, an operation of the emergency stop system for an elevator according to this first embodiment will be described referring to the drawings. <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> is a flowchart illustrating an operation of the brake controller of the emergency stop system for an elevator according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The brake controller 31 receives an emergency stop command signal from an elevator operating device such as a control board to start the operation based on the received signal (Step 101).</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The power monitoring device 43 monitors a state of electric power supplied from the uninterruptible power supply device 32 to the entire brake control system. When the supplied electric power is unstable, the power monitoring device 43 feeds a power fail signal for stopping the brake control to the command calculating unit 42 (Step 102).</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The sensor signal processing unit 41 calculates deceleration of the car based on the signals detected by the first speed governor encoder 1 and the second speed governor encoder 2. The sensor signal processing unit 41 has two-system signal processing/calculating units corresponding to a first signal processing/calculating unit 51 and a second signal processing/calculating unit 52, each independently performing a calculation. First, each of the signal processing/calculating units 51 and 52 calculates a state quantity of the elevator, such as the deceleration based on the signals obtained from the speed governor encoders 1 and 2.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The results are compared in each of the calculating units to detect a malfunction of the encoder. For example, when a difference between the state quantity calculated by the two-system encoders 1 and 2 the state quantity calculated by the two-system encoder 2 is smaller than a predetermined value in the first signal processing/calculating unit 51, or is less than the predetermined value (first predetermined value), it can be determined that the both encoders 1 and 2 operate normally. When the difference is larger than the predetermined value, or is equal to or larger than the predetermined value (first predetermined value), it can be determined that at least one of the encoders malfunctions (Step 103). The same process is performed in the second signal processing/calculating unit 52.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Next, when each of the encoders 1 and 2 operates normally, the state quantities of the elevator, which are calculated by the signal processing/calculating units 51 and 52, respectively, are compared with each other to determine that the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> calculations are correct. The first signal processing/calculating unit 51 calculates the state quantities of the elevator, such as the decelerations based on the signals obtained from the speed governor encoders 1 and 2 to compare an average value of the state quantities with an average value of the state quantities of the elevator, which are calculated by the second signal processing/calculating unit 52.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Similarly, the second signal processing/calculating unit 52 calculates the state quantities of the elevator, such as the decelerations based on the signals obtained from the speed governor encoders 1 and 2 to compare an average value of the state quantities with an average value of the state quantities of the elevator, which are calculated by the first signal processing/calculating unit 51.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Even in this case, when a difference between the state quantities calculated by the two-system signal processing/calculating units 51 and 52 is smaller than a predetermined value, or is less than the predetermined value (second predetermined value), it can be determined that the signal processing/calculating units 51 and 52 both operate normally. When the difference is larger than the predetermined value, or is equal to or larger than the predetermined value (second predetermined value), it can be determined that at least one of the signal processing/calculating units malfunctions (Step 104).</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">When it is determined that the speed governor encoders 1 and 2 and the signal processing/calculating units 51 and 52 all operate normally, the sensor signal processing unit 41 outputs, for example, the average value of the state quantities of the elevator, which are calculated by the first signal processing/calculating unit 41 and the second signal processing/calculating unit 52, respectively, to the command calculating unit 42. Processing of obtaining the average value in a plurality of systems is the same in the other processing or in a second embodiment.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">It should be noted that in some cases, any one of the state quantities of the elevator, which are calculated by the first signal processing/calculating unit 51 and the second signal processing/calculating unit 52, respectively, may be output to the command calculating unit 42. The same is applied to the other processing or the second embodiment. When it is determined that any of the speed governor encoders 1 and 2 and the signal processing/calculating units 51 and 52 does not operate normally,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the sensor signal processing unit 41 feeds a detection fail signal for stopping the brake control to the command calculating unit 42.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Next, the command calculating unit 42 calculates a command value for operating the brake and gives commands to the brake and the power source. The command calculating unit has two-system command value calculating units corresponding to a first command value calculating unit 61 and a second command value calculating unit 62, each independently calculating the command value to be provided for the brake. If the detection fail signal or the power fail signal is not input to the command calculating unit 42, the command values each are calculated by the command value calculating units 61 and 62 based on the state qualities of the elevator.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The command values calculated by the two command value calculating units are compared with each other to determine that the calculations in the command value calculating units are correct. Even in this case, as being performed in the signal processing/calculating units, when a difference between the state quantities calculated by the two-system command value calculating units 61 and 62 is smaller than a predetermined value, or is less than the predetermined value (third predetermined value), it is determined that the command value calculating units both operate normally to calculate the command values normally. When the difference is larger than the predetermined value, or is equal to or larger than the predetermined value (third predetermined value), it is determined that at least any one of the command value calculating units malfunctions to prevent the command values from being normally calculated (Step 105).</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">When it is determined that the command value calculating units 61 and 62 operate normally, an average value of the each calculated brake operation commands is fed from the brake controller 31 to the brake device (Steps 106 and 107). In this case, the brake device is required to be controlled after the determination of a target value which can realize a deceleration which does not adversely affect a passenger in the car 15 and the elevator system, and when the brake controller 31 has information of the position of the car, is moderated within the range that avoids the car 15 from entering the end of a shaft.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">When it is determined that the command value is not calculated<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> normally or the detection fail signal or the power fail signal is input, the brake coils 23 and 24 are de-energized. Further, a signal for stopping power feeding from the uninterruptible power supply device 32 is output to the uninterruptible power supply device 32 to shut off the power supply itself. As a result, it can be ensured that the car is prevented from entering the end of the shaft at a dangerous speed.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The uninterruptible power supply device 32 can supply electric power even in an emergency and has power storage ability. When a normal power source is not available, the stored power is supplied. Moreover, if it is determined that the stored power is always used in an emergency, the amount of power supply for keeping the brake in a released state is limited. As a result, since the upper limit of a time period, in which the brake is in the released state, can be ensured, added safety is ensured.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In addition, as a method of further enhancing the safety of the emergency stop system for an elevator, the following methods are conceived. In one method, the brake controller 31 has a timer function. After an elapse of a given period of time, or when the deceleration after an elapse of a given period of time is smaller than a predetermined value, a brake command is output.
