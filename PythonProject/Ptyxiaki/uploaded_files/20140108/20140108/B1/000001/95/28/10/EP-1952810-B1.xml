load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b><u>Background of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to the treatment of breast cancer with 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4-OHT).</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Breast cancer constitutes a significant health problem for women in the United States and throughout the world. Despite advances in detection and treatment of the disease, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women, affecting more than 180,000 women in the United States alone each year. For women in North America, the life-time odds of getting breast cancer are one in eight.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">No universally successful method for preventing or treating breast cancer currently exists. Management of the disease relies on a combination of early diagnosis (through routine breast screening procedures) and aggressive treatment, which may include one or more of a variety of treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy. These therapies are dangerous, toxic, costly, and often ineffective, especially in the treatment of metastatic disease.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The most commonly prescribed hormonal medication for breast cancer is tamoxifen. It works by blocking the effects of estrogen, which promotes the growth of breast cancer cells. As a treatment for breast cancer, tamoxifen slows or stops the growth of cancer cells that are already present in the body, and helps prevent recurrences and the development of new cancers. Taking tamoxifen for 5 years reduces the risk of recurrence by about half in patients with estrogen receptor positive cancers. Tamoxifen also decreases the incidence of breast cancer involving the opposite breast (contralateral) in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Moreover, tamoxifen has recently been found to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in women at high risk of developing this disease.<br/>
In spite of its benefits, tamoxifen has significant drawbacks. Its action potentially impacts on every estrogen receptor bearing cell in the body, and, as both an agonist and antagonist, tamoxifen provokes a wide range of systemic effects. These effects increase<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the risk of endometrial cancer, endometrial hyperplasia and polyps, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, changes in liver enzyme levels, and ocular toxicities, including cataracts. Additionally, patients treated with oral tamoxifen reported having hot flashes, vaginal discharge, depression, amenorrhea, and nausea (Ibis, 2002; Fentiman 1986, 1988, 1989).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Due to tamoxifen's drawbacks, some cancer researchers have proposed using 4-hydroxy tamoxifen, a metabolite of tamoxifen, for breast cancer. In <i>in vitro</i> studies, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen inhibits the growth of both normal and cancerous breast cells (Nomura, 1985; Malet, 1988, 2002; Charlier, 1995). Additionally, transdermally delivered 4-hydroxy tamoxifen exhibits an anti-tumor effect on human breast tumors grown subcutaneously in mice (<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5904930A"><text>U.S. patent No. 5,904,930</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US4919937A"><text>US 4,919,937</text></patcit> discloses a percutaneous gel comprising 4-hydroxytamoxifen and progesterone for the treatment of conditions of the breast.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5904930A"><text>US 5,904,930</text></patcit> discloses a transdermal patch comprising tamoxifen derivative and an absorption-promoting additive for systemic administration.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Kuttenn et al. (Contracept. Fertil. Sex., 1991, 19, 2, 165-171</text></nplcit>) discloses that 4-hydroxytamoxifen passes the cutaneous barrier and is found preferentially in the tumor tissue, in estradiol receptor rich subcellular fractions and to a lesser extent in the normal tissue.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Limited experiments in humans have shown that percutaneously administered 4-hydroxy tamoxifen can concentrate in local breast tumors, with very little systemic distribution (Mauvais-Jarvis, 1986). However, the most extended reported study of this sort, in which patients were treated for three weeks, showed that breast tissue concentrations of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen administered percutaneously remained lower than those observed after oral tamoxifen treatment (Pujol, 1995). Accordingly, the researchers concluded that they could not propose percutaneous 4-hydroxy tamoxifen as an alternative tamoxifen treatment.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Importantly, none of the reported studies regarding 4-hydroxy tamoxifen in humans has evaluated an anti-tumor effect. This failure leaves wide open the most important question - whether percutaneously administered 4-hydroxy tamoxifen actually exerts any effect on breast cancer in humans. Therefore, a strong need still exists for breast cancer treatments and prophylactics that provoke few systemic side effects.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>Summary of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention relates to the treatment of breast cancer by administering 4-hydroxy tamoxifen. This treatment approach, implemented topically, effectively reduces tumor tissue proliferation and results in lower plasma drug levels than oral tamoxifen.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present application also describes prevention of breast cancer by administering 4-hydroxy tamoxifen. As with the treatment approach, the prophylactic approach also is preferably implemented topically.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The subject of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition for percutaneous administration comprising 4-hydroxy tamoxifen and isopropyl myristate as a penetration enhancer for use in treating breast cancer.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">For purposes of prophylaxis or treatment, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen may be administered by any means that delivers it to estrogen receptor-bearing cells <i>in vivo.</i> According to the invention the administration is done percutaneously (topically), to avoid the first-pass effect and related liver metabolism of the 4-hydroxy tamoxifen. For percutaneous administration, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen may be applied to any skin surface. Application to the breasts is advantageous because 4-hydroxy tamoxifen tends to concentrate in local subcutaneous tissues with estrogen receptors when administered percutaneously.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A broad range of topical formulations are suitable for performing the invention, but hydroalcoholic solutions and hydroalcoholic gels are preferred. The concentration of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen in these formulations may vary, but a dose should result in local 4-hydroxy tamoxifen tissue concentrations that effectively oppose estrogenic driven effects.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Brief Description of the Figures</u></b></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> illustrates the metabolism of tamoxifen.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> illustrates the mean plasma concentration of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen in healthy women following cutaneous administration.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003 f0004">Figure 3</figref> illustrates the concentration of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen in tissues, according to mode of administration and dosage.

Moreover, percutaneously administered 4-hydroxy tamoxifen results in lower plasma levels of the drug than the standard dose of oral tamoxifen, which translates to fewer adverse side effects. Accordingly, percutaneous 4-hydroxy tamoxifen is an alternative to tamoxifen for both treatment and prophylaxis in this context.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The inventors have performed the first study to demonstrate that 4-hydroxy tamoxifen reduces breast tumor proliferation <i>in vivo</i> in humans (see Example 4, below). In brief, they administered 4-hydroxy tamoxifen gel percutaneously to human patients diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. After only 2-3 weeks of administration, the inventors observed dose-related reductions in tumor tissue proliferation indexes, with the highest dose (2.0 mg/day) showing approximate equivalence to a standard dose of oral tamoxifen. The tumor tissue proliferation indexes evaluated were Ki67 (Gerdes 1984; Schluter 1993) and Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) (Waseem, 1990). Although percutaneous 4-hydroxy tamoxifen gel and oral tamoxifen were equivalent in reducing tumor tissue proliferation, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen plasma levels were consistently lower in patients receiving 4-hydroxy tamoxifen gel.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The compound 4-hydroxy tamoxifen, or 1-[4-(2-N-dimethylaminoethoxy)phenyl]-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylbut-1-ene, constitutes an active metabolite of the well characterized anti-estrogen compound, tamoxifen. Due to the presence of a double bond between two carbon atoms, 4- hydroxy tamoxifen exists in two stereoisomeric forms. According to the medical and biochemical literature, isomeric forms of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen are commonly designated as <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> isomers. From a purely chemical perspective, however, this designation is not strictly accurate because each double bonded carbon atom does not contain an identical chemical group. Therefore, it is more appropriate to refer to the isomers as E (the so-called cis form) and Z (the so-called trans form) configurations. Both the E and Z isomers of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen, either alone or in combination, are useful according to the present invention. The Z isomer is preferred, however, because it is more active than the <i>E</i> isomer.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">4-Hydroxy tamoxifen acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that exhibits tissue-specificity for estrogen receptive tissues. In breast tissue, it functions as an estrogen antagonist. Studies have shown that 4-hydroxy tamoxifen can regulate the transcriptional activity of estrogen-related receptors, which may contribute to its tissue-specific activity. In vitro, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen exhibits more potency than tamoxifen, as measured by binding affinity to estrogen receptors, or ERs, and a binding affinity similar to estradiol for estrogen receptors (Robertson <i>et al</i>., 1982; Kuiper <i>et al</i>., 1997). Z-4-hydroxy tamoxifen inhibits the growth in culture of normal human epithelial breast cells 100 fold more than Z-tamoxifen (Malet <i>et al</i>., 1988).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Although 4-hydroxy tamoxifen is a tamoxifen metabolite, its usefulness for breast cancer is not presaged by previous experience with tamoxifen itself. Tamoxifen is extensively metabolized in humans, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. Thus, its action in vivo is the net result of individual actions by the parent compound and its metabolite compounds competing for the occupation of receptors within target tissues. For example, see Jordan, 1982. Each of these compounds manifests different and unpredictable biological activities in different cells, determined in part by each compound's individual effect on estrogen receptor conformation. That is, estrogen receptor binding of each compound generates a unique receptor-ligand conformation that recruits different cofactors, and results in varying pharmacologies for the different compounds (Wijayaratne <i>et al</i>., 1999; Giambiagi <i>et al</i>., 1988).</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Several examples of these varying effects have been documented. For instance, tamoxifen but not 4-hydroxy tamoxifen is a potent rat liver carcinogen. (Carthew <i>et al.,</i> 2001; Sauvez <i>et al.,</i> 1999). Additionally, tamoxifen but not 4-hydroxy tamoxifen reportedly initiates apoptosis in p53(-) normal human mammary epithelial cells (Dietze <i>et al</i>., 2001). By contrast, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen exhibits a significant inhibitory effect on estrone sulphatase activity in mammary cancer cell lines, while tamoxifen has little or no effect in this regard (Chetrite <i>et al., 1993).</i></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Previous studies with 4-hydroxy tamoxifen also did not predict its effectiveness for breast cancer treatment and prevention. The ability of any drug to inhibit tumor cell growth <i>in vitro</i> or in a xenograft assay is a crude indicator of how the drug might act in humans (Gura, 1997). Cell culture, an artificial environment, provides no information regarding how a drug acts in a complete biological system, and animals often do not<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> process drugs the same way as humans. Moreover, previous human studies with 4-hydroxy tamoxifen only evaluated drug delivery, and provided no information regarding the drug's effect on breast tumors. By contrast, experiments performed by the present inventors have surprisingly shown that 4-hydroxy tamoxifen, administered percutaneously, causes dose-related reductions in tumor tissue proliferation indexes.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Methods for preparing 4-hydroxy tamoxifen are well known. For example, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US4919937A"><text>U.S. patent No. 4,919,937</text></patcit> describes a synthesis, derived from Robertson and Katzenellenbogen, 1982, that occurs in stages:
<ul><li>Stage 1 - Reaction between 4-(β-dimethylaminoethoxy)-α-ethyldeoxybenzoin and p-(2-tetrahydropyranyloxy)phenylmagnesium bromide;</li><li>Stage 2 - Separately from stage 1, formation of 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenyl-1-butanone by hydroxylation of 1,2-diphenyl-1-butanone;</li><li>Stage 3 - Reaction between the products of stages 1 and 2 to form 1-(4-dimethylaminoethoxyphenyl)-1-[p-2-tetrahydropyranyloxy)phenyl]-2-phenylbutan-1-ol;</li><li>Stage 4 - Dehydration with methanol/hydrochloric acid produces 1-[p-(<i>β-</i>dimethylaminoethoxy)phenyl]-<i>Z</i>-1-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-pheny-1-but-1-ene=4-OH-tamoxifen, a mixture of E and Z isomers;</li><li>Stage 5 - Separation of the E and Z isomers by chromatography and crystallization to constant specific activity.</li></ul></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to the present invention, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen may be administered to a patient diagnosed with breast cancer. The cancer preferably will be estrogen receptor positive, as it is believed that 4-hydroxy tamoxifen primarily exerts its effect by acting on estrogen receptors. Additionally, it is preferred that the breast cancer be localized to the breast. For example, a primary breast tumor and/or a metastatic tumor solely located in the breast may be treated by topical administration. Breast cancer tumors at other locations that are accessible to topically administered 4-hydroxy tamoxifen also may be treated in this manner, however.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The present application also describes administration of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen prophylactically, to a patient at increased risk for developing breast cancer. Many risk factors for breast cancer are well established. For instance, family history of breast cancer, personal history of breast cancer, previous breast biopsy detection of proliferative breast disease such as atypical hyperplasia, and previous breast irradiation all place a patient at an elevated risk for developing breast cancer. Particular genetic risk factors include BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CHEK-2 and p53 mutations. Certain lifestyle-related risk factors for women include delayed childbirth until after age 30, long-term use of oral contraceptives, and long-term use of hormone replacement therapy. A skilled medical practitioner can evaluate these and other risk factors to determine whether a patient will benefit from prophylactic use of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen. In making such an assessment, a practitioner may employ the Gail model.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">4-Hydroxy tamoxifen is particularly useful for preventing breast cancer in premenopausal women. In this population, an anti-estrogen must compete with high amounts of circulating estrogen to occupy estrogen receptors. Because 4-hydroxy tamoxifen has 100 fold more affinity for estrogen receptors than tamoxifen, it is better able to compete for the receptors at low doses. The ability to use a low dose holds particular importance in a prophylactic context, where a patient's exposure to the drug is long-term and side effects are less tolerable.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Pursuant to the present invention, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen may be administered in any dosage form and via any system that delivers the active compound to breast and/or tumor estrogen receptors in vivo by "percutaneous administration," a phrase that denotes any mode of delivering a drug from the surface of a patient's skin, through the stratum corneum, epidermis, and dermis layers, and into the microcirculation. This is typically accomplished by diffusion down a concentration gradient. The diffusion may occur via intracellular penetration (through the cells), intercellular penetration (between the cells), transappendageal penetration (through the hair follicles, sweat, and sebaceous glands), or any combination of these.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Percutaneous administration of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen offers several advantages. First, it avoids the hepatic metabolism that occurs subsequent to oral administration (Mauvais-Jarvis <i>et al.,</i> 1986). Second, percutaneous administration significantly reduces systemic drug exposure, and the attendant risks from non-specifically activating estrogen<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> receptors throughout the body; this, because topical 4-hydroxy tamoxifen is absorbed primarily into local tissues. In particular, when 4-hydroxy tamoxifen is percutaneously applied to breasts, high concentrations accumulate in the breast tissue, presumably due to many estrogen receptors therein, without creating a high plasma concentration (Mauvais-Jarvis <i>et al</i>., <i>supra</i>). Pursuant to the present invention, therefore, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen may be applied to any skin surface, but preferably to one or both breasts.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Although the invention is not constrained to any particular theory, clinically significant side effects of anti-estrogen agents occur when the agents displace estradiol in non-target tissues. Because 4-hydroxy tamoxifen and estradiol have similar binding affinities for estrogen receptors, a competition between them for receptor binding would be approximately equal when the concentration of each compound approximates that of the other. If the 4-hydroxy tamoxifen concentration exceeds the estradiol concentration, the former will be bound preferentially to the estrogen receptors, and vice versa.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Accordingly, doses of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen that result in plasma concentrations less than about 80 pg/mL, or the mean estradiol concentration in normal premenopausal women, are preferred. More preferably, doses of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen will result in plasma concentrations less than about 50 pg/mL. The daily doses to be administered can initially be estimated based upon the absorption coefficients of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen, the breast tissue concentration that is desired, and the plasma concentration that should not be exceeded. Of course, the initial dose may be optimized in each patient, depending on individual responses.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As noted above, by targeting 4-hydroxy tamoxifen to breast tissue, high concentrations can be achieved in that tissue without simultaneously raising 4-hydroxy tamoxifen plasma levels to a point where significant systemic competition for estradiol receptors occurs. At a percutaneous dose of 1 mg/breastlday, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen concentration in breast tissue exceeds normal estradiol concentrations in breast tissue by a factor of 4. (Barrat <i>et al</i>., 1990; Pujol <i>et al</i>., <i>supra).</i> Moreover, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen applied in this manner reaches concentrations in breast tissue that are an order of magnitude higher than concentrations in plasma, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>.<i>,</i> 10:1. By contrast, the breast tissue to plasma ratio of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen following oral administration of tamoxifen is about 5:1.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In a percutaneous formulation, doses on the order of 0.25-2.0 mg/breast/day of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen should achieve the desired result, with doses of about 0.5-1.0 mg/breast/day being preferred. In particular embodiments, the dosage is about 0.5, 0.75 or 1.0 mg/breast/day of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Percutaneous administration can be accomplished mainly in two different ways: (i) by mixing a therapeutically active compound or its non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salt with suitable pharmaceutical carriers and, optionally, penetration enhancers to form ointments, emulsions, lotions, solutions, creams, gels or the like, where an amount of said preparation is applied onto a certain area of the skin, or (ii) by incorporating the therapeutically active substance into patches or transdermal delivery systems according to known technology.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The effectiveness of percutaneous drug administration depends on many factors, including drug concentration, surface area of application, time and duration of application, skin hydration, physicochemical properties of the drug, and partitioning of the drug between the formulation and the skin. Drug formulations intended for percutaneous use take advantage of these factors to achieve optimal delivery. Such formulations often comprise penetration enhancers that improve percutaneous absorption by reducing the resistance of the stratum corneum by reversibly altering its physiochemical properties, changing hydration in the stratum corneum, acting as cosolvent, or changing the organization of lipids and proteins in the intercellular spaces. Such enhancers of percutaneous absorption include surfactants, DMSO, alcohol, acetone, propyleneglycol, polyethylene glycol, fatty acids or fatty alcohols and their derivatives, hydroxyacids, pyrrolidones, urea, essential oils, and mixtures thereof. In addition to chemical enhancers, physical methods can increase percutaneous absorption. For example, occlusive bandages induce hydration of the skin. Other physical methods include iontophoresis and sonophoresis, which use electrical fields and high-frequency ultrasound, respectively, to enhance absorption of drugs that are poorly absorbed due to their size and ionic characteristics.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The many factors and methods relating to percutaneous drug delivery are reviewed in <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="b"><text>REMINGTON: THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY, Alfonso R. Gennaro (Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2000), at pages 836-58</text></nplcit>, and in <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="b"><text>PERCUTANEOUS ABSORPTION: DRUGS COSMETICS MECHANISMS METHODOLOGY, Bronaugh and Maibach<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> (Marcel Dekker, 1999</text></nplcit>). As these publications evidence, those in the pharmaceutical field can manipulate the various factors and methods to achieve efficacious percutaneous delivery.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">4-Hydroxy tamoxifen is a large and very lipophilic molecule; hence, without assistance from penetration enhancers it poorly penetrates the skin. Accordingly, formulations of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen used in the present invention comprise one or more penetration enhancers including alcohols because 4-hydroxy tamoxifen is soluble in alcohol and isopropyl myristate.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">For percutaneous administration, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen may be delivered in an ointment, cream, gel, emulsion, lotion, powder, oil or similar formulation. To this end, the formulation may comprise customary excipient additives, including vegetable oils such as almond oil, olive oil, peach kernel oil, groundnut oil, and castor oil animal oils, DMSO, fat and fat-like substances, lanolin lipoids, phosphatides, hydrocarbons such as paraffins, petroleum jelly, waxes, detergent emulsifying agents, lecithin, alcohols, carotin, polyols or polyglycols such as glycerol (or glycerine), glycerol ethers, glycols, glycol ethers, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, non-volatile fatty alcohols, acids, esters, volatile alcoholic compounds, urea, talc, cellulose derivatives, coloring agents, antioxidants and preservatives.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">According to the present invention, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen also may be delivered via a transdermal patch. In one embodiment, the patch comprises a reservoir for the 4-hydroxy tamoxifen formula. The patch may comprise (a) a solution-impermeable backing foil, (b) a layer-like element having a cavity, (c) a microporous or semipermeable membrane, (d) a self-adhesive layer, and (e) optionally, a removable backing film. The layer-like element having a cavity may be formed by the backing foil and the membrane. Alternatively, the patch may comprise (a) a solution-impermeable backing foil, (b) an open-pored foam, a closed-pore foam, a tissue-like layer or a fibrous web-like layer as reservoir, (c) if the layer according to (b) is not self-adhesive, a self-adhesive layer, and (d) optionally a removable backing film.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In preferred embodiments of the invention, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen is formulated in a hydroalcoholic gel. The amount of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen in such a gel may range from about 0.001 to about 1.0 gram of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen per 100 grams of gel. Preferably,<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> it ranges from about 0.01 to about 0.1 gram of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen per 100 grams of gel.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">4-hydroxy tamoxifen formulations comprise isopropyl myristate as a penetration enhancer. When isopropyl myristate is used in a gel, the amount may range from about 0.1 to about 5.0 grams per 100 grams of gel. Preferably, the amount of isopropy myristate ranges from about 0.5 to about 2.0 grams per 100 grams of gel.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">4-Hydroxy tamoxifen formulations of the invention generally will comprise one or more nonaqueous vehicles. These vehicles should be capable of dissolving both 4-hydroxy tamoxifen and any penetration enhancer used. They also should have a low boiling point, preferably less than 100°C at atmospheric pressure, to permit rapid evaporation upon contact with the skin. Examples of suitable non-aqueous vehicles include ethanol, isopropanol and ethyl acetate. Ethanol and isopropanol are preferred. In particular, ethanol effectively contributes to the percutaneous absorption of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen by rapidly evaporating upon contact with skin. The amount of nonaqueous vehicle in a gel formulation generally ranges between 54% and 85% by weight, and preferably between 65% and 75.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Formulations also may comprise an aqueous vehicle, which permits solubilization of any hydrophilic molecules in a formulation, and also promotes diffusion of lipophilic molecules from the formulation to the skin. An aqueous vehicle also can regulate pH. Aqueous vehicles include alkalinizing and basic buffer solutions, including phosphate buffered solutions (e.g., dibasic or monobasic sodium phosphate), citrate buffered solutions (e.g., sodium citrate or potassium citrate) and simply purified water. The amount of an aqueous vehicle preferably ranges between 15% and 45% by weight of a gel formulation, and more preferably between 25% and 35%.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Additionally, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen formulations may comprise one or more gelling agents to increase the viscosity of a formulation and/or to function as a solubilizing agent. Depending on the gelling agent's nature, it may constitute between 0.1% and 20% by weight of a formulation, preferably between 0.5% and 10%, and still more preferably between 1% and 5%. Preferred gelling agents include carbomers,<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> cellulose derivatives, poloxamers and poloxamines. Mor particularly, preferred gelling agents are chitosan, dextran, pectins, natural gum and cellulose derivatives such as ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). One highly preferred gelling agent is hydroxypropyl cellulose.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">When a formulation comprises a gelling agent, in particular a non-preneutralized acrylic polymer, it may advantageously also comprise a neutralizing agent. The neutralizing agent/gelling agent ratio preferably is between 10:1 and 0.1:1, more preferably between 7:1 and 0.5:1, and still more preferably between 4:1 and 1:1. A neutralizing agent should form, in the presence of the polymer, salts that are soluble in the vehicle. A neutralizing agent also should permit optimum swelling of polymer chains during neutralization of charges and formation of polymer salts. Useful neutralizing agents include sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, arginine, aminomethylpropanol and tromethamine. Those skilled in the art will select a neutralizing agent according to the type of gelling agent employed in a formulation. When cellulose derivatives are used as gelling agents, however, no neutralizing agents are required.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Table 1 describes the composition of two highly preferred 4-hydroxy tamoxifen gel formulations.

It is the first direct comparison of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen gel with tamoxifen and untreated controls on biological end points of breast cancer in humans. The results show that percutaneous administration of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen gel for 2-3 weeks produces dose-dependent reductions in tumor tissue proliferation indexes (Ki-67 and PCNA) in postmenopausal women scheduled to undergo surgery for breast cancer, with approximate equivalence between the 2.0 mg/day 4-hydroxy tamoxifen dose and 20 mg/day oral tamoxifen. Estrogen and progesterone receptor levels did not show dose-related reductions with 4-hydroxy tamoxifen treatment.

Anti-PCNA (DAKO) completed the panel of antibodies used to analyze proliferation in fixed tissues. Detection was made without heat denaturation. Six serial sections were analyzed per case in order to standardize sampling. Analysis was performed with a computer assisted system. (Système microphotométrique à balayage automatique; Samba-Alcatel, Grenoble, France). For each preparation, optical density (OD) thresholds were determined using real microscopic images of the analyzed field as reference. Measurements of immunostaining were performed at x 25. Twenty fields were analyzed for each section. Stained nuclear surface was determined (segmentation and thresholding) and a LI scored (stained cells/ counterstained elements). OD immunostaining was expressed in arbitrary units. Control of immunostaining quantitative analysis and reproducibility of the procedure were performed: -by comparison to iterative measurements done on the same preparations, - by comparison to measurements compiled on six sequential sections of the same specimen. Evaluation of tissue variations in immunostaining quantitative analysis was performed by comparing the OD immunostaining measurements of 20 fields taken from nonconsecutive sections from each specimen. The intensity of PCNA immunoreactivity displayed by actively proliferating cells in lymph nodes (centroblasts) served as a reference for thresholds positive staining in breast tissues.

As was seen with Ki-67 LIs, the percentage of patients who had decreases in PCNA index of ≥1, ≥2, or ≥3 units (%) demonstrated a strong treatment effect of 4-OHT especially for the 4-OHT 1 and 2 mg/d groups, relative to untreated controls and showed approximate equivalence with oral tamoxifen (Table 9B). There were no significant differences in PCNA labeling between tamoxifen and any dose of 4-OHT. Response defined as a tumor having a PCNA LI or Ki-67 LI decrease of 3 arbitrary units demonstrated a tendency to increase with 4-OHT dosage. However, sample size was not sufficient to demonstrate significance for the relationship.
