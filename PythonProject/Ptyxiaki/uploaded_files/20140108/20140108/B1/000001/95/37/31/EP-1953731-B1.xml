load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method of driving a plasma display panel for use in a wall-mounted television or a large monitor, and to a plasma display device.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND ART</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">An alternating-current surface-discharge panel representative of a plasma display panel (hereinafter abbreviated as "panel") has a large number of discharge cells formed between the front plate and the rear plate faced to each other. For the front plate, a plurality of display electrode pairs, each made of a scan electrode and a sustain electrode, are formed on a front glass substrate in parallel with each other. A dielectric layer and a protective layer are formed to cover these display electrode pairs. For the rear plate, a plurality of parallel data electrodes are formed on a rear glass substrate and a dielectric layer is formed over the data electrodes to cover them. Further, a plurality of barrier ribs are formed on the dielectric layer in parallel with the data electrodes. Phosphor layers are formed over the surface of the dielectric layer and the side faces of the barrier ribs. Then, the front plate and the rear plate are faced to each other and sealed together so that the display electrode pairs are intersected with the data electrodes. A discharge gas containing xenon in a partial pressure ratio of 5%, for example, is charged into the inside discharge<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> space formed between the plates. Discharge cells are formed in portions where the respective display electrode pairs are faced to the corresponding data electrodes. For a panel structured as above, gas discharge generates ultraviolet light in each discharge cell. This ultraviolet light excites the red (R), green (G), and blue (G) phosphors so that the phosphors emit the respective colors for color display.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A general method of driving a panel is a subfield method: one field is divided into a plurality of subfields and combinations of light-emitting subfields provide gradation display.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Each subfield has an initializing period, an address period, and a sustain period. In the initializing period, initializing discharge is caused so that wall charge necessary for the succeeding address operation is formed on the respective electrodes and priming particles (excited particles to work as priming for discharge) are generated to stabilize the address discharge.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the address period, application of address pulse voltage selectively to the discharge cells to be lit causes address discharge and forms wall charge (hereinafter this operation also being referred to as "addressing"). In the sustain period, sustain pulses are applied alternately to the display electrode pairs, each made of a scan electrode and a sustain electrode. This application causes sustain discharge in the discharge cells having generated the address discharge, and causes the phosphor layers of the corresponding discharge cells to emit light. Thus, an image is displayed.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Further, a novel driving method is disclosed among the subfield methods. In this driving method, initializing discharge is caused by using a gently changing voltage waveform, and initializing discharge is further performed selectively on the discharge cells having<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> generated sustain discharge. Thus, light emission unrelated to gradation display is minimized and the contrast ratio is improved.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Specifically, among a plurality of subfields, in the initializing period of one subfield, an initializing operation for causing initializing discharge in all the discharge cells (hereinafter abbreviated as "all-cell initializing operation") is performed. In the initializing period of each of the other subfields, an initializing operation for causing initializing discharge only in the discharge cells having generated sustain discharge (hereinafter "selective initializing operation") is performed. In this driving method, the light emission unrelated to image display is only the light emission caused by the discharge in the all-cell initializing operation and thus the luminance of the areas displaying black pictures (hereinafter "black picture level") is only due to the weak light emission in the all-cell initializing operation. Thus, images having a high contrast can be displayed. (See Patent Document 1, for example.)</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further, the above Patent Document 1 includes the description of so-called erasing discharge using a narrow pulse. In this erasing discharge, the pulse width of the last sustain pulse in the sustain period is set shorter than the pulse widths of the other sustain pulses so that the potential difference between the display electrode pairs caused by the wall charge thereon is alleviated. Generating this erasing discharge using a narrow pulse can ensure the address operation in the address period of the succeeding subfield and provide a plasma display device having a high contrast ratio.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further, techniques are proposed to control the luminance of an image to be displayed and thus to improve the visibility of the image. One of such techniques is to detect the average picture level<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> (hereinafter "APL") of input image signals and to control the number of sustain pulses in the sustain period according to the APL. (See Patent Document 2, for example.)</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The number of sustain pulses in each subfield is determined by multiplying a ratio of the brightness to be displayed (hereinafter "brightness weight") in the subfield by a proportionality factor (hereinafter "luminance factor"). In this technique, the luminance factor is controlled according to the APL, and thereby the number of sustain pulses in each subfield is determined. Control is made so that the luminance factor is lower for an image signal having a higher APL, and the luminance factor is higher for an image signal providing a dark image and having a lower APL. Such control can increase the luminance of the image to be displayed and make the dark image brighter, and thus provides a more visible image, when the APL is lower.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Immediately after a plasma display device is powered on, the operation of each circuit, such as an image signal processing circuit, power supply circuit, and driving circuit, is not stable and thus an abnormal image can be displayed in the plasma display device. A general method of addressing this problem is to stop the address operation and display a black picture on the entire display surface (hereinafter "image muting") for a few seconds immediately after the power-on until the stabilized operation of each circuit.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">On the other hand, in the panel of a plasma display device immediately after the driving has been initiated by the power-on, insufficient priming particles can induce strong discharge in the initializing operation. This strong discharge can cause some discharge cells to generate sustain discharge and emit light even<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> though address operation is not performed therein (hereinafter referred to as "initializing spot").</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Particularly in the muting period, a black picture is shown on the entire image display surface of the panel. Thus, the initializing spots are easy to recognize and the quality of displayed images seems to deteriorate.

A driving method for one frame is changed between a period (supply power stability waiting period) required until the supply power becomes stable and a display period. Time required until a voltage becomes stable is for example 0.5 seconds to 1 second after power-ON. In a field during this period, one field is divided into a plurality of sub-fields and the number of repeated pulses is smaller during a sustaining period of each sub-field than that of repeated pulses during a sustaining period of a sub-field in the display period. For example, no sustaining pulse is fed to a scanning electrode. As a result, sustaining light emission becomes inconspicuous even if the erroneous discharge occurs due to an influence of the residual charges.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US2003234753A"><text>US 2003234753</text></patcit> discloses a method that drives a plasma display panel including first and second substrates facing each other, a plurality of first and second electrodes extends on the first substrate in a first direction such that each of the second electrodes makes a pair with each of the first electrodes located adjacent thereto, and a plurality of third electrodes extending on the second substrate in a second direction perpendicular to the first direction. The method includes the steps of dividing a field into a plurality of sub-fields having at least two weighted luminance, selecting whether discharge is to be generated between the first or second and third electrodes for controlling a gray scale, weighting the luminance by varying the number of application of sustaining pulses to the first or second electrode, and stopping application of the sustaining pulses in at least one sub-field among the plurality of sub-fields.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The article entitled "<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Analysis of a weak discharge of ramp-wave driving to control wall voltage and luminance in AC-PDPs" by Sakita et al of the SID International Symposium, May 16th to 18th 2000, Long Beach California, Vol. XXXI</text></nplcit> discloses an investigation of weak discharge of ramp-wave driving in AC-PDPs.

At this time, in the all-cell initializing operation to be performed for the<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> first time after the start of driving panel 10, i.e. after plasma display device 1 is powered on, the increasing ramp waveform voltage to be applied to scan electrodes SC1 to SCn is generated so as to have a gentler slope than the increasing ramp waveform voltage in the normal all-cell initializing operations, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>. In this exemplary embodiment, such driving reduces the initializing spots generated immediately after the start of driving panel 10. The reasons therefor are as follows.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Immediately after plasma display device 1 is powered on, i.e. immediately after the device is changed from the non-operating state to the operating state, the operation of the image signal processing circuit, power supply circuit, or each driving circuit is not stable and thus an abnormal image having a display luminance and gradation value different from those of the input image signals can be displayed. To address this problem, in this exemplary embodiment, the address operation in the address period is stopped to effect image muting, and all the discharge cells are unlit to display a black picture on the entire image display surface, for a few seconds (approximately two seconds for this embodiment) immediately after plasma display device 1 is powered on until the operation of each of the circuits is stabilized.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">At this time, in panel 10 immediately after the driving is initiated, insufficient priming particles are likely to increase discharge delay (time delay after the voltage applied to the discharge cells exceeds the breakdown voltage before the discharge actually occurs). In the discharge caused by application of an increasing ramp waveform voltage, the large discharge delay considerably increases the applied voltage after the breakdown voltage is exceeded before the discharge actually occurs, and thus induces strong discharge. This<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> strong discharge can cause sustain discharge and thus light emission even without address operation, in some discharge cells. In other words, initializing spots can be generated.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Particularly in the image muting period, a black picture is displayed on the entire image display surface of panel 10, and thus initializing spots are easily recognized.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">At this time, an increasing ramp waveform voltage having a gentler slope is applied. This waveform voltage can inhibit an increase in the voltage after the breakdown voltage is exceeded before actual discharge occurs, even when the discharge delay is large. Thus, the generation of strong discharge can be reduced. In other words, generation of initializing spots can be reduced.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">In this exemplary embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, in the all-cell initializing operation to be performed for the first time after plasma display device 1 is powered on and the driving of panel 10 is initiated, an increasing ramp waveform voltage is generated so as to have a gentler slope than the increasing ramp waveform voltage in the normal diving operation. Specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, in the increasing ramp waveform voltage in the normal all-cell initializing operation, voltage Vi1 is increased to voltage Vi2 for approximately 200 µsec. In contrast, in the all-cell initializing operation to be performed for the first time after plasma display device 1 is powered on, voltage Vi1 is increased to voltage Vi2 for approximately 2,000 µsec. In the latter all-cell initializing operation, the increasing ramp waveform voltage is generated so as to have a slope approximately one tenth the slope generated in the normal operation.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">This operation can inhibit generation of strong discharge and reduce generation of initializing spots in the all-cell initializing<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> operation performed with fewer priming particles immediately after the start of driving panel 10. Once the all-cell initializing discharge is caused, this discharge generates sufficient priming particles. Thus, in the all-cell initializing discharge thereafter, the increasing ramp waveform voltage can be generated so as to have a normal slope.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">On the other hand, the increasing ramp waveform voltage having a gentler slope makes the all-cell initializing period longer by the gentler slope. Thus, it is possible that some subfields extend out of one field. To address this problem, in this exemplary embodiment, control is made so that the total number of sustain pulses generated in a first field after the start of driving panel 10 is equal to or smaller than the total number of sustain pulses in one field in normal operation. This control can ensure the margin of the all-cell initializing period extended by the gentler slope of the increasing ramp waveform voltage.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Specifically, in the first field after the start of driving panel 10, the luminance factor is fixed to the minimum value within a setting range regardless of the APL. As described above, for this exemplary embodiment, the luminance factor is changed according to the detection results of APL detecting circuit 56. The luminance factor is controlled in the following manner. For an image signal having a higher APL, the luminance factor is set lower. (For example, for an image having an APL of 100%, the luminance factor is 1.) For an image signal having a lower APL, the luminance factor is set higher. (For example, for an image having an APL of 50%, the luminance factor is 2. For an image having an APL up to 20%, the luminance factor is 5. The luminance factor between these values is gradually changed according to the APL.) This control can change the total<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> number of sustain pulses in one field according to the APL, and adjust the brightness of images to be displayed.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">Then, in the first field after the start of driving panel 10, the luminance factor is fixed to the minimum value within the setting range, i.e. 1, regardless of the APL.

However, the slope need not be kept constant necessarily throughout the period during which the increasing ramp waveform voltage is applied. The increasing ramp waveform voltage to be applied to scan electrodes SC1 to SCn for the first time after the start of driving panel 10 may be generated in the following manner. The period during which this increasing ramp waveform voltage is applied is set longer than each of the periods during which the other ramp waveform voltages are applied. At this time, the slope of this increasing ramp waveform voltage starts at a start voltage (Vi1) and ends at an end voltage (Vi2), and these start voltage and end voltage are set equal to those of the slopes of the other ramp waveform voltages. For example, the increasing ramp waveform voltage to be applied to scan electrodes SC1 to SCn for the first time after the start of driving panel 10 may include the following two kinds of sub-periods: a sub-period during which a voltage is applied so as to have a slope equal to the slopes of the other increasing ramp waveform voltages; and a sub-period during which the applied voltage is substantially unchanged. Repeating these sub-periods can set the application period of the increasing ramp waveform voltage to be generated for the first time longer than the application period of the other increasing ramp waveform voltages while the start voltage (Vi1) and end voltage (Vi2) of the slope are equal to those of the slopes the other increasing ramp waveform voltages.
