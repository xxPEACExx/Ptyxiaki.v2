In the electromagnetic brake device, a brake shoe is pressed against a braking surface due to a spring force of a brake spring, so rotation of the drive sheave 8 is braked. Also, the brake shoe is opened away from the braking surface through excitation of an electromagnet, so braking is released.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">A pair of car suspending pulleys 12a and 12b are provided on the lower portion of the car 3. A counterweight suspending pulley 13 is provided on an upper portion of the counterweight 4.

As a result, the car 3 is stopped as an emergency measure. When the running speed of the car 3 reaches the second overspeed, the speed governor rope. 19 is gripped by the rope catch of the speed governor 18. As a result, the speed governor rope 19 is stopped from being circulated.

The elevator control device 23 has an operation control portion 24 for controlling the operation of the drive device 7, and a weigher inspecting portion 25 for detecting an abnormality in the weighing device 17. The weigher inspecting portion 25 issues a command to perform a test operation of the car 3, and detects an abnormality in the weighing device 17 based on a signal output from the weighing device 17 through the test operation.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of the elevator control device 23 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. The elevator control device 23 is constituted by a computer having a CPU (calculation processing portion) 26, a memory (ROM, RAM, and the like) 27, an input portion 28 to which external signals including a weighing device signal<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> are input, and an output portion 29 from which a signal is output to the outside. That is, the functions of the operation control portion 24 and the weigher inspecting portion 25 are realized by the computer. Programs for realizing the functions of the operation control portion 24 and the weigher inspecting portion 25 are stored in the memory 27. The CPU 26 performs calculation processings regarding the functions of the operation control portion 24 and the weigher inspecting portion 25 based on the programs.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Next, a method of inspecting the weighing device 17 will be described. In initializing the elevator apparatus, a signal from the weighing device 17 at the time of a sudden stop of the car 3 is confirmed to inspect whether or not the weighing device 17 is normal. More specifically, after the brake portion 10 has been released with the weights of the car 3 and the counterweight 4 unbalanced with each other so as to accelerate the car 3, the brake portion 10 is caused to perform braking operation to make a sudden stop of the car 3. It is then checked whether or not a value of the weighing device signal during acceleration resulting from the unbalanced state and an oscillation frequency of the weighing device signal after the sudden stop are appropriate. In carrying out this check, an acceleration determined by the weight of an entire system and the amount of unbalance of the car 3, an oscillation frequency determined by a composition of a rope system and the weights of<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the car 3 and the counterweight 4, and the like are used.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">When it is determined that the weighing device 17 is normal during inspection at the time of initialization as described above, data such as an output waveform of the weighing device signal at that time or a characteristic quantity thereof (bias value corresponding to an unbalance acceleration or an oscillation frequency after the stop) and the like are saved in the memory 27.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In inspecting the weighing device 17 after the elevator apparatus has been operated, a command to perform the test operation of the car 3 is issued from the weigher inspecting portion 25 when there is no passenger within the car 3, for example, at night. The test operation performed in this case is similar to the operation performed during inspection at the time of initialization. In the weigher inspecting portion 25, after the test operation has been performed, the output waveform saved in the memory 27 or the characteristic quantity thereof is compared with an output waveform of a signal output from the weighing device 17 through the test operation or a characteristic quantity thereof. When a difference between both the values is within a predetermined range, it is determined that the weighing device 17 is normal. When the difference between both the values is outside the predetermined range, it is determined that the weighing device 17 is abnormal. When an<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> abnormality in the weighing device 17 is detected, an error signal is output from the weigher inspecting portion 25. Then, measures are taken to inform an elevator supervising room, stop the operation of the elevator apparatus, etc.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is a graph showing an example of changes in the position of the car and the speed of the car with time during the test operation performed by the weigher inspecting portion 25 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref> is a graph showing an example of changes in the acceleration of the car with time during the test operation performed by the weigher inspecting portion 25 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. When the test operation is performed with the aid of the unbalance acceleration as described above, the car 3 behaves as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>. Thus, when the weighing device 17 is normal, a signal as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref> is output from the weighing device 17. From this signal, the value of the weighing device signal during acceleration resulting from the unbalanced state and the weight of the car, which is estimated from the oscillation frequency of the weighing device signal after the sudden stop, are compared with the data at the time of initialization.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The inspection of the weighing device 17 as described above is automatically conducted at preset timings or on a preset cycle. That is, the elevator control device 23 has control modes including an automatic inspection mode for automatically inspecting the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> weighing device 17.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Alternatively, the inspection of the weighing device 17 may be started in response to reception of an inspection command signal from an external device, for example, a remote supervision board, or the like.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In the elevator apparatus constructed as described above, the weigher inspecting portion 25 issues a command to perform a test operation of the car 3, and automatically detects an abnormality in the weighing device 17 based on a signal output from the weighing device 17 through the test operation. Therefore, the efficiency in inspecting the weighing device 17 can be enhanced.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Further, the weigher inspecting portion 25 performs the test operation with the aid of the unbalance acceleration of the car 3. Therefore, the test operation of the car 3 can be performed easily without the aid of manpower.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Furthermore, the weigher inspecting portion 25 causes oscillations in the car 3 as the test operation of the car 3, and detects an abnormality in the weighing device 17 based on a weight of the car 3, which is estimated from a time-series waveform of a signal from the weighing device 17. Therefore, the presence or absence of an abnormality in the weighing device 17 can be confirmed by the simple test operation, so the weighing device 17 can be<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> inspected in a short period of time.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Still further, the weigher inspecting portion 25 compares the data acquired from the weighing device 17 through the test operation of the car 3 with the data saved at the time of initialization to detect an abnormality in the weighing device 17. Therefore, an operation of inputting data or the like with the aid of manpower is not required in inspecting the weighing device 17, so the inspection can be conducted with ease.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The test operation of the car 3 is not limited to the foregoing examples. For example, it is also appropriate to make a shift to the automatic inspection mode with no passenger within the car 3, cause the car 3 to run normally throughout a preset section, and compare a weight of the car, which is estimated from signals from the weighing device 17 during acceleration and deceleration, with the data saved at the time of initialization.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Further, the weighing device or an arithmetic circuit for processing a signal from the weighing device may be configured as a dual system. The present invention is applicable in this case as well.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Furthermore, the data saved at the time of initialization, which serve as a comparison criterion, may be updated through an inspection similar to the inspection during initialization when<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> an operation such as periodic inspection using manpower is performed. Thus, erroneous detection of an abnormality in the weighing device can be prevented from being caused due to a secular change such as elongation of the main rope 6.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Still further, the method of detecting the weighing device is not limited in particular as long as the output therefrom continuously changes in response to changes in the load within the car 3.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Further, the place where the weighing device is installed is not limited in particular either. For example, the weighing device may be provided on the lower portion of the car, the drive device, the return pulley, or the like. If the elevator apparatus is designed such that the end of the main rope is connected to the car, the weighing device may be provided at that portion of the main rope which is connected to the car.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56986298" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Aufzugsvorrichtung, umfassend:
