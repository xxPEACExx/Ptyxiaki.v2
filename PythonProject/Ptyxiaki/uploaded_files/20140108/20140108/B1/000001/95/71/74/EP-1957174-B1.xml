The words "right," "left," "upper," and "lower" designate directions in the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> drawings to which reference is made. The terminology includes the words above specifically mentioned, derivatives thereof, and words of similar import.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Referring to the drawings in detail, wherein like numerals indicate like elements throughout, there is shown in the figures a preferred embodiment of an articulated walking toy device, indicated generally at 10, in accordance with the present invention. The toy device 10 walks along a surface (not shown) by cyclically moving each of a plurality of leg assemblies 30, as will be described in more detail below. Preferably, the toy device 10 includes six leg assemblies 30, three leg assemblies 30 on each lateral side 10a, 10b of the device 10 (and its frame 12), to mimic an insect-like creature. It is within the scope of the present invention that there be more or less than six leg assemblies 30, provided the toy device 10 can still function to propel or support and propel the toy device 10, as described herein. Additionally, it is intended that the toy device 10 includes a decorative outer housing or body one example of which is indicated generally at 11 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. Body 11 is decorated in a bug-like, and/or monster-like-appearance that is visually attractive to the user.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs. 1-3</figref>, the toy device 10 includes a frame 12 having a top, first plate 12a and a bottom, second plate 12b. The plurality of leg assemblies 30 are coupled with the frame 12, preferably be being sandwiched between the first and second plates 12a, 12b. Leg shafts 37 extend between the first and second plates 12a, 12b, and preferably, a portion of each leg shaft 37 extends above the first plate 12a of the frame 12 and supports a second cam member 44 of the leg assembly 30 for rotation. The second cam member 44 will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the toy device 10 is shown with the first plate 12a and the second cam members 44 removed to expose part of a drive mechanism of the toy device 10 indicated generally at and other portions of the leg assemblies 30. The toy device 10 preferably includes a drive mechanism indicated generally at 13, which preferably includes two independent drives that are mechanical mirror images of one another, on either lateral side 10a, 10b of the device 10. Each drive preferably includes a reversible motor 14 (see <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 18</figref>) for driving each of the three leg assemblies 30 on one of the lateral sides 10a, 10b. Each motor 14 engages with and drives a conventional reduction gear train portion of the mechanism 13 indicated generally at 16, which drives the wheel assemblies 30 through longitudinally extending drive shafting 18 (again, indicated in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 18</figref>). Each motor 14 is rotatably coupled through the reduction gear train 16 and shafting 18 with three worms 38, one for each of the leg<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> assemblies 30 of that lateral side of the device 10. Each worm 38 is engaged with and drives a worm gear 40 of the respective leg assembly 30.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The construction of each leg assembly 30 is preferably the same, although details and operation might vary from that of the described embodiment. Each leg assembly 30 include a leg member 32 configured to rotate with respect to the frame 12 about separate first and second axes as will be described. Each leg member 32 is actuated by the drive mechanism 13 to rotate about the two axes in a like, predetermined, repeatable cycle of movement. The phases of the cycles of the leg members are suggestedly varied with respect to one another to unsynchronize the movements of each leg assembly 30 and at least its immediately adjoining leg assembly(-ies) 30 to prevent all the legs assemblies or even adjoining pairs of leg assemblies on either lateral side of the toy device from moving in parallel and so as more faithfully mimic an anatomic gait. Accordingly, one leg assembly 30 will be described, the description applying to the other leg assemblies 30.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008 f0009 f0010">Figs. 3-16</figref>, each depicted leg assembly 30 includes a base member 34 supporting the leg member 32 for rotation about the two separate axes with respect to the frame 12. As will be described, the two axes are at least generally transverse to one another sufficiently to provide each leg member 32 with freedom of rotation in at least two directions. The leg member 32 is preferably generally L-shaped so that the leg members 32 of the various leg assemblies 30 extend generally outwardly and downwardly from the frame 12 in order to support the frame 12 above a support surface S.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005 f0010">6-16</figref>, rotatably fixed with each worm gear 40 is a first cam member 42 with first and second cams 42a, 42b respectively, and the second cam member 44 with a third cam 44a such that rotation of the gear 40 causes simultaneous rotation of the coupled together cam members 42, 44 and cams 42a, 42b, 44a. The worm gear 40 and cam members 42-44 may be made as separate pieces and keyed or otherwise fixed together to rotate in unison or they may be keyed to the leg shaft and the leg shaft rotated on the frame 12. There may be three separate cam members instead of two or all three cams could be combined in a single member with or without the worm gear 40. The three cams 42a, 42b, 44a all rotate together about the central axis 37a of leg shaft 37 but need not be so linked or arranged.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The first cam member 42 is preferably captured between the first and second plates 12a, 12b. The first cam 42a and second cam 42b are preferably disposed in a stacked manner with the first cam 42a atop the second cam 42b in the figures. The order of the cams could be<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> reversed, however. The first cam member 42 is situated within a channel 34d in the base member 34 of each leg assembly 30. Referring generally to <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008 f0009 f0010">Figs. 3-16</figref>, the base member 34 of each assembly 30 is preferably pivotally engaged with the second plate 12b of the frame 12 at a pivot 35 (see <figref idrefs="f0007 f0008 f0009 f0010">Figs. 10-16</figref>) and further coupled to the frame 12 by the leg shaft 37 which passes through a generally arcuate slot 34c (best seen in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figs. 10-11</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0008">13</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">15</figref>) in the bottom of the base member 34, and which is offset from the pivot 35. Coupled to the frame 12 in this manner, the base member 34 pivots horizontally forward and rearward (with respect to the longitudinal direction of the frame 12 and device 10) about the pivot 35 and its central axis 35a by rotational motion of the first and second cams 42a, 42b within the channel 34d of the base member 34.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Specifically, motion of the base member 34 is accomplished as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0005 f0009">Figs. 6-15</figref>. The first cam 42a of first cam member 42 is fully depicted in each of <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Figs. 6-9</figref>. The second cam 42b of the first cam member 42 is fully depicted in <figref idrefs="f0007 f0008 f0009">Figs. 10-15</figref> together with a portion of a web or spacer 42c which supports the first cam 42a over the second cam 42b. The first cam 42a preferably interacts with a first follower surface 34a in the channel 34d of the base member 34 to pivot the base member 34 about the pivot 35 in a first, return direction as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Figs. 6-9</figref>. The second cam 42b then preferably interacts with a second follower surface 34b in the channel 34d of the base member 34 to pivot the base member 34 about the pivot 35 in a second, propulsion direction opposite the first direction as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007 f0008 f0009">Figs. 10-15</figref>. The forward-rearward cycle is repeated as long as the worm gear 40 is driven. Preferably, the first and second cams 42a, 42b of the first cam member 42 are oriented and configured so that motion of the base member 34 in the first, return direction begins immediately after motion in the second propulsion direction is completed and vice versa so that there is no noticeable lag. However, one or more of the base members 34 can be made to dwell, if desired, particularly in the first, return direction of the movement when the leg assembly will be elevated from the surface supporting the device 10, as will be described. Additionally, it is preferred that the first and second cams 42a, 42b are configured such that the base member 34 moves faster (and thus for less time) in the first, return (i.e., forward) direction when elevated than it does in the second, propulsion (i.e. rearward) direction, preferably approximately 25% of the cycle time to move in the first, return (i.e., forward) direction and approximately 75% of the time in the opposite second (i.e., rearward/propulsion) direction. Although this is preferred, it is within the present invention that the first and second cams 42a, 42b be configured differently to vary the timing<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> and/ or the direction of motion of the base member 34, provided the device 10 is still capable of functioning as described herein.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Preferably each leg member 32 is pivotably attached to the base member 34 by a generally horizontal pivot shaft 36 to rotate or more particularly pivot about its central axis 36a. Preferably, each leg member 32 is biased in an upward direction by a bias member, such as a linear tension spring 46 (<figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 16</figref>) or a torsional spring (not depicted) centered about the pivot shaft 36 between the leg member 32 and the base member 34, or another type of spring or spring member or elastomeric member (none depicted) disposed between the leg member 32 and the base member 34 or between the leg member 32 and a portion of the frame 12. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0004">5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0010">16</figref>, the second cam member 44 and its third cam 44a interact with a follower 32a operably associated with the leg member 32. The follower 32a may be a roller or wheel as depicted or merely a surface. The second cam member 44 and third cam 44a function to maintain the leg member 32 in a lowered position (against the bias of the spring 46) while the base member 34 moves in the second direction and allows the leg member 32 to pivot about the pivot shaft 36 to a raised position (with the bias of the spring 46) while the base member 34 moves in the first, return direction. By coordinating the vertical and horizontal pivoting motion of each leg member 32 in this way, the first, second and third cams 42a, 42b and 44a, function to move the leg member 32 in a cyclic walking motion depicted in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 17</figref>.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The horizontal, forward/rearward movements generated by the first and second cams 42a, 42b are illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig 17</figref> where the center leg member 32 is depicted in solid half way through a forward horizontal movement in the first (return) direction between points I and II. The rearward horizontal movement in a second propulsion direction (opposite the first) occurs between points III and IV. Also illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 17</figref> are vertical movements, a downward movement between points II and III and an upward movement between points IV and I, caused by the third cam 44a. The pivot 35 and shaft 36 and their central axes 35a, 36a are at least generally transverse to one another to provide two degrees of freedom of rotation to each leg member 35 and are preferably at least essentially perpendicular to one another to maximize the two degrees of freedom of movement to each leg assembly to permit the two dimensional movement of the leg members 32 in a generally vertical, longitudinal extending plane that is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 17</figref>. In this way, each of the leg members 32 is actuated by the drive mechanism 13 to rotate about the first and second axes 35a, 36a in the like, predetermined repeatable cycle of movements depicted in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 17</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0012 f0013">Figs. 18-23</figref>, the first, second and third cam 42a, 42b and 44a of the leg assemblies 30 are preferably configured such that the phase of the cyclic movement of each of the leg members on a lateral side are varied from one another such that only one of the three leg members 32 on each side of the toy device 10 is lifted from the travel surface at any given time. That is, only one leg member 32 on each side is in the raised position and pivoting in the first, return (forward) direction at a time while the other two leg members 32 of each side are in the lowered position and pivoting in the second (rearward) direction to impart forward motion to the toy device 10. In particular, the three legs in the foreground on the lateral side 10a of device 10 are raised and moved in the first, return direction one at a time from the leftmost leg member to the rightmost leg member. It can be further seen that the remaining three legs in the background on the opposite lateral side (10b) of the device 10 are similarly being raised and moved in the rearward direction from the leftmost to the rightmost leg member 30 (as viewed in the figure) but are displaced by a partial cycle from the leg members in the foreground. In this way, a sufficient member of the leg members 32 are in contact with the surface S to at all times support the toy device 10 in an upright manner illustrated and to produce an anatomic-like gait of the device 10 on the surface S upon actuation.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">It is noted that the just described motion of the leg members 32 occurs only when both motors 14 are driven in a rotary direction causing "forward" movement of the device 10. When both of the motors 14 are driven in an opposite rotary direction causing "rearward" movement, the cyclic motion of the leg members 32 is reversed as is the direction of the cycle of each leg member 32 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 17</figref>. Turning of the toy device 10 can be accomplished by driving one of the motors 14 in a forward-motion rotary direction and the other of the motors 14 in the rearward-motion rotary direction or by driving only one of the motors 14 or by driving both motors 14 but at different speeds.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes could be made to the embodiment described above without departing from the broad inventive concept thereof. In one important aspect of the invention, as few as a pair of the leg assemblies on opposite sides of the toy device could be used to propel the toy device. Two leg assemblies also could be used to support or at least partially support the toy device. For example, the distal, surface contacting end of each leg could be provided with a member or surface that resists rearward motion while permitting forward motion. This would permit each leg to be moved from a forward position to a rearward position as described above and brought back to a forward position without being<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> raised from the support surface in a shuffling or sliding movement. Alternatively or in addition, each leg could be pivoted slightly downwardly at the end of its rearward movement to momentarily tilt the toy device away from that side before the leg is slightly raised from the surface and returned to a forward position. Thus a chassis with one or more support wheels or equivalents such as castors or skids could be provided and the leg assemblies used only for propulsion or propulsion and partial support. Four leg assemblies could be used to mimic four-legged creatures (e.g., mammals, amphibians, and reptiles) while eight leg assemblies can be used to mimic arachnids.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The toy device 10 is conventionally powered by an on-board power source, such as a battery, or battery pack (not shown). Furthermore, it is preferred that the toy device 10 have conventional remote control electronics (not shown) for example mounted on a circuit board 22 (see <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 18</figref>) and including conventional radio receiver, microprocessor and appropriate motor control circuits (none depicted) to be remotely controlled by a user using a generally conventional remote control device (not shown) spaced from the toy device 10.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">While remote control of the toy device is preferred, it will be appreciated that the toy device can be factory preprogrammed to perform a predetermined movement or series of movements or can be configured to be selectively programmed by a user to create such predetermined movement(s). Alternatively or in addition, the toy device can be equipped with sensors, e.g., switches, proximity detectors, etc., that will control the toy device to turn away from or reverse itself automatically from whatever direction it was moving in if or when an obstacle is contacted or otherwise sensed.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Furthermore, while two, independently operative, reversible electric motors are preferred, the toy device could easily be propelled by a single motor in a conventional fashion where one of the drive trains on one side of the toy device is in continuously engages the motor with the leg assemblies on one side of the toy device and the other leg assemblies are connected to the motor through an additional throw-out gear and idler, which maintain the output of the drive reaching the other leg assemblies in the same rotational direction regardless of the rotational direction of the motor. This arrangement is sometimes referred to as J-drive.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">It is understood, therefore, that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiment disclosed, but it is intended to cover modifications within the scope of the present invention.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56986304" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Ein mit Gelenken ausgestattetes Spielzeuggerät (10), konfiguriert zur laufenden Bewegung über eine Oberfläche (S), umfassend:
