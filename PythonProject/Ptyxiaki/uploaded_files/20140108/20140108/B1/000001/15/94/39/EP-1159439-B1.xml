The vector system described herein is an improvement and modification of the two plasmid pBHG system, described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6140087A"><text>US 6,140,087</text></patcit> , whereby a replication defective genomic adenoviral vector and a shuttle plasmid were recombined via homologous recombination in a cell in which they were cotransfected.

In the absence of compensating deletions in E1 or E3, a maximum of about 2 kb can be inserted into the Ad genome to generate viable virus progeny. The E1 region is not required for viral replication in complementing 293 cells, or other cells known to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> complement E1, and up to approximately 3.2 kb can be deleted in this region to generate conditional helper independent vectors with a capacity of 5.0-5.2 kb. In the E3 region, which is not required for viral replication in cultured cells, deletions of various sizes have been utilized to generate nonconditional helper independent vectors with a capacity of up to 4.5-4.7 kb. The combination of deletions in E1 and E3 permits the construction and propagation of adenovirus vectors with a capacity for insertions of up to approximately 8 kb of foreign DNA.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The construction of Adenovirus vectors can be performed in many ways. One approach is to cotransfect permissive cells, usually, but not limited to, 293 cells, with a shuttle plasmid containing a portion of the left end of the Ad genome and, most commonly, having the E1 sequences replaced by a foreign DNA, and with DNA isolated from virions cleaved near the left end by a suitable restriction enzyme. Homologous recombination between overlapping viral DNA sequences of the shuttle plasmid and the virion DNA results in production of recombinant viruses containing the foreign DNA. A disadvantage of this method is the need to prepare purified viral DNA. In addition, such methods typically result in the presence of contaminating parental virus in the resulting vector preparations, such as when 100% of the viral DNA is not cleaved, or when the two viral DNA fragments produced by restriction cleavage are rejoined.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Another method has recently been described (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Hardy S, Kitamura M, Harris-Stansil T, Dai Y, Phipps ML, "Construction of adenovirus vectors through Cre-lox recombination." J Virol 1997 Mar;71(3):1842-1849</text></nplcit>; see also <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO9732481A"><text>PCT publication WO97/32481</text></patcit> relating to use of site-specific recombination of virus and helper dependent vectors) which involves infection of 293Cre cells (293 cells engineered to express Cre recombinase) with an Adenovirus containing a floxed packaging signal (Ψ) and transfection with a shuttle plasmid containing an ITR, a packaging signal and an expression cassette followed by a lox site, or cotransfection of 293Cre cells with purified deproteinized Adenoviral DNA and a shuttle plasmid. According to that method, Cre-mediated excision of the packaging signal from virus followed by site-specific recombination with the lox site in the shuttle plasmid<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> produces a recombinant vector containing the expression cassette. However, as Cre action is not 100% efficient, the resulting virus preparations remain contaminated with parental virus, and must be passaged in 293Cre cells to eliminate the contaminating parental virus. A further disadvantage of this method is that it requires use of an infectious virus or DNA extracted from a virus as one of the starting materials, and is thus less attractive for commercial distribution than kits containing only bacterial plasmid DNA. Furthermore, the parental virus can recombine with Ad E1 sequences present in 293 cells, resulting in a virus containing a wild-type packaging signal and a wild-type E1 region. Such recombinant virus has the propensity to overgrow the original vector, leading to contamination of subsequent vector preparations with non-attenuated E1 expressing Ads.<br/>
One of the most frequently used and most popular methods for construction of adenovirus vectors is based on "the two plasmid method" (see <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Bett, A. J., Haddara, W., Prevec, L. and Graham, F.L An efficient and flexible system for construction of adenovirus vectors with insertions or deletions in early regions 1 and 3. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. US 91: 8802-8806, 1994</text></nplcit>), whereby suitable host cells (typically 293 cells) are cotransfected with two plasmids that separately are incapable of generating infectious virus, but which, when recombined within the transfected cell by homologous recombination, can generate replicating virus. The most widely used plasmids of this type are described in patent application S/N Serial No.<patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO08250885A"><text>08/250,885</text></patcit>, and in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO9500655A"><text>PCT publication number WO95/00655</text></patcit>. That system has advantages over other methods using viruses or viral DNA as components since only easily-prepared plasmid DNAs are needed, and there is no background of parental virus that could contaminate the final vector isolates. Furthermore, the plasmids are not only easy and inexpensive to produce by those skilled in the art, but can be easily stored and transported, making them convenient for commercial distribution, (i.e. particularly when precipitated with ethanol or when lyophilized, these vectors do not require a cold chain for distribution). However, although this currently available system has proven utility and is widely used, the efficiency of virus production by homologous recombination can be low and variable, and the system cannot always be used easily by those not skilled in the art.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As demonstrated in the art (<nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Anton, M. and Graham, F.

Such techniques are combined in the present invention with a head-to-head ITR containing shuttle plasmid to provide a long-needed advancement in the art of adenoviral vector production by enhancing the efficiency of vector production, whether through homologous recombination or site-specific recombination events. In addition, the present patent disclosure demonstrates that the FLP recombinase, which recognizes a nucleic acid site known as frt (<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>O'Gorman, S., Fox, D.

It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art based on this disclosure that the method is not limited to the use of Cre recombinase and its recognition sites and FLP and its recognition sites, as other site specific recombinases that act in similar fashion to Cre and FLP could be substituted for Cre or FLP recombinases, or used in combination with such enzymes. It will also be appreciated that although the examples disclosed herein describe methods to rescue foreign DNA into the E1 region of "first generation" Ad vectors these examples are not meant to be limiting as the target sites for site specific recombination can be readily inserted into other regions of the viral genome and site specific recombination can consequently be utilized for manipulation of other regions of the viral genome besides E1.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the present invention, viruses, plasmids or both are constructed which contain head-to-head ITR junctions, and optionally, wherein said viral DNA may also contain <i>lox P</i> sites<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> positioned such that site-specific recombination between <i>lox P</i> sites in separate plasmids results in generation of infectious viral DNA at high-efficiency in cotransfected host cells that have been engineered to express the Cre recombinase. Such cells (293Cre cells) have been described by <nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>Parks, R. J., Chen, L., Anton, M., Sankar, U., Rudnicki, M. A. and Graham, F. L.

Because of the high-efficiency and specificity of the Cre enzyme, suitably engineered plasmids can be readily recombined to produce infectious virus at high-efficiency in cotransfected 293 cells, without, at the same time, producing a contaminating parental adenovirus, with the attendant problems for removal thereof.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Due to the enhancement of recombination efficiency achieved by the instant invention, whereby a head-to-head ITR junction is included in the shuttle plasmid, even in the absence of site-specific recombination, enhanced efficiency is achieved in production of recombinant virus vectors.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In one embodiment of this invention a head-to-head ITR junction is included in the shuttle plasmid, whereby enhanced efficiency of production of recombinant virus vectors is achieved whether by homologous recombination or by site-specific recombination.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In a further embodiment of this invention, homologous recombination via cellular enzymes is replaced by site-specific recombination, via a recombinase such as Cre, FLP or the like, to join two DNAs that separately are noninfectious to form an infectious DNA molecule, wherein the efficiency of the site-specific recombination is enhanced by inclusion of head-to-head ITR junctions in the shuttle plasmids of a two-plasmid system. One application of the techniques disclosed herein is the isolation of "first generation" vectors with insertions of foreign DNA in E1. Such applications utilize a series of plasmids such as<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> pBHGloxΔE1,3 (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, and variations and equivalents thereof), and various shuttle plasmids containing a head-to-head ITR junction, a packaging signal, an expression cassette, and a lox or other recombinase recognition site.<br/>
In a further embodiment of this invention, DNA-TP complexes are utilized to combine the high efficiency of head-to-head ITR mediated recombination, with or without site-specific recombination, such as Cre-lox recombination, with the high infectivity of DNA-TP. While the rescue of infectious virus via head-to-head ITR mediated homologous recombination, or head-to-head ITR mediated recombination with Cre-mediated recombination is surprisingly efficient compared to homologous recombination alone, and is more than adequate to produce viral vectors and to introduce mutations into the viral genome for most applications, there may be certain applications for which even higher efficiencies are desirable or necessary. It is known by those skilled in the art that the infectivity of adenovirus DNA is up to 100 fold higher if the virion DNA is extracted and purified by methods that leave intact the terminal protein (TP) that is normally linked to the 5' end of each strand of the duplex Ad DNA molecule (<nplcit id="ncit0008" npl-type="s"><text>Sharp PA, Moore C, Haverty JL, "The infectivity of adenovirus 5 DNA-protein complex," Virology 1976 Dec;75(2):442-456</text></nplcit>, <nplcit id="ncit0009" npl-type="s"><text>Chinnadurai G, Chinnadurai S, Green M, "Enhanced infectivity of adenovirus type 2 DNA and a DNA-protein complex." J Virol 1978 Apr;26(1):195-199</text></nplcit>). For rescue of cassettes, the two plasmid system is more than sufficiently efficient, especially with the approximately 10-fold enhancement in efficiency demonstrated herein for head-to-head ITR mediated recombination, or the approximately 100-fold enhancement in efficiency demonstrated herein for head-to-head ITR mediated recombination when coupled with Cre-lox mediated recombination (over homologous recombination alone), and consequently would be preferred for most purposes. However, there may be times when even higher efficiencies are required, as when, for example, one wishes to develop a library of fibre mutations (a large number of different viruses - the more the better). Then the chore of preparing DNA-TP might be worthwhile and could be accomplished by those skilled in the art.

Said bacterial plasmid is designed to be unable to generate infectious adenovirus by virtue of a deletion of viral DNA sequences, such as the packaging signal, which is normally located at the left end of wild-type Ad DNA, and which is essential for virus replication. Alternatively, formation of infectious virus may be prevented by the insertion of DNA ("stuffer DNA") such that the overall size of the resulting virus DNA exceeds the upper packaging limit for Ad virions (approximately 38 kb). Deletion of the pIX sequences from the Ad sequences makes the size-limitation of the packaging limitation more stringent, unless complementing cells which express the pIX gene product are used. Optionally, certain additional viral DNA sequences may be deleted, such as sequences from E3, which can in any event be omitted from the viral genome without preventing a viral genome from replicating in such cells as may be permissive for replication of said viral genome in the form of infectious virus.<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Another embodiment of the invention provides a second bacterial plasmid, known as a "shuttle" plasmid, comprising minimally approximately 340 base pairs from the left end of the Ad5 genome, a head-to-head terminal repeat sequence (referred to in abbreviated form herein as "hthITR"), and the packaging signal sequences thereof, optionally a promoter, optionally a foreign DNA encoding a protein, optionally a polyadenylation signal, and optionally a <i>lox</i> site (various <i>lox</i> sites are known in the art, including, but not limited to <i>loxP, lox511, lox514, loxPsym,</i> and mention of any one of these sites incorporates the mention of the other <i>lox</i> sites), or like site-specific recombinase recognition sites, such as FRT, recognized by the FLP recombinase. The promoter, foreign gene and poly adenylation signal are referred to herein collectively as an "expression cassette". Cotransfecting 293Cre cells with said shuttle plasmid and the plasmid of the first embodiment of the invention results in recombination between said plasmids and rescue of said expression cassette into an infectious viral vector by homologous recombination or by action of said Cre recombinase. The hthITR present in the shuttle plasmid has, surprisingly, been found to significantly enhance the level or recombination and rescue of recombinant virus, whether through homologous recombination or through site-specific, recombinase directed recombination, or both.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">It will be appreciated that the term "bacterial plasmid" is not meant to be limiting, since one skilled in the art would recognize that other types of DNA could be recombined with equal efficiency, by homologous or site-specific recombination, such as through use of the Cre recombinase. For example, the Cre recombinase could be expressed in yeast cells to allow for high-efficiency recombination between yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC's) harboring<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> an Ad genome, or, similarly, in bacteria, to allow for Cre-mediated recombination between cosmids or bacteriophage genomes harboring Ad sequences. Similarly, expression of Cre in mammalian cells could be used to allow for efficient recombination between two or more infectious Ad vectors, between an Ad vector and a bacterial plasmid, between an adenoviral genome and a linear DNA fragment and the like.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A third embodiment of the invention provides a mammalian cell line, such as a human cell line, that provides the Cre recombinase enzyme.

Alternatively, Cre could be expressed in other species, for example bacteria or yeast, to allow for recombination and generation of recombinant Ad genomes in said species.

First, the efficiency by which recombinants are produced is enhanced through use of an hthITR junction in combination with homologous recombination or in combination with site-specific recombination, rather than relying exclusively on homologous recombination. This invention further advances the art in that it facilitates use of vectors which are themselves non-infectious and stable. Further, by use of the methods disclosed herein, rapid production of recombinant virus is facilitated wherein every virus produced is a recombinant virus, as opposed to known methods wherein a starting virus is used in a site-specific recombination wherein substantial levels of non-recombinant starting virus remain in the preparation which has to then be serially passaged to remove the contaminating starter virus. As a result of this enhanced efficiency, while it may in many instances be desirable to colony or plaque-purify the results of a given cotransfection,<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> because all viruses produced according to this embodiment of the instant technique are recombinants, plaque purification is not absolutely required.

Among the regions of the viral genome that encode proteins that function in <i>trans</i>, two have been most important in the design and development of adenovirus vectors. These are early region 3 (E3) located between approximately 76 and 86 mu (mu = % distance from the left end of the conventionally oriented genome) and early region 1 (E1) located between approximately 1 and 11 mu. E3 sequences have long been known to be nonessential for virus replication in cultured cells and many viral vectors have deletions of<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> E3 sequences so that the capacity of the resulting vector backbone for insertion of foreign DNA is thereby increased significantly over that allowable by the wild-type virus (<nplcit id="ncit0029" npl-type="s"><text>Bett, A.

However, E1 can also be deleted, providing that the resulting virus is propagated in host cells, such as the 293 cell line, PER-C6 cells, 911 cells, and the like, which contain and express E1 genes and can complement the deficiency of E1 (-) viruses.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Viruses with foreign DNA inserted in place of E1 sequences, and optionally also carrying deletions of E3 sequences are conventionally known as "first generation" adenovirus vectors. First generation vectors are of proven utility for many applications. They can be used as research tools for high-efficiency transfer and expression of foreign genes in mammalian cells derived from many tissues and from many species. First generation vectors can be used in development of recombinant viral vaccines when the vectors contain and express antigens derived from pathogenic organisms. The vectors can be used for gene therapy, because of their ability to efficiently transfer and express foreign genes <i>in vivo</i>, and due to their ability to transduce both replicating and nonreplicating cells in many different tissues. Adenovirus vectors are widely used in these applications.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">There are many known ways to construct adenovirus vectors. As discussed above, one of the most commonly employed methods is the so called "two plasmid" technique. In that procedure, two noninfectious bacterial plasmids are constructed with the following properties: each plasmid alone is incapable of generating infectious virus. However, in<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> combination, the plasmids potentially can generate infectious virus, provided the viral sequences contained therein are homologously recombined to constitute a complete infectious virus DNA. According to that method, typically one plasmid is large (approximately 30,000-35,000 nt) and contains most of the viral genome, save for some DNA segment (such as that comprising the packaging signal, or encoding an essential gene) whose deletion renders the plasmid incapable of producing infectious virus or said plasmid contains an insertion such that said viral genome would be too large to be packaged into virions. The second plasmid is typically smaller (eg 5000-10,000 nt), as small size aids in the manipulation of the plasmid DNA by recombinant DNA techniques. Said second plasmid contains viral DNA sequences that partially overlap with sequences present in the larger plasmid. Together with the viral sequences of the larger plasmid, the sequences of the second plasmid can potentially constitute an infectious viral DNA. Cotransfection of a host cell with the two plasmids produces an infectious virus as a result of homologous recombination between the overlapping viral DNA sequences common to the two plasmids. One particular system in general use by those skilled in the art is based on a series of large plasmids known as pBHG10, pBHG11 and pBHGE3 described by <nplcit id="ncit0030" npl-type="s"><text>Bett, A. J., Haddara, W., Prevec, L. and Graham, F.L: "An efficient and flexible system for construction of adenovirus vectors with insertions or deletions in early regions 1 and 3," Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Those plasmids contain most of the viral genome and are capable of producing infectious virus but for the deletion of the packaging signal located at the left end of the wild-type viral genome. The second component of that system comprises a series of "shuttle" plasmids that contain the left approximately 340 nt of the Ad genome including<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> the packaging signal, optionally a polycloning site, or optionally an expression cassette, followed by viral sequences from near the right end of E1 to approximately 15 mu or optionally to a point further rightward in the genome. The viral sequences rightward of E1 overlap with sequences in the pBHG plasmids and, via homologous recombination in cotransfected host cells, produce infectious virus. The resulting viruses contain the packaging signal derived from the shuttle plasmid, as well as any sequences, such as a foreign DNA inserted into the polycloning site or expression cassette located in the shuttle plasmid between the packaging signal and the overlap sequences. Because neither plasmid alone has the capability to produce replicating virus, infectious viral vector progeny can only arise as a result of recombination within the cotransfected host cell. However, as has been noted above, such homologous recombination processes can be inefficient, resulting in variable success in the isolation of vectors and occasional failure, particularly in the hands of those who are not specifically skilled in the art of virology, and more particularly, in the art of adenovirology.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Site-specific recombination catalysed by an efficient recombinase, such as the Cre or FLP recombinase, can be many fold more efficient than homologous recombination.

A 35-fold increase represents a very significant and unexpectedly high improvement over efficiencies of vector rescue when virus isolation is dependent on homologous recombination. Coupled with the fact that the only infectious virus present in the transfected cell preparation are recombinants, rather than contaminating starting virus, the efficiency, cleanliness and convenience of this method in comparison to known methods represent significant advances in the art. Thus, with this new method it will be possible to reduce the amount of plasmid DNA used in cotransfections and reduce the number of dishes of 293 (293Cre) cells needed in cotransfections for rescue of viral vectors. It will also aid in the rescue of constructs which, for unknown reasons, might be otherwise difficult to rescue (e.g. rescue of vectors containing large foreign DNA inserts in E1 is often inefficient for reasons that are not known).</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">To confirm that the enhanced efficiency of plaque formation following cotransfection of 293Cre cells with pCA36 + pBHGloxAE1,3 was due to Cre-lox dependent recombination (versus, for example, enhanced efficiency of homologous recombination) we constructed a derivative of pCA36lox, named pCA36loxΔ (see <figref idrefs="f0017">Figure 8</figref>), from which overlapping Ad sequences to the right of the lox site had been removed, thus virtually eliminating any possibility of homologous recombination.

In contrast pCA36 or pCA36lox were able to generate small numbers of plaques on 293 cells. However, again, the efficiency was markedly enhanced if 293Cre cells were cotransfected with pCA36lox and pBHGloxAE1,3.

Construction of Ad vectors by Cre-mediated recombination between two plasmids<!-- EPO <DP n="66"> --> cotransfected into 293Cre4 cells is highly efficient. Unfortunately, this system requires E1-complementing cell lines expressing Cre, which are currently not as widely available as are the parental 293 cells. This method would be more widely applicable if high efficiency Cre-mediated vector rescue could be achieved using the ubiquitous 293 cells or other E1-complementing cell lines. Therefore, we modified the system by introducing a Cre expression cassette into the shuttle plasmid pCA36loxΔ to generate pCA361oxΔCreR and pCA36loxΔCreT (<figref idrefs="f0020">Fig. 8c</figref>). The plasmids were designed so that the Cre cassette is not incorporated into the recombinant vector after recombination owing to its location within the plasmids, but should permit transient Cre expression following cotransfection thus abrogating the need for a Cre-expressing cell line. The validity of this approach was tested by comparing the vector rescue efficiencies following cotransfection of 293 cells with pBHGloxΔE1,3 and shuttle plasmids with or without the Cre expression cassette. The results of typical experiments are presented in Table 3.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">Similar numbers of plaques were generated with pCA361oxΔCreR (Table 3). However, the efficiencies of vector rescue using pCA36loxΔCreT or pCA361oxΔCreR were considerably lower than that obtained using 293Cre4 cells (Table 3) suggesting that constitutive Cre expression from 293Cre4 cells resulted in more efficient Cre-mediated vector rescue than was obtained via transient Cre-expression from the transfected shuttle plasmid.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">Although we had no direct measure of Cre levels in 293Cre4 cells compared to 293 cells transiently transfected with pCA36loxΔCreR, it was possible that Cre recombinase levels in 293Cre4 cells were higher than levels in transfected 293 cells. Therefore we asked<!-- EPO <DP n="67"> --> whether it might be possible to increase the efficiency of Cre-mediated vector rescue by increasing the copy number of the shuttle plasmid. To do this we replaced the single ITR junction in pCA36loxΔCreT with a head-to-head ITR junction to generate pCA35loxΔCreITR (<figref idrefs="f0020">Fig. 8c</figref>). The rationale for this modification was based on the observation that an ITR junction can serve as an efficient origin of Ad DNA replication resulting in linearization and, presumably, amplification of plasmid DNA (<nplcit id="ncit0043" npl-type="s"><text>Graham, 1984 EMBO J. 3:2971</text></nplcit>). Therefore, following cotransfection of 293 cells with pBHGloxAE1,3, which also bears an ITR junction as well as encoding all trans-acting factors required for Ad DNA replication, pCA35loxCreITR was expected to linearize and replicate, which we anticipated should also result in increased Cre expression (more copies of the expression cassette). The validity of this approach was tested by comparing the vector rescue efficiencies following cotransfection of 293 cells with pBHGIoxΔE1,3 plus various shuttle plasmids. The results of a typical experiment are presented in Table 4. In contrast to the results with pCA36loxΔCreT, the number of plaques generated with pCA35loxΔCreITR was -10-fold higher (Table 4) indicating that replacement of the single ITR with an ITR junction resulted in a significant increase in the efficiency of Cre-mediated vector rescue using 293 cells.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">The results presented in Table 4 indicated that a shuttle plasmid containing a Cre expression cassette and an ITR junction resulted in very significantly improved rescue efficiency compared to a similar plasmid that had only a single ITR. However, in the absence of direct measurements of Cre protein in transfected cells we could not conclude that this was due to enhanced Cre expression or due to some other mechanism. As a control<!-- EPO <DP n="68"> --> experiment we constructed a shuttle plasmid without the Cre cassette and containing an ITR junction for comparison with a similar plasmid having a single ITR (<figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 2a</figref>). Virus rescue in this experiment (Table 5) was dependent on homologous rather than Cre-mediated recombination since none of the plasmids used contained lox sites and no Cre was expressed in the cotransfected cells. Surprisingly, the shuttle plasmid with an ITR junction gave about 10 fold higher efficiency of recombinant virus rescue compared to an otherwise identical plasmid with a single ITR. Thus the improved rescue using pCA35loxCreITR compared to pCA36loxΔCreT may be entirely due to the use of an ITR junction rather than to increased levels of Cre. Consequently, recombinant virus rescue using the two plasmid approach is markedly improved (approximately 10 fold greater efficiency) by incorporation of ITR junctions into the shuttle plasmids. This allows either for greater numbers of plaques to be produced or allows for vector rescue to be achieved using lower concentrations of plasmid DNA in the cotransfections or fewer numbers of cells or both.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Expression of Cre can be from the cotransfected cells, eg through use of 293Cre4 cells or the like, or by expression from Cre cassettes cloned in one or the other of the cotransfected plasmids. For example, not meant to be limiting, a Cre cassette can be inserted into the genomic plasmid such as one based on pBHGloxΔE1,3. An example of one method of construction of such plasmids is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 4c</figref> wherein a Cre expression cassette was inserted in either of two orientations into a pBHG10 derivative, pBHGloxΔE1,3, to generate pBHGIoxΔE1,3Cre and pBHGloxΔE1,3CreR. Combining use of ITR junctions with the Cre-mediated recombination system of AdVec10 improves the efficiency of recombinant virus production by at least 100 fold over the original two plasmid method<!-- EPO <DP n="69"> --> (Tables 6-9). For example, the data presented in Table 6 show that cotransfection of 293 cells with the genomic plasmid, pBHGloxΔE1,3, plus the shuttle plasmid pCA36lox did not produce any plaques, in this experiment, because of the low efficiency of rescue by homologous recombination when the shuttle plasmid contains only a single ITR. In contrast addition of an ITR junction resulted in relatively high efficiency of rescue (15 plaques/dish), and cotransfection of 293Cre cells with pCA36lox + pBHGloxΔE1,3 (which allows for rescue by Cre mediated recombination) resulted in 11 plaques/dish. The best efficiencies were obtained by cotransfecting 293Cre cells with the shuttle plasmid containing an ITR junction: 113 plaques/dish. That recombination was due to action of Cre can be seen from the results obtained when the shuttles are deleted of Ad sequences rightward of the expression cassette thus preventing homologous recombination. In this case, no plaques were obtained following cotransfection of 293 cells but over a hundred plaques/dish were obtained in 293Cre cells when the plasmid contained an ITR junction. Thus a preferred embodiment of the invention is the combination of site specific recombination with use of shuttle plasmids that contain ITR junctions in addition to lox sites. Nonetheless, those skilled in the art will appreciate that even the simple addition of an ITR junction to the shuttle plasmids used in homolgous recombinations results in a marked improvement in rescue efficiency over use of plasmids containing a single ITR. Thus when use of a site specific recombinase might be impractical or undesirable, use of shuttle plasmids with ITR junctions provides a simple and relatively efficient means to construct Ad vectors containing foreign DNA insertions.<!-- EPO <DP n="70"> --></p><p id="p0087" num="0087">The results presented in Table 7 demonstrate that Cre recombinase can be provided by the cotransfecting shuttle plasmid, for example pCA35loxΔCreITR, or by the cotransfected host cells, eg. 293Cre cells. In these and several additional experiments, plaques were isolated, expanded on 293 cells and analyzed for viral DNA structure and for expression of β-galactosidase from the expression cassette cloned in pCA35 and pCA36 and derivative plasmids. Over 60 independent plaque isolates were analyzed in this way and in every case the viral DNA structure was that predicted for recombinant viral vectors generated by recombination between the genomic plasmid DNA and the shuttle plasmid DNA and all recombinant viruses expressed β-galactosidase. Thus the methods described herein provide for accurate and reliable construction of Ad vectors containing and expressing a foreign DNA.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">The results presented in Table 8 indicate that for high efficiency rescue the Cre recombinase can be expressed by the recipient host cells, such as 293Cre4 cells, or by the shuttle plasmid, such as pCA35loxΔCreITR, or by the genomic plasmid such as pBHGloxΔE1,3Cre or by a combination of these. It will be seen by those skilled in the art that the result of recombination between said plasmids is a virus that does not contain the Cre expression cassette. The results also provide further evidence for the importance of providing an ITR junction on the shuttle plasmid whether rescue is via homologous recombination or via site specific recombination.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Thus, as is amply illustrated by the results of numerous cotransfection experiments presented in Tables 6, 7, 8, the Cre recombinase may be expressed from either of the<!-- EPO <DP n="71"> --> cotransfecting plasmids or from the host cells, such as 293Cre4 cells. The efficiency of rescue of recombinant viruses can be remarkably high, in some experiments, such as those illustrated by Table 9 , resulting in too many plaques to be countable. Although a Cre cassette may be in either the genomic plasmid or in the shuttle plasmid, if Cre expression is provided by the cotransfected plasmid DNA rather than from the transfected host cells, it is a preferred emodiment of the invention that the Cre cassette be present in the genomic plasmid for two reasons: firstly, the shuttle plasmids may then be as small as possible with as many cloning sites as possible for ease of insertion of foreign DNAs, and secondly, the results illustrated in Tables 9, 10 suggest that the efficiency of rescue is greater for those transfections of 293 cells in which Cre recombinase is provided by the genomic plasmid, specifically the plasmid pBHGloxΔE1,3Cre.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many different shuttle plasmids can be constructed and used to generate recombinant viral vectors by the methods outlined above. As an example, not meant to be limiting, the series of shuttle plasmids illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">Figures 5a</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0011">5b</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0013">5d</figref> were constructed from readily available plasmids using methods commonly employed by those skilled in the art. Among the shuttle plasmids constructed are plasmids such as pΔE1Sp1AloxITR(MCS) and pΔE1Sp1BloxITR(MCS) (<figref idrefs="f0010">Figure. 5a</figref>) that have ITR junctions, polycloning sites (MCS), lox sites and Ad sequences for homologous recombination. Said plasmids can be used for virus rescue by either homologous or site specific recombination by the methods outlined above. Other useful plasmids are pDC111-114 (<figref idrefs="f0011">Figure 5b</figref>) also having ITR junctions, polycloning sites, lox sites, or having ITR junctions and Ad sequences for homologous recombination (pDC113 and pDC114) if Cre<!-- EPO <DP n="72"> --> mediated recombination is not required or not desirable. <figref idrefs="f0013">Figure 5d</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0014">Figure 6</figref> illustrate the construction of several shuttle plasmids that have a promoter (the murine cytomegalovirus immediate early gene promoter, MCMV), a polycloning region, and polyadenylation signal (SV40) for insertion and expression of cDNAs in Ad vectors. These plasmids provide for considerable versatility in vector isolation. For example, pDC115 and pUC116 (<figref idrefs="f0013">Figure 5d</figref>), having lox sites but no Ad sequences rightward of the lox sites, can be used for virus rescue by cotransfection of cells in the presence of Cre recombinase. Plasmids pDC117 and 118 on the other hand, having no lox sites but having Ad sequences for homologous recombination, can be used for recombinant virus isolation in the absence of Cre recombinase, and the efficiency of rescue is high due to the presence of ITR junctions.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">The use of shuttle plasmids with ITR junctions and the use of Cre mediated site specific recombination and the combination of these two improvements significantly increase the efficiency and reliability of the two plasmid system for Ad vector construction. These new methods will permit the production of expression vector libraries comprising large numbers of recombinant adenovirus vectors capable of expressing different cDNAs for analysis of protein function in mammalian cells and in animals. Vectors produced by the methods disclosed herein can also find use as recombinant viral vaccines and in gene therapy.</p><heading id="h0024"><u>EXAMPLE 12</u></heading><heading id="h0025"><u>PRODUCTION OF RECOMBINANT VECTOR USING FLP-FRT RECOMBINATION</u></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="73"> --><p id="p0092" num="0092">293 cells and 293 Cre cells transformed with an expression plasmid actively encoding FLP recombinase and demonstrated to express functional FLP have been disclosed in copending Patent application (docket no.

As FLP is capable of catalyzing site specific recombination between frt sites (<figref idrefs="f0023">Figure 9A</figref>) in a manner analogous to Cre mediated site specific recombination between loxP sites it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that genomic plasmids and shuttle plasmids carrying frt sites at loci previously occupied by loxP sites can be used in an analogous system as that disclosed in copending application (AdVec10, <patcit id="pcit0018" dnum="USSN09263650A"><text>USSN 09/263,650</text></patcit> and AdVec10IA, <patcit id="pcit0019" dnum="USSN09415899A"><text>USSN 09/415,899</text></patcit>) to rescue foreign DNA into Ad vectors by site specific recombination. Accordingly, this invention enables the production of viruses and vectors generated by FLP-mediated site specific recombination between two cotransfected plasmid DNAs in 293FLP cells. An example of a genomic plasmid derived from pBHG10 (<nplcit id="ncit0044" npl-type="s"><text>Bett, A.

The minimal frt DNA sequence is a 34bp DNA segment that is readily produced as a synthetic deoxyoligonucleotide that can be inserted into plasmid or viral DNA (see <figref idrefs="f0023">Figure 9A</figref>). The genomic plasmid pBHGfrtΔE1,3 was constructed in two stages. First a synthetic oligonucleotide carrying an frt site comprising annealed oligonucleotides AB10352 and AB10353 was inserted into the BglII site of pΔE1SP1A (<nplcit id="ncit0045" npl-type="s"><text>Bett, A.

Second, an EcoRV-Bst1107I fragment spanning said frt site and pIX gene was substituted for a Bst1071 fragment in pBHG10.

This constitutes the basis for the "two plasmid" rescue method for construction of Ad vectors (<nplcit id="ncit0046" npl-type="s"><text>Bett, A.

We have shown previously (Ng et al, 1999, 2000) that site specific recombination catalyzed, for example, by Cre recombinase, is more efficient than homologous recombination. We now demonstrate in the following that FLP mediated recombination is likewise highly efficient in generating recombinant viruses from cells cotransfected with a genomic plasmid and a shuttle plasmid both of which contain frt sites.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094"><figref idrefs="f0026">Figure 10A</figref> illustrates the construction of a shuttle plasmid, pCA35AfrtITR, made by insertion of a synthetic frt site comprised of oligonucleotides AB19509 and AB19510 between a BglII site and an EheI site in pCA35ITR, a shuttle plasmid containing an expression cassette for the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> β-galactosidase gene. The resulting plasmid,<!-- EPO <DP n="75"> --> pCA35ΔfrtITR, comprises an ITR junction, the viral packaging signal, the β-galactosidase expression cassette and an frt site in the same orientation as the frt site in pBHGfitAE1,3. FLP mediated recombination between said frt sites, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0027">Figure 10B</figref>, results in generation of a recombinant adenovirus expression vector containing the transgene, the E. coli β-galactosidase gene in this example, inserted in the E1 region of said virus. The results of a typical experiment demonstrating that FLP functions with high efficiency to produce recombinant viral vectors in cotransfected 293FLP cells are illustrated in Table 11. We have previously demonstrated (Ng et al., 2000; AdVec 10IA, <patcit id="pcit0020" dnum="USSN09415899A"><text>USSN 09/415,899</text></patcit>) that in Cre mediated rescue of Ad vectors the recombinase need not be expressed constitutively by the host cells that are cotransfected but can be transiently expressed from an expression cassette cloned either into the genomic plasmid or into the shuttle plasmid. This system has certain advantages over a system utilizing recombinase expressing host cells since rescue can be performed in any suitable host cell including a host cell that has not previously been engineered to express a recombinase. Thus for certain purposes, insertion of a recombinase gene into one of the cotransfected plasmids is a preferred embodiment of the invention. Therefore we constructed a FLP expressing genomic plasmid, pBHGfitΔEI,3FLP, derived from pBHGfitAE1,3 as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0028">Figure 11</figref>. First, pBHGfrtΔE1,3 was modified by insertion of a synthetic oligonucleotide containing a SwaI restriction site to generate pBHGfrtAE1,3poly2. Next, a FLP recombinase expression cassette contained within a HpaI-SalI fragment of pdelE1CMVFLP (obtained from Volker Sandig, Merck Research Laboratories, Inc) was inserted into the SwaI site of pBHGfrtΔE1,3poly2 as illustrated. The final plasmid, pBHGfrtΔE1,3FLP, thus contains a FLP expression cassette that results in transient expression of FLP in cotransfected cells that catalyzes site specific recombination<!-- EPO <DP n="76"> --> between the frt site in pBHGfrtΔE1,3FLP and a frt site in a cotransfected shuttle plasmid such as pCA35ΔfrtITR to generate an infectious Ad vector identical to that illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0027">Figure 10B</figref>. The genomic plasmid, pBHGfrtΔE1,3FLP, is designed such that the FLP expression cassette is not introduced into the final recombinant virus.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the foregoing examples are not meant to be limiting.
