Therefore, if such cyclopropene compounds are not stored at a low temperature (below -100°C), they may easily undergo loss of their chemical properties through dimerization etc. In order to solve the problems associated with the storage of these compounds, a variety of research has been actively undertaken to find a method for safe storage of the cyclopropene compounds.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For example, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6017849A"><text>UP Patent Nos. 6,017,849</text></patcit>,<patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6426319B"><text> 6,426,319</text></patcit>,<patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6444619B"><text> 6,444,619</text></patcit>,<patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US6548448B"><text> 6,548,448</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US6762153B"><text>6,762,153</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US6953540B"><text>6,953,540</text></patcit> disclose safe storage methods of cyclopropene derivatives, particularly 1-methylcyclopropene and application thereof to target sites. That is, these patents disclose the encapsulation of small molecules such as 1-methylcyclopropene into macromolecules such as α-cyclodextrin. More specifically, 1-methylcyclopropene is safely stored using α-cyclodextrin, and α-cyclodextrin complex containing 1-methylcyclopropene is treated with water, upon using thereof for desired applications. The added water molecules gradually infiltrate into α-cyclodextrin, thus leading to the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> release of 1-methylcyclopropene to the outside, and therefore the released 1-methylcyclopropene acts on plants to thereby inhibit the action of ethylene.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, the above-mentioned techniques suffer from various disadvantages such as a difficulty to prepare 1-methylcyclopropene, a separate process of adsorbing 1-methylcyclopropene to α-cyclodextrin after preparation of 1-methylcyclopropene, a treatment of the 1-methylcyclopropene-containing α-cyclodextrin complex with water to release 1-methylcyclopropene from the complex for treatment of 1-methylcyclopropene on the plants, thus resulting in a long processing time and know-how for such treatment, consequently high processing costs.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">To this end, as discussed hereinbefore, there is a strong need for the development of a technique which is capable of achieving convenient <i>in situ</i> preparation of cyclopropene derivatives in a simplified manner, followed by direct treatment thereof to the plants.

For example, the storage member may be in the form of a container having an outlet for supply of reaction materials on at least one side and made of a material inert to the reaction materials and reagents. That is, the storage part may be composed of the first storage container for storing the cyclopropene precursors and the second storage container for storing reaction reagents.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In one specific embodiment, the device further includes a reaction vessel selectively interconnected to the first storage container and the second storage container, and the spray part may be connected to the reaction vessel. Therefore, the cyclopropene precursors and the reaction reagents, supplied from individual storage containers, are contacted to undergo chemical reaction in the reaction vessel, thereby producing cyclopropene derivatives, and the resulting cyclopropene derivatives are discharged through the spray part. Where appropriate, the spray part may also be integrated into the reaction vessel as a part thereof.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In another embodiment, the spray part may be directly connected to the second storage container or otherwise may be integrated into the second storage container as a part thereof, and the first storage container may be selectively interconnected with the second storage container. Where appropriate, the device may be embodied in a different structure wherein the spray part is directly connected to the first storage container or otherwise is integrated into the first storage container as a part thereof, and the second storage container is selectively interconnected with the first storage container.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As used herein, the phrase "selectively interconnected" means that the interconnection part may be opened or closed, if necessary. As one example for this<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> purpose, mention may be made of a structure in which each container is interconnected via the pipes, and the pipes are provided with control valves such as open-close type cocks. In yet another embodiment, the device may have a structure in which individual containers are adjacent to each other, openings for interconnection are formed at an adjoined area, and open-close type barriers are installed in the openings.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In one preferred embodiment, for easy spraying of the resulting cyclopropene derivatives, the device may further include a carrier supply part for a carrier gas as a medium toward the spray part. Examples of the carrier gas may include inert gas such as nitrogen, air, and the like. The carrier supply part may be, for example, a compressor for inducing gas stream. The carrier supply part is connected to the reaction vessel or the second storage container (or the first storage container) in the above-discussed embodiments and thereby facilitates migration of the cyclopropene derivatives to the spray part.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The spray part in the device of the present invention may have various configurations, and may optionally include, for example, a nozzle for controlling a spraying amount and direction of the cyclopropene derivatives, a heater for facilitating evaporation of liquid cyclopropene derivatives and a filter for removing chemical impurities produced from the reaction.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The cyclopropene derivatives prepared in the device of the present invention is a material represented by Formula I below:<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> -->
