mxw-id="PDES63961209" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present application relates to the field of angle or phase modulation of a carrier signal.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND ART</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Angle or phase modulators are typically used in digital transmitters to encode messages in the phase of the output signal from the transmitter. High speed links require a large modulation bandwidth in the phase modulator. One method of modulation is to configure a single wide band loop so that all the modulation is performed inside the loop. In this manner, the loop stabilizes around the modulation. The main problem with using a single wide band loop is that a lot of noise is present. To address such a noise problem, a dual path modulation system can be used. This dual path modulation system typically keeps the main loop relatively narrow so that the noise can be controlled. However, using a narrow band main loop leaves fairly wide band modulations where the higher frequencies outside the main loop still have to be calibrated so that the overall gain is flat.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">One dual-path method to is to use an angle or phase modulating system including a phase locked loop and apply the phase<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> information to the main loop reference while simultaneously applying modulation directly to an analog voltage controlled oscillator used for the transmitter signal. The main loop reference is also called a direct path. The modulation is applied to a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) via an auxiliary modulation path separate from the direct path. The variations in analog circuitry result in a mismatch between the phase indicated by the auxiliary modulation path and the phase indicated by the direct path. This variation must be calibrated.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary block diagram of a conventional dual path angle modulator 10 as described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6094101A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,094,101</text></patcit>. The output of the main loop VCO 28 is mixed, via mixer 30, with the output of an offset PLL 32 to produce an IF (intermediate frequency) output signal frequency equal to the difference between the main loop VCO frequency and the offset loop frequency. The IF output signal is the feed back signal needed to measure the output phase and is processed in the remainder of the circuitry, which is all digital, to produce a control signal for the main loop VCO 28. The main loop VCO 28 produces the desired output signal phase. The digital circuitry has two paths, one low frequency path directly through the loop and a high frequency path with a scaling gain of MS. The scaling factor MS is adjusted for flat overall frequency response, and provides for balancing of the gain among the low-frequency, or direct, path and the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> high-frequency, or auxiliary, modulation path. Determination and application of the proper value of MS requires a calibration procedure.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">During the calibration procedure, a known modulation signal is applied and the output is measured. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the known modulation signal is generated by the phrase modulation generator 12, which is applied to the digital synthesizer 18 to output the signal S. An analog to digital converter (ADC) 34, such as a Sigma-Delta frequency to digital converter, provides a measured signal M which is a digital representation of the analog frequency output from the VCO 28. A logic circuit 36 receives the signal S and the signal M, and outputs an error signal A representing the frequency error between the signal S and the signal M. The error signal Δ is filtered using a digital filter, represented as the K1 block 20 and the K2/s block 22 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. The output of the K1 block 20 is a frequency error signal and the output of the K2/s block 22 is a phase error signal. The frequency error signal and the phase error signal are directed to a DAC 26 via a summing logic circuit 24. The scaling factor FS is used to add angle modulation waveform to the frequency error signal and the phase error signal via the summing logic circuit 24. The output signal of the DAC 26 is applied through resistors R1 and R2 to an integrating capacitor C1. The voltage stored on the integrating capacitor C1 is applied to the VCO 28.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The auxiliary modulation path is used to modify a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> modulation voltage applied to the VCO 28 in the main loop. The modulation signal generated by the phase modulation generator 12 is applied to a modulation DAC 42 via an MS multiplier 38. The MS multiplier 38 applies the scaling factor MS to the modulation signal. An output signal of the modulation DAC 42 is applied to the VCO 28 via the integrating capacitor C1. The modulating signal of the auxiliary path is scaled by the gain parameter MS, via the MS multiplier 38, and also scaled by the scaling factor FS, via the FS multiplier 40, and applied to the main loop at the summing logic circuit 24.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Achieving accurate wide bandwidth angle modulation in a phase locked loop is difficult. The method of using two or more paths to impress the phase information on the phase locked loop VCO is an established method. However, VCOs tend to drift and DACs also introduce inaccuracies. The gains in each of the two paths have to match. If the gain of the auxiliary modulation path (the path through which the higher frequencies pass) is too high, then too much modulation is applied to the VCO. If the gain of the auxiliary modulation path is too low, then there is insufficient modulation on the VCO. The means for balancing these two modulation paths has conventionally been achieved using a calibration procedure that focuses just on this calibration issue. The calibration procedure is either done manually using swept frequency techniques or done automatically using special calibration signals. However, such approaches are intrusive to the normal operation<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> of such an angle or phase modulator because the calibration procedure can not be performed while the system is in operation. Instead, operation of the system must be suspended, and only during such a lapse time can the calibration procedure be performed.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Many conventional systems are designed to operate in bursts, which provide the necessary lapse time to perform the calibration procedure. Examples of such systems include GSM systems, other cellular networks, or any network using TDMA (time division multiple access). A transmitter included within such a system operates in a stand-by mode for a portion of the time. When it is time to transmit, the transmitter is awakened from stand-by mode, a calibration procedure is executed, the transmission is made, and the transmitter goes back to stand-by mode.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, in newer generation systems, such as CDMA (code division multiple access), the transmitter is operating at all times, and there are no natural periods or intervals of down time where a calibration procedure can be performed. It is critical to the operation of a dual path modulator that both paths have exactly the same gain, so calibration of the two paths is still necessary.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In a conventional dual path angle modulator, if gains are wrong in the forward path of the control loop, then the entire signal is normalized within the control loop, including noise. A current practice is to make the bandwidth very wide so that the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> control loop automatically normalizes the entire wide band modulation signal. This practice yields a lot of noise in the output signal. As wider signal bandwidths are utilized, such as for wideband CDMA and wireless LAN, the resulting noise becomes impractical.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6094101A"><text>US 6, 094, 101 A</text></patcit> discloses a phase lock loop comprising a VCO, of which the output is input to a phase detector, which receives as a second input the modulated numeric frequency.

The VCO also receives the modulation input signal via a second sigma-delta converter which is connected to the VCO.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5483203A"><text>US 5, 483, 203 A</text></patcit> discloses the use of a phase detector output signal as a gain control signal which is used to control the amplitude of an input signal which is used as the direct modulating signal on a VCO.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The subject-matter of the invention is defined by the feature of claims 1 and 12. Embodiments of the invention are described by the features of claims 2 to 11.</p><heading id="h0003">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present application is directed to a multiple path angle modulator in which a closed secondary loop is added to a main control loop to automatically adjust a scaling factor related<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> to high frequency gain to the angle modulation. This improves conventional dual path modulators and provides a real time method for balancing the two or more phase modulation paths in a closed loop phase modulator. This is done by taking advantage of the fact that the desired phase modulation signal is distributed in frequency such that components fall into the frequency response of all the modulation paths. Any subsequent discussion referring to frequency or phase refers in general to frequency, phase, and phase differential, where appropriate. The main control loop can be configured as a primary path to process the low frequency portion of the phase modulation signal, and the secondary loop is configured as an auxiliary path to process the high frequency portions of the phase modulation signal. The secondary loop senses calibration information and uses it to calibrate the gain within each loop. In alternative embodiments, additional auxiliary<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> paths are configured to further de-couple the frequency spectrum.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The two or more phase modulation paths are balanced when the output phase of a phase locked loop VCO in the main control loop exactly matches the input phase, thereby meeting calibration requirements for the gain in each path. As applied herein, a varying frequency input signal can be applied to the multiple path angle modulator. As such, the term "a phase lock loop" refers generally to "a frequency control loop" and "a phase control loop" since the circuit is not restricted to being 'locked" to a single frequency or phase.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The output phase is detected or measured and compared to the input or desired phase. The difference signal between these two phase signals is determined and used to systematically adjust the gain of each of the paths until the detected or measured output signal phase matches the input signal phase. The low frequency path is fixed and is used to maintain control of the center frequency of the output signal from the VCO.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In contrast to conventional dual path angle modulators that require a lapse time to perform a calibration procedure, the described angle modulator continuously calibrates each path while the system performs its primary operation. In other words, the angle modulator described in this application uses a calibration process running in the background during normal operations, thereby eliminating the need for a system shut down or calibration specific timing, such as a lapse time, to balance the modulation paths.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> In other systems that require a lapse time, a command is required to initiate the calibration procedure. Within the system as presently described, calibration is continuously performed as a background process. The presently described angle modulator is applicable to many, if not all, modulation type systems including, but not limited to, the GSM system described in background above, a wireless LAN, a radar, a phased-array, any CDMA-based system, and any TDMA-based system.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In one aspect, a modulating circuit includes a phase control loop and a modulating loop.

However, tuning the sensitivity in the VCO of the main control loop can lead to a variance, sometimes in a substantial manner. This can leave a mismatch of gains between the main control loop and the auxiliary modulation loop. Sometimes the gain in the auxiliary modulation loop is too high, sometimes too low. The dual path angle modulator provides a means for automatically sensing when the gain is too low and increasing it, or when the gain is too high and decreasing it.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">One concept applied to this system is that when the gain normalization is exactly correct in the dual-path angle modulator, then the output signal is exactly the desired input signal. A feedback signal M is a digital representation of the analog output signal from the VCO. A directly synthesized signal S is a digital representation of the desired input signal. An error signal Δ is determined as the difference between the signal S and the signal M. When the output signal of the dual path angle modulator is exactly the desired input,signal, the error signal Δ is zero. Even though circuit artifacts such as phase noise keep this from being true at all times, over the long term, the error signal Δ continuously converges towards zero. The gain scaling factor MS is applied to the high frequency path. A second feed-forward scaling factor FS is fixed and determined by the operational requirements of the output circuit.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">If there is a non-zero value for the long term average of the error signal A, then there is an error in the high frequency path gain MS. Further, the direction and magnitude of this gain error is discernable from the long term average of the error signal Δ. Thus, correction of this gain error is achieved to an arbitrary accuracy using a feedback loop within the auxiliary modulation path. The input to this loop is the error signal Δ, and the output is the high frequency path gain parameter MS. A valuable aspect to the dual path angle modulator is that the originally input modulation waveform is unimportant. The automatic correction<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> operates in the presence of an arbitrary modulation waveform, which allows it to operate during normal system operation. There is no need for external calibration modes, nor for breaks in normal operation to perform or update the calibration information. This system makes this gain normalization transparent to the user.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> illustrates a generalized block diagram of the dual path angle or phase modulator. The dual path angle modulator 50 includes a primary control loop and a secondary, or auxiliary, modulation loop. The primary loop includes a phase locked loop with a VCO 60 that generates an analog output signal. The analog output signal is provided as feedback to a difference logic circuit 54. The difference logic circuit 54 outputs the error signal Δ. The secondary loop includes a modulation gain normalizing block 64 that automatically and continuously determines the gain parameter MS based on the error signal Δ. The mean of the error signals Δ are zero. In other words, if the analog output signal from the VCO 60 is exactly the same as the desired input signal, then the error signal Δ is zero. The gain parameter MS is the high frequency gain parameter used to match the gain between the primary control loop and the secondary modulation loop. One function of the dual path angle modulator 50 is to measure an error between an output signal and a desired signal, and to make an adjustment based on the measured error.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> illustrates a block diagram of a first embodiment of the dual path angle modulator 100 of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> application. The dual path angle modulator 100 of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> is similar to the dual path angle modulator 10 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> with the addition of the auxiliary modulation loop that includes a gate 144 and a processing circuit 150 to provide a feedback loop within the auxiliary modulation path. In this first embodiment, the modulation gain normalization block 64 of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> comprises the gate 144 and the processing circuit 150. The dual path angle modulator 100 is an embodiment of the apparatus for performing the measurement and adjustment functions described above in relation to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>. In this embodiment, the processing circuit 150 is an accumulator. The error signal Δ includes a sign and some measure of magnitude over time. The gate 144 can take various embodiments that take advantage of different combinations and usages of the signs and magnitudes. For example, an XOR gate utilizes both sign and magnitude, and converges very quickly. An AND gate only looks at one sign, such as only processing positively signed values while ignoring negatively signed values. The AND gate converges less quickly than the XOR gate. A THROUGH option ignores sign and only uses the magnitude. The output of the gate is a modified error signal Δ'.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The accumulator 150 accumulates the modified error signals Δ'. The numbers (error signals Δ') going to the accumulator 150 are negative when the gain is too low. If the gain is too high, then the numbers are positive, which indicates that there is too much gain in the forward path. The modulation is a zero-mean<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> process because the accumulator 150 accumulates errors both positive and negative, so there is guaranteed convergence to an accumulated value within the accumulator 150. This accumulated value is the gain parameter MS. As the accumulator 150 converges towards the gain parameter MS, the error signal Δ heads towards zero. When the error signal Δ is zero, the value in the accumulator 150 corresponds to the optimal gain parameter MS. Only when the error signal Δ equals zero does the accumulator 150 stop. Design options can be utilized to define how fast or slow the system converges. As an example, if it is determined that the measuring process has more noise, then the system may be set to converge more slowly.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, the frequency constant block 114 represents a carrier signal. A modulation is generated by the phase modulation generator 112, which is added to the carrier signal, via the summing circuit 116, to generate a desired input signal. The digital synthesizer 118 converts the desired input signal to a numeric stream, the desired input signal S. The K1 block 120 and the K2/s block 122 act as digital filters. The signal coming out of the K1 block 120 is the frequency error and the signal coming out of the K2/s block 122 is the phase error. The error signal Δ is also directed to the gate 144, which provides the modified error signal Δ' to the accumulator 150. The FS multiplier 140 and the Sigma Delta DAC 126 function similarly as in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. The configuration of the resistors and the capacitors are exemplary,<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> and can take other embodiments. The dual path angle modulator 100 of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> modifies the structure of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> in such a way that the gain parameter MS is automatically determined without need for an external process and on an on-going basis. The MS multiplier 138 receives the gain parameter MS from the accumulator 150 to scale the modulation in the forward path of the auxiliary modulation loop. The gain parameter MS also influences the gain in the main control loop, as the scaled modulation signal output from the MS multiplier 138 is used as an input to the FS multiplier 140.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The analog output signal from the VCO 128 is provided as feedback and converted to the digital signal M by the analog to digital converter 134. The analog to digital converter 134 can be a Sigma Delta frequency to digital converter. Both signal S and signal M has full bandwidth information, including the modulation. The K1 digital filter 120 and the K2/s digital filter 122 in the main control loop function as a low pass filter. The main control loop processes the narrow band center frequency, but the information related to high bandwidth errors are present in the error signal Δ. This error information is processed within the gate 144 and the accumulator 150 to determine the gain parameter MS.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">As expected, if the gain parameter MS is low, then the high frequency gain is also low. Similarly, if the gain parameter MS is too high, then the high frequency gain is also high. Of<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> importance here is the observation that the error in the frequency response flattens as directly related to the error in the value of the gain parameter MS.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">As an example, if the gain parameter MS is too low, then the signal M does not equal the desired signal S. As a result, the high frequency modulation components of the signal M do not subtract completely the high frequency modulation components from the signal S, and so an error signal Δ results. Since there is not enough high frequency components on this error signal Δ, the value stored within the accumulator 150 ramps up, making the gain parameter MS larger. The increased gain parameter MS is applied to the forward path of the auxiliary modulation loop, which acts to increase the normalized modulator gain up toward the normalized condition. Likewise, if the gain parameter MS is increased too high, then too much high frequency modulation is coming in on the signal M. In this case, the error signal Δ reflects that the gain is too high and the value in the accumulator 150 ramps down, making gain parameter MS smaller. Note that, a difference between the feedback signal M, which is a digital representation of the analog output signal from the VCO 128, and the signal S, which is a digital representation of the desired input signal, is represented as the error signal Δ. Accordingly, until the output signal from the dual path angle modulator and the desired input signal coincide with each other in the calibration procedure, the value of the error signal Δ is presumed to alternately take positive and negative<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> values and to eventually converge to zero. For this reason, particular attention should be given during the process of generating the gain parameter MS based on the error signal Δ.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, the gate 144 operates on the error signal Δ. Variations in the implementation of the gate 144 yields different performance for the dual path angle modulator 100. Some options already identified are described in greater detail below. If the gate 144 is an exclusive-OR (XOR) gate, then the signed error signal A is sampled with normalized modulation using all samples of the error signal.

Alternatively, the AND gate outputs all negatively signed error signal Δ values, and all positively signed error signal A values are ignored.

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>, the symbol k defines the number of higher significant bits. By controlling the value of k, the rate at which the accumulator 150 converges is controlled. Increasing k is accomplished by setting the value of the more higher significant bits to zero. This acts to slow down the convergence of the accumulator 150. In other words, the speed of the accumulator 150 is controlled by increasing the number of higher significant bits set to zero, which slows down the accumulator 150, or by reducing the number of higher significant bits set to<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> zero, which speeds up the accumulator 150.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The accumulator 150 can perform some filtering by only taking the top L most significant bits as the gain parameter MS.

This is true even if the signal to noise ratio of the feedback signal M is poor. Noisy inputs result in a slight wandering of the desired gain parameter MS, causing distortion in the desired modulation and degradingsignal quality measurements such as EVM. Accordingly, the automatic calibration loop could be designed to both sense that convergence is occurring, and also to narrow its loop bandwidth when converged. Narrowing the loop bandwidth is achieved by slowing down the correction variation rate within the accumulator 150.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">There are a wide variety of methods by which the loop bandwidth can be narrowed to slow down its correction variation rate. One is to increase the value of k in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>, making the scale factor a a variable. Another is to only operate on every K<sup>th</sup> sample of Δ (decimating Δ by K). A third is to filter D using<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> either FIR (finite input response) or I IR (infinite input response) methods described below, or to change the parameters of such filters if they are already being used such that the resulting filter bandwidth is narrower than before.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The detection of loop convergence about the proper value of the gain parameter MS is detected by an expanded accumulator 250 such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>. The expanded accumulator 250 of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref> can automatically adjust the value of k by detecting small changes between successive values of the gain parameter MS. An alternative method would be to detect inputs to the accumulator near zero, but this latter method does not enjoy the averaging effects of the accumulator. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>, the ACC<sub>N</sub> block 150 represents the accumulator of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>. The expanded accumulator 250 takes the difference between successive outputs of the accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub> 150. The modified error signal Δ' enters a manipulation block 152 under the control of the k select block 160 such that the number of higher significant bits set to zero equals k, as determined by the k select block 160. In this manner, the accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub> 150 receives a bit stream in which the k most significant bits are set to zero and the remaining lower significant bits are the modified error signal Δ'. The bit stream entering the ACC<sub>N</sub> 150 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref> as the zeros on top to represent zeros as more significant bits.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The function of the expanded accumulator 250 is to evaluate outputs of the accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub> 150, which is the gain<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> parameter MS, and determine when the values are converging. In other words, taking the differences of sequential values MS<sub>j-1</sub> and MS<sub>j</sub> coming out of the accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub> 150 and as the difference, MS<sub>j-1</sub> - MS<sub>j</sub>, goes to zero, this provides implied information that the input, error signal Δ, has gone to zero. Averaging can also be used such that the difference between each successive output MS is not evaluated, but instead some period of measurement, for example every 16<sup>th</sup> MS, is evaluated.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Each block R represents a clocked register. Each sequential value of MS is output from the accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub> 150 and stored in a register R 154 such that during a subsequent cycle, the current value, MS<sub>j</sub>, output from the accumulator 150 is compared to the previously stored value, MS<sub>j-1</sub>. The difference between these two values, MS<sub>j-1</sub> and MS<sub>j</sub>, is determined by,logic circuit 156 and stored in a shift register 158, represented as the series of R blocks in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>. The k select block 160 evaluates the difference to determine if the value of k is to be adjusted. The closer the values of MS<sub>j-1</sub> and MS<sub>j</sub>, the closer the accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub> 150 is to convergence. Based on design parameters included within the k select block 160, if the determined difference is within a predetermined range, then the accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub> 150 is slowed down. The accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub> 150 is slowed by increasing the value of k, which coincides with more higher significant bits (k) being set to zero. In this manner, the expanded accumulator 250, shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref> acts as a throttle mechanism for the accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub><!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> 150. When the accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub> 150 has sufficiently converged on a value MS, the speed by which the accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub> 150 subsequently converges is slowed by adding more higher order zeros (increase the value of k). This mechanism can also be used to speed up the accumulator 150 by decreasing the value k.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Occasion for slowing the accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub> 150 might occur when the determined difference is essentially noise. In operation, the impact of noise forces the value of MS to wander. The auxiliary modulation loop, including the accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub> 150 is continuously attempting to converge on a fixed value for the gain parameter MS, while noise in the system acts to disrupt this convergence. It is observed that the noise contributes in small increments to the disruption of the convergence whereas if the error signal Δ is still significantly large, then convergence towards the gain parameter MS occurs in fairly large steps for a given time period. When the error signal A becomes insignificantly small, the input to the accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub> 150 is also becoming very small, and the accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub> 150 is no longer taking large steps towards convergence. When such a condition occurs, the accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub> 150 is responding primarily to noise, and there is no need for the accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub> 150 to respond as quickly. Therefore, the accumulator ACC<sub>N</sub> 150 is made less responsive by increasing the value of k, as described above. This acts to smooth out the impact of the noise.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048"><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref> illustrates a block diagram of another dual<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> path angle modulator.

The function g(Δ)<sub>j</sub> is a general transfer function dependent upon the specific LMS adaptive algorithm.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In operation, the dual path angle modulator of the present application includes amain control loop that is configured as a primary path to process the low frequency portion of the phase modulation signal, and an auxiliary modulation loop is configured as secondary path to process the high frequency portions of the phase modulation signal. The auxiliary modulation loop receives an error signal Δ that represents the difference between an output signal of the main control loop and a desired input modulation<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> signal. The error signal Δ is manipulated and/or filtered before being input to an accumulator as a modified error signal Δ'. The accumulator accumulates the values of the modified error signals Δ'. The value of the accumulator is used as a gain parameter MS, which is used to normalize the gain within both the main control loop and the auxiliary modulation loop. The error signals Δ are continuously determined and used to update the gain parameter MS within the accumulator. In this manner, the dual path angle modulator continuously calibrates both paths as a background process.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The first and second embodiments of the dual path angle modulator indicate that the error signal Δ can be manipulated and filtered using any type of gate, as in the first embodiment, or using a qualifier and FIR filter, as in the second embodiment. It is understood that the dual path angle modulator can manipulate and/or filter the error signal Δ using any other appropriate conventional type of circuitry.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">It is understood that although the angle or phase modulator is described above as a dual path modulator, the angle of phase modulator can be implemented to include more than two paths. In general, the angle of phase modulator is a multi-path angle or phase modulator. The present application has been described in terms of specific embodiments incorporating details to facilitate the understanding of the principles of construction and operation of the multiple path angle modulator. Many of the<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> components shown and described in the various figures can be interchanged to achieve the results necessary, and this description should be read to encompass such interchange as well. As such, references herein to specific embodiments and details thereof are not intended to limit the scope of the claims appended hereto.
