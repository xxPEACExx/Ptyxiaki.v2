Related Art</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">As society becomes more mobile and therefore spends a greater amount of time traveling and away from home, demand rises for electronic appliances and devices outside the home environment. For example, media units including video screens have been mounted in the headrests of vehicles, facilitating video entertainment on the road. These media units may play video and audio from different media sources located in different portions of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">When selling a vehicle, new and used vehicle dealerships may give consumers the option of installing a vehicle seat entertainment system. In such a situation, the dealerships may want to show an example of an installed entertainment system to a prospective purchaser.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Therefore, a need exists for a vehicle seat entertainment system that can be easily mounted to or removed from a seat and a process for displaying vehicle seat entertainment systems that allows for easy installation or removal of an entertainment system depending on whether a purchaser chooses the entertainment system as an option in the vehicle.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">A media system for a vehicle having a seat, in accordance with the present invention, comprises a housing mounted to the seat, and a media unit capable of being coupled to the housing, wherein the housing includes a receiving portion that pivots with respect to the housing and receives the media unit therein.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The receiving portion comprises a first side portion and second side portion, wherein the first and second side portions include first and second extensions for engaging respective grooves on a first side surface and a second side surface of the media unit.

invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">An entertainment system 100 includes a housing 110 mounted in a headrest 10 of a seat of a vehicle, such as an automobile, minivan or sport utility vehicle (SUV) to provide media, such as video and audio to rear seat passengers. Alternatively, the entertainment system and housing may be mounted in a body of seat. The entertainment system 100 further includes a media unit 120 that can be easily coupled to and removed from the housing 110. The media unit 120 may be operational when coupled to or removed from the housing.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">1B</figref>, a headrest 10 includes an entertainment system 100 mounted therein. The entertainment system 100 includes a housing 110 and a media unit 120, which is easily coupled to and removed from the housing 110. The media unit 120 includes a display 130 having a screen for displaying video. The screen is preferably an LCD type display, but may be another type of display, such as, for example, an organic LED, a plasma display or electro-luminescent display.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In one embodiment, an LCD simultaneously displays different content in right and left viewing directions by directionally controlling the viewing angle of the LCD. In other words, one passenger can see a program from a first media source from a right side of the display, while another can see a program from a second media source from the left side of the display. The simultaneous display of different content on the display (e.g., display 130), is accomplished by superimposing a parallax barrier on a thin film transistor (TFT) LCD to enable light from a backlight to separate into right and left directions.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Video is supplied from a media source, for example, a DVD player 140 provided behind<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the display 130 (<u>see</u> <figref idrefs="f0014">Fig. 4A</figref>). The media source may also be, for example, a CD-ROM player, a video game player, a videocassette player, a television tuner, a radio tuner, a wireless receiver, an MP3 player, a digital video recorder, a device for playing media supplied from a portable storage device (e.g., a portable hard drive, memory cards, flash memory sticks, key drives, thumb drives), and/or a device for playing media supplied from a portable audio or video player, such as, for example, an IPOD®.
