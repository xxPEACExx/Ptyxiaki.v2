Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to fluoropolymer compositions of polytetrafluoroethylene and other perfluoropolymers.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20040242783A1"><text>US 2004/0242783 A1</text></patcit> discloses a blend of tetrafluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene copolymer, commonly called FEP, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the PTFE imparting the improved extrusion property of reduced cone breaks during melt draw down extrusion coating of wire. The PTFE content of the blend is disclosed to be 0.03 to 2 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the copolymer. When the amount of PTFE is more than 2 parts by weight, two disadvantageous results are disclosed: the melt viscosity of the blend increases significantly and the molded article tends to become brittle [0027]. These are the same effects as adding filler to a polymer, except that in the case of adding PTFE to FEP, the disadvantageous effects arise with even small additions of the PTFE to the FEP.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">The present invention includes the discovery of melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer compositions containing PTFE in much greater amounts than 2 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the perfluoropolymer that have desirable viscosities for melt fabrication and that do not become brittle. According to one embodiment, the present invention is a melt-mixed composition comprising a dispersion of submicrometer-size particles comprising non-melt flowable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in a continuous phase comprising melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer, said PTFE constituting at least 4 wt% of the combined weight of said PTFE and said melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer, said composition exhibiting thixotropy when being subjected to increasing shear in the molten state. Thus, the compositions of the present invention exhibit reduced melt viscosity at increasing shear rate. Under shear conditions used in melt mixing involved in melt fabrication, the melt viscosity of the composition becomes low enough to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> enable the compositions to be melt-fabricated, notwithstanding that the PTFE is non melt flowable, i.e. the PTFE has such a high viscosity in the molten state that it does not flow and therefore is not melt-processible. Preferably this thixotropy is characterized by a reduction in melt viscosity upon increasing the shear rate applied to the molten dispersion from 10 s<sup>-1</sup> to 100 s<sup>-1</sup> that is at least 10% greater, preferably at least 100% greater, than the reduction in melt viscosity at the same shear rates for the melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer by itself, as determined by the capillary rheometer method described later herein. The thixotropy imparted to the perfluoropolymer by non-melt flowable PTFE is a surprising result and exists for high contents for the PTFE, e.g. up to 65 wt% thereof and even up to 75 wt% thereof, based on the combined weight of the PTFE and the melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer component of the composition of the present invention imparts melt-fabricability to the composition. Thus, the composition is melt-fabricable by such processes as extrusion and injection molding to form strong, tough products. Some indicia of this strength and toughness are the tensile and flexural properties of the composition disclosed herein.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The fact that the composition of the present invention is not brittle is evident from the fact that it exhibits a high elongation at break. Preferably, its elongation at break is at least 200%, more preferably at least 250%, at up to at least 30 wt% PTFE in the composition, based on the combined weight of the PTFE and perfluoropolymer. Most preferably, the composition exhibits an elongation at break that is at least as high as that of the melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer by itself, indicating that the presence of the PTFE is not making the composition brittle. This effect extends well above the 4 wt% PTFE content of the composition, preferably at least to up to 15 wt% PTFE, based on the combined weight of the PTFE and melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer. The composition of the present invention also exhibits properties indicating that the PTFE in the composition is reinforcing the composition, rather than acting as a filler. For example, both the tensile strength and elongation at<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> break can be greater than for the melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer by itself. Another indicia of the composition of the present invention not being brittle arises from its exhibiting an MIT Flex Life of at least 500 cycles, preferably at least 1000 cycles, i.e. film made from the composition by the MIT Flex Life test procedure is flexed over upon itself repeatedly without breaking. Preferably the MIT flex life of the composition is at least as great as for the perfluoropolymer by itself. The melt-mixed composition of this embodiment of the present invention can be considered as a melt blend of the PTFE and perfluoropolymer components.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The continuous phase being the melt flowable perfluoropolymer is confirmed by the melt fabricability of the melt mixed composition. Articles molded from the composition are transparent to translucent, rather than opaque as are articles molded from PTFE.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Both the non-brittle and thixotropic attributes described above are believed to arise from this novel dispersion/continuous phase structure, wherein the PTFE is present in such small particle size within the perfluoropolymer continuous phase. This novel structure exists at compositions containing less than 4 wt% PTFE although this is a minimum amount. For example, the dispersion structure can exist for amounts of PTFE greater than 50 wt%, e.g. up to 65 wt% PTFE and even up to 75 wt%, based on the combined weight of the PTFE and perfluoropolymer, because of the small size of the PTFE particle. All of the thixotropy, elongation at break, tensile strength, and MIT Flex Life parameters applied to the first mentioned embodiment of the present invention also apply to this embodiment.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The melt-mixed nature of the compositions of the present invention means that it has been preferably heated to the state at which both the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> PTFE and the perfluoropolymer are molten and then the molten mass is subjected to mixing of the two polymers together, such as may occur in the typical melt fabrication processes of extrusion or injection molding. In the,case of extrusion, the extruded, melt-mixed product can be molding pellets for further melt fabrication into final product or final product. Thus, the compositions of the present invention can be in any form such as the molding pellet or final product form formed by melt fabrication process.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is surprising that compositions of the present invention can contain much more PTFE than 2/100 parts by weight and exhibit the properties described above, denoting melt-fabricability and absence of brittleness. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20040242783A1"><text>US 2004/0242783 A1</text></patcit> discloses the uses of a multi-screw kneader in an attempt to homogeneously disperse the small amount of PTFE in the FEP [0029] and the use of pre-mixing to improve the degree of dispersion of the PTFE [0042], indicating that the dispersion achieved by the multi-screw kneader by itself is deficient. In Example 1 of 783, powders of the PTFE and copolymer are mixed together, followed by kneading in a twin-screw extruder to produce molding pellets, which are then melt-draw down extruded, using a single screw extruder, as a coating onto wire. The PTFE powder used in the premixing has an average particle size of 450 micrometers. The particle size of the FEP is not disclosed in Example 1, but the aqueous emulsion polymerization to obtain this copolymer is disclosed. This copolymer is recovered from emulsion polymerization by coagulation, which provides a dry powder particles that agglomerates of the FEP particles of the emulsion. The FEP particles of the emulsion are the primary particles, which are submicrometer-size in average particle size so as to be in the emulsion state. The agglomerates of the primary particles are the secondary particles, which are typically hundreds of time larger in diameter than the primary particles. The 450 micrometer PTFE fine powder particles used in the Example are secondary particles. Thus, in Example 1, secondary particles of the FEP and of the PTFE are pre-mixed before kneading in a twin screw extruder.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The novel structure of the melt-mixed compositions of the present invention, wherein the PTFE is dispersed in a continuous phase of the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer, is obtained by carrying out the melt mixing on a mixture of submicrometer-size particles of the PTFE and of the melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer. Thus, these polymers are present as a mixture of primary particles, rather than secondary particles. This mixture can be achieved by providing the PTFE primary particle inside the perfluoropolymer particle, i.e. in the form of a core/shell polymer. Alternatively, each of the polymers can be provided in the form of aqueous dispersions, e.g. from the aqueous dispersion polymerization process for making each of them, followed by mixing these dispersions together to form the mixture of primary particles of each polymer. Core/shell polymer is preferred, because of the greater intimacy of the two polymers and the ability of the molten perfluoropolymer to integrate the particles together without needing to overcome the incompatibility between the melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer and the PTFE. Thus, the melt mixing converts the mixture of primary particles that already exists into the composition of the present invention, whether considered as a melt blend or as a dispersion as described above.</p><heading id="h0005"><b><u>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">The PTFE and melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer components of the melt-mixed compositions of the present invention will be described individually hereinafter, sometimes with reference to their being supplied to the melt-mixed composition as a core/shell polymer. This description of polymer components, however, also applies to the supply of these polymers to the melt-mixed composition from separate sources, e.g. from the combination of core/shell polymer (PTFE core/perfluoropolymer shell) and separately supplied perfluoropolymer or from separately supplied PTFE and perfluoropolymer.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">With respect to the PTFE component, the non-melt flowability of the PTFE can also be characterized by high melt creep viscosity, sometimes called specific melt viscosity, which involves the measurement of the rate of elongation of a molten sliver of PTFE under a known tensile stress for 30 min., as further described in and determined in accordance with <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6841594B"><text>U.S. Patent 6,841,594</text></patcit>, referring to the specific melt viscosity measurement procedure of <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US3819594A"><text>U.S. Patent 3,819,594</text></patcit>. In this test, the molten sliver made in<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> accordance with the test procedure is maintained under load for 30 min, before the measurement of melt creep viscosity is begun, and this measurement is then made during the next 30 minutes of applied load. The PTFE preferably has a melt creep viscosity of at least 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> Pa·s, more preferably at least 1 x 10<sup>7</sup> Pa•s, and most preferably at least 1 x 10<sup>8</sup> Pa•s, all at 380°C. This temperature is well above the first and second melt temperatures of PTFE of 343°C and 327°C, respectively. The difference between non-melt flowability of the PTFE core and the melt flowability of the melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer shell is apparent from the melt flow rate (MFR) test procedure of ASTM D 1238-94a. In this procedure, the MFR is determined by the rate in g/10 min that perfluoropolymer that flows through a defined orifice under a specified load at a specified temperature, usually 372°C. The PTFE used in the present invention has no melt flow (zero MFR). The high melt creep viscosity of the PTFE present in the core of the core/shell polymer also means that the PTFE is sinterable, i.e. a molded article, unsupported by the mold (free-standing), of the PTFE can be heated above the melting point of the PTFE to coalesce the PTFE particles without the molded article flowing to lose its shape. The PTFE used in the present invention is also often characterized by standard specific gravity (SSG), which is the ratio of weight in air of a PTFE specimen prepared in a specified manner to an equal volume of water at 23°C as further described in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US4036802A"><text>U.S. Patent 4,036,802</text></patcit> and ASTM D 4894-94. The lower the SSG, the higher the molecular weight of the PTFE. The specimen preparation procedure as disclosed in ASTM D-4894-94 includes compression molding the test specimen, removing the compression molded test specimen from the mold, and sintering the specimen in air, i.e. free standing, at 380°C. The non-melt flowability of the PTFE enables this sintering to be carried out without the test specimen losing its compression molded shape and dimensions.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The PTFE can be the granular type or the fine powder type, made by suspension or aqueous dispersion polymerization, respectively. The PTFE can be homopolymer of tetrafluoroethylene or a copolymer thereof<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> with a small amount of comonomer, such as hexafluoropropylene or perfluoro(alkyl vinyl ether), preferably wherein the alkyl group contains 1 to 5 carbon atoms, that improves the sinterability of the TFE, to obtain such improvement as reduced permeability and greater flex life, as compared to the TFE homopolymer. This type of PTFE is sometimes referred to as modified PTFE. Examples of modified PTFE are disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US3142665A"><text>U.S. Patents 3,142,665</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US3819594A"><text>3,819,594</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US6870020B"><text>6,870,020</text></patcit>. For simplicity and because the modified PTFE exhibits the same non-melt flow, high melt creep viscosity of PTFE homopolymer, this type of PTFE is included in the term polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE used herein.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The non-melt flowable PTFE used in the present invention is to be distinguished from low molecular weight PTFE, which because of its low molecular weight has melt flowability but not melt-fabricability. This melt flowable PTFE, which has an MFR that is measurable by ASTM D 1238-94a, is obtained by direct polymerization under conditions that prevent very long, polymer chains from forming, or by irradiation degradation of non-melt flowable PTFE. Such melt flowable PTFE is commonly called PTFE micropowder. It is not considered as being melt fabricable because the article molded from the melt is useless, by virtue of extreme brittleness. Because of its low molecular weight (relative to non-melt-flowable PTFE), it has no strength. An extruded filament of the PTFE micropowder is so brittle that it breaks upon flexing.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">With respect to the melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer component of the melt-mixed composition on the present invention, as indicated by the prefix "per" in perfluoropolymer, the monovalent atoms bonded to the carbon atoms making up the polymer are all fluorine atoms. Other atoms may be present in the polymer end groups, i.e, the groups that terminate the polymer chain. The perfluoropolymer is a perfluoroplastic, not a perfluoroelastomer.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">If the non-melt flowable PTFE and melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer is supplied to the melt-mixed composition of the present invention as core/shell polymer, the PTFE forms the core and the perfluoropolymer forms the shell.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The melt flow rate (MFR) of the perfluoropolymers used in the present invention can vary widely, depending on the proportion of PTFE, the melt-fabrication technique desired for the core/shell polymer or melt-mixed composition, as the case may be, and the properties desired in the melt-fabricated article. Thus, MFRs for the melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer can be in the range of 0.1 to 500 g/10 min, but will usually be preferred as 0.5 to 100 g/10 min, and more preferably 0.5 to 50 g/10 min., as measured according to ASTM D-1238-94a and following the detailed conditions disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US4952630A"><text>U.S. Patent 4,952,630</text></patcit>, at the temperature which is standard for the resin (see for example ASTM D 2116-91a and ASTM D 3307-93 that are applicable to the most common melt-fabricable perfluoropolymers, both specifying 372°C as the resin melt temperature in the Plastometer®). The amount of polymer extruded from the Plastometer® in a measured amount of time is reported in units of g/10 min in accordance with Table 2 of ASTM D 1238-94a. If the perfluoropolymer is present as the shell of core/shell polymer, the MFR of the perfluoropolymer in the shell is determined by carrying out the polymerization of the perfluoromonomers used to form the perfluoropolymer by themselves, i.e. no core, using the same recipe and polymerization conditions used to form the shell, to obtain perfluoropolymer that can be used in the MFR determination. The higher the MFR of the perfluoropolymer, the greater is the tendency to generate smoke when the polymer is subjected to the NFPA-255 bum test, thus failing such test. The shell can have high MFR, e.g. greater than 20 g/10 min without the article melt-fabricated from the core/shell polymer or separately-supplied PTFE and perfluoropolymer components failing the NFPA-255 burn test, because in the presence of the PTFE, the article molded from the melt-mixed composition, notably as dispersed submicrometer-size particles in a perfluoropolymer continuous phase does not flow, and thus, does not drip to cause smoke generation.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Even when the core/shell polymer exhibits an MFR of 0 g/10 min, i.e. there is no flow of the polymer when measured by ASTM D 1238-94a at the temperature that is standard for the melt-fabricable<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> perfluoropolymer, the core/shell polymer can still be melt-fabricable.

The determination of melt viscosities disclosed herein, unless otherwise indicated, is by dividing shear stress applied to the polymer melt by shear rate applied to the polymer melt as disclosed on p. 31 of <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="b"><text>F.N.

As a practical matter, the equivalent melt viscosities are obtained simply by readout from the computer accompanying the rheometer used to determine shear rate and shear stress. The melt viscosity of the melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer by itself is such that the above mentioned melt viscosities for the polymer mixture are obtained. The melt viscosity of the perfluoropolymer component by itself can also be characterized by the above mentioned melt viscosities.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Examples of melt-fabricable perfluoropolymers that can be used in the shell of the polymer of the core/shell polymer or as separately supplied polymer include the copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) with one or more polymerizable perfluorinated comonomers, such as perfluoroolefin having 3 to 8 carbon atoms, such as hexafluoropropylene (HFP), and/or perfluoro(alkyl vinyl ether) (PAVE) in which the linear or branched alkyl group contains 1 to 5 carbon atoms. Preferred PAVE monomers include perfluoro(methyl vinyl ether) (PMVE), perfluoro(ethyl vinyl ether) (PEVE), perfluoro(propyl vinyl ether) (PPVE), and perfluoro(butyl vinyl ether)<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> (PBVE). The copolymer can be made using several PAVE monomers, such as the TFE/perfluoro(methyl vinyl ether)/perfluoro(propyl vinyl ether) copolymer, sometimes called MFA by the manufacturer. The preferred perfluoropolymers are TFE/HFP copolymer in which the HFP content is 5-17 wt%, more preferably TFE/HFP/PAVE such as PEVE or PPVE, wherein the HFP content is 5-17 wt% and the PAVE content, preferably PEVE, is 0.2 to 4 wt%, the balance being TFE, to total 100 wt% for the copolymer. The TFE/HFP copolymers, whether or not a third comonomer is present, are commonly known as FEP. TFE/PAVE copolymers, generally known as PFA, have at least 2 wt% PAVE, including when the PAVE is PPVE or PEVE, and will typically contain 2-15 wt% PAVE. When PAVE includes PMVE, the composition is 0.5-13 wt% perfluoro(methyl vinyl ether) and 0.5 to 3 wt% PPVE, the remainder to total 100 wt% being TFE, and as stated above, may be referred to as MFA. The low melt viscosity of these copolymers relative to the high melt creep viscosity of the PTFE, provides the melt flowability to the perfluoropolymer for its melt fabricability, and the perfluoropolymer composition itself provides the strength required for the practical utility of the article melt fabricated from the perfluoropolymer. The melt flow difference between the melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer being characterizable by melt viscosity and MFR and the non-melt flowable PTFE being characterizable by melt creep viscosity and SSG is great.. The melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer cannot be characterized by either-melt creep-viscosity or by SSG. In the melt creep viscosity test, the sliver of molten perfluoropolymer melts, flows, and breaks during the 30 minutes initial heating under load at 380°C, so there is no sliver remaining for the melt creep determination during the second 30 minutes of heating. In the SSG test, the specimen (polymer) melts and flows during the 380°C heating (sintering for non-melt flowable PTFE), undermining the integrity of the specimen for the SSG determination. Of course, the non-melt flowability of the PTFE used in the present invention, enables the melt creep viscosity and SSG determinations to be made on such PTFE.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The perfluoropolymer comonomer content of core/shell polymer and of the melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer by itself is determined by infrared analysis on compression molded film made from the core/shell polymer particles in accordance with the procedures disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="US4380618A"><text>U.S. Patent 4,380,618</text></patcit> for the particular fluoromonomers (HFP and PPVE) disclosed therein.

The perfluoropolymer shell composition is made to have a composition that is predictable from copolymerization to make the perfluoropolymer by itself. The perfluoropolymer composition of the core/shell polymer used in the present invention, however, is determined on the entire core/shell polymer. The composition of the shell is calculated by subtracting the weight of the TFE consumed to make the PTFE core. The perfluoromonomer content other than TFE of the core/shell polymer is preferably at least 1.5 wt% based on the total weight of the TFE and perfluoromonomer in the core/shell polymer, but concentrated in the shell. The perfluoropolymer content of the melt-mixed composition when the perfluoropolymer is separately supplied to the composition, i.e. not as core/shell polymer, is the weight % of the perfluoropolymer component used to form the melt mixed composition, based on the combined weights of the PTFE and perfluoropolymer components used to form the composition.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The combination of the non-melt flowable PTFE core and melt fabricable perfluoropolymer shell of the polymer results in a core/shell polymer that is also melt fabricable. Although the presence of the non-melt flowable PTFE core may lower the MFR of the overall polymer as compared to the MFR of the perfluoropolymer shell, and may even render the MFR not measurable by ASTM D 1238-94a, the thixotropy exhibited by the polymer when subjected to sufficient shear in the molten state enables the resultant melt blend to be melt fabricated. This effect extends over the entire range of core/shell compositions. At least about 0.1 wt% PTFE core is required before the thixotropic effect is appreciable. The maximum amount of PTFE core is preferably up to that amount that<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> enables the core to be the dispersed phase when the core/shell polymer is melt-mixed, such as occurs in extrusion or injection molding. The thixotropic phenomenon observed for the core/shell polymer also exists for the melt-mixed composition wherein the PTFE and perfluoropolymer components are separately supplied as submicrometer-size particles, except that the thixotropy obtained from the core/shell polymer is greater than for the melt-mixed composition derived from the separately supplied polymers. In either case, the preferred reduction in viscosity is at least 100%, and more preferably at least 500% greater than the viscosity reduction for the perfluoropolymer by itself when the shear rate is increased from 10 s<sup>-1</sup> to 100 s<sup>-1</sup>. These shear rates are expressed in terms of "about", because of limitations in the operation of the rheometer used to measure them. The rheometer includes a variable speed piston that provides the volumetric flow rate (Q) of molten polymer through the rheometer orifice and various orifice sizes, the selection of which provides the radius r in the equation: shear rate (y) = 4Q/πr<sup>3</sup>. With particular rheometers it may be difficult to adjust the piston speed and orifice size such that the exact shear rates of 10 s<sup>-1</sup> and 100 s<sup>-1</sup> are obtained. The shear rates used in the Examples were 11.9 s<sup>-1</sup> and 101 s<sup>-1</sup>. Typically, the rheometer can be operated so that the shear rates are 10 s<sup>-1</sup> ± 3 s<sup>-1</sup> and 100 s<sup>-1</sup> ± 5 s<sup>-1</sup>. In absolute terms, the preferred reduction in melt viscosity by the core/shell polymer of the present invention is at least 200 Pa·s, more preferably at least 400 Pa·s at the shear rates specified above.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The advantage of thixotropy discovered by the present invention extends to higher shear rates than 100 s<sup>-1</sup> enabling the melt-mixed composition of the present invention to be extruded at a faster rate by melt-draw down extrusion than the melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer by itself. Alternatively, the melt cone formed in melt-draw-down extrusion can have a lower draw-down ratio (DDR) than the usual DDR of 80 to 100:1, to improve concentricity of the wall thickness of the extrudate, applied for example as jacketing on FEP insulated communications cable, especially such cable used in plenums of buildings. DDR is the ratio of the cross-sectional<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> area of the annular die opening to the cross-sectional area of the final shape and size of the extrudate, e.g. the plenum cable jacket just described.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Within the above composition range, various improvements in physical properties exist. Preferably, the non-melt flowable polytetrafluoroethylene content is 4 to 50 wt% based on the combined weight of the non-melt flowable polytetrafluoroethylene and melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer. As the PTFE wt% increases from 2 wt% based on the combined weight of the PTFE and perfluoropolymer components of the composition, the elongation and/or tensile strength increase, indicating reinforcement of the perfluoropolymer continuous phase by the dispersed core particles. This reinforcement extends to much greater amounts of PTFE, e.g. up to 20 wt% PTFE, more preferably up to 30 wt% PTFE, and most preferably up to 40 wt% PTFE, 4 wt% PTFE core being the mininimum, all percents being based on the combined weight of the PTFE and perfluoropolymer components. Alternatively, either the perfluoropolymer composition or its MFR can be adjusted to optimize melt flow either for high production rate melt fabrication or the production of intricately molded shapes, while still retaining adequate physical properties for the particular utility intended. For example, the elongation at break of the melt-mixed composition of the present invention is preferably at least 200% for compositions containing up to 30 wt% PTFE, preferably at least 40 wt%, based on the combined weight of the PTFE and perfluoropolymer components. The foregoing characterizations of the compositions apply to core/shell polymer when used to supply the polymer components to the composition, and to these components when separately supplied, notwithstanding the fact that core/shell polymer typically provides the best results in terms of reduction in melt viscosity with increasing shear and such physical properties as elongation at break and tensile strength.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The process of melt blending the core/shell polymer or separately supplied PTFE and perfluoropolymer components can also be described by the advantageous property results, e.g. the melt blend exhibiting thixotropy characterized by the at least 10%, at least 100%, or<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> at least 500% reductions in melt viscosity when the shear rate is increased from 10 s<sup>-1</sup> to 100 s<sup>-1</sup> by the capillary rheometer method. Alternatively or in combination with this thixotropy, the melt-mixed composition, whether from core/shell polymer or separately supplied polymers, preferably exhibits an elongation of at least 200% up to 30 wt% of the core/shell polymer being the PTFE, more preferably, at least 40 wt% of the composition being the PTFE. Example 50 discloses greater than 200% elongation for a composition containing 75 wt% PTFE.

Thus, the melt mixing temperature will typically be at least 350°C.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The core/shell polymer useful in the present invention can be prepared as a concentrate, i.e. of relatively high PTFE content for dilution with separately supplied melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer by itself. Separately supplied melt fabricable perfluoropolymer is perfluoropolymer that is not supplied by the core/shell polymer. Submicrometer-size PTFE particles can also be separately supplied. The resultant melt blend causes<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> the melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer from the shell of the core/shell polymer to melt mix with the separately supplied melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer to become indistinguishable as they form together the continuous phase for the dispersed particles of non-melt flowable polytetrafluoroethylene. Preferably the dilution of the core/shell polymer with additional (independently supplied) melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer involves the mixing together of aqueous dispersions of each polymer, followed by co-coagulation of the intermixed dispersion, resulting in an intimate mixing of the primary particles of the polymer from each dispersion with one another. This provides the best overall results for the viscosity of the melt blend in melt mixing accompanying melt fabrication and for the physical properties of articles molded from the blend. Co-coagulation of the mixed dispersions results in the formation of agglomerates, which contain both primary particles of core/shell polymer and separately supplied melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer. The particle sizes of these primary particles and agglomerates (fine powder when dried) are the same as disclosed above with respect to the core/shell polymer particles and agglomerates thereof by themselves. The independently supplied melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer should be compatible with the perfluoropolymer of the shell of the core/shell polymer. By compatible is meant that the melt-fabricable perfluoropolymers become indistinguishable in melt mixing and cooling in forming the continuous phase as described above. Preferably the monomers making up the melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer of the shell and the independently supplied perfluoropolymer are either the same or in the homologous series. The shell polymer and the independently supplied perfluoropolymer are considered to be the same even there may be small difference in concentration of the same perfluoromonomer and/or difference in MFR as occurs from small differences in the polymerization process producing the shell polymer as compared to producing the perfluoropolymer by itself. This provides the indistinguishability of the shell perfluoropolymer and independently supplied perfluoropolymer resulting from melt mixing to form the continuous phase of the blend. The most common melt-fabricable perfluoropolymers, FEP and PFA are incompatible with one<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> another, one indicia of which is that magnified frozen (that is non-molten) cross-sections of the cooled melt blend reveal domains of each perfluoropolymer being present when viewed under polarized light.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In this embodiment, in which the core/shell polymer is a concentrate, the core/shell polymer by itself can be melt-fabricable by itself.

Thus, an aqueous dispersion of the non-melt flowable PTFE and an aqueous dispersion of the melt-facricable perfluoropolymer will be obtained. In each dispersion, the polymer particles will be submicrometer-size. The core/shell polymer particle sizes and measurement thereof described above for the core/shell polymer applies to each of these aqueous dispersions. These dispersions are mixed together, the result being a mixture of primary particles of each polymer in the resultant aqueous dispersion. Co-coagulation of this dispersion mixture, as described above for the core/shell polymer, forms agglomerates, each containing primary particles of each polymer. The same is true after drying the agglomerates to form fine powder having an average particle size typically at least 300 micrometers. Melt-mixing of this fine<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> powder to form a composition of the present invention, as in the case of core/shell polymer, provides a mixture of primary particles of each polymer as the starting material for the melt mixing step. The conditions of shear rate in the melt-mixing process are not critical because the mixture of primary particles of each polymer component has already been established prior to melt mixing.

In greater detail, to make the 60 mil thick plaque, the fine powder was added in an overflow amount to a chase which was 55 mil (1.4 mm) thick. The chase defines the 6 x 6 in sample size. To avoid sticking to the platens of the compression molding press, the chase and fine powder filling are sandwiched between two sheets of aluminum foil. The press platens are heated to 350°C. This sandwich is first pressed for 5 min at about 200 lb (91 kg) to melt the fine powder and cause it to coalesce, followed by pressing at 10000 lb (4535 kg) for 2 min, followed by 20000 lb (9070 kg) for 2 min, followed by release of the pressing force, removal of the compression molding from the chase and sheets of aluminum foil, and cooling in air under a weight to prevent warping.

Each of the polymerizations was carried out to a solids content of 33.8 to 35.8 wt% and the RDPS of the polymer particles ranged from 194 to 261 nm (0.194 to 0.261 micrometers). As compared to the reduction in melt viscosity of 101 Pa·s for typical FEP by itself (Comparison Example A), the core/shell polymer of the present invention exhibits a much greater melt viscosity reduction with increasing shear, with the maximum reduction occurring at the lowest core content tested. This thixotropy enables the core/shell polymer, which exhibits very low MFR, to be melt fabricated when subjected to the higher shear applied in the melt fabrication process. With respect to physical properties, the tensile strength and elongation at break of the core/shell polymer was better than for the FEP by itself at PTFE core contents up to about 30 wt%, and useful tensile strength and elongation at break exist for core contents exceeding core content of about 40 wt%. The best combination of optimum thixotropy and physical properties occur in the range of about 4 to 20 wt% PTFE core when the perfluoropolymer in the shell is FEP. The low-to-no MFR shown for the core/shell polymers in Table 1 is beneficial to the utility of articles melt-fabricated from the core/shell polymers. Such articles (dispersion of PTFE core in perfluoropolmer continuous phase obtained by melt mixing the core/shell polymer) when exposed to high heat such as in a building fire will resist flowing and dripping to thereby remain non-smoking.</p><heading id="h0011"><b><u>Comparative Example B</u></b></heading><p id="p0055" num="0055">This Example shows the polymerization of PTFE by itself essentially under the same conditions used for polymenzing TFE to make the non-melt flowable PTFE in the core/shell polymer of Examples 1-6 above and in the Examples to follow to verify that the PTFE is non-melt flowable.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">A cylindrical, horizontal, water-jacketed, paddle-stirred, stainless steel reactor having a length to diameter ratio of about 1.5 and a water capacity of 10 gallons (37.9 L) was charged with 50 pounds (22.7 kg) of demineralized water, 330 mL of a 20 wt% solution of ammonium perfluorooctanoate surfactant in water, and 1.0 g Krytox® 157 FSL, available from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Inc.

The polymerizations shown in Table 5 were carried out to a polymer solids content of 18.4 to 28.5 wt% and average RDPS of 184 to 192 nm. The results in Table 5 show large reductions in melt viscosity over the entire range of core/shell polymer compositions and improved tensile strength and elongation also over the entire range. Also surprising is the increase in MIT Flex Life, ranging from an increase of at least about 150% to an increase more than 2000%. Preferably the core/shell polymer in which the shell is PFA exhibits an increase in MIT Flex Life of at least 200% as compared to the PEA by itself.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">The PTFE/FEP core shell polymer also exhibited favorable MIT Flex Life as compared to the same FEP by itself (1100 cycles) through the range of 4 to 40 wt% PTFE core, i.e. the MIT flex life of the PTFE/FEP core shell polymer was about the same at 10 wt% PTFE core and above, while at lower PTFE content, a substantial improvement was been found to exist. For example, at 7 wt% PTFE core, the MIT Flex Life was 17000 cycles.</p><heading id="h0018"><b><u>Comparative Example D</u></b></heading><p id="p0069" num="0069">This Example shows the preparation of a different typical PFA by itself for comparison with core/shell polymer.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">A cylindrical, horizontal, water-jacketed, paddle-stirred, stainless steel reactor having a length to diameter ratio of about 1.5 and a water capacity of 10 gallons (37.9 L) was charged with 54 pounds (24.5 kg) of demineralized water, 5.0 g Krytox® 157 FSL (available from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Inc.), and 240 mL 20 wt% solution of ammonium perfluorooctanoate surfactant in water. With the reactor paddle agitated at 50 rpm, the reactor was evacuated and purged three times with tetrafluoroethylene (TFE). Ethane was added to the reactor until the pressure was 8 in Hg (3.93 psig, 2.71 x 10<sup>-2</sup> MPa), then 200 mL of perfluoro(propyl vinyl ether) (PPVE) were added. The reactor temperature then was increased to 75°C. After the temperature had become steady at 75°C, TFE was added to the reactor to achieve a final pressure of 250 psig (1.75 MPa). An aliquot of 400 mL of a freshly prepared aqueous initiator solution containing 0.2 wt% of ammonium persulfate (APS) was charged to the reactor. This same initiator solution was pumped into the<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --> reactor at 5 mL/min for the remainder of the batch. After polymerization had begun, as indicated by a 10 psig (0.07 MPa) drop in reactor pressure, additional TFE was added to the reactor at a rate of 0.167 lb/min (75.6 g/min) until a total of 20 lb (9080 g) of TFE were added after kickoff. PPVE was added at 2.0 mL/min for the duration of the batch, 120 min. At the end of the reaction period, the TFE, PPVE, and initiator feeds were stopped and the reaction vessel was vented. When the reactor pressure reached 5 psig (0.035 MPa), the reactor was swept with nitrogen, then the reactor contents were cooled to 50°C before the dispersion was discharged from the reactor. Solids content of the dispersion was 28.9 wt%, and the raw dispersion particle size (RDPS) was 0.130 µm. After coagulation, the polymer was isolated by filtering and then dried in a 150°C convection air oven. This TFE/PPVE copolymer had a melt flow rate (MFR) of 8.2 g/10 min, a PPVE content of 3.66 wt%, melting points of 232 and 328°C, and an MIT flex life of 78583 cycles. The tensile strength of the PFA was 3502 psi (24.5 MPa) and the elongation at break was 292%.

With the reactor paddle agitated at 50 rpm, the reactor was evacuated and purged three times with tetrafluoroethylene (TFE). The reactor temperature then was increased to 75°C. After the temperature had become steady at 75°C, the pressure of the reactor was raised to 300 psig (2.1 MPa) using TFE. Four hundred milliliters of an initiating solution consisting of 0.2 wt% APS in water was injected to the reactor, then this same initiator was added at 5.0 mL/min. After polymerization had begun as indicated by a 10 psig (0.07 MPa) drop in reactor pressure, additional TFE was added at 0.2<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> lb (90.8 g)/min for 5 min. After 4 lb (1816 g) of TFE was fed after initiation, the TFE and initiator feeds were stopped, then the reactor was slowly vented. After stopping agitation, the reactor vapor space was evacuated. Agitation was resumed at 50 rpm, then the contents were cooled to 25°C. The agitator was again stopped, then the pressure in the reactor was raised to 8 in Hg (3.93 psig, 2.71 x 10<sup>-2</sup> MPa) with ethane. After the addition of ethane, the agitator was restarted at 50 rpm and the contents of the reactor were warmed to 75°C. A 200 mL aliquot of perfluoro(propyl vinyl ether) (PPVE) was added, then the pressure in the reactor was raised to 250 psig (1.75 MPa) with TFE. For the duration of the reaction, PPVE was added at 2 mL/min and initiation was resumed using the same solution at a rate of 5 mL/min. The pressure of TFE in the reactor was continuously adjusted to maintain a reaction rate of 0.167 lb TFE/min (75.7 g/min). After 16 lbs (8618 g) TFE reacted in 96 min, the reaction was terminated by stopping TFE, initiator, and PPVE feeds, then venting the reactor.

The core shell polymer also exhibited a tensile strength of 4097 psi (28.7 MPa) and elongation at break of 370%. The PTFE core content was 19.3 wt%, and Δη was 19568 Pa•s.

The polymerizations of Table 6 were carried out to polymer solids contents of 29.3 to 31.3 wt%, and average RDPS of 95 to 145 nm, except that the core/shell polymer of example 45 had an average RDPS of 250 nm which limited the polymerization to a solids content of 16.9 wt%. For Examples 25 to 35, the amount of PPVE fed to the polymerization remained constant, with the result being that as the PTFE core content increased, the PEVE content of the overall core/shell polymer decreased. For Examples 36 to 45, the PPVE feed to the polymerization of the shell was increased as PTFE core content increased, to approximately keep the PPVE content of the overall core/shell polymer constant. This resulted in an increase in PPVE content for the shell as the PTFE core content increased. The results reported in Table 6 show that some of the core/shell polymers of Examples 25-35 exhibit either better physical properties or melt viscosity reduction or both than the corresponding core/shell polymer of Examples 36-45, while for other core/shell polymers, the corresponding ones in Examples 36-45 are better. Adjustment of the amount of comonomer with the TFE in the polymerization of the shell is another way to adjust the melt and physical properties of the core/shell polymer. The results reported in Table 6 also show melt viscosity reductions of more than 200% greater than the melt viscosity reduction obtained for the PFA by itself over the entire range of PTFE core contents. The tensile strengths and elongations at break for the core/shell polymer were also superior for the core/shell polymer.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">Examples 20-45 show core/shell polymer compositions for PFA shell, wherein the PTFE core content ranges from about 4 to about 50 wt%, exhibiting one or more favorable properties of reduced melt viscosity with increased shear and high tensile strength and high elongation at break.</p><heading id="h0021"><b><u>Example 46</u></b></heading><p id="p0075" num="0075">This Example shows the use of core/shell polymer of the present invention as a concentrate, blended with melt-fabricable perfluoropolymer by itself.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">A core/shell PFA containing 38.4 wt% PTFE core polymerized in the manner of Example 33 was coagulated by freezing, rinsed, and dried<!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --> overnight at 150°C.

To shorten the time for MIT Flex Life testing the testing reported in Table 3 was done on 1 27 mm thick compression molded films, which gives a much smaller MIT Flex Life, which would be much larger if the testing were done on 0.21 mm thick films. As shown in Table 7, as the core content for the PTFE homopolymer core increase to about 75 wt%, the tensile properties are still reasonably significant to have value For example at about 75 wt% core content, elongation is still above 200%. The tensile properties of the melt extruded strand are also reasonably high to have value.</p><heading id="h0032"><b><u>Example 61</u></b></heading><p id="p0100" num="0100">This Example is directed to improved injection molding and resulting from the use of the melt-mixed composition of the present invention, wherein the composition is obtained by melt mixing core/shell polymer.</p><p id="p0101" num="0101">PFA 1 used in this Example is a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and perfluoro(propyl vinyl ether) (PPVE), with PPVE content of 4.1 wt%, and MFR of 29 2 g/10 min.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">PFA 2 used in this Example is the same copolymer as PFA 1 except that the PPVE content of 4.2 wt%, and the MFR is 12.6 g /10 mm<!-- EPO <DP n="63"> --></p><p id="p0103" num="0103">State 1 is a core/shell polymer having 4.78 wt% polytetrafluoroethylene core and a PFA shell of composition like that of PFA 1.
