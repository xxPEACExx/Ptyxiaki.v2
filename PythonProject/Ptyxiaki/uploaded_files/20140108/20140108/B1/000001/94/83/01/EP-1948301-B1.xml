mxw-id="PDES63961216" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><heading id="h0001"><b>BACKGROUND ART</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of delivery of electrical impulses (and/or fields) to bodily tissues for therapeutic purposes, and more specifically to devices and methods for treating conditions associated with bronchial constriction</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">There are a number of treatments for various infirmities that require the destruction of otherwise healthy tissue in order to affect a beneficial effect. Malfunctioning tissue is identified, and then lesioned or otherwise compromised in order to affect a beneficial outcome, rather than attempting to repair the tissue to its normal functionality. While there are a variety of different techniques and mechanisms that have been designed to focus lesioning directly onto the target nerve tissue, collateral damage is inevitable.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Still other treatments for malfunctioning tissue can be medicinal in nature, in many cases leaving patients to become dependent upon artificially synthesized chemicals. Examples of this are anti-asthma drugs such as albuterol, proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole (Prilosec), spastic bladder relievers such as Ditropan, and cholesterol reducing drugs like Lipitor and Zocor. In many cases, these medicinal approaches have side effects that are either unknown or quite significant, for example, at least one popular diet pill of the late 1990's was subsequently found to cause heart attacks and strokes.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Unfortunately, the beneficial outcomes of surgery and medicines are, therefore, often realized at the cost of function of other tissues, or risks of side effects.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The use of electrical stimulation for treatment of medical conditions has been well known in the art for nearly two thousand years. It has been recognized that electrical stimulation of the brain and/or the peripheral nervous system and/or direct stimulation of the malfunctioning tissue, which stimulation is generally a wholly reversible and nondestructive treatment, holds significant promise for the treatment of many ailments.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Electrical stimulation of the brain with implanted electrodes has been approved for use in the treatment of various conditions, including pain and movement disorders including essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. The principle behind these approaches involves disruption and modulation of hyperactive neuronal circuit transmission at specific sites in the brain. As compared with the very dangerous lesioning procedures in which the portions of the brain that are behaving pathologically are physically destroyed, electrical stimulation is achieved by implanting electrodes at these sites to, first sense aberrant electrical signals and then to send electrical pulses to locally disrupt the pathological neuronal transmission, driving it back into the normal range of activity. These electrical stimulation procedures, while invasive, are generally conducted with the patient conscious and a participant in the surgery.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Brain stimulation, and deep brain stimulation in particular, is not without some drawbacks. The procedure requires penetrating the skull, and inserting an electrode into the brain matter using a catheter-shaped lead, or the like. While monitoring the patient's condition (such as tremor activity, etc.), the position of the electrode is adjusted to achieve significant therapeutic potential. Next, adjustments are made to the electrical stimulus signals, such as frequency, periodicity, voltage, current, etc., again to<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> achieve therapeutic results. The electrode is then permanently implanted and wires are directed from the electrode to the site of a surgically implanted pacemaker. The pacemaker provides the electrical stimulus signals to the electrode to maintain the therapeutic effect. While the therapeutic results of deep brain stimulation are promising, there are significant complications that arise from the implantation procedure, including stroke induced by damage to surrounding tissues and the neurovasculature.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">One of the most successful modern applications of this basic understanding of the relationship between muscle and nerves is the cardiac pacemaker. Although its roots extend back into the 1800's, it was not until 1950 that the first practical, albeit external and bulky pacemaker was developed. <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Dr. Rune Elqvist developed the first truly functional, wearable pacemaker in 1957</text></nplcit>. Shortly thereafter, in 1960, the first fully implanted pacemaker was developed.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Around this time, it was also found that the electrical leads could be connected to the heart through veins, which eliminated the need to open the chest cavity and attach the lead to the heart wall. In 1975 the introduction of the lithium-iodide battery prolonged the battery life of a pacemaker from a few months to more than a decade. The modern pacemaker can treat a variety of different signaling pathologies in the cardiac muscle, and can serve as a defibrillator as well (see <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US6738667B"><text>U.S. Patent Number 6,738,667 to Deno, et al.</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Another application of electrical stimulation of nerves has been the treatment of radiating pain in the lower extremities by means of stimulation of the sacral nerve roots at the bottom of the spinal cord (see <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6871099B"><text>U.S. Patent Number<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> 6, 871, 099 to Whitehurst, et al</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2004078252A"><text>WO 2004078252</text></patcit> describes a device for the treatment of various human diseases by electric stimulation and/or electric blocking of body tissues, comprising, among other components, implanted electrodes for applying an electric signal to the tissues. The document discloses the treatment of asthma by applying an electric signal to the right or left sinocarotid collector (located over the bifurcation spot of the common carotid artery).</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US20050065574A"><text>US 2005/0065574</text></patcit> describes also such a device but achieving stimulation through the hypothalamic target site.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The smooth muscles that line the bronchial passages are controlled by a confluence of vagus and sympathetic nerve fiber plexuses. Spasms of the bronchi during asthma attacks and anaphylactic shock can often be directly related to pathological signaling within these plexuses. Anaphylactic shock and asthma are major health concerns.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Asthma, and other airway occluding disorders resulting from inflammatory responses and inflammation-mediated bronchioconstriction, affects an estimated eight to thirteen million adults and children in the United States. A significant subclass of asthmatics suffers from severe asthma. An estimated 5,000 persons die every year in the United States as a result of asthma attacks. Up to twenty percent of the populations of some countries are affected by asthma, estimated at more than a hundred million people worldwide. Asthma's associated morbidity and mortality are rising in most countries despite increasing use of anti-asthma drugs.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Asthma is characterized as a chronic inflammatory condition of the airways. Typical symptoms are coughing, wheezing, tightness of the chest and shortness of breath. Asthma is a result of increased sensitivity to foreign bodies such as pollen, dust mites and cigarette smoke. The body, in effect, overreacts to the presence of these foreign bodies in the airways. As part of the asthmatic reaction, an increase in mucous production is often triggered, exacerbating airway restriction. Smooth muscle surrounding the airways goes into spasm, resulting in constriction of airways. The airways also become inflamed.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Over time, this inflammation can lead to scarring of the airways and a further reduction in airflow. This inflammation leads to the airways and a further reduction in airflow. This inflammation leads to the airways becoming more<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> irritable, which may cause an increase in coughing and increased susceptibility to asthma episodes.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Two medicinal strategies exist for treating this problem for patients with asthma. The condition is typically managed by means of inhaled medications that are taken after the onset of symptoms, or by injected and/or oral medication that are taken chronically. The medications typically fall into two categories; those that treat the inflammation, and those that treat the smooth muscle constriction. The first is to provide anti-inflammatory medications, like steroids, to treat the airway tissue, reducing its tendency to over-release of the molecules that mediate the inflammatory process. The second strategy is to provide a smooth muscle relaxant (an anticholinergic and/or anti-adrenergic medication) to reduce the ability of the muscles to constrict.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">It has been highly preferred that patients rely on avoidance of triggers and anti-inflammatory medications, rather than on the bronchodilators as their first line of treatment. For some patients, however, these medications, and even the bronchodilators are insufficient to stop the constriction of their bronchial passages, and more than five thousand people suffocate and die every year as a result of asthma attacks.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Anaphylaxis likely ranks among the other airway occluding disorders of this type as the most deadly, claiming more than eight thousand deaths per year in the United States alone. Anaphylaxis (the most severe from of which is anaphylactic shock) is a severe and rapid systemic allergic reaction to an allergan. Minute amounts of allergans may cause a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction. Anaphylaxis may occur after ingestion, inhalation, skin contact or injection of an allergan. Anaphylactic shock usually results in death in minutes if untreated. Anaphylactic shock is a life-threatening<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> medical emergency because of rapid constriction of the airway. Brain damage sets in quickly without oxygen. Anaphylactic shock itself accounts for approximately 1,500 deaths every year in the United States.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The triggers for these fatal reactions range from foods (nuts and shellfish), to insect stings (bees), to medication (radiocontrasts and antibiotics). It is estimated 1.3 to 13 million people in the United States are allergic to venom associated with insect bites; 27 million are allergic to antibiotics; and 5-8 million suffer food allergies. All of these individuals are at risk of anaphylactic shock from exposure to any of the foregoing allergens. In addition, anaphylactic shock can be brought on by exercise. Yet all are mediated by a series of hypersensitivity responses that result in uncontrollable airway occlusion driven by smooth muscle constriction, and dramatic hypotension that leads to shock. Cardiovascular failure, multiple organ ischemia, and asphyxiation are the most dangerous consequences of anaphylaxis.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Anaphylactic shock requires advanced medical care immediately. Current emergency measures include rescue breathing; administration of epinephrine; and/or intubation if possible. Rescue breathing may be hindered by the closing airway but can help if the victim stops breathing on his own. Clinical treatment typically consists of antihistamines (which inhibit the effects of histamine at histamine receptors) which are usually not sufficient in anaphylaxis, and high doses of intravenous corticosteroids. Hypotension is treated with intravenous fluids and sometimes vasoconstrictor drugs. For bronchospasm, bronchodilator drugs such as salbutamol are employed.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Given the common mediators of both asthmatic and anaphylactic bronchoconstriction, it is not surprising that<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> asthma sufferers are at a particular risk for anaphylaxis. Still, estimates place the numbers of people who are susceptible to such responses at more than 40 million in the United States alone.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Tragically, many of these patients are fully aware of the severity of their condition, and die while struggling in vain to manage the attack medically. Many of these incidents occur in hospitals or in ambulances, in the presence of highly trained medical personnel who are powerless to break the cycle of inflammation and bronchoconstriction (and life-threatening hypotension in the case of anaphylaxis) affecting their patient.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Unfortunately, prompt medical attention for anaphylactic shock and asthma are not always available. For example, epinephrine is not always available for immediate injection. Even in cases where medication and attention is available, life saving measures are often frustrated because of the nature of the symptoms. Constriction of the airways frustrates resuscitation efforts, and intubation may be impossible because of swelling of tissues.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Typically, the severity and rapid onset of anaphylactic reactions does not render the pathology amenable to chronic treatment, but requires more immediately acting medications. Among the most popular medications for treating anaphylaxis is epinephrine, commonly marketed in so-called "Epi-pen" formulations and administering devices, which potential sufferers carry with them at all times. In addition to serving as an extreme bronchodilator, epinephrine raises the patient's heart rate dramatically in order to offset the hypotension that accompanies many reactions. This cardiovascular stress can result in tachycardia, heart attacks and strokes.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Unlike cardiac arrhythmias, which can be treated chronically with pacemaker technology, or in emergent situations with equipment like defibrillators (implantable and external), there is virtually no commercially available medical equipment that can chronically reduce the baseline sensitivity of the muscle tissue in the airways to reduce the predisposition to asthma attacks, or to break the cycle of bronchial constriction associated with an acute asthma attack or anaphylaxis.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for new products and methods for treating the immediate symptoms of anaphylactic shock and asthma.</p><heading id="h0002"><b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">The present invention involves products of treatment of asthma, anaphylaxis, and other pathologies involving the constriction of the primary airways, utilizing an electrical signal that may be applied to the vagus nerve to temporarily block and/or modulate the signals in the vagus nerve.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In a first embodiment, the present invention contemplates an electrical impulse delivery device that delivers one or more electrical impulses to at least one selected region of the vagus nerve to block and/or modulate signals to the muscle fibers surrounding the bronchi, and/or block and/or affect histamine response of the vagus nerve, facilitating opening of airways. The invention is carried out as in claim 1.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In an example, methods in accordance with the present invention contemplate delivery of one or more electrical impulses to at least one selected region of the vagus nerve to block and/or modulate signals to the muscle fibers surrounding the bronchi, and/or block and/or affect<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> histamine response of the vagus nerve, facilitating opening of airways.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">It shall be understood that the activation of such impulses may be directed manually by a patient suffering from bronchospasm, depending on the embodiment.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the prefered embodiment, the impulses are applied in a manner that blocks and/or affects the constriction of the smooth muscle lining the bronchial passages to relieve the spasms that occur during anaphylactic shock or asthma attacks. The impulses may be applied by positioning leads on the nerves that control bronchial activity such as the anterior and posterior bronchial branches of the right and left branches of the vagus nerve, which join with fibers from the sympathetic nerve chain to form the anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses. Leads may be positioned above both the pulmonary and cardiac branches of the vagus nerve to include a stimulus and/or blocking and/or modulation of both organs. It shall also be understood that leadless impulses as shown in the art may also be utilized for applying impulses to the target regions.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The mechanisms by which the appropriate impulse is applied to the selected region of the vagus nerve can include positioning the distal ends of an electrical lead or leads in the vicinity of the nervous tissue controlling the pulmonary and/or cardiac muscles, which leads are coupled to an implantable or external electrical impulse generating device. The electric field generated at the distal tip of the lead creates a field of effect that permeates the target nerve fibers and causes the blocking and/or modulation of signals to the subject muscles, and/or the blocking and/or affecting of histamine response.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The application of electrical impulses, either to the vagus nerve or the fibers branching off the vagus nerve to the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> bronchial muscles to modulate the parasympathetic tone in order to relax the smooth muscle or block and/or affect the constriction of the bronchial passageways to reduce airway constriction during pathological inflammatory responses that are associated with asthma and anaphylaxis, is more completely described in the following detailed description of the invention, with reference to the drawings provided herewith, and in claims appended hereto.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The inventors submit that the cause of many physiological disorders may be a dysfunction in any one nerve, or a combination of nerves and/or nerve clusters (ganglia and/or plexuses), and that the proper treatment of such a dysfunction by electrical stimulation cannot be effective without a method that takes these alternative pathologies into consideration. More particularly, with respect to organ function, including but not limited to the respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, reproductive, and renal-urinary systems, the nerves most directly involved with motor and sensory control are those of the tenth cranial nerve (the vagus nerve) and the sympathetic nerves. It shall be understood that the sympathetic nerve fibers emanating from the chain that extends along the anterior outside of the vertebral column, in conjunction with the fibers of the spinal cord nerve roots that join with the sympathetic fibers, form the sympathetic nervous system. The plexuses and ganglia, such as the celiac, pulmonary, cardiac, hepatic, mesenteric plexuses, that control the organ function are formed, from one side by, the afferent and efferent fibers of the vagus nerve (or in limited instances by others of the cranial nerves) and on the other side by the fibers of the sympathetic nervous system. The present invention has applicability in treating disorders that benefit from simultaneous monitoring and/or modulation of one or more sympathetic nerves, or one or more cranial nerves, or the plexus formed by the interaction of the two.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Specifically, the treatment regiments contemplated by the inventors of the present invention include the holistic monitoring of at least two of (i) the sympathetic nerve fibers (at a location distal to the sympathetic chain such that the spinal cord nerve root fibers are incorporated into the fiber bundle), (ii) the fibers of the cranial nerve branch responsible for communication with the organ or target tissue, (iii) the plexus wherein these two nerve fibers communicate, (iv) the muscles surrounding or interfacing with the pathologically responding tissue, and (v) any physical state of being that may be associated with the condition, and thusly creating a stimulation signal pattern based upon the evaluation of the monitoring such that the desired therapeutic effect results.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">More specifically, the inventors hereof have made the realization that the control of the organ and/or tissue is the result of a circuit that begins in the brain, and may include at least three separate descending components, i.e., the cranial nerve, the sympathetic nerve fibers, and the spinal cord nerve roots. This circuit is, in fact, an electrical circuit, and most importantly it is being disclosed herein that it is most effective, when attempting to modify the behavior of a component in an electrical circuit, to determine the nature and function of as many of (and preferably all of) the components of the circuit before simply driving a signal into the system. This requires monitoring the appropriate components and accurately analyzing the results of that monitoring.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Physiological disorders that may be treated by this monitoring of the entire circuit, and then applying the corrective signal to the appropriate component of the system, include, but are not limited to intestinal motility disorders, sexual dysfunction, bronchial disorder (such as asthma),<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> dysfunction of the liver, pancreatic disorders, and heart disorders, pulmonary disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and renal and urinary complaints. The number of disorders to be treated is limited only by the number, variety, and placement of electrodes (or combinations of multiple electrodes) along the sympathetic nervous system and cranial nervous system.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In general, an allergic response is an increasing cause of adult-onset asthma cases. The allergic process, called atopy, and its connection to asthma, involves various airborne allergens or other triggers that set off a cascade of events in the immune system leading to inflammation and hyperreactivity in the airways. One description of the allergic process is as follows: The primary contributor to allergies and asthma appears to be a category of white blood cells known as helper T-cells, in particular a subgroup called TH2-cells. TH2-cells overproduce interleukins (ILs), immune factors that are molecular members of a family called cytokines, powerful agents of the inflammatory process.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Interleukins 4, 9, and 13, for example, may be responsible for a first-phase asthma attack. These interleukins stimulate the production and release of antibody groups known as immunoglobulin E (IgE). People with both asthma and allergies appear to have a genetic predisposition for overproducing IgE. During an allergic attack, these IgE antibodies can bind to special cells in the immune system called mast cells, which are generally concentrated in the lungs, skin, and mucous membranes. This bond triggers the release of a number of active chemicals, importantly potent molecules known as leukotrienes. These chemicals cause airway spasms, over-produce mucus, and activate nerve endings in the airway lining.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Another cytokine, interleukin 5, appears to contribute to a late-phase inflammatory response. This interleukin attracts white blood cells known as eosinophils. These cells accumulate and remain in the airways after the first attack. They persist for weeks and mediate the release of other damaging particles that remain in the airways.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Over the course of years the repetition of the inflammatory events involved in asthma can cause irreversible structural and functional changes in the airways, a process called remodeling. The remodeled airways are persistently narrow and can cause chronic asthma.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention, a method of treating bronchial constriction includes inducing at least one of an electric field and electromagnetic field in one or more lungs of a mammal such that one or more mitogenic factors, and that contribute to bronchial constriction are down-regulated. The mitogenic factor may include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Additionally or alternatively, the mitogenic factor may effect the production of T-helper type 2 cells (TH2).</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Additionally or alternatively, the mitogenic factor may include one or more enzymes, such as one or more matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The one or more MMPs may include one or more of: Stromelysin-1, gelatinase A, fibroblast collagenase (MMP-1), neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8), gelatinase B (MMP-9), stromelysin-2 (MMP-10), stromelysin-3 (MMP-11), matrilysin (MMP-7), collagenase 3 (MMP-13), and TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE).</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">One or more embodiments may include inducing the field(s) by applying at least one electrical impulse to one or more field emitters. The one or more field emitters may be disposed percutaneously and/or subcutaneously to direct the field(s) toward the lung(s). For example, the one or more field<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> emitters may be disposed at least one of on a chest of the mammal and on the back of the mammal. The one or more field emitters may include at least one of capacitive coupling electrodes and inductive coils.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">One or more embodiments may include applying drive signals to the one or more field emitters to produce the at least one impulse and induce the field(s). The drive signals may include at least one of sine waves, square waves, triangle waves, exponential waves, and complex impulses. For example, the drive signals include a frequency of between about 10 Hz to 100 KHz, a duty cycle of between about 1 to 100 %, and/or an amplitude of between about 1 mv/cm to about 50 mv/cm. The field(s) may be applied for a predetermined period of time, for example, between about 0.5 to about 24 hours.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Preferably, a response of the mammal to the field(s) is measured (e.g., airway pressure and/or lung volume), such that data collection and/or field adjustments may be made.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Ultimately, the inventors hereof recognize that the treatment of disorders having common symptoms may have entirely different causes, and as such must be distinguished from one another if an effective treatment is to be developed. Nowhere is this principle truer than in the potential treatment of ailments through stimulation of the nerves that control the peripheral organs and/or tissues.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Other aspects, features, advantages, etc. will become apparent to one skilled in the art when the description of the invention herein is taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0049" num="0049">For the purposes of illustrating the various aspects of the invention, there are shown in the drawings forms that are<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> presently preferred, it being understood, however, that the invention is not limited by or to the precise data, methodologies, arrangements and instrumentalities shown, but rather only by the claims.

The vagus nerve, as the source of the signal to constrict bronchial smooth muscle, is thought to provide a baseline level of tonicity in the smooth muscles surrounding the bronchial passages, in order to prevent the tissue lining the airways from collapsing shut.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Specifically, one or more embodiments of the present invention consider the signals carried by the vagus (parasympathetic) nerve to cause a constriction of the smooth muscle surrounding the bronchial passages. The sympathetic nerve fibers carry the opposing signals that tend to open the bronchial passages. It should be recognized that the signals of the vagus nerve mediate a response similar to that of histamine, while the sympathetic signals generate an effect<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> similar to epinephrine. Given the postulated balance between the parasympathetic and sympathetic signals, removing the parasympathetic signal should create an imbalance emphasizing the sympathetic signal. Along these lines, scientific literature also indicates that severing the vagus nerve in dogs will open the bronchial passages, much the same way that epinephrine does.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Now referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGS. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, the vagus nerve is shown in more detail. The vagus nerve is composed of motor and sensory fibers. The vagus nerve leaves the cranium and is contained in the same sheath of dura matter with the accessory nerve. The vagus nerve passes down the neck within the carotid sheath to the root of the neck. The branches of distribution of the vagus nerve include, among others, the superior cardiac, the inferior cardiac, the anterior bronchial and the posterior bronchial branches. On the right side, the vagus nerve descends by the trachea to the back of the root of the lung, where it spreads out in the posterior pulmonary plexus. On the left side, the vagus nerve enters the thorax, crosses the left side of the arch of the aorta, and descends behind the root of the left lung, forming the posterior pulmonary plexus.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In mammals, two vagal components have evolved in the brainstem to regulate peripheral parasympathetic functions. The dorsal vagal complex (DVC), consisting of the <i>dorsal motor nucleus</i> (DMNX) and its connections, controls parasympathetic function below the level of the diaphragm, while the ventral <i>vagal complex</i> (VVC), comprised of <i>nucleus ambiguus</i> and <i>nucleus retrofacial,</i> controls functions above the diaphragm in organs such as the heart, thymus and lungs, as well as other glands and tissues of the neck and upper chest, and specialized muscles such as those of the esophageal complex.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The parasympathetic portion of the vagus innervates ganglionic neurons which are located in or adjacent to each target organ. The VVC appears only in mammals and is associated with positive as well as negative regulation of heart rate, bronchial constriction, vocalization and contraction of the facial muscles in relation to emotional states. Generally speaking, this portion of the vagus nerve regulates parasympathetic tone. The VVC inhibition is released (turned off) in states of alertness. This in turn causes cardiac vagal tone to decrease and airways to open, to support responses to environmental challenges.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The parasympathetic tone is balanced in part by sympathetic innervation, which generally speaking supplies signals tending to relax the bronchial muscles so overconstriction does not occur. Overall, airway smooth muscle tone is dependent on several factors, including parasympathetic input, inhibitory influence of circulating epinephrine, NANC inhibitory nerves and sympathetic innervation of the parasympathetic ganglia. Stimulation of the vagus nerve (upregulation of tone), such as occurs in asthma attacks or anaphylactic shock, results in airway constriction and a decrease in heart rate. In general, the pathology of both severe asthma and anaphylaxis appear to be mediated by inflammatory cytokines that overwhelm receptors on the nerve cells and cause the cells to massively upregulate the parasympathetic tone.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In the case of asthma, it appears that the airway tissue has both (i) a hypersensitivity to the allergen that causes the overproduction of the cytokines that stimulate the cholenergic receptors of the nerves and/or (ii) a baseline high parasympathetic tone or a high ramp up to a strong parasympathetic tone when confronted with any level of cholenergic cytokine. The combination can be lethal.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> Anaphylaxis appears to be mediated predominantly by the hypersensitivity to an allergen causing the massive overproduction of cholenergic receptor activating cytokines that overdrive the otherwise normally operating vagus nerve to signal massive constriction of the airways. Drugs such as epinephrine drive heart rate up while also relaxing the bronchial muscles, effecting temporary relief of symptoms from these conditions. As mentioned above, experience has shown that severing the vagus nerve (an extreme version of reducing the parasympathetic tone) has an effect similar to that of epinephrine and adrenaline on heart rate and bronchial diameter in that the heart begins to race (tachycardia) and the bronchial passageways dilate.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">In accordance with at least one aspect of the present invention, the delivery, in a patient suffering from severe asthma or anaphylactic shock, of an electrical impulse sufficient to block and/or modulate transmission of signals will result in relaxation of the bronchi smooth muscle, dilating airways and/or counteract the effect of histamine on the vagus nerve. Depending on the placement of the impulse, the signal blocking and/or modulation can also raise the heart function.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In accordance with at least one aspect of the present invention, blocking and/or modulating the signal in the vagus nerve, and/or blocking and/or affecting the histamine response of the vagus nerve, to reduce parasympathetic tone provides an immediate emergency response, much like a defibrillator, in situations of severe asthma attacks or anaphylactic shock, providing immediate temporary dilation of the airways and optionally an increase of heart function until subsequent measures, such as administration of epinephrine, rescue breathing and intubation can be employed. Moreover, the teachings of the present invention permit immediate airway<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> dilation and/or heart function increase to enable subsequent life saving measures that otherwise would be ineffective or impossible due to severe constriction or other physiological effects. Treatment in accordance with the present invention provides bronchodilation and optionally increased heart function for a long enough period of time so that administered medication such as epinephrine has time to take effect before the patient suffocate.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The methods described for instance herein of applying an electrical impulse to a selected region of the vagus nerve may further be refined such that the at least one region may comprise at least one nerve fiber emanating from the patient's tenth cranial nerve (the vagus nerve), and in particular, at least one of the anterior bronchial branches thereof, or alternatively at least one of the posterior bronchial branches thereof. Preferably the impulse is provided to at least one of the anterior pulmonary or posterior pulmonary plexuses aligned along the exterior of the lung. As necessary, the impulse may be directed to nerves innervating only the bronchial tree and lung tissue itself. In addition, the impulse may be directed to a region of the vagus nerve to block and/or modulate both the cardiac and bronchial branches. As recognized by those having skill in the art, this embodiment should be carefully evaluated prior to use in patients known to have preexisting cardiac issues.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Further reference is now made to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, which illustrates a simplified view of the vagus nerve shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> and cardiac and pulmonary branches thereof.

The sympathetic, spinal, and cranial nerves all have couplings to the central nervous system, generally in the primitive regions of the brain, however, these components have direct effects over many regions of the brain, including the frontal cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. The central components of the spinal cord and the sympathetic nerve chain extend into the periphery of the<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> autonomic nervous system from their cranial base to the coccyx, essentially passing down the entire spinal column, including the cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions. The sympathetic chain extends on the anterior of the column, while the spinal cord components pass through the spinal canal. The cranial nerves, the one most innervating of the rest of the body being the vagus nerve, passes through the dura mater into the neck, and then along the carotid and into the thoracic and abdominal cavities, generally following structures like the esophagus, the aorta, and the stomach wall.</p><p id="p0122" num="0122">Because the autonomic nervous system has both afferent and efferent components, modulation of its fibers can affect both the end organs (efferent) as well as the brain structure to which the afferents fibers are ultimately coupled within the brain.</p><p id="p0123" num="0123">Although sympathetic and cranial fibers (axons) transmit impulses producing a wide variety of differing effects, their component neurons are morphologically similar. They are smallish, ovoid, multipolar cells with myelinated axons and a variable number of dendrites. All the fibers form synapses in peripheral ganglia, and the unmyelinated axons of the ganglionic neurons convey impulses to the viscera, vessels and other structures innervated. Because of this arrangement, the axons of the autonomic nerve cells in the nuclei of the cranial nerves, in the thoracolumbar lateral comual cells, and in the gray matter of the sacral spinal segments are termed preganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers, while those of the ganglion cells are termed postganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers. These postganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers converge, in small nodes of nerve cells, called ganglia that lie alongside the vertebral bodies in the neck, chest, and abdomen. The effects of the ganglia as part of the autonomic system are extensive. Their effects range from the control of<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> insulin production, cholesterol production, bile production, satiety, other digestive functions, blood pressure, vascular tone, heart rate, sweat, body heat, blood glucose levels, and asexual arousal.</p><p id="p0124" num="0124">The parasympathetic group lies predominately in the cranial and cervical region, while the sympathetic group lies predominantly in the lower cervical, and thoracolumbar and sacral regions. The sympathetic peripheral nervous system is comprised of the sympathetic ganglia that are ovoid/bulb like structures (bulbs) and the paravertebral sympathetic chain (cord that connects the bulbs). The sympathetic ganglia include the central ganglia and the collateral ganglia.</p><p id="p0125" num="0125">The central ganglia are located in the cervical portion, the thoracic portion, the lumbar portion, and the sacral portion.

The seven lower ganglia distribute filaments to the aorta, and unite to form the greater, the lesser, and the lowest splanchnic nerves. The greater splanchnic nerve (splanchnicus major) is formed by branches from the fifth to the ninth or tenth thoracic ganglia, but the fibers in the higher roots may be traced upward in the sympathetic trunk as far as the first or second thoracic ganglion. The greater splanchnic nerve descends on the bodies of the vertebrae, perforates the crus of the diaphragm, and ends in the celiac ganglion of the celiac plexus. The lesser splanchnic nerve (splanchnicus minor) is formed by filaments from the ninth and tenth, and sometimes the eleventh thoracic ganglia, and from the cord between them. The lesser splanchnic nerve pierces the diaphragm with the preceding nerve, and joins the aorticorenal<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> ganglion. The lowest splanchnic nerve (splanchnicus imus) arises from the last thoracic ganglion, and, piercing the diaphragm, ends in the renal plexus.</p><p id="p0127" num="0127">The lumbar portion of the sympathetic system usually includes four lumbar ganglia, connected together by interganglionic cords. The lumbar portion is continuous above, with the thoracic portion beneath the medial lumbocostal arch, and below with the pelvic portion behind the common iliac artery. Gray rami communicantes pass from all the ganglia to the lumbar spinal nerves. The first and second, and sometimes the third, lumbar nerves send white rami communicantes to the corresponding ganglia.</p><p id="p0128" num="0128">The sacral portion of the sympathetic system is situated in front of the sacrum, medial to the anterior sacral foramina. The sacral portion includes four or five small sacral ganglia, connected together by interganglionic cords, and continuous above with the abdominal portion. Below, the two pelvic sympathetic trunks converge, and end on the front of the coccyx in a small ganglion.</p><p id="p0129" num="0129">The collateral ganglia include the three great gangliated plexuses, called, the cardiac, the celiac (solar or epigastric), and the hypogastric plexuses. The great plexuses are respectively situated in front of the vertebral column in the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic regions. They consist of collections of nerves and ganglia; the nerves being derived from the sympathetic trunks and from the cerebrospinal nerves. They distribute branches to the viscera.</p><p id="p0130" num="0130">Although all of the great plexuses (and their sub-parts) are of interest in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, by way of example, the celiac plexus is shown in <figref idrefs="f0013">FIGS. 21</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0014">22</figref> in more detail. The celiac plexus is the largest of the three great sympathetic plexuses and is located at the upper part of the first lumbar vertebra. The<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> celiac plexus is composed of the celiac ganglia and a network of nerve fibers uniting them together. The celiac plexus and the ganglia receive the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves of both sides and some filaments from the right vagus nerve. The celiac plexus gives off numerous secondary plexuses along the neighboring arteries. The upper part of each celiac ganglion is joined by the greater splanchnic nerve, while the lower part, which is segmented off and named the aorticorenal ganglion, receives the lesser splanchnic nerve and gives off the greater part of the renal plexus.</p><p id="p0131" num="0131">The secondary plexuses associated with the celiac plexus consist of the phrenic, hepatic, lineal, superior gastric, suprarenal, renal, spermatic, superior mesenteric, abdominal aortic, and inferior mesenteric. The phrenic plexus emanates from the upper part of the celiac ganglion and accompanies the inferior phrenic artery to the diaphragm, with some filaments passing to the suprarenal gland and branches going to the inferior vena cava, and the suprarenal and hepatic plexuses. The hepatic plexus emanates from the celiac plexus and receives filaments from the left vagus and right phrenic nerves. The hepatic plexus accompanies the hepatic artery and ramifies upon its branches those of the portal vein in the substance of the liver. Branches from hepatic plexus accompany the hepatic artery, the gastroduodenal artery, and the right gastroepiploic artery along the greater curvature of the stomach.</p><p id="p0132" num="0132">The lienal plexus is formed from the celiac plexus, the left celiac ganglion, and from the right vagus nerve. The lienal plexus accompanies the lienal artery to the spleen, giving off subsidiary plexuses along the various branches of the artery. The superior gastric plexus accompanies the left gastric artery along the lesser curvature of the stomach, and joins with branches from the left vagus nerve. The suprarenal<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> plexus is formed from the celiac plexus, from the celiac ganglion, and from the phrenic and greater splanchnic nerves. The suprarenal plexus supplies the suprarenal gland. The renal plexus is formed from the celiac plexus, the aorticorenal ganglion, and the aortic plexus, and is joined by the smallest splanchnic nerve. The nerves from the suprarenal plexus accompany the branches of the renal artery into the kidney, the spermatic plexus, and the inferior vena cava.</p><p id="p0133" num="0133">The spermatic plexus is formed from the renal plexus and aortic plexus. The spermatic plexus accompanies the internal spermatic artery to the testis (in the male) and the ovarian plexus, the ovary, and the uterus (in the female). The superior mesenteric plexus is formed from the lower part of the celiac plexus and receives branches from the right vagus nerve.</p><p id="p0134" num="0134">The superior mesenteric plexus surrounds the superior mesenteric artery and accompanies it into the mesentery, the pancreas, the small intestine, and the great intestine. The abdominal aortic plexus is formed from the celiac plexus and ganglia, and the lumbar ganglia. The abdominal aortic plexus is situated upon the sides and front of the aorta, between the origins of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries, and distributes filaments to the inferior vena cava. The inferior mesenteric plexus is formed from the aortic plexus. The inferior mesenteric plexus surrounds the inferior mesenteric artery, the descending and sigmoid parts of the colon and the rectum.</p><p id="p0135" num="0135">While the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system extends between the brain and the great plexuses, the cranial nerves extend between the brain and the great plexuses along other paths. For example, as best seen in <figref idrefs="f0014">FIG. 22</figref>, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves extend between the brain the celiac plexus along a first portion of a "circuit,"<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --> while the vagus nerve extends between the brain the celiac plexus along a second portion of the same circuit.</p><p id="p0136" num="0136">There are twelve pairs of cranial nerves, namely: the olfactory, optic, oculomotor, trochlear, trigeminal, abducent, facial, acoustic, glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory, and hypoglossal. The nuclei of origin of the motor nerves and the nuclei of termination of the sensory nerves are brought into relationship with the cerebral cortex.</p><p id="p0137" num="0137">Although all of the cranial nerves are of interest in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, by way of example, the vagus nerve is shown in <figref idrefs="f0013">FIGS. 21</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0014">22</figref> in more detail. The vagus nerve is composed of motor and sensory fibers and is of considerable interest in connection with various embodiments of the present invention because it has a relatively extensive distribution than the other cranial nerves and passes through the neck and thorax to the abdomen. The vagus nerves leaves the cranium and is contained in the same sheath of dura mater with the accessory nerve. The vagus nerve passes down the neck within the carotid sheath to the root of the neck. On the right side, the nerve descends by the trachea to the back of the root of the lung, where it spreads out in the posterior pulmonary plexus. From the posterior pulmonary plexus, two cords descend on the esophagus and divide to form the esophageal plexus. The branches combine into a single cord, which runs along the back of the esophagus, enters the abdomen, and is distributed to the posteroinferior surface of the stomach, joining the left side of the celiac plexus, and sending filaments to the lienal plexus.</p><p id="p0138" num="0138">On the left side, the vagus nerve enters the thorax, crosses the left side of the arch of the aorta, and descends behind the root of the left lung, forming the posterior pulmonary plexus. From posterior pulmonary plexus, the vagus<!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --> nerve extends along the esophagus, to the esophageal plexus, and then to the stomach. The vagus nerve branches over the anterosuperior surface of the stomach, the fundus, and the lesser curvature of the stomach.</p><p id="p0139" num="0139">The branches of distribution of the vagus nerve are as follows: the auricular, the superior laryngeal, the recurrent, the superior cardiac, the inferior cardiac, the anterior bronchial, the posterior bronchial, the esophageal, the celiac, and the hepatic. Although all of the branches of the vagus nerve are of interest in accordance with various embodiments of the invention, the gastric branches and the celiac branches are believed to be of notable interest. The gastric branches are distributed to the stomach, where the right vagus nerve forms the posterior gastric plexus on the postero-inferior surface of the stomach and the left vagus nerve forms the anterior gastric plexus on the antero-superior surface of the stomach. The celiac branches are mainly derived from the right vagus nerve, which enter the celiac plexus and supply branches to the pancreas, spleen, kidneys, suprarenal bodies, and intestine.</p><p id="p0140" num="0140">For example, it is believed that disorders associated with bronchial restriction (e.g. asthma, anaphylaxis, etc.) may be better treated through electronic monitoring and/or electro-modulation of the nerves and/or musculature on both sides of<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --> the cervical ganglion (and/or the esophageal plexus). In particular, it is believed that electrical (or chemical) modulation of: (i) one or more of the sympathetic or parasympathetic nerves (discussed above) on the one side of the appropriate plexus; and (ii) one or more of the vagus nerves (also discussed above) on the other side of the appropriate plexus, will improve the therapeutic effect on one or more pathologies.</p><p id="p0141" num="0141">Further reference is now made to <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 23</figref>, which illustrates a process flow of steps or actions, one or more of which may be carried out in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. At action 550, one or more electrodes 500 are implanted on or near at least one of the sympathetic or parasympathetic nerves on one side of a target plexus, such as the celiac plexus. On or more further electrodes 500 are implanted on or near at least one of the cranial nerves entering or leaving the target plexus, or on or near at least one of the muscles enervated by such nerves. The electrodes 500 may be configured as monopolar electrodes, with one electrode 500 per lead, or as multipolar electrodes, with more than one electrode 500 per lead. Preferably, the electrodes 500 are made from a biocompatible conductive material such as platinum-iridium. Any of the known electrodes and leads may be used for this purpose (such as from Medtronic, Model 4300). The electrodes 500 are attached to the electrical leads prior to implantation and navigated to a point near the desired modulation site. The electrical leads and electrodes 500 may be surgically inserted into the patient using a surgical technique, such as laparotomy or laparoscopy, with proximal ends of the leads located near the modulation unit 502 and distal ends located near the desired modulation site.<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --></p><p id="p0142" num="0142">At action 550 simultaneous monitoring of the nerve and/or muscle activity on both sides of the target plexus is performed using the monitor circuit 502. Any of the known equipment operable to receive electrical signaling from the electrodes 500 and to produce graphic and/or tabular data therefrom may be employed. It is desirable that the monitor circuit 502 and/or a computer associated therewith is capable of correlating and/or analyzing the received data to identify abnormalities in the activity of the nerves and/or muscles (action 554) or to identify a desired activity of the nerves and/or muscles (action 556) to achieve the therapeutic effect. For example, if a bronchial disorder (e.g., asthma) were to be treated, the measured activity of the nerves and/or muscles of the patient may indicate an abnormal bronchial restriction profile. If so, a desired profile may be formulated, which if achieved through modulation of the nerves and/or muscles would result in a reduced desire to eat on the part of the patient.</p><p id="p0143" num="0143">At action 558, the modulation unit 502 is preferably programmed to modulate the nerves and/or muscles on one or both sides of the target plexus to achieve the therapeutic result (action 560). The modulation may be achieved through electrical and/or chemical intervention. In the case of electrical modulation, the preferred effect may be to stimulate or reversibly block nervous and or muscular tissue. Use of the term block means disruption, modulation, and/or inhibition of nerve impulse transmission and/or muscular flexion and inhibition. Abnormal regulation can result in an excitation of the pathways or a loss of inhibition of the pathways, with the net result being an increased perception or response. Therapeutic measures can be directed towards either blocking the transmission of signals or stimulating inhibitory feedback. Electrical stimulation permits such stimulation of the target neural structures and, equally importantly, prevents the total destruction of the nervous system.<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> Additionally, electrical stimulation parameters can be adjusted so that benefits are maximized and side effects are minimized.</p><p id="p0144" num="0144">The electrical voltage/current profile of the modulation signal to the electrodes 500 (and thus the nerves/muscles) may be achieved using a pulse generator (such as that discussed above with respect to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>). For example, the modulation unit 502 includes a power source, a processor, a clock, a memory, etc. to produce a pulse train to the electrodes 500. The parameters of the modulation signal are preferably programmable (action 558), such as the frequency, amplitude, duty cycle, pulse width, pulse shape, etc. The modulation unit 502 may be surgically implanted, such as in a subcutaneous pocket of the abdomen or positioned outside the patient. By way of example, the modulation unit 502 may be purchased commercially, such as the Itrel 3 Model 7425 available from Medtronic, Inc.

For example, the electric field and/or electromagnetic field may be induced to down-regulate one or more mitogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and/or one or more enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).</p><p id="p0150" num="0150">In the context of down-regulating VEGF, it is has been discovered that when VEGF is expressed in the lungs of genetically engineered transgenic mice, asthma-like alterations develop. Indeed, the presence (and over expression) of VEGF in mice produced many features of asthma, such as mucous formation, airway fibrosis and asthma-like pulmonary function abnormalities. It has also been previously<!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --> discovered that if VEGF is blocked, the asthma-like manifestations in mouse asthma models is likewise blocked.</p><p id="p0151" num="0151">VEGF is a mitogenic factor that stimulates angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is the process of blood vessel growth (new capillary blood vessels as outgrowths of pre-existing vessels) towards a tissue in need of oxygen or an injured tissue. Angiogenesis can be either harmful or beneficial, for example, in cases such as tumor growth, angiogenesis towards the tumor can supply the tumor with nutrients and support its growth, thus further harming the patient.</p><p id="p0152" num="0152">At the onset of angiogenesis, the quiescent endothelium is destabilized into migratory, proliferative endothelial cells. The angiogenic (activated) endothelium is maintained primarily by positive regulatory molecules. In the absence of such molecules, the endothelium remains in a differentiated, quiescent state that is maintained by negative regulatory molecules, angiogenesis inhibitors. Normally, the negative and positive activities are balanced to maintain the vascular endothelium in quiescence. A shift in the balance of the positive and negative regulatory molecules can alter the differentiated state of the endothelium from the non-angiogenic, quiescent to the angiogenic state. In the switch to pro-angiogenesis, the quiescent endothelial cells are stimulated to migrate toward a chemotactic stimulus, lining up in a tube (sprout) formation. These cells also secrete proteolytic enzymes that degrade the endothelial basement membrane, thus allowing the migrating endothelial cells to extend into the perivascular stroma to begin a new capillary sprout. The angiogenic process is characterized by increased proliferation of endothelial cells to form the extending capillary.</p><p id="p0153" num="0153">In accordance with one or more aspects of the present invention, the mitogenic nature of the VEGF factor is believed<!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --> to be the cause of the bronchial constrictions associated with, for example, asthma, and the resultant over-growth of mucus, fibers, clogging, etc. of the lungs. Thus, down-regulating the VEGF factor in treating the pathology is desirable.</p><p id="p0154" num="0154">There are naturally occurring molecules that serve as negative regulators of angiogenesis, such as angiostatin, a 38-45 kDa cleavage product of plasminogen, containing kringle domains 1-4 (K1-4). Various attempts to block VEGF activity using non-natural means have also been proposed. Inhibitory anti-VEGF receptor antibodies, soluble receptor constructs, antisense strategies, RNA aptamers against VEGF and low molecular weight VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors have all been proposed for use in interfering with VEGF signaling. Monoclonal antibodies against VEGF have been shown to inhibit human tumor xenograft growth and ascites formation in mice. <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="US6342221B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,342,221 to Thorpe, et al</text></patcit>. discloses the use of anti-VEGF antibodies to specifically inhibit VEGF binding to the VEGFR-2 receptor.</p><p id="p0155" num="0155">The induction of electric field and/or electromagnetic field in the lungs to down-regulate VEGF, however, is an entirely different approach to treating bronchial constrictions (e.g., asthma). In accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention, the electric field and/or electromagnetic field may be induced by way of externally disposed apparatus, such as a control unit (including a drive signal generator) and percutaneous field emitters, such as capacitive coupling electrodes and/or inductive coils.

Particular locations for the field emitters are considered well within the knowledge and/or skill of artisans in the field.</p><p id="p0157" num="0157">The fields are induced by applying at least one electrical impulse the field emitters, such as by using the signal generator to apply the drive signals to the field emitters.

In one or more embodiments, the signal generator may be implemented using a power source, a processor, a clock, a memory, etc. to produce the aforementioned waveforms, such as a pulse train. The parameters of the drive signal are preferably programmable, such as the frequency, amplitude, duty cycle, pulse width, pulse shape, etc. In the case of an implanted signal generator, programming may take place before or after implantation. For example, an implanted signal generator may have an external device for communication of settings to the generator. An external communication device may modify the signal generator programming to improve treatment.</p><p id="p0158" num="0158">By way of example, the parameters of the drive signal may include a sine wave profile having a frequency of between about 10 Hz to 100 KHz, a duty cycle of between about 1 to 100 %, and an amplitude of between about 1 mv/cm to about 50 mv/cm. The electric fields and/or electromagnetic fields may be applied for a predetermined period of time, such as between about 0.5 to about 24 hours. The protocol of one or more embodiments of the present invention may include measuring a response of the patient to the applied field(s).

MMPs are naturally-occurring enzymes found in most mammals. Over-expression and activation of MMPs or an imbalance between MMPs and inhibitors of MMPs have been suggested as factors in the pathogenesis of diseases characterized by the breakdown of extracellular matrix or connective tissues. MMPs include one or more of: Stromelysin-1, gelatinase A, fibroblast collagenase (MMP-1), neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8), gelatinase B (MMP-9), stromelysin-2 (MMP-10), stromelysin-3 (MMP-11), matrilysin (MMP-7), collagenase 3 (MMP-13), and TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE).</p><p id="p0161" num="0161">The MMP enzymes have been implicated with a number of diseases which result from breakdown of connective tissue, including such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, periodontitis, multiple sclerosis, gingivitis, corneal epidermal and gastric ulceration, atherosclerosis, neointimal proliferation which leads to restenosis and ischemic heart failure, and tumor metastasis. A major limitation on the use of currently known<!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --> MMP inhibitors is their lack of specificity for any particular enzyme. Recent data has established that specific MMP enzymes are associated with some diseases, with no effect on others. The MMPs are generally categorized based on their substrate specificity, and indeed the collagenase subfamily of MMP-1, MMP-8, and MMP-13 selectively cleave native interstitial collagens, and thus are associated only with diseases linked to such interstitial collagen tissue. This is evidenced by the recent discovery that MMP-13 alone is over expressed in breast carcinoma, while MMP-1 alone is over expressed in capillary carcinoma.</p><p id="p0162" num="0162">In accordance with one or more aspects of the present invention, however, the prevention and treatment of the aforementioned diseases associated with over-expression of MMPs (e.g., asthma) may be effected by inhibiting metalloproteinase enzymes using application of electric fields and/or electromagnetic fields in the patient's lungs.
