The present invention further relates to a specific class of bituminous binder compositions comprising a bitumen component and a block copolymer composition of a high vinyl content diblock copolymer and a high vinyl content block copolymer that is either a linear triblock copolymer, a multiarm coupled block copolymer or a mixture thereof, as well as a bituminous binder concentrate containing the same. The present invention even further relates to a specific class of polymer compositions comprising a high vinyl content diblock copolymer and a high vinyl content block copolymer that is either a linear triblock block copolymer, a multiarm coupled block copolymer or a mixture thereof.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>Background of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Polymer modified asphalt for paving applications and methods for preparing various polymer modified asphalt compositions are well known in the art. Various polymers, including diene elastomers such as polybutadiene, EPDM, EPR and styrenic block copolymers (SBCs) such as styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) and styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) block copolymers, are commonly combined with bitumen to improve the performance of the bitumen. See, for example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5190998A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,190,998</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6150439A"><text>U.S.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Patent No. 6,150,439</text></patcit>. It is well known in the art to utilize styrenic block copolymers to improve the performance of bitumen. The degree to which property improvements are realized depends upon the compatibility of the block copolymer and the bitumen. Highly compatible or compatibilized polymers are most effective in providing property improvements. Over the years, researchers have developed a range of chemical techniques to improve the compatibility of these types of polymers with bitumens. An extensive range of additives have been used for the purpose of "curing" or "crosslinking" the polymers and bitumens thereby rendering the mixture compatible. These additions include sulfur crosslinking agents and sulfur-containing crosslinking agents. Sulfur has long been known to be added to polymer modified bitumens to strengthen and accelerate the polymer-bitumen bonding and curing process. See, for example, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US4145322A"><text>U.S. Patent. No. 4,145,322</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US4242246A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,242,246</text></patcit>. While sulfur itself is relatively safe, the reaction between sulfur, the block copolymers and asphalt generates hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) which is extremely hazardous. Accordingly, from an environmental and safety standpoint, there is a strong desire to eliminate sulfur and sulfur containing crosslinking agents which aid in the curing of bituminous formulations.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In addition, there are improvements associated with the use of styrenic block copolymers which the bitumen paving industry would like to see. These improvements include, but are not limited to, improved mixing, shorter cure times, less separation with incompatible asphalts, and increased efficiency.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Bituminous compositions containing block copolymer compositions having a high vinyl content or block copolymer compositions having a high vinyl content and a low diblock content have been used in an attempt to provide bituminous compositions with better properties. See, for example, <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US4530652A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,530,652</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US5798401A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,798,401</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US5854335A"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,854,335</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US6508875B"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,508,875</text></patcit>. Compositions high in diblock have also been used to prepare bituminous compositions in an effort to provide rapid and easy mixing and to improve dispersion.

More specifically, the present invention provides a process for preparing a polymer modified bituminous binder composition wherein the amount of crosslinking agent is less than 0.01% of the total weight of the polymer modified bituminous binder composition, said process comprising the steps of:
<ol><li>a. heating a bitumen component in a stirred tank to a temperature from about 185°C to about 221 °C;<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></li><li>b. adding from 2 to 36% by weight, based on the weight of the polymer modified bituminous binder composition of a block copolymer composition to the bitumen component while stirring the bitumen component to form a homogeneous mixture of the bitumen component and the block copolymer composition; or

and</li><li>c. continuing to stir the homogeneous mixture while maintaining the temperature from 185°C to 221°C for a period of time from about 4 hours to about 30 hours until a cured polymer modified bituminous binder composition is obtained;<br/>
wherein said block copolymer composition comprises
<ol><li>(i) 100% of a diblock copolymer comprising one block of a monovinylaromatic hydrocarbon and one block of a conjugated diene having a peak molecular weight from 30,000 to 78,000 and a vinyl content from 35 to 80 mol percent based on the number of repeat monomer units in the conjugated diene block, or a mixture of the diblock copolymer and</li><li>(ii) optionally one or more block copolymers comprising at least two blocks of monovinylaromatic hydrocarbon and at least one block of conjugated diene, the block copolymer selected from linear triblock copolymers, multiarm coupled block copolymers, and mixtures thereof, the linear triblock copolymers having a peak molecular weight that is 1.5 to 3.0 times the peak molecular weight of the diblock copolymer and multiarm coupled block copolymers having a peak molecular weight that is 1.5 to 9.0 times the peak molecular weight of the diblock copolymer, and each having a vinyl content from 35 to 80 mol percent based on the number of repeat monomer units in the conjugated diene block, wherein the peak molecular weight of each monovinyl aromatic hydrocarbon block in (i) and (ii) is from 10,000 to 25,000, and</li></ol><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> -->
wherein the ratio of (i) to (ii) is greater than 1:1.</li></ol></li></ol></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention even further relates to a specific class of bituminous binder compositions and bituminous binder concentrates which comprise a bitumen component and a block copolymer composition comprising a high vinyl diblock copolymer and either a high vinyl linear triblock copolymer, a high vinyl multiarm block copolymer, or mixtures thereof, at a ratio of diblock copolymer to linear triblock copolymer, multiarm block copolymer or mixtures thereof, of greater than about 1:1, which copolymers comprise at least one block of a conjugated diene and at least one block of a monovinylaromatic hydrocarbon.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>Detailed Description</u></b></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">The process of the present invention is particularly useful for preparing polymer modified bituminous binder compositions to be used for road/paving applications of all sorts. By using the process of the present invention, which does not require the use of crosslinking agents, it is possible to prepare polymer modified bituminous binder compositions that not only demonstrate properties that are as good, if not better, than the prior art polymer modified bituminous binder compositions which use crosslinking agents, but which are also safer and more environmentally friendly due to the elimination of the crosslinking agents. In addition, the polymer modified bituminous binder compositions of the present invention exhibit improved processability, a decreased cure time, and a reduction in phase separation.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In one embodiment of the present process, a bitumen component is heated in a stirred tank to a temperature from 185°C to 221°C. The bitumen component utilized in the process according to the present invention may be any naturally occurring bitumen or it may be derived from petroleum. In addition, petroleum pitches obtained by a cracking process and coal tar can be used as the bitumen component as well as blends of various bitumen materials. Examples of suitable components include, but are not limited to, distillation or "straight-run bitumens", precipitation bitumens (e.g. propane bitumens), blown bitumens (e.g. catalytically blown<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> bitumen), multigrades, and mixtures thereof. Other suitable bitumen components include, but are not limited to, mixtures of one or more of these bitumens with extenders (fluxes) such as petroleum extracts, e.g. aromatic extracts, distillates or residues, or with oils. Suitable bitumen components (either "straight-run bitumens" or "fluxed bitumens") are those having a penetration of in the range of from about 25 to about 400 units at 25°C; therefore quite hard bitumens of a penetration of from about 60 to about 70 units may be used, but generally a straight run or distilled bitumen having a penetration from about 110 to about 250 units will be the most convenient to use. Both compatible as well as incompatible bitumens may be used.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The success of the process of the present invention is not dependent upon the type of tank (or vessel) utilized to prepare the polymer modified bituminous binder composition of the present invention. Accordingly, any known tank or vessel utilized in the preparation of bitumen compositions can be used provided that such tank or vessel has stirring (agitation) and heating capabilities. As used within the scope of the present invention, the phrase "stirred tank" refers to such tanks and vessels that have stirring (agitation) and heating means. Suitable stirring or agitation includes, but is not limited to, vertical impellers, side-arm impellers and pump around circulation. In terms of carrying out the process, the bitumen component is typically placed in the stirred tank and gradually heated to a temperature from 185°C to 221°C, alternatively from about 196°C to about 218°C, and in still another alternative, from about 198°C to about 216°C. The bitumen component is typically stirred or agitated during this heating phase. While the presence of air is not detrimental to the process of the present invention (i.e., the use of an open air vessel which results in the surface of the mixture coming in contact with air), the intentional introduction of air (as in the case of air curing or blown bitumen) is not necessary to the process of the present invention and is in fact discouraged since such addition would most likely result in the hardening of the bitumen component.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the present embodiment, once the bitumen component has reached the desired temperature, the block copolymer composition (described hereinbelow) is added<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> while the bitumen component is being stirred in order to form a homogeneous mixture of the bitumen component and the block copolymer composition.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The manner and form in which the block copolymer composition is added to the bitumen component is also not critical to the invention. Therefore, block copolymer compositions in the form of powders, porous pellets, and/or crumb may be added all at once or divided into small amounts or batches and added at intervals over a brief period of time (e.g., over a period of 5 to 60 minutes although slightly shorter or longer times are also envisioned). In most instances, the block copolymer composition is added in the form of a porous pellet all at once. Addition of the block copolymer composition over an even longer period of time is also possible but not necessarily desirable from an economic standpoint. During the addition of the block copolymer composition, the mixture is stirred and the temperature to which the bitumen component was heated (from 185°C to 221°C) is maintained.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In many bitumens, the block copolymer composition may dissolve and form a homogeneous blend with simple stirring or other agitation means as noted above. In hot mix asphalts, the bitumen forms a thin film on the aggregate that is present. It is generally accepted that the thickness of this film is on the order of approximately ten microns. Bitumen additives are generally considered to be homogeneous within a blend if they completely disperse in the bitumen on an equal or finer scale than the film of bitumen on aggregate. On the other hand, it is well known that SBS polymers dispersed in bitumen to form a phase structure comprising a polymer rich phase and a bitumen rich phase. It is generally accepted that the scale of this phase structure is on the order of less than approximately ten microns. Accordingly, as used herein with regard to the present invention, the phrase "homogeneous blend" refers to a mixture that comprises the bitumen component and block copolymer composition such that the block copolymer composition is dispersed within the bitumen component on the approximate ten micron scale or less.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In certain instances it may be desirable to accelerate this blending process by passing the mixture through a high shear mill. While a high shear mill may be utilized for the entire process, it is typically utilized for a sufficient period of time for the block copolymer to form a homogeneous blend with the bitumen component. Thereafter the stirring is typically accomplished utilizing low shear blending. Both of these processes are well known in the art and are contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention. Once the block copolymer composition and bitumen are mixed, the stirring continues for a period of time from 4 to 30 hours while the temperature of the mixture is maintained in order to allow for complete curing of the mixture prior to use. In alternative embodiments of the present process, the stirring occurs for periods of time from 4 to 26 hours, even more preferably from 6 to 24 hours. Note that when the block copolymer composition is added over a longer period of time as noted above, the final time for stirring may need to be adjusted accordingly to take into consideration the duration of block copolymer addition.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The quantity of block copolymer composition to be added in the process of the present invention can vary based on whether it is desirable to have a concentrate which will be subsequently diluted ("let down") before further use or whether the amount added provides the final dilution to be used at that time (the final product). Accordingly, the amount to be added will be such that the amount of block copolymer composition added to the bitumen component will be from as little as 2 % by weight to as high as 36 % by weight, based on the weight of the polymer modified bituminous binder composition. As used within the scope of this application, the term "let down", as known to those skilled in the art of bitumen, is an industry term used to reference the dilution or diluting of a concentrate bituminous binder composition to the final concentration that will be used. For example, the process of the present invention can be utilized to produce a bituminous binder concentrate which will contain from about 6% by weight to 36% by weight, preferably from about 9 to 30%, and more preferably from about 12% by weight to about 22% by weight, block copolymer composition (based on the total weight of the polymer modified bitumen binder composition). This bituminous binder concentrate will at some point be diluted with<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> more bitumen to achieve the desired final concentration for final use (typically from 2% by weight to about 6% by weight based on the total weight of the polymer modified bitumen binder composition). The process of diluting a polymer modified bituminous binder concentrate to the desired concentration for use is well known in the art as a cost effective method of utilizing blending equipment. The bituminous binder concentrate of the present invention may be diluted ("let down") to the final concentration during or immediately following the curing process or, in the alternative, it may be stored and /or shipped to a different location where it will later be diluted ("let down") to the final concentration. Accordingly, the process of the present invention may optionally contain further steps in the production of polymer modified bituminous binder compositions. One such embodiment allows for the preparation of a concentrate comprising 6 to 36% by weight of the block copolymer composition followed by the dilution of the concentrate with more bitumen to achieve the desired final concentration (preferably for a final concentration of from about 2% by weight to about 6% by weight). This dilution may occur either during curing (step (c)) or subsequent to curing after step (c) provided that the temperature is maintained for the required time to achieve the cure. During or subsequent to curing, the composition maybe shipped to a different location provided that adequate temperature and agitation are maintained. When diluting during the cure, the composition may be diluted as soon as the concentrate blend becomes homogeneous (at the beginning of step (c) or as the composition cures (during step (c)). This embodiment is advantageous when expensive milling equipment is used so that higher throughput may be achieved. Alternatively, the concentrate composition may be let down after the curing process is complete. This embodiment is advantageous for long term storage as the diluting bitumen may be introduced at a much lower temperature resulting in a final blend at a temperature more suitable for long term storage.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In embodiments where the asphalt composition is to be used at that time or where more dilute concentrations are desired, the block copolymer composition will preferably be present in an amount from 2 % by weight to about 6% by weight,<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> and most preferably from about 2.5 % by weight to about 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the polymer modified bituminous binder composition.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The present invention further provides for an alternative to the above process that differs from the above process in that the bitumen is first heated to a molten state, the block copolymer composition is added, and then the temperature is raised to the level for curing, from 185°C to 221°C. Accordingly, the present alternative only includes changes in the process steps themselves, not within the types of materials utilized (e.g., bitumen and block copolymer composition) or means of accomplishing the steps (e.g., type of equipment utilized). More specifically, in this alternative, the bitumen component, as described hereinbefore, is heated in a stirred tank until the bitumen component is in a molten state. As used herein, the phrase "molten state" refers to the point at which the bitumen component becomes liquid. Those skilled in the art will recognize that most bitumens reach a "molten state" within the temperature range of from about 87°C to about 121°C, more specifically from about 93°C to about 105°C. During this phase, the bitumen component is optionally stirred. Once the bitumen component reaches a molten state, the block copolymer composition is added in the manner described hereinbefore. At this point, if the mixture is not already being stirred, active stirring may begin although stirring is not necessary. After the block copolymer composition is added, the temperature is raised to from about 185°C to about 221°C, alternatively from about 196°C to about 218°C, and in still another alternative, from about 198°C to about 216°C (as described hereinbefore) while actively stirring the bitumen component and block copolymer composition in order to form a homogeneous mixture of the two components. This mixture will continue to be stirred at the noted temperature for a total of from 4 hours to 30 hours until a cured polymer modified bituminous binder composition is obtained. In the alternative, the homogeneous mixture will be further let down as described hereinbefore either during or after the curing of the polymer modified bituminous binder composition.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Through the use of compositions having high vinyl content copolymers and a high quantity of diblock copolymer, it is possible to eliminate the use of crosslinking<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> agents in the preparation of polymer modified bitumen. Accordingly, with the present invention it is possible to produce a polymer modified bituminous binder composition or a bituminous binder concentrate in the substantial absence of crosslinking agents. As used herein, the phrase "in the substantial absence of crosslinking agents" means that the addition of crosslinking or curing agents during the preparation process is not required. Furthermore, with regard to the bituminous binder composition and the bituminous binder concentrate the phrase "substantially free of crosslinking agents" means that no substantial amount of crosslinking agent is present in the product. However, traces of such crosslinking or curing agents may be present due to the active addition of insubstantial amounts of crosslinking or curing agent or residual amounts from another source such as with the addition of ground rubber and/or what naturally occurs in the bitumen. Such an amount would be considered to be in an insubstantial amount provided that it does not significantly alter the final properties of the bituminous binder composition, typically less than 0.01 % of the total weight of the polymer modified bituminous binder composition or bituminous binder concentrate. Without wishing to be bound by the following statements, it is believed that when block copolymers having a specific diblock content and a specific vinyl content are utilized in a process for preparing polymer modified asphalts at a temperature from 185°C to 221°C, it is possible to achieve self-controlling thermal crosslinking (cure) that normally requires the use of crosslinking agents to achieve this cure. The resulting blend is storage stable (it does not separate), and the cure is faster than observed with conventional systems.

These tests are commonly used to evaluate Polymer Modified Bitumens and are well known to those skilled in the art. The mixtures were also graded according to the Performance Grade (PG) protocol as set forth in ASTM D6373 and AASHTO M320. While this protocol is somewhat complex, it is commonly practiced in the United States and elsewhere in the world and is well known to those skilled in the art. The PG protocol grades bituminous binders into classes of high and low temperature with the classes being six degrees Celsius apart. Thus, a binder may grade as PG 64-28 or PG 70-22 so that the binder will be expected to perform within a pavement temperature range of -28° C to +64° C or -22° C to +70° C respectively. Note that both of these grades cover a temperature range of 92° C. For comparative purposes it is common practice for researchers to interpolate the numerous parameters in the protocol to determine "exact" PG grades. Thus two binders, A and B, may both grade as PG 64-28. However, if binder A has an exact grade of 68.3-31.1 and binder B has an exact grade of 65.1-29.1, binder A would be deemed a superior material as it covers a broader temperature range than<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> binder B, 99.4° C versus 94.1 ° C. For the purposes of this invention, the PG exact grade of the bituminous binder compositions will be reported, as well as the temperature range. Classical properties are shown in Table 5. PG exact grades and temperature ranges are shown in Table 6.

Example 1 is comparative example that is a typical conventional blend of a commercial linear SBS polymer (Comparative Polymer C3) at 4% concentration in Bitumen 1. The properties of the blend are good but the separation potential is high with a softening point difference of 32° C. This is considered unacceptable by many specifying agencies.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Example 2 is exemplary of the present invention (using Inventive Polymer 2).

In Example 3, a commercial high diblock SBS polymer (Comparative Polymer C1) was blended in a conventional process, then crosslinked with a sulfur containing agent. The properties and separation were good, but sulfur based crosslinking was required. In Examples 4 and 5 (comparative examples made using Comparative Polymer C1) no sulfur crosslinking was used. With or without curing there was adequate low separation but less than superior performance properties were found. Note that Examples 4 and 5 were run at a different time with comparable Canadian bitumen (a different batch)).</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Example 6 demonstrated that a second polymer of the invention (Inventive Polymer 3) with higher coupling still gives good properties and adequately low separation in the Canadian bitumen.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Example 7 is a comparative example that demonstrated that a comparative polymer with a very high coupling efficiency (90%) and a high vinyl content (Comparative Polymer C2) works in this bitumen though the viscosity is higher thereby limiting the concentration range for this comparative polymer.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Examples 8 through 10 (examples of the present invention utilizing Inventive Polymers 1, 2 and 3, respectively) and Example 11 (a comparative example utilizing Comparative Polymer C2) examined polymers of the present invention and the prior art in the process of the present invention using a Far East waxy paraffinic bitumen (Bitumen 2) that is considered the most challenging bitumen to modify with SBS polymers. Inventive Polymer 2 with high vinyl content (58.5 mol %) and low coupling (20.9%), example 9, was the only polymer that gave satisfactory results. Inventive Polymer 1 with a lower vinyl content (38.9 mol %) and low coupling (19.6%), example 8, could be processed but still gave a large degree of separation, 22° C. Inventive Polymer 3 with high vinyl content (63.7 mol %) and a higher coupling (29%), example 10, and Comparative Polymer C2, a high vinyl radial polymer (57 mol %) with high<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> coupling (90%), example 11, gelled during the PG aging protocol so that testing could not be completed. These results demonstrated that sufficiently high vinyl content and sufficiently low coupling are both required for optimum results in difficult bitumens.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Examples 12 through 15 demonstrated that the present invention, as well as the prior art, cannot address all bitumens that are difficult to modify. Although Inventive Polymers 1 and 2 were better than Inventive Polymer 3 and Comparative Polymer C2, all four gelled during the PG aging protocol so testing could not be completed. This was thought to be due to the poor aging characteristics of European bitumen.</p><heading id="h0013"><u>Mixing Dissolution Rate / Concentration Effects</u></heading><p id="p0067" num="0067">To demonstrate ease of mixing, mixing time studies were performed on Comparative Polymers C1, C2 and C3, and Inventive Polymer 2a of the present invention. Note that Inventive Polymer 2a is similar to Inventive Polymer 2 used in Examples 2, 3, 9 and 12. However, Inventive Polymer 2a was produced as a porous pellet with similar morphology and density to the Comparative Polymers. Density and morphology affect mixing time so this distinction is important. In the mixing time studies, the polymer pellets of the Comparative Polymers C1, C2 and C3 were blended into bitumen and the rotational viscosity was constantly measured. After the viscosity plateaus the points at which the viscosity reached 90%, 95% and 99% of the final value were noted. These times are reported in Table 7 below. Because if its high vinyl content polymer Comparative Polymer C2 dissolved faster than polymer Comparative Polymer C3 despite its higher molecular weight. Comparative Polymer C1 dissolved faster than either Comparative Polymer C2 or Comparative Polymer C3 because of its low coupling efficiency (high diblock content). Inventive Polymer 2a combines high vinyl content and low coupling efficiency and gives comparable mixing times to the previous best. When mixed at 180°C, Inventive Polymer 2a dissolved completely in less than one hour.<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> -->
