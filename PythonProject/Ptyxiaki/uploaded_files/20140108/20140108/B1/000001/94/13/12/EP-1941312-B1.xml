In particular, but not exclusively, it relates to an optical fibre structure for coupling the output of a high-power semi-conductor having a linear emitting region into an optical fibre with high coupling efficiency and brightness.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">High-power semi-conductor laser diodes are often used for pumping fibre lasers. In these applications, the output from the fibre laser is applied to a cladding layer of the fibre which has Bragg gratings formed in its core and the energy from the laser diodes is used as pumping energy to cause a lasing effect within the active fibre.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A means is therefore required for coupling the output of these high-power semi-conductor laser diodes into the cladding of the optical fibres.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">High-power semi-conductor laser diodes suitable for such laser pumping often have linear emitting regions. Most commonly, these have dimensions of approximately 1 x 100 µm. The output of such an emitter can be coupled into a multi-mode optical fibre with a core diameter slightly larger than the emitter width, typically around 105 µm, using a simple fast axis collimation scheme. It is desirable to use emitters with larger output width, typically as large as 1,000 µm, as these can produce more power at a lower cost per watt. However, if the output of such lasers is coupled into a circular optical fibre using a straightforward fast axis collimation scheme, then the diameter of the optical fibre core<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> must be very large (ie greater than 1000 µm) and therefore the brightness (or more correctly radiance) of the fibre coupled output may be too low to be useful as a fibre laser pump source.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Various techniques have been developed for circularising the output of linear semi-conductor laser sources and coupling this into an optical fibre with much smaller diameter than the emitter width. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4688884A"><text>US 4,688,884</text></patcit> discloses a fibre optical coupling system for phased array semi-conductor lasers. This system is for coupling, the output from an array of semi-conductor lasers to an optical fibre and has a 'squashed' input end which has a generally elliptical, cross-section. The output end is generally circular for coupling to a circular fibre.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The fibre coupler shown in this document however is squashed to produce its input end. Such squashing may cause difficulties during manufacture such as damage the coupler or may lead to unreliable or unquantifiable transmission rates or to non-repeatability amongst different couplers. The coupling efficiency with this coupler may be around 77 to 80% but is generally less than optimal for a given configuration.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention arose in an attempt to provide an improved optical coupler and to increase coupling efficiency.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the present invention there is provided an optical fibre coupling structure comprising an optical fibre having an elongate input surface and shaped so that the diameter of the core of the fibre reduces in one dimension away from the input while<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> increasing in the other dimension away from the input to form respective convergent and divergent surfaces, towards an output which is more circular than the input;<br/>
wherein the optical fibre tapers outward in a direction towards the input and has a wedge formed onto the tapered section.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The optical fibre most preferably has a core which is non-circular in cross-section so as to couple optical rays input at the input end between horizontal and vertical planes.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The invention further provides a method of forming an optical fibre coupling structure comprising tapering an optical fibre to a required output diameter and forming a wedge onto the tapered section by removal of material so as to form an elongate input at the end of the wedge portion.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a further aspect, there is provided a method of coupling a laser beam into an output optical fibre, using a coupling structure.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

The laser diode may be used to provide pumping energy through a fibre 3 to a cladding pumped optical fibre laser 3. The coupling structure 1 is mounted between the laser diode 2 and output fibre 3. The structure 1 comprises a large diameter optical fibre that is tapered and has a low angle wedge 4 machined or polish onto the tapered section 5. As is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figures 1 to 5</figref>, the fibre is tapered so that its diameter in one direction (the horizontal direction) is greatest at its input and reduces generally continuously along the tapered section 5. Similarly, the wedge section is formed so that the diameter in the other direction is at a minimum at the end 6 and diverges outwards away from the input along section 5. The input surface is therefore generally rectangular but may have other shapes provided it has one major dimension (the horizontal dimension in this case) which is substantially greater than the other major dimensions.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The optical fibre includes a central core 7 and at least one cladding layer 8. Optical radiation is transmitted within the fibre by virtue of total internal reflection at the core-cladding interface. ,</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Radiation is emitted from the laser diode or other emitter 2 via a fast access collimator 9 into the input face 6 of the coupler. In the coupler, the generally rectangular or otherwise elongate output of the linear emitter is circularised and coupled into an output optical fibre 3 with core diameter smaller than the emitter width.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the coupler most preferably has a non-circular core. Advantageously, it is faceted and may be hexagonal as shown by the core 7 shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> or may be another polygonal shape having flat sides or have other non-circular configurations. The reason for this will be described further below.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2 and 3</figref> show the basic steps in manufacturing the coupler. Firstly, a relatively large diameter optical fibre (typically having a diameter which is to represent the largest diameter of input face 6 of the coupler after manufacture) is tapered by heating and drawing to the required output diameter. The fibre has a non-circular core. This step is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> where the fibre reduces in diameter from its input end 6 towards its output end. In one example, the input diameter may be about 800 µm and the output diameter about 400 µm.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Secondly, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>, a wedge 9 is formed on the tapered section. This is<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> formed by an operation which removes material, such as a machining or planing operation. It is preferably performed by optical polishing but may be performed by other methods. The wedge may be formed on one or both sides of the fibre.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The coupler may terminate at the largest diameter part 10 of the wedge portion or may continue, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2 and 3</figref>, with a generally cylindrical optical fibre section 11 which can then be connected to an output fibre 3.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>, and also more clearly in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>, the wedge is preferably formed so that it exposes the core 7 directly to the air at at least the narrower end of the wedge shown by portion 12 in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As is well-known, optical transmission in an optical fibre occurs by total internal reflection of light at the core/cladding interface provided at the incident angle of the radiation is less than the critical angle of that interface. In the portion of the coupler in which the core is exposed, the interface is a core-air interface and internal reflection also occurs at this interface provided the critical angle relevant to this interface is not exceeded.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Basically, the structure of the coupler is one in which the diameter of the fibre reduces in one dimension away from the input while increasing in the other dimension away from the input. Thus, the tapering causes a reduction in the horizontal dimension (in the disposition shown in the figures) whilst the wedging causes an increase in the vertical dimension, both in the direction away from the input.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As is shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 6</figref>, an optical ray which is incident upon a first wall S1 of a convergent structure at an angle □<sub>1</sub> which is less than the critical angle is reflected off this surface at similar angle □<sub>1</sub>. It then impinges upon opposite wall S2 but at an increased angle □<sub>2</sub>. This angle might again be less than the critical angle so that ray is reflected back to surface S1. At surface S1 this time, because S1 and S2 are convergent, the angle of incidence will again be greater and this might be greater than the critical angle. Therefore, the ray is not internally reflected and may pass out of the fibre, as shown at 13.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">To overcome this, if the coupler is divergent in the other dimension, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 7</figref>, then provided the optical rays are caused to couple between, say, the horizontal and vertical planes, then rays alternately reflecting from the top and side surfaces will alternately encounter converging and diverging surfaces. Thus, the effect, outlined with respect to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 6</figref>, will be cancelled out if after each time a ray contacts one of the (convergent) surfaces S1 or S2 it then contacts one of the (divergent) surfaces S3 and S4. This ensures that any ray input at the correct angle to the input face 6 of the coupler will continue to transmit through the fibre to the output 10 and hence onwards through the rest of the fibre.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Instead of the term "critical angle" the term "numeral aperture" is often used in relation to optical fibres so that if an incident angle exceeds the numeral aperture of the optical fibre it ceases to be guided by it and is transmitted outwards through the side of the fibre, as shown at 13.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The optical fibre is caused to have a core which is non-circular to provide better coupling between the convergent and divergent surfaces of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 6 and 7</figref>, for example. If the core were circular, any light ray which enters in a horizontal disposition for example would simply be reflected horizontally each time and therefore would ultimately probably cease to be transmitted, as described above. If this ray on the other hand encounters a surface which is not perpendicular to its direction of travel then the ray will be reflected at a non-horizontal angle and thus will ultimately impinge upon both generally divergent and generally convergent surfaces, thus ensuring that the ray continues to be transmitted.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A hexagonal core geometry, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, has been found to be particularly efficient in this regard but any other core geometry which is non-circular may also be used. The geometry is preferably a faceted one comprising a polygonal shape with three of more straight sides. It may be, for example, pentagonal, hexagonal or any other polygonal shape. Alternatively, one or more of the surfaces of the core may be arcuate or any other non-circular configuration may be used for different configurations.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Effectively, the hexagonal or other non-circular orientation increases the coupling of rays between the horizontal and vertical plane and thus increases performance. This can enable the length of the taper to be reduced, making the structure easier to manufacture.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 8</figref> shows a plot of taper length in millimetres (ie length of the wedge portion) against coupling efficiency calculated for three different samples. These are respectively for a hexagonal core of numerical aperture 0.22, a hexagonal core of numerical aperture<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> 0.15 and for a circular core of numerical aperture 0.22. The emitter dimensions are 750 x 1 µm. The input core width is 800 µm wide and the output optical fibre core diameter is 400 µm.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The results show that in general a longer taper length results in higher coupling efficiency. However, a longer tapered section can be more difficult to manufacture and it is therefore desirable to minimise the length of the tapered section. In the example shown, the highest coupling efficiency is seen to be around 90% and this is achieved for a 10 mm taper with a hexagonal core numerical aperture of 0.22. The results show that to obtain the highest coupling efficiency, a hexagonal or other faceted or non-circular core is preferable to a circular section core.
