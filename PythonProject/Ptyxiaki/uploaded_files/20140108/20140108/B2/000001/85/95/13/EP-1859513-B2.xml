mxw-id="PDES63961276" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="1"> --><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to connectors, and more particularly to a lever mated connector assembly having a connector position assurance ("CPA") device for preventing movement of the connector assembly lever out of a locked position.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In certain applications, electrical connectors must be securely mated to one another to prevent disconnection of the electrical signals routed through the connector conductors. For example, in automotive applications wherein electrical signals are routed to safety equipment such as air bag deployment systems or other systems relating to the operational or safety features of the vehicle, disconnection of the electrical signals as a result of accident, negligence, or operating conditions such as vibration, etc. may result in undesirable consequences. Thus, some electrical connectors are coupled to connector assemblies that mechanically lock the electrical connectors in mating engagement with one another.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Some conventional connector assemblies include a housing that houses an electrical connector, a wire guide attached to the housing and enclosing the electrical connector, and a lever that couples the housing to a header housing a mating electrical connector. When in a locked position, the lever prevents disconnection of the housing from the header, which prevents disconnection of the mated electrical connectors. Some levers are further configured to latch into engagement with the wire guide when the lever is in the locked position to ensure that the lever is not unintentionally moved out of the locked position. However, the problem is that if sufficient force is applied to such levers, they may disengage from the wire guide and permit disconnection of the mated electrical connectors.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A prior art connector assembly (on which the preamble of claim 1 is based) is disclosed in patent <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20040192090A"><text>US 2004/0192090</text></patcit>. The assembly includes a wire guide and a mate assist lever which is moveable between unlocked and locked positions. The lever includes a cross portion which is engageable with a latch tab of the wire guide. The lever also has mounted thereon a connector position assurance member which is slidable into engagement with a bridge member of the wire guide which bridge member is separate from the latch tab.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The solution to the problem is provided by a lever mated connector assembly according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a perspective view of one embodiment of a lever mated connector assembly according to the present invention depicting the lever in an unlocked position;</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref> are perspective views of a wire guide of the lever mated connector assembly of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>;</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4A</figref> is a rear elevation view of the wire guide of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>;</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4B</figref> is a partially fragmented, cross-sectional view taken substantially along line 4B-4B of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4A</figref>;</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">6</figref> are perspective views of a CPA device of the lever mated connector assembly of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>;</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0007">Figures 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">8</figref> are perspective views of a lever of the lever mated connector assembly of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>;</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 9A</figref> is a top plan view of the lever of <figref idrefs="f0007">Figures 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">8</figref>;</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 9B</figref> is a rear elevation view of the lever of <figref idrefs="f0007">Figures 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">8</figref>;</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 9C</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken substantially along line 9C-9C of <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref>;</p><p id="p0016" num="0016"><figref idrefs="f0010">Figure 10</figref> is a perspective view of a lever mated connector assembly according to the present invention, depicting the lever in a locked position;</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0011">Figure 11</figref> is a perspective view similar to <figref idrefs="f0010">Figure 10</figref>, depicting the CPA device in a locked position; and</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0012">Figure 12</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken substantially along line 12-12 of <figref idrefs="f0011">Figure 11</figref>.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views.

Rather, the embodiments are chosen and described so that others skilled in the art may utilize their teachings.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, one embodiment of a lever mated connector assembly to the present invention having a position assurance device configured for mating with a lever is shown. It should be understood that the connector assembly described herein may be suitable for many applications wherein secure mating between electrical contacts is desirable, such as for vehicle airbag applications. In general, the connector assembly<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> includes a wire guide 10, a CPA device 12 coupled to wire guide 10, and a lever 14 coupled to a housing 16 and configured for cooperation with wire guide 10 and CPA device 12. As is further described below, wire guide 10 mates with housing 16, and lever 14 is used to mate the connector assembly with a header 17.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">Figures 1 through 4B</figref>, wire guide 10 generally includes a pair of side walls 18, 20, a rear wall 22, and an upper wall 24, together forming an interior space 26. Side wall 18 includes a rear protrusion 28 and a tab 30 defined on side wall 18 by a pair of notches 32, 34 that permit tab 30 to deflect slightly inwardly toward interior space 26 upon mating of wire guide 10 with housing 16 as is further described below. Tab 30 includes a cam surface 36 and a shoulder 38 for engaging housing 16. Side wall 20 similarly includes a rear protrusion 40 and a tab 42 defined by a pair of notches 44, 46 and including a cam surface 43 and a shoulder 45.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Upper wall 24 generally includes a CPA device receiving portion 48, a lever retaining portion 50, and a wire shroud 52. CPA device receiving portion 48 includes a substantially flat wall 54 including a retaining wedge 56 defined by a cut-out 58. Wedge 56 includes a cam surface 60, an upper surface 62, and a retaining surface 64, and flexibly extends from wall 54 such that pressure on cam surface 60 causes wedge 56 to flex inwardly toward interior space 26. One edge 66 (<figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4A</figref>) of wall 54 cooperates with side wall 18 and a ridge 68 extending inwardly from side wall 18 toward side wall 20 to form a channel 70 for receiving CPA device 12 as is further described below. Similarly, an opposite edge 72 (<figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4A</figref>) of wall 54 cooperates with side wall 20 and a ridge 74 extending inwardly from side wall 20 toward side wall 18 to form a channel 76 for receiving CPA device 12. A distal edge 78 of wall 54 forms an opening 80 with side walls 18, 20 and lever retaining portion 50 for receiving a portion of CPA device 12 as is further described below.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Lever retaining portion 50 includes a pair of flats 82, 84 and a cantilever latch 86 positioned between flats 82, 84 and defined by a pair of cut-outs 88, 90. Latch 86 includes a cam surface 92, an upper surface 94, and a retaining surface 96. A pair of recesses 98, 100 (only recess 98 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4B</figref>) are formed in lever retaining portion 50 to receive retaining wedges extending from CPA device 12 as is further described below. A distal edge 102 of lever retaining portion 50 transitions to wire shroud 52.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Wire shroud 52 includes a pair of side walls 103, 104 and an upper wall 106, which together form an opening 108 for receiving wires (not shown). A tab 110 is formed on upper wall 106, and similar tabs 112, 114 are formed on wire shroud side walls 102, 104, respectively, to permit the user to attach a cable tie or wire clamp.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">6</figref>, CPA device 12 generally includes a body 116 having a pair of arms 118, 120. Body 116 includes a base portion 122 and an extension 123. Base portion 122 includes an upper wall 124, a pair of side walls 126, 128, a rear wall 130, and a lower wall 132, which together define an interior space 134. Lower wall 132 extends laterally from side walls 126, 128 to form rails 131, 133 which are respectively received by channels 70, 68 (<figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4B</figref>) of CPA device receiving portion 48 as is further described below. Upper wall 124 includes a push ridge 135 that projects upwardly relative to interior space 134 and is configured to permit a user to move CPA device 12 between a locked position and an unlocked position as is further described below.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As should be apparent from the drawings, extension 123 of body 116 is substantially separated from arms 118, 120 by a pair of cut-outs 136, 138. As such, arms 118, 120 may flex slightly relative to body 116. Extension 123 includes a pair of side walls 142, 144, an upper surface 146, and a lower surface 148. Extending between side walls 142, 144 of extension 123 adjacent lower surface 148 is a retaining wall 150 including a retaining surface 152, a transition surface 154, and a cam surface 156. As best shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>, opposite cam surface 156 of lower surface 148 is a recess 158 having a locking surface 160 formed on upper surface 146 of extension 123. As is further described below, locking surface 160 cooperates with lever retaining portion 50 to prevent movement of lever 14 out of its locked position.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Arm 118 of CPA device 12 includes a retaining wedge 162 having a cam surface 164 and a forward surface 166. Similarly, arm 120 includes a retaining wedge 168 having a cam surface 170 and a forward surface 172.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0007">7</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0008">8</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">9A-C</figref>, lever 14 generally includes a handle 161 and a pair of support arms 163, 165 extending substantially perpendicularly from handle 161. Handle 161 includes a forward edge 167, a rearward edge 169, an upper surface 171, and a lower surface 173. A pair of cams 174, 176 extend downwardly from lower surface 173 to engage and deflect CPA device arms 120, 118, respectively, when lever 14 is in its locked position as is further described below. Lower surface 173 further includes a catch 178 having a cam surface 180 (<figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 9C</figref>) and a retaining surface 182 for cooperating with retaining surface 96 of cantilever latch 86 to retain lever 14 in its locked position as is further described below. Support arm 163 of lever 14 includes an inwardly projecting lug 184 that is received by a recess (not shown) formed in housing 16. Support arm 165 also includes an inwardly projecting lug 186 that is received by a recess (not shown) formed in housing 16. Lugs 184, 186 oppose one another and are movably received by their respective recesses, thereby permitting rotational movement of latch 14 between the unlocked position of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> and the locked position of <figref idrefs="f0010 f0011 f0012">Figures 10 through 12</figref>.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Support arm 163 further includes a curved gear 185, and support arm 163 includes a similar, opposed gear 187. As is further described below, gears 185, 187 engage corresponding grooves (not shown) formed in header 17 to draw the connector assembly (i.e., wire guide 10, CPA device 12, lever 14, and housing 16) toward header 17 to provide the high mating force needed<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> to facilitate electrical connection between a connector component disposed in housing 16 and a mating connector component disposed in header 17.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">During assembly, the user installs contacts in an electrical connector 189 (<figref idrefs="f0012">Figure 12</figref>) fitted in housing 16. After connector 189 is wired, the user installs wire guide 10 onto housing 16. More specifically, rear protrusions 28, 40 of wire guide side walls 18, 20 are positioned within corresponding openings 191, 193 formed in housing 16 and wire guide 10 is pivoted downwardly toward housing 16. Cam surfaces 36, 43 of wire guide tabs 30, 42, respectively engage upper edges 188, 200 of housing 16, thereby causing tabs 30, 42 to flex inwardly toward one another. As wire guide 10 is pivoted to its mated position, tabs 30, 42 register with openings 202, 204 formed in housing 16 and flex outwardly into the openings. Shoulders 38, 45 of tabs 30, 42 engage respective upper edges 206, 208 (not shown) of housing openings 202, 204 to prevent wire guide 10 from being pivoted out of its mated position. As should be apparent from the foregoing, a user may apply inward pressure to tabs 30, 42 to cause tabs 30, 42 to flex inwardly such that shoulders 38, 45 clear upper edges 206, 208, thereby permitting wire guide 10 to be pivoted out of its mated position. During installation of wire guide 10, the wires connected to electrical connector 189 are routed out of wire guide 10 through opening 108 of wire shroud 52.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Lever 14 is installed by flexing support arms 162, 164 slightly away from one another and positioning lugs 184, 186 into respective recesses (not shown) formed in housing 16. When support arms 162, 164 are released, lugs 184, 186 move into the recesses of housing 16 and gears 185, 187 of support arms 162, 164 mate with corresponding grooves (not shown) formed in header 17.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">CPA device 12 may be fitted onto wire guide 10 before wire guide 10 is mated with housing 16 or after. In either case, CPA device 12 is slid into CPA device receiving portion 48 of wire guide 10. More specifically, base portion 122 of CPA device 12 is slid over flat wall 54 of CPA device receiving portion 48 such that rails 131, 133 of lower wall 132 move into respective channels 70, 76 of CPA device receiving portion 48 and arms 118, 120 of CPA device 12 move toward opening 80 of wire guide 10.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As the user applies pressure to push ridge 135 to move CPA device 12 farther into CPA device receiving portion 48, cam surface 156 of retaining wall 150 engages retaining wedge 56 of flat wall 54, causing retaining wedge 56 to flex downwardly. After retaining wall 150 moves over retaining wedge 56, retaining wedge 56 returns to its initial position and is disposed partially within interior space 134 of CPA body 116. As such, retaining surface 64 of wedge 56 prevents reverse movement of CPA device 12 beyond the position wherein retaining surface 152 of retaining wall 150 engages retaining surface 64. When in this first, unlocked position (shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0010">10</figref>), retaining wedges 162, 168 formed at the ends of CPA device arms 118, 120 engage lever retaining portion 50 of wire guide 10. In particular, forward surfaces 166, 172 of retaining wedges 162, 168 engage the lower edges of flats 82, 84, thereby preventing further forward movement of CPA device 12 into opening 80.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Finally, the connector assembly is fitted onto header 17. More specifically, housing 16 is placed over header 17 such that electrical connector 189 is in alignment with a mating connector disposed within header 17, but firm electrical connection between the connector components is not yet established. This configuration is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>. Next, the user applies pressure to handle 161 of lever 14 to pivot lever 14 in the direction of arrow 210 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> out of its unlocked position. This movement of lever 14 causes support arms 163, 165 to pivot about lugs 184, 186 within the recesses (not shown) formed in housing 16. The pivotal movement of lever 14 further causes gears 185, 187 of support arms 163, 165 to move within corresponding grooves (not shown) formed in header 17. As gears 185, 187 move within the grooves, lever 14 draws housing 16 (and wire guide 10) toward header 17, thereby causing electrical connector 189 in housing 16 to securely mate with the connector disposed in header 17.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">As lever 14 approaches its locked position as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Figure 10</figref>, cam surface 180 of catch 178 (<figref idrefs="f0009">Figures 9B and 9C</figref>) engages cam surface 92 of cantilever latch 86 (<figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>) formed on lever retaining portion 50 of wire guide 10. As lever 14 is rotated farther, catch 178 causes cantilever latch 86 to deflect downwardly toward interior space 26 as catch 178 passes over cantilever latch 86. When lever 14 reaches its locked position and catch 178 has passed completely over cantilever latch 86, cantilever latch 86 returns to its initial position. As such, lever 14 is inhibited from being moved out of its locked position because reverse rotation of lever 14 causes retaining surface 182 of catch 178 to engage retaining surface 96 of cantilever latch 86. This constitutes a first mechanical lock of lever 14 in its locked position.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Also, when lever 14 is in its locked position, cams 174, 176 of lever 14 engage cam surfaces 164, 170 of retaining wedges 162, 168 formed at the ends of CPA device arms 118, 120, respectively. This engagement causes arms 118, 120 to flex downwardly, such that forward surfaces 166, 172 of retaining wedges 162, 168 clear the lower edges of flats 82, 84 of lever retaining portion 50. As such, CPA device 12 may be moved farther forward into opening 80 as described below.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">To place CPA device 14 into its second, locked position, the user applies pressure to push ridge 135 and moves CPA device 14 farther into opening 80 in the direction of arrow 212 shown in <figref idrefs="f0011">Figure 11</figref>. As best shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0012">12</figref>, when CPA device 14 reaches its locked position, recess 158 of CPA device extension 123 receives a portion of cantilever latch 86. As such, locking surface 160 of recess 158 prevents downward deflection of cantilever latch 86, thereby inhibiting lever 14 from being moved out of its locked position. This constitutes<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> a second mechanical lock of lever 14 in its locked position.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Additionally, movement of CPA device 14 into its locked position causes retaining wedges 162, 168 of CPA device arms 118, 120 to move under the lower edges of flats 82, 84 and then into recesses 98, 100 (only recess 98 is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4B</figref>) of lever retaining portion 50 as arms 118, 120 flex upwardly toward their original positions. As retaining wedges 162, 168 are biased into recesses 98, 100, retaining wedges 162, 168 inhibit rearward movement of CPA device 14 out of its locked position.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">To move lever 14 back to its unlocked position, the user applies pressure to push ridge 135 of CPA device 14 to move CPA device 14 in a reverse direction, toward rear wall 22 of wire guide 10. Sufficient force causes cam surfaces 164, 170 of retaining wedges 162, 168 to move out of recesses 98, 100 and under the lower edges of flats 82, 84. This reverse movement is limited as retaining surface 152 of retaining wall 150 engages retaining surface 64 of retaining wedge 56 of CPA device receiving portion 48 when CPA device 14 reaches its first, unlocked position.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Next, the user applies downward pressure to cantilever latch 86 to permit retaining surface 182 of lever catch 178 to clear retaining surface 96 of cantilever latch 86. It should be understood that downward deflection of cantilever latch 86 is no longer prevented, as locking surface 160 of CPA device recess 158 is no longer positioned below cantilever latch 86. As the user applies downward pressure to cantilever latch 86, the user simultaneously rotates lever 14 counter-clockwise as viewed in the figures, out of its locked position.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">While this invention has been described as having an exemplary design, the present invention may be further modified within the scope of the claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56986568" lang="DE" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Steckverbinder-Baugruppe, die eine Drahtführung (10), einen Hebel (14), wobei der Hebel zwischen einer entriegelten Stellung und einer verriegelten Stellung bewegt werden kann, und eine CPA-Einrichtung (12) umfasst:
