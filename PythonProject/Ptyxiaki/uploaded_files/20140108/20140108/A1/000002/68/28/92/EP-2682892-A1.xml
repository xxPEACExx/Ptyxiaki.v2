These requests include access to network resources, requests for specific information, access to various APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and many other needs. This architecture is generally known as client-server, where a first (requesting) application acting as a client sends a request to a second (receiving) application acting as a server. The receiving application (known as the server), needs to authenticate the requesting application, to validate that the request should be granted. Specifically, the receiving application needs to validate that the request is legitimate, i.e. originated in the permitted application, and was not sent by an impersonator (human or application user purporting to be the legitimate application).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Application authentication is known as a topic of interest in the computer field. Application authentication is required both when the application acts on behalf of a user (for example, a browser<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> application accessing a web server) and when the application acts independently (for example, when an application accesses a database to perform a scheduled task) or a batch process. There are also cases when the application acts on behalf of a user, while also authenticating to a network resource with dedicated credentials, separate from those used by the user (for example, a user connects through an application, which also accesses a database to retrieve some information). Conventionally, the problem of authentication is addressed by a combination of the following conventional techniques:
<ol><li>1. In a first technique, credentials are presented by the application - such as passwords, PKI (Private Key Infrastructure) certificates, or other credentials.</li><li>2. In a second technique, a provider provides the application with the needed credentials, which are then used to access the network resources.</li><li>3. In a third technique, NAC (Network Access Control) controls access to the network and the network resources by identifying the machine (physical and operating system, also referred to as "the environment") on which the application is running. NAC is primarily designed for end user access and not for application-to-application controls.</li></ol></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">These conventional techniques are lacking in several aspects. In the first technique, credentials are stored within an application or in the application's environment, and are used when needed. However, this technique exposes the stored credentials to other parties (human or programmatic) who have permissions to operate in the same environment. These parties can, potentially, access and use the credentials to be falsely authenticated as the intended application.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The second technique addresses the above-mentioned problem by performing checks on the application before providing it with the necessary credentials. However, these steps are performed on the request before the request reaches the network resource or server, thus the network server has no effective way of validating that these checks were indeed performed. The network server receives the request from the application and the credentials, and has no way to validate further that the application was indeed the source of the request.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The third technique (NAC) mainly identifies the environment in which the application is running and is usually employed to validate that only specific environments have access to organizational network. This technique is not designed to identify, and does not identify, the specific application requesting access to network resources.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A related field of authentication is that of human user authentication, which deals with authenticating a user of a specific application. Several solutions in this field employ "out-of-band" authentication (OOBA), such as basing their decision on something the user has (for example, possession of a mobile phone), knows (additional information, such as mother's maiden name) or is (for example, biometrics).</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Examples of conventional OOBA techniques include <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20120159603A"><text>US application 2012/0159603</text></patcit> to Tobias Queck for <i>Mobile Out-Of-Band Authentication Service.</i> Queck teaches enabling authentication of an application session at a client machine by using authentication values and user-identification values that are received from a mobile communication device. The mobile communication device provides an out-of-band channel for validating the session and enables secure authentication for a variety of applications. Queck solves the problem of stronger user authentication by adding authentication of the user's platform (in this case the user's mobile communication device). This additional/second authentication is done by sending a token to the purposed originating device and checking whether it is received and responded to accordingly. While Queck adds another layer of conventional authentication, this teaching does not suggest a solution for application authentication, as this technique only verifies the device (that is, the environment) of the application and not the application itself.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Another conventional authentication technique is taught in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US20120030742A"><text>US application 2012/0030742</text></patcit> to Laurence Lundblade for <i>Methods and apparatus for providing application credentials.</i> Lundblade teaches providing an application credential for an application running on a device, wherein the application credential is used by the application to authenticate to a data server. The method includes receiving a request to generate the application credential, wherein the request includes an application identifier. The method also includes generating the application credential using the application identifier and a master credential associated with the device. While Lundblade does discuss application authentication, this technique is conventional in-band authentication, and hence suffers from the same problems as other in-band techniques. Specifically, other parties can impersonate the original application, send the request to generate the application credential, and falsely complete the authentication process.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Another known technique is described in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US20080196101A"><text>US application 2008/0196101</text></patcit> to Yair Sade (assigned to Cyber-Ark Software, Ltd.) for Methods and Systems for Solving Problems with Hard-Coded Credentials. Sade teaches methods for handling hard-coded credentials, and provides methods for intercepting credential usage, mapping to other credentials, and replacing the credentials with valid application credentials. This is an example of the provider technique mentioned above.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> The request is intercepted and valid credentials are placed into the request, which is then sent to the server. However, the server has no independent way of validating the source of the request and must rely on the validity of the served credentials.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">There is therefore a need for a system and method of application authentication that is out-of-band and provides increased security compared to current techniques, specifically, authenticating both the application credentials and the fact that the credentials are indeed presented by the authenticated application.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY</u></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">The following brief list of some of the terms used in this document is provided for the convenience of the reader and to help define the general use of these terms in this document. The following definitions should not be considered limiting, and are further discussed in the below description and/or the appropriate Standards documents.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Machine - is used for simplicity and clarity, but should not be interpreted as limiting implementation of the current invention. As will be obvious to one skilled in the art, the term machine can include computers and computing systems (for example, physically separate locations or devices) and processors, processing systems, computing cores (for example, shared devices) and similar systems, modules, and combinations on which implementations can be instantiated. In general, a machine is an execution environment for computer software, including a physical or virtual hardware environment and an operating system.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">While the current description uses a typical case of implementation on two separate machines (computers), as described above in reference to the term "machine", use of this case is non-limiting. Based on the current description, one skilled in the art will be able to implement embodiments of the current invention on other machines or a single machine (combinations of platforms).</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Authentication agent or simply "agent" - refers to computer software used to achieve a specific purpose, such as collecting information, and generally refers to an information collection utility. Functionality of agents includes querying a client, for example the operating system on a client machine or a client application. The current invention can be implemented with both agent-less and agent-based implementations. Agent-based implementations include both pre-installed and installed-on-demand agents, which in turn can be volatile (removed after performing their functionality) or persistent (remain on the system for future use).<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0005">Application - generally refers to computer software.</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">Application authentication - generally refers to the process of confirming that an application is what the application claims to be. This usually is a required step prior to granting access and operation permissions, and usually includes validating (verifying) the identity, proper functioning, and integrity of an application.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Authentication/authenticating information - information used for authentication, for example credentials.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Challenge - private information provided (to a user/agent) to be used in a response (from the user/agent) for authentication (to authenticate the user/agent). Note that "challenge" is also used in conventional authentication techniques to refer to the prompt (the "challenge" to the user/agent) to provide the private information (the response/reply). For example, a user is given a code (the challenge) which the user then provides when challenged.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Channel - generally a communications path. For simplicity in the current description, generally between two applications over a network. For example, a channel can be a TCP/IP connection.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Client and server - used for simplicity and clarity in the current description, client applications and server applications are typically applications on a first (client) machine and second (server) machine, respectively. Clients and servers are typically connected via at least one network using at least one channel. The use of the terms "client" and "server" should not be interpreted as limiting. One skilled in the art will realize that the functionality described in the current description in relation to clients and servers can also be implemented on a single machine or plurality of machines, or distributed across a multitude of machines. In other words, the client application(s) and server application(s) can each be on a distinct machine, or both the client applications and server applications can be implemented on the same machine as the application generating the request.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In-band authentication (IBA) - Utilizing the same network or channel for both communication and authentication between two parties, devices, or machines.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Out-of-band authentication (OOBA) - Utilizing a channel other than a primary (first) channel to perform identification. In a preferred embodiment, using two separate networks or channels for authentication, a primary network/channel generally used to communicate and authentication (primary authentication), and a second network/channel used for performing additional authentication, between two parties, devices, or machines.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><heading id="h0006">PIN - Personal identification/identifier number.</heading><p id="p0024" num="0024">Separate/second channel - a channel other than the primary, or first channel. As will be known to one skilled in the art, separate communication channels may use either common or different physical means of implementation, including, but not limited to two TCI/IP sessions on the same network, two physically separate computer networks, two different types of network (for example, Ethernet and Cellular), and common infrastructures with logical separation (for example, a common Ethernet network with a first and second VLAN (virtual local area network) implementing the first and second channels). A second channel is considered out-of-band with respect to a first channel.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">One skilled in the art will realize that in the current description, references to a second channel are in the singular for clarity, as a "second channel" can be also be implemented as "second channels" or "at least one channel other than the first channel". In other words, more than one channel, other than the primary channel, can be used for implementing the features of a second channel. For example, a server can communicate via a second channel with an agent on a client machine, and the agent can transmit authentication information via a third channel to the server.</p><heading id="h0007"><u>SUMMARY</u></heading><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to the teachings of the present embodiment there is provided a system for authentication including: a server machine configured to: receive, via a first channel, a request from a client machine, the request associated with a client application on the client machine;

Authentication information is associated with a component of the system such as the request or the client application, while being collected independent of interaction with the client application initiating the request. Implementations provide improved security over existing solutions using in-band or other means of collecting authentication information.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">As a general overview, without limiting implementations of the current invention, a server machine receives, via a first channel, a request from a client machine, the request associated with a client application on the client machine. The server connects, via a second channel that is separate from the first channel, between the server machine and the client machine. Authentication information is collected on the client machine. The collected authentication information is sent from the client machine via the second channel to the server machine. The server machine receives via the second channel, authentication information from the client machine. In particular, the authentication information is associated with a component of the system such as the request and/or the client application, and the authentication information is collected independently of interaction with the client application.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref>, a simplified diagram of conventional authentication, a user application <b>12</b> on user machine <b>10</b> sends a request <b>36</b> to a server application <b>22</b> on a bank machine <b>20.</b> User machine <b>10</b> is generally a first machine, also referred to in this document as a client, client computer, or client machine. Bank machine <b>20</b> is generally a second machine, also referred to in this document as a server, server computer, or server machine.

In this exemplary case, a user <b>40</b> of user application <b>12</b> wants to access an online banking service. The user <b>40</b> employs user application <b>12</b> to access via user interface <b>30</b> the banking application (server application <b>22)</b> on the bank machine <b>20.</b> The server application sends via SMS (short message service) a onetime password (shown as PIN <b>32)</b> to a cell phone <b>42</b> of user <b>40.</b> User <b>40</b> enters the received PIN <b>32</b> information in the user application <b>12,</b> which sends the information via reply <b>32A</b> to server application <b>22</b> to complete the authentication. In this case, the primary channel is the user interface <b>30,</b> including an online login screen where the user enters their login information. The second separate channel providing the OOBA is the cellular network. This added layer of security in OOBA versus in-band authentication prevents the likelihood of hackers and malware from compromising access to the complete authentication process, in this case by providing the additional information that user <b>40</b> actually possesses device (mobile phone) <b>42,</b> which is associated with this user in server application <b>22</b> and serves as part of the user's authentication.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In another case of OOBA, a user <b>40</b> of user application <b>12</b> wants to be authenticated to server application <b>22.</b> After receiving request <b>36,</b> server application <b>22</b> sends challenge <b>34</b> information to agent <b>14</b> on user machine <b>10.</b> Agent <b>14</b> collects identifying information about user machine <b>10,</b> and then sends reply <b>34B</b> from user machine <b>10</b> to bank machine <b>20.</b> Reply <b>34B</b> includes information that enables server application <b>22</b> to validate that challenge <b>34</b> was properly received and validating information regarding the user machine <b>10.</b> For example, that user machine <b>10</b> is the machine associated with user <b>40</b> or that user machine <b>10</b> has an up-to-date antivirus program).</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Note that conventional techniques include validating information for the machine (on which the agent, such as agent <b>14,</b> resides), but do not include validating information regarding the application, such as user application <b>12.</b> In other words, this conventional OOBA technique verifies the machine on which the agent resides, but not the application sending the request <b>36.</b></p><p id="p0066" num="0066">As will be obvious to one skilled in the art, <figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 1</figref> is a simplified diagram, with limited examples of simplified elements, to provide a convenient basis for assisting and clarifying descriptions in this document.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Conventional techniques use in-band authentication, which can be characterized as an application using information internal to the application (such as user application <b>12)</b> for authentication. Other conventional techniques use OOBA, which can be characterized as using information other than information internal to the application (such as agent <b>14</b> collecting<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> information regarding user machine <b>10,</b> or PIN <b>32</b> received via cell phone <b>42</b> by user <b>40).</b> An implementation of the current invention addresses a different problem - that of enabling server application <b>22</b> to validate that request <b>36</b> indeed originated in application <b>12</b> and not just by user <b>40</b> or on machine <b>10.</b> In other words, a feature of the current invention is application-to-application authentication, as opposed to techniques designed for end-user access. To facilitate solving this problem, an OOBA technique is used to connect to machine <b>10</b> and collect authenticating information regarding application <b>12,</b> for example by employing an agent (similar to agent <b>14,</b> but with different functionality) and to return the information to the server to accomplish proper authentication. This problem is not resolved by existing techniques. Note, that one skilled in the art will realize that in this characterization of the implementation, "authenticating information" refers to information about the application that is specific to the application (such as local path on machine, process names, file sizes and more), but available to other applications residing on the same machine (processes, operating system, etc.), and should not be confused with information internal to the running of the application. The authenticating information can be considered application specific information, in contrast to general system (such as user machine <b>10)</b> information.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Refer now to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2</figref>, a diagram of out-of-band application authentication and <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 3</figref>, a diagram of an exemplary implementation of out-of-band application authentication. A server machine <b>100</b> and server application <b>102</b> are installed to function as a destination server for requests <b>121</b> or as an intermediary/proxy server to confirm or deny requests from client applications <b>112</b> on a client machine <b>110</b> to other applications or network resources or assets. Client machine <b>110</b> and server machine <b>100</b> are typically connected via at least one network using at least one channel. Server application <b>102</b> is configured to listen for requests (such as request <b>121)</b> from applications on a network to which server machine <b>100</b> is connected, recognize an application (such as client application <b>112)</b> which generated the request, and recognize a machine (such as client machine <b>110)</b> from which the request originated. Server application <b>102</b> receives authentication information, such as the results of authentication agent <b>214,</b> analyzes the authentication information, and makes a decision regarding whether or not a received request <b>121</b> was indeed authenticated correctly and/or validate (grant or deny) <b>(124)</b> the request <b>(121).</b></p><p id="p0069" num="0069">The application authentication process is initiated by a request <b>121</b> originating from a client application <b>112</b> on client machine <b>110</b> to the server application <b>102.</b> Request <b>121</b> may have characteristics including, but not limited to, time, originating IP address and port, destination IP address and port, contents, and protocol. Request <b>121</b> may also include in-band authentication<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> information, such as application or user credentials (for example, username/password combination). Request <b>221</b> is a non-limiting example of request <b>121</b> sent from client machine <b>110</b> via IP:port 2.2.2.2:777 to IP:port 3.3.3.3:444 on server machine <b>100).</b></p><p id="p0070" num="0070">An optional step of preliminary request validation <b>225</b> can be performed by server application <b>102</b> by checking characteristics and content of request <b>221</b> to validate whether this request has a potential of being granted. For example, by validating originating and destination IP address and port, checking the contents for username/password combination or any other characteristic of the request. If preliminary request validation <b>225</b> fails, requests can be denied, without the need for further steps.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">The server application <b>102</b> then initiates the OOBA process, connecting to the originating machine, client machine <b>110,</b> shown as arrow connection <b>122,</b> "connect and collect information". Connection (connect and collect information) <b>222</b> is a non-limiting example of connection <b>122,</b> from server machine <b>100</b> on IP:port 3.3.3.3:555 to IP:port 2.2.2.2:666 on client machine <b>110.</b> In the current embodiment, the first channel (primary channel) is used for connection and primary authentication (the application provides credentials which are used for primary authentication) while a second channel (OOB relative to the first channel) is used for additional authentication. The use of additional authentication provides a stronger authentication than the use of only the primary authentication.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Connection <b>122</b> is via a separate/second channel from request <b>121.</b> In other words, connection <b>122</b> is established as an out-of-band channel (with regard to the channel of request <b>121).</b> A significant feature of the current embodiment is that the collection of information session (connection <b>122)</b> is out-of-band with respect to the original request session (request <b>121).</b> This communication using separate channels (connections/ports) between machines facilitates providing distinctive flexibility and security benefits over conventional methods (where in conventional in-band authentication, the same channel [connection] is used for both requesting information and authenticating the requestor). The session of connection <b>122</b> can be established by known methods, such as administrative or user passwords, PKI, and/or other credentials and known methods of secure access to enable server application <b>102</b> to access client machine <b>110.</b></p><p id="p0073" num="0073">After a connection is established, authentication information is collected. Authentication information includes information regarding the client application <b>112</b> or request <b>121.</b> A feature of collecting information on the client machine is that authentication information is collected independent of interaction with the client application <b>112.</b> In other words, collection of authentication information, such as queries on the client machine, do not require a response from<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> client application <b>112.</b> A first exemplary method of collecting authentication information is to query the operating system of client machine <b>110.</b> For example, in a Windows™ environment, server application <b>102,</b> can connect <b>122</b> using Windows WMI API to client machine <b>110,</b> and find the executable characteristics of client application <b>112.</b> This can be done for example, by locating the client application <b>112</b> Windows process name according to the TCP/IP port that the client application <b>112</b> used to connection to the server application <b>102.</b> Once authentication information is obtained, the authentication information can be transmitted back (send authentication information <b>123)</b> over the WMI channel to server application <b>102.</b> In a second example, on Unix systems the server application <b>102</b> can initiate SSH connection <b>122</b> to client machine <b>110,</b> investigate the environment of client machine <b>110,</b> locate client application <b>120</b> characteristics, and send them back <b>123</b> to server application <b>102</b> over the SSH channel.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">A second method of collecting authentication information is to use an authentication agent (or simply agent) <b>214</b> on client machine <b>110.</b> In the current example, agent <b>214</b> is a local agent on client machine <b>110.</b> Use of an agent is optional, as sufficient information for authentication can typically be collected by using the services of the client machine's operating system. In other words, the required functionality of an agent can typically be achieved using the services provided by the operating system on client machine <b>110,</b> without requiring an agent on client machine <b>110.</b> In a case where an authentication agent is being used, use of agents are known in the art. Agents can be deployed by various methods including, but not limited to, pre-installing an agent on a client machine and downloading an agent to a client machine (procedurally an additional part of connection <b>122</b> or on-demand). In addition to collecting authentication information, for example by querying the operating system, an agent can optionally and typically is responsible (configured) for transferring the collected authentication information (sending <b>223)</b> from a client machine <b>110</b> to the server machine <b>100</b> / server application <b>102.</b> Note that while an agent is typically deployed on a client machine, such as agent <b>214</b> on client machine <b>110,</b> deployment of agents in other locations and configurations is known in the art. Generally, an agent <b>214</b> should be able to collect information regarding an application <b>112</b> and facilitate the collected information being sent to server machine <b>100.</b> An agent <b>214</b> can also collect information regarding request <b>121.</b> Based on this description, one skilled in the art will be able to implement an agent to meet the specific needs for the system on which the agent is deployed.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">In this description, for clarity, a typical case is described where server application <b>102</b> connects to client machine <b>110</b> to initiate collection of authentication information. In an alternative<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> implementation, in a case where client machine <b>110</b> includes an agent <b>214,</b> agent <b>214</b> can monitor client machine <b>110</b> and/or client application <b>112</b> to detect events that may require authentication information to be collected. Alternatively, client machine <b>110</b> can include additional modules, such as an interception module (not shown in the diagrams). The interception module can monitor client machine <b>110</b> and notify agent <b>214</b> of an event requiring authentication. Agent <b>214</b> can initiate a connection to server machine <b>100.</b> This alternative implementation is not shown in the diagrams, but is similar to connection <b>222,</b> though in the opposite direction.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">There are at least two types of authentication information that can be collected. A first type of authentication information includes information regarding the request (such as request <b>121).</b> Collection of this first type of information can be viewed as the answer(s) to the question "What application originated the request?" One method of answering this question (collecting this information) is by using the distinguishing characteristics of the <i>request.</i> For example, querying client machine <b>110</b> to find out what process initiated a connection with an originating port of request <b>121.</b> In the current example, request <b>221</b> originates from port 777, so client machine <b>110</b> is queried for what process is associated with port 777. In the current example, port 777 is associated with client application <b>112.</b> Responses to this query can include process name, application name, or other distinguishing characteristic that determine what application originated the request. The responses constitute authentication information, and are sent from client machine <b>110</b> to server machine <b>100,</b> as shown by arrow "send authentication information" <b>223.</b> The authentication information is analyzed on server machine <b>100,</b> such as by server application <b>102,</b> and a decision is made regarding whether or not received request <b>121</b> was indeed authenticated correctly and/or validate (grant or deny) <b>124</b> the request <b>121.</b></p><p id="p0077" num="0077">The collection of this first type of information is optional. For example, in an implementation where an assumption is made that the originating application is already known, this first type of information does not need to be collected. Note that this first type of authentication differs from preliminary request validation <b>225,</b> described above. While both this first type of authentication and preliminary request validation <b>225</b> can be based on, or initiated on, common characteristics and content of request <b>221,</b> these techniques authenticate/validate different <i>parameters.</i> As described above, preliminary request validation <b>225</b> is performed by server application <b>102</b> using parameters (characteristics and/or content) of request <b>221.</b> In contrast, first type of authentication is performed on client machine <b>110,</b> where characteristics and/or content of request <b>221</b> are used to query <b>(222)</b> client machine <b>110</b> or agent <b>214</b> regarding request <b>221.</b> In response to this query, the client machine <b>110</b> or agent <b>214</b> responds by providing parameters regarding distinguishing characteristics of request <b>221.</b> These parameters regarding distinguishing<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> characteristics of request <b>221</b> are then used to perform authentication. For example, these parameters are sent from client machine <b>110</b> via send authentication information <b>223</b> in a secondary channel to server machine <b>100</b> where server application <b>102</b> validates <b>224</b> request <b>221.</b></p><p id="p0078" num="0078">A second type of authenticating information includes information regarding the application (client application <b>112)</b> supposedly (based on first type authenticating information described above or deduced from request <b>121)</b> making the request (request <b>121).</b> Collection of this second type of information can be viewed as the answer(s) to the question "What are the current characteristics of the <i>application</i> that originated the request?" One method of answering this question (collecting this information) is by using the distinguishing characteristics of the <i>application.</i> An example is querying client machine <b>110</b> to find out details of the application that supposedly issued this request. Responses to this query can include the process name, application path, size of files and directories, results of a hash-function calculation on components of the application, results of a hash-function calculation on executable files of the application or other calculations on application files and other related processes and files. This information can be later used to determine the authenticity of the application supposedly making the request. As noted above, responses can be provided by the operating system on a client machine <b>110,</b> or by an authentication agent <b>214</b> (pre-installed, installed-on-demand, etc.).</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The collected authentication information is then transmitted back to server application <b>102,</b> shown as arrow "send authentication information" <b>223.</b> For clarity, both the connection <b>222</b> and the reply transmitting authentication information <b>223</b> are described as using a second channel, as compared to request <b>221</b> that uses a first channel. Note, however, that connection <b>222</b> and sending authentication information <b>223</b> are separate arrows, and as defined above can use the same or separate channels. For example, a server can communicate via a second channel (actually one or more channels other than the first channel) with an agent on a client machine, and the agent can transmit authentication information via a third channel (actually one or more channels other than the first channel and/or other than the second channel) to the server.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Server application <b>102</b> uses the transmitted authentication information to determine if the application is properly authenticated, and if the original request should be granted or denied, shown as "validate request" <b>224.</b> Techniques for determining authentication (authenticating) are known in the art and include, but not limited to, authenticating based on pre-stored policy, configuration, or other known methods for comparing and making a validation decision. Based on this description, one skilled in the art will be able to select an authentication technique appropriate for a particular implementation.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p id="p0081" num="0081">A non-limiting example is now described for clarity. A typical use case is an organizational application, such as an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) application that needs to access a sensitive database. The ERP application sends a request to a server machine on which the database resides and uses dedicated credentials for authentication. Prior to granting the request, the server application connects via a second channel to the machine from which the request originated and checks two aspects - that the request indeed came from the ERP application (and not some other entity impersonating the application), and that the ERP application parameters (such as path on disk, process name, executable hash computation value and others) have not changed (since changed parameters can indicate potential compromise of the ERP application).</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">A preferred implementation includes a client application, which needs to access a network resource (such as a database), while access credentials to the network resource are managed by a privileged identities management system. A server machine acts as a credentials provider. The client application sends a request to the server machine requesting access credentials to the database. The credentials provider (server machine) connects via a second channel to the client machine from which the request for access credentials originated and checks whether the application is valid (such as intact - residing at an expected path, a hash computation value is as expected, and other authentication parameters). If the application is intact, the request for access credentials to the network resource is processed and the access credentials are sent to the requesting client application.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">Another non-limiting example is of a bank that wants to insure the security of requests from user clients to the bank's server. Prior to operation of the system, the bank contacts the author of a client application, and receives a private validated copy of the client application code, or a validated hash value of the application code. In operation, the bank's server receives a request on a first connection from a supposed application on a user client. The system uses a second connection from the bank's server back to the user client to get a hash value of the application on the user client. The bank server can then compare the validated hash value on the server to the hash value from the user client. If the hash values are not identical, the application on the user client may have been compromised, and the bank server rejects the request.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURE 4</figref> is a high-level block diagram of a processing system <b>600</b> for embodiments of a server machine <b>100</b> (second machine of the current invention). System (processing system) <b>600</b> includes a processor <b>602</b> and four memory devices: a RAM <b>604,</b> a boot ROM <b>606,</b> a mass storage device (hard disk) <b>608,</b> a flash memory <b>610,</b> a first communication channel <b>620,</b> and a second communication channel <b>622,</b> all communicating via a common bus <b>612.</b> A module (processing<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> module) <b>614</b> is shown on mass storage <b>608,</b> but as will be obvious to one skilled in the art, could be located on any of the memory devices.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">Mass storage device <b>608</b> is a non-limiting example of a computer-readable storage medium bearing computer-readable code for implementing the data storage methodology described herein. Other examples of such computer-readable storage media include read-only memories such as CDs bearing such code.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">System <b>600</b> may have an operating system stored on the memory devices, the ROM <b>(606)</b> may include boot code for the system, and the processor <b>(602)</b> may be configured for executing the boot code to load the operating system to RAM <b>604,</b> executing the operating system to copy computer-readable code to RAM <b>604</b> and execute the code. Communication channels <b>620</b> and <b>622</b> may be separate channels, such as two Network Interface Controllers (NICs), the same interface controller enabling separate concurrent network connections or other possible communicating channels.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">As can be seen from the above description and example, a feature of the current invention is that authentication can be done "out-of-band", that is, authentication is done separate from client application <b>112,</b> and does not rely on interaction with application <b>112.</b> In other words, collection of authentication information is independent of responses from the client application <b>112</b> and communication of authentication information is in a channel independent of a channel used by the client application. This feature of providing verification independent of a requesting application at least in part facilitates improved authentication over existing solutions. In particular, improved authentication of the identity and integrity of a requesting application.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">As can be seen from the above description, conventional solutions generally use in-band techniques, such as in-band authentication to authenticate the application and requests. Such techniques rely on authenticating information (such as access credentials) being transmitted with the request, hence the authentication process relies solely on information provided with the request. This makes such solution vulnerable to impersonation - a malicious party with the valid credentials can impersonate the legitimate application and successfully pass the authentication.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Another relevant technique is NAC (network access control), which provides information regarding the machine (that is, the environment) from which the request originated, and enforces<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> access control based on this information. Generally, NAC does not provide information regarding a specific application, and even when NAC does provide this information, this information is not used to authenticate a specific request. For example, a NAC agent can report whether an antivirus is up-to-date and running on the client machine, but does not provide information regarding a specific application that sent a specific request. NAC usually requires installing on a client machine an agent to collect required information. This information is used by the NAC system to decide whether a request to connect to network resources from the client machine should be granted or denied. In contrast to NAC, which serves to authenticate the client machine and the environment from which the request originated, the current embodiment authenticates the specific application that originated the request. The current embodiment includes a request for additional authentication information and is initiated by a server application. In contrast to solutions that use in-band communications, such as relying on authenticating information transmitted with the request, the current embodiment uses out-of-band communications to retrieve additional authenticating information.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">Conventional solutions for human user authentication include using a human's ability to operate devices, the biometric qualities possessed by humans, and/or a person's knowledge. In contrast, applications employ unique interfaces and communication methods that are not used by human users. The interfaces of applications create distinguishing characteristics to an application's request. A current embodiment uses the application characteristics and interfaces for authenticating an application.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">While some components of the current invention may currently be in use in the field, the innovative combination of components and methods are not obvious from the existing techniques. This innovation can be seen from the long-standing need for a solution for application authentication, without teaching or suggestion of the method and system of the current invention. Specifically, the current embodiment includes using a separate, out-of-band authentication process to authenticate an application that sent a request.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">While the above embodiments have been generally described as using secure channels, for example, secure connections using PKI or other known secure access methods, implementations are also possible using non-secure connections.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">Note that a variety of implementations for modules and processing are possible, depending on the application. As will be obvious to one skilled in the art, the elements of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGURE 2 and FIGURE<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> 3</figref>, including client application <b>112,</b> authentication agent <b>214,</b> server application <b>102,</b> preliminary request validation <b>225,</b> and validate request <b>224</b> can all be considered modules of the current system and method. Modules are preferably implemented in software, but can also be implemented in hardware and firmware, on a single processor or distributed processors, at one or more locations. The above-described module functions can be combined and implemented as fewer modules or separated into sub-functions and implemented as a larger number of modules.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">As is well known to persons skilled in art, the various functionality components described above can be implemented in monolithic or modular fashions. For example, server application <b>102</b> can be implemented as a single application or as a system of interacting modules, each responsible for a specific functionality or step of the process, such as receiving request <b>121,</b> performing preliminary request validation <b>225,</b> connecting and collection information <b>122,</b> receiving authentication information <b>123</b> and decision making on validating request <b>224.</b> This is also true for the implementation of an authentication agent <b>214.</b> Based on the above description, one skilled in the art will be able to design an implementation for a specific application.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">It should be noted that the above-described examples, numbers used, and exemplary calculations are to assist in the description of this embodiment.
