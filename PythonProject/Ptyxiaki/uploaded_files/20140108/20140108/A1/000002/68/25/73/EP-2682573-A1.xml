Attempts have also been made to lighten a load of the oil pump by regulating the oil pressure supplied to a valve system lubricating circuit and a crankshaft system lubricating circuit to an oil pressure required by each circuit.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">To achieve such objects, an invention (to be referred to hereafter as "the invention according to Patent Document 1") disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2009264241A"><text>2009-264241</text></patcit> (Patent Document 1) has been proposed. The invention according to Patent Document 1 will be described briefly below. Reference symbols used in the description are identical to those used in Patent Document 1. First, oil is drawn from an oil pan 10 by an oil pump 12 and delivered to a first oil feeding path 16a and a second oil feeding path 16b.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The first oil feeding path 16a is a path for supplying the oil mainly to a bearing portion 18 of a crankshaft, while the second oil feeding path 16b is a path for supplying the oil to a valve mechanism 20 and so on, for example. An oil pressure control valve 22 for controlling an amount of oil supplied to the bearing portion 18 of the crankshaft is disposed on the first oil feeding path 16a. The oil pressure control valve 22 is configured such that an output oil pressure thereof is controlled by a control unit 24.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The control unit 24 is controlled by an engine rotation speed sensor 26, an engine load sensor 28, an oil temperature sensor 30, and an oil pressure sensor 32. A relief valve 34 is provided to allow surplus oil pressure to escape into the oil pan 10 from a part of the oil path between the oil pump 12 and a filter 14 when the oil pressure exceeds a predetermined value. In this configuration, the oil pressure control valve 22 is controlled by the control unit 24.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Following problems exist in Patent Document 1 and similarly configured prior art. In Patent Document 1, the control means is controlled electronically. It is therefore necessary to obtain a large amount of information, such as the engine rotation speed, the oil temperature, the engine load, and the oil pressure, to control the oil pressure control valve 22. Complicated control such as MAP control and oil temperature correction is also required. As a result, a large cost increase can be foreseen. Moreover, electric power is consumed to drive the oil pressure control valve 22, and therefore the engine load may increase due to the need to drive a power generation apparatus.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Furthermore, when a fault occurs in any of the electric systems, such as the various sensors required for the control, the oil pressure control valve 22, and the control unit 24, the control cannot be performed sufficiently, and therefore expected effects are no longer obtained. An object of the present invention (a technical problem to be solved thereby), therefore, is to provide a control valve with which a high degree of reliability is obtained inexpensively by driving a mechanism hydraulically in order to avoid problems inherent in electronic control.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">As a result of a great deal of committed research undertaken by the present inventor to solve the problems described above, a first aspect of the present invention solves these problems by providing a control valve including: a main flow passage; a flow passage sectional area adjustment spool mounted midway in the main flow passage in order to increase and reduce a flow passage sectional<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> area; a downstream side branch flow passage that bifurcates from the main flow passage on a downstream side of a position of the flow passage sectional area adjustment spool; a communicating flow passage for delivering oil from the downstream side branch flow passage toward the flow passage sectional area adjustment spool; a flow passage opening/closing valve mounted between the downstream side branch flow passage and the communicating flow passage in order to connect and cut off the downstream side branch flow passage and the communicating flow passage to and from each other; a flow passage opening/closing spool mounted midway in the communicating flow passage; and an upstream side branch flow passage that bifurcates from the main flow passage on an upstream side of the position of the flow passage sectional area adjustment spool in order to supply an oil pressure to the flow passage opening/closing spool, wherein, in a low rotation region of an engine, the flow passage opening/closing valve cuts off the downstream side branch flow passage from the communicating flow passage so that the flow passage sectional area of the main flow passage is maximized, in a medium rotation region of the engine, the flow passage opening/closing valve connects the downstream side branch flow passage to the communicating flow passage and the flow passage opening/closing spool allows the communicating flow passage to communicate such that the flow passage sectional area adjustment spool is moved by the oil pressure in a direction for reducing the flow passage sectional area of the main flow passage, and in a high rotation region of the engine, the flow passage opening/closing spool blocks the communicating flow passage such that the flow passage sectional area of the main flow passage is maximized.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A second aspect of the present invention solves the problems described above by providing a control valve including: a main flow passage; a flow passage sectional area adjustment spool mounted midway in the main flow passage; a downstream side branch flow passage that bifurcates from the main flow passage on a downstream side of a position of the flow passage sectional area adjustment<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> spool; a communicating flow passage for delivering oil from the downstream side branch flow passage toward the flow passage sectional area adjustment spool; a flow passage opening/closing valve mounted between the downstream side branch flow passage and the communicating flow passage in order to connect and cut off the downstream side branch flow passage and the communicating flow passage to and from each other; a flow passage opening/closing spool mounted midway in the communicating flow passage; and an upstream side branch flow passage that bifurcates from the main flow passage on an upstream side of the position of the flow passage sectional area adjustment spool in order to supply an oil pressure to the flow passage opening/closing spool, wherein the flow passage opening/closing valve connects the downstream side branch flow passage to the communicating flow passage when the oil pressure in the downstream side branch flow passage increases, the flow passage opening/closing spool blocks the communicating flow passage when the oil pressure from the upstream side branch flow passage increases, and the flow passage sectional area adjustment spool is elastically biased such that a flow passage sectional area of the main flow passage shifts to a maximum side, and moves so as to reduce the flow passage sectional area of the main flow passage when the oil pressure from the communicating flow passage increases.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A third aspect of the present invention solves the problems described above by providing the control valve according to the first or second aspect, wherein an oil pressure required for the flow passage opening/closing valve to connect the downstream side branch flow passage to the communicating flow passage is set to be smaller than an oil pressure required for the flow passage opening/closing spool to block the communicating flow passage.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A fourth aspect of the present invention solves the problems described above by providing the control valve according to any one of the first to third aspects, wherein a drain flow passage is provided between a flow passage sectional area adjustment spool chamber in which the flow passage sectional area adjustment spool<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> is mounted and a flow passage opening/closing spool chamber in which the flow passage opening/closing spool is mounted, an exhaust flow passage is formed in the flow passage opening/closing spool chamber, and when the flow passage opening/closing spool blocks the communicating flow passage, the drain flow passage communicates with the exhaust flow passage.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A fifth aspect of the present invention solves the problems described above by providing the control valve according to any one of the first to fourth aspects, wherein the flow passage sectional area adjustment spool chamber in which the flow passage sectional area adjustment spool is mounted is constituted by a main chamber portion and an auxiliary chamber portion, both of which are orthogonal to the main flow passage, and the flow passage sectional area adjustment spool reciprocates between the main chamber portion and the auxiliary chamber portion so as to traverse the main flow passage.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The first and second aspects of the present invention are configured such that the oil pressure on the downstream side of the control valve is controlled in accordance with variation in the engine rotation speed, or in other words variation in the oil pressure in the main flow passage, using only a mechanical hydraulic mechanism and without the use of a solenoid valve, a sensor, or the like that has to be driven electrically.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As a result, the possibility that oil pressure control cannot be performed appropriately due to a fault in an electric system can be eliminated, operational reliability exceeding that of a conventional lubricating oil supply apparatus can be secured, and cost increases caused by the addition of components, control, and so on can be suppressed.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Further, from an operational viewpoint, in the medium rotation region of the engine, the flow passage sectional area of an oil circuit is narrowed by applying oil pressure to the flow passage sectional area adjustment spool so that the flow passage sectional area adjustment spool moves in an axial direction. By<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> narrowing the sectional area of the oil passage, the oil pressure on the downstream side of the flow passage sectional area adjustment spool can be reduced.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Moreover, in the high rotation region of the engine, the oil flowing through the communicating flow passage is blocked by the flow passage opening/closing spool so that the drain flow passage communicates with the exhaust flow passage provided in the flow passage opening/closing spool chamber, and therefore the oil pressure applied to the flow passage sectional area adjustment spool is reduced such that the flow passage sectional area adjustment spool is moved in a direction for maximizing the flow passage sectional area of the main flow passage by the elastic biasing force acting on the flow passage sectional area adjustment spool. As a result, the flow rate and pressure of the oil can be increased in accordance with the rotation speed of the engine.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Hence, in the present invention, the oil pressure can be increased gradually following startup in the low rotation region of the engine without causing the oil pressure on the downstream side to decrease. Further, in the medium rotation region of the engine, an increase in the oil pressure is suppressed, and therefore a wasteful oil action can be prevented. Moreover, when a high oil pressure is required for lubrication and cooling in the high rotation region of the engine, a high oil pressure can be supplied accordingly.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the third aspect of the present invention, the oil pressure required by the flow passage opening/closing valve to connect the downstream side branch flow passage to the communicating flow passage is set to be smaller than the oil pressure required by the flow passage opening/closing spool to block the communicating flow passage, and therefore the flow passage opening/closing valve moves before the flow passage opening/closing spool in response to an increase in the oil pressure flowing through the main flow passage.
