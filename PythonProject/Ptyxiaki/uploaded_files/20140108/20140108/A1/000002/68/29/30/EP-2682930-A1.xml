collects ambient sounds using each of a plurality of sound collectors and specifies the moving direction of a sound source (particularly, a vehicle) based on the arrival time difference of each sound. The device disclosed in Patent Literature 1 converts an electric signal output from a plurality of microphones disposed in a predetermined intervals into a correction electric signal by removing a frequency component of a low frequency band and high frequency band respectively using a band pass filter, calculates a power of a predetermined frequency band which expresses the characteristics of the running noise of the vehicle from the correction electric signal, and determines that the approaching vehicle is present in a case where the power level is larger than a predetermined value. Further, the device disclosed in Patent Literature 1 converts the correction electric signal into a noise suppression signal by removing an unnecessary noise component, calculates a mutual correlation between noise suppression signals of the plurality of the microphones, and calculates an approaching direction of the approaching vehicle from the arrival time difference in which the correlation is a maximum. In a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> case where the approaching vehicle is detected in this way, various driving support using the information of the approaching vehicle is performed. For example, an alarm output to a driver is performed when it is determined that there is a possibility of collision of the host vehicle and the approaching vehicle based on the information of the approaching vehicle.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Citation List</b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b>Patent Literature</b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003"><ul><li>[Patent Literature 1] Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Registration Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP5092767A"><text>5-92767</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Literature 2] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP8202999A"><text>8-202999</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Literature 3] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP9128697A"><text>9-128697</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>Summary of Invention</b></heading><heading id="h0006"><b>Technical Problem</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">In a case where a detection of an approaching vehicle is operated at all times based on a running noise of a vehicle, the detection of the approaching vehicle is performed even in a situation where the surrounding status is visible enough for the driver (or a situation which can be detected sufficiently by the camera sensor system). Therefore, despite the driver being aware of the approaching vehicle, the approaching vehicle is detected based on the running noise and then, the alarm output or the like is performed with regard to the approaching vehicle. In such a case, since the driver feels inconvenienced by the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> alarm output, it would be better if the approaching vehicle detection is not operated.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an approaching vehicle detection device that operates an approaching vehicle detection only in an appropriate situation based on the running noise.</p><heading id="h0007"><b>Solution to Problem</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">An approaching vehicle detection device according to the present invention includes; an approaching vehicle detection unit that detects an approaching vehicle based on a running noise, an acquisition unit that acquires visibility information which indicates a visibility around the vehicle, and a determination unit that determines whether or not to cause the approaching vehicle detection unit to operate based on the visibility information acquired by the acquisition unit.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the approaching vehicle detection device, the visibility information that indicates the visibility around the vehicle is acquired by the acquisition unit. In a case where the visibility around the vehicle is high, the driver can visually check for the neighboring vehicle. However, in a case where the visibility around the vehicle is low, it is difficult for the driver to visually check the neighboring vehicle. Therefore, in the approaching vehicle detection device, the determination unit determines whether or not to cause the approaching vehicle detection unit to operate based on the visibility information, and causes the approaching vehicle detection unit to operate only when the visibility around the vehicle is getting worse, and the approaching vehicle is detected based on the running noise. In this manner, by<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> determining whether or not to cause the approaching vehicle detection unit to operate based on the visibility information indicating the visibility around the vehicle, the approaching vehicle detection device can cause the approaching vehicle detection unit to operate only in the situation where the visibility around the vehicle is getting worse (the situation where the approaching vehicle detection based on the running noise is needed). As a result, when such a neighboring situation can be checked by the view of the driver, it is possible to suppress the unnecessary alarm output by an operation of the approaching vehicle detection unit and to suppress the inconvenience to the driver. In addition, the number of the operations (operating time) of the approaching vehicle detection unit can be reduced. Therefore, the energy-saving effect also can be obtained.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Here, the acquisition unit may acquire illumination information around the vehicle. In this case, the determination unit may determine whether or not to cause the approaching vehicle detection unit to operate based on a comparison between the illumination information acquired by the acquisition unit and a predetermined threshold value of the illumination. In addition, the acquisition unit may acquire weather information around the vehicle. In this case, the determination unit may determine whether or not to cause the approaching vehicle detection unit to operate based on a comparison between the weather information acquired by the acquisition unit and a predetermined weather conditions.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The approaching vehicle detection device according to the present invention may be configured to further include a detection unit<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> that detects the visibility information which indicates the visibility how much the driver can view and the determination unit determines whether or not to cause the approaching vehicle detection unit to operate based on the visibility information detected by the detection unit.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the approaching vehicle detection device, the visibility information which indicates the visibility how much the driver can view is acquired by the detection unit. Even in such a situation that the visibility can be determined good based on the visibility information around vehicle, there is a case that it is difficult for the driver to recognize the neighboring situation due to the road structure or an obstacle such as a building. In such a case, the driver tries to check the situation as much as possible by often moving his/her eyes to right and left sides or by changing his/her posture. Therefore, in the approaching vehicle detection device, the determination unit determines whether or not to cause the approaching vehicle detection unit to operate based on the visibility information indicating how much the driver can view, and causes the approaching vehicle detection unit to operate only when the visibility how much the driver can view is getting worse, and the approaching vehicle is detected based on the running noise. In this manner, by determining whether or not to cause the approaching vehicle detection unit to operate based on the visibility information indicating the visibility how much the driver can view, the approaching vehicle detection device can cause the approaching vehicle detection unit to operate only in the situation where the visibility how much the driver can view is getting worse (the situation where the approaching vehicle detection based on the running noise is needed).<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Here, the detection unit may detect the driver's line of sight information.

In the drawings, like elements or corresponding elements are referenced by like reference numerals, and duplicated descriptions will not be repeated.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the present embodiment, the present invention is applied to an approaching vehicle detection device which is mounted on a vehicle. The approaching vehicle detection device according to the present embodiment detects a vehicle approaching to a host vehicle based on a running noise of the vehicle (that is, specifies a moving direction of a sound source of the running noise of neighboring vehicles), and provides the approaching vehicle information to a driving support device. In particular, the approaching vehicle detection device according to the present embodiment does not operate the approaching vehicle detection at all times but operates the approaching vehicle detection only when an operation determination unit configured in the device determines that the operation is needed. There are two embodiments in the present embodiment, in the first embodiment, the operation is determined based on illumination information and weather information, in the second embodiment, in addition to the determination in the first embodiment, the operation is determined based on line of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> sight information and posture information of the driver.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In addition, the running noise of the vehicle is mainly a road noise (a frictional noise between a tire surface and a road surface) and a pattern noise (a vortex of air in the grooves of the tire (compression / open)). A frequency component range of the running noise of the vehicle may be determined in advance by experiment or the like.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The approaching vehicle detection device 1A in the first embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1. Fig.1</figref> is a configuration diagram of the approaching vehicle detection device in the first embodiment.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The approaching vehicle detection device 1A includes an illumination sensor 10, a weather information acquisition device 11, a sound collector array 12 (sound collector 12a, ...), and an ECU [Electronic Control Unit] 20A (an operation determination unit 21A and an approaching vehicle detection unit 22). In the approaching vehicle detection device 1A, the operation determination unit 21A in the ECU 20A operates at all times, and the approaching vehicle detection unit 22 operates only when the operation determination unit 21A determines the situation is that the visibility is getting worse based on the illumination information and the weather information. Furthermore, in the first embodiment, the illumination sensor 10 is corresponding to an acquisition unit disclosed in Claims and the operation determination unit 21A is corresponding to a determination unit disclosed in Claims.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The illumination sensor 10 is a sensor that detects an illumination outside the vehicle. The illumination sensor 10 detects the illumination around the host vehicle at regular time intervals, and<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> transmits the detected illumination information to the ECU 20A.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The weather information acquisition device 11 is a device that acquires weather information around the host vehicle. As the examples of the weather information acquisition device 11 may include; a device that acquires information of a wiper's ON / OFF state and an operation interval of the wiper when the wiper is in ON state, a device that acquires an atmospheric pressure around the vehicle, a device capable of receiving the information distributed through the internet (particularly, the weather information), and a device capable of receiving the infrastructure information distributed from the road side (particularly, the weather information). The weather information acquisition device 11 transmits the acquired weather information to the ECU 20A when the weather information is acquired.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The sound collector array 12 includes two or more sound collectors 12a. The two or more sound collectors 12a are disposed on the front end of the vehicle in a line in a vehicle width direction (a lateral direction). The sound collector 12a is an acousto-electric convertor, collects the neighboring sounds outside the vehicle, converts the collected sounds to electric signal, and transmits the electric signal to the ECU 20A.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The ECU 20A is an electronic control unit formed of a CPU [Central Processing Unit], a ROM [Read Only Memory] and a RAM [Random Access Memory], and performs overall control of the approaching vehicle detection device 1A. The ECU 20A is configured to include the operation determination unit 21A that operates at all times when the vehicle system is operating and the approaching vehicle<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> detection unit 22 that operates only when the operation is permitted by the operation determination unit 21A. In the ECU 20A, each information from the illumination sensor 10 and the weather information acquisition device 11 are input respectively, and the processing in the operation determination unit 21A is performed using each information at all times at regular time intervals. In addition, in the ECU 20A, each electric signal from each sound collector 12a is input respectively, and the processing in the approaching vehicle detection unit 22 is performed using the electric signal at regular time intervals only when the operation is permitted.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The operation determination unit 21A determines, based on the illumination information, the situation whether or not the visibility is getting worse, for it is dark around the host vehicle and the view (by eyes) of the driver or the detection by the sensor of the camera system is difficult. In this determination, for example, the operation determination unit 21A determines whether the detected illumination is equal to or less than a predetermined threshold value or not. In addition, the operation determination unit 21A determines, based on the weather information, the situation whether or not the visibility is getting worse, for the weather condition is bad and the visibility how much the driver can view or the detection by the sensor of the camera system is difficult. In this determination, for example, the determination is performed by the presence and the amount of rain, snow and fog. Then, in a case where at least one of the determinations shows the situation that the visibility is getting worse, the operation determination unit 21A determines to cause the approaching vehicle detection unit 22<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> to operate. In a case where both of the determinations show the situation that the visibility is not getting worse, the operation determination unit 21A determines to cause the approaching vehicle detection unit 22 to stop operating. Moreover, besides those conditions, the determination of the situation whether or not the visibility is getting worse may be performed when an angle of the sun light is low.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Incidentally, when it is bright around the vehicle, the surrounding situation can be checked by the view of the driver. However, when it is dark around the host vehicle, it is difficult to check the surrounding situation by the view of the driver. In case of a vehicle in which approaching vehicle detection is also performed by the sensor of the camera system, it is difficult to detect the neighboring vehicle when it is dark around the vehicle depending upon the performance of the sensor of the camera system. In this case, it is necessary to detect the approaching vehicle based on the running noise.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The approaching vehicle detection unit 22 operates only when it is determined to operate by the operation determination unit 21A. The approaching vehicle detection unit 22 calculates an arrival time difference of the sound from the mutual correlations between the electric signal of the two sound collectors 12a and 12a, and determines the presence of the sound source and the approaching direction of the sound source in a case where the sound is present, based on the arrival time difference.

The example of the approaching vehicle information includes information on the presence or absence of the approaching vehicle, the approaching direction in a case where the approaching vehicle is present, and the relative distance to the host vehicle. Moreover, in a case where the approaching vehicle detection unit 22 is not operating, in the ECU 20A, the approaching vehicle information may not be transmitted to the driving support device 2, or the approaching vehicle information saying the detection process to stop may be transmitted to the driving support device 2.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The driving support device 2 is a device that gives various type of driving supports to the driver. In particular, the driving support device 2 performs the driving supports regarding the approaching vehicle at regular time intervals when the approaching vehicle information is received from the approaching vehicle detection device 1A. For example, in a case where an vehicle approaching to the host vehicle is present, the driving support device 2 determines the possibility of collision of the approaching vehicle and the host vehicle, outputs an alarm to the driver or provides information of the approaching vehicle when it is determined that there is a possibility of a collision, and further performs vehicle control such as an automatic braking when the possibility of collision is increased.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the operation of the approaching vehicle detection device 1A will be described.
