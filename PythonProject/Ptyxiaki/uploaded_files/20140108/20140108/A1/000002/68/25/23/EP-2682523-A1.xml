Predominantly, the logical concept of fast food restaurants is based on the single use<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> package, like a single use container. Single use means that after the consumption of the food, the package of the food is discarded.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Since such packages may consist of both cellulosic material, predominantly in form of fibres, like paper, paper board or other molded fibre items, or plastic materials like polyethylene, polypropylene or polyethylenterephtalate or of a mixture of cellulosic material and plastic material, a waste management based on recycling the material could be difficult, even impossible.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Although it is known that the big advantage of single use package is that the used package need not be taken back for cleaning and thus a lot of energy consumption, like for heating dishwater and/or drying of the cleaned single use packages, is avoided, besides maintaining high and reliable hygienic standards for public use, the main stream of single use packages is worldwide a big problem.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The problem is related to the nature of the waste stream of single use packages. As already mentioned, this waste consists of a mixture of plastic material and cellulosic material typically. In order to recycle this waste, it is necessary to separate the different materials which could be recycled after separation from each other. However, the waste stream containing a mixture of these materials makes it often impossible to separate and recycle the different materials economically.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Traditionally, in the manufacture of paper and paper board, paraffin waxes and synthetic polymers as plastic material are used as moisture retardants, water repellents, oil repellents, stiffness strengtheners and release agents. Consequently, the waste of such paper and paper board of which single use packages traditionally<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> are made, is not only difficult, but often impossible to be repulped and recycled in standard paper mill processes, because the polymers, in particular the waxes derived from petroleum, are not biodegradable in mill white waters (circulated process waters) and discharge effluents. Additionally, the residue of the waxes that can't be removed from the pulp fibers during the repulping and recycling process can cause severe problems due to buildups that occurs on the screens and felts used during the process of forming and making the paper or paperboard sheet.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is also known that such waxes resist biodegradation and composting when disposed off in landfills and other waste disposal systems. Consequently, paper and paper board coated or impregnated with traditional synthetic polymers and waxes are often difficult, and even impossible to repulp and recycle owing to their resistance to separate from the fibres in the standard repulping processes resulting in significant fibre losses in efforts to repulp and thus recycle them. Moreover, often such synthetic polymers are also not biodegradable and therefore resist composting.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Although it is known that such impregnated paper and/or paper board can be repulped by using specialized repulping machinery that separates the pulp fibres from the laminated films and/or impregnation material, this is far more expensive in terms of operating costs and/or recycled pulp fibre yields in comparison to standard repulping processes. The action of separating the fibres from any impregnating synthetic and/or plastic material damages some fibres causing them to be selected out of the recycled pulp and to be lost for reuse. Additionally a separated plastic material waste carries some of the fibres out of the repulpate when its adherence to the fibres is not hindered by the repulping process. Likewise, not only synthetic material used as sheets for the manufacture of paper and paper board, but also<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> coatings and impregnating products made from synthetic materials like waxes, can be repulped for recycling only in specially configured repulping equipment that removes and separates the waxes. However, these more intense physical and chemical requirements of these repulping processes coupled with a loss of fibres that become trapped in the wax cause the recyclable repulped fibre levels to fall far below those of the standard repulping processes. In addition, packages made from such products are not biodegradable and must be separated and deposited in separate landfill areas.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is an indispensable requirement that a recyclable sheet material should not only be repulpable and recyclable according to standard paper mill processes but should also maintain a sufficient high water barrier after exposure to high mechanical forces which are necessary for example during folding a paper board or other sheet material based on cellulosic material in order to form a container. This folding is known to have sometimes an impairing effect on the water resistance of a sheet material by cracking of a water coating or water impregnation during the forming of a container used for foodstuff containing water. For this use a considerable risk exists that by using a sheet material having only one surface coating or impregnation as water barrier the water barrier is considerably reduced after forming a container.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a recyclable sheet material especially for forming a container thereof, preferably for single use, based on cellulosic material, preferably on a paper board, which can be repulped and recycled according to standard paper mill processes and provides a sufficient high water barrier for foodstuff containing water even after being used for the production of containers of various kinds, especially single use cups, under exposure to<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> mechanical forces. In addition, the residue of the repulped sheet material if any is also preferably biodegradable and can be composted when disposed of in a landfill or other dispose systems.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">This object is solved by providing a recyclable and preferably repulpable sheet material comprising
