Internal hemorrhoids are located above the anal canal and are covered by a mucosa. On the other hand, those external are located below the anorectal union and are covered by outer skin. Among the main symptoms of hemorrhoids are included: (a) anal pain, especially while sitting; (b) anal itching; (c) blood on toilet tissue, stool or in the toilet bowl; (d) pain during bowel movements; and (e) one or more hard tender lumps near the anus.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Around 5% of the population in western countries has symptoms related to hemorrhoids, and the prevalence of the aforementioned symptoms reaches 50% from 50 years of age. It is estimated, approximately, from 50% to 75% of the western population has hemorrhoid symptoms at some point in their lives.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Sedentary occupations, efforts during the work or sport, keep standing for a long time and certain dietary habits are other causes involved in the formation of hemorrhoids.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Hemorrhoids generally appear before the constipation, and this is usually secondary to them, rather than vice versa. Diarrhea, since it increases the anal pressure also increases the clinical incidence of hemorrhoids. Finally, it should be noted that there is often a family history suggesting a background or hereditary predisposition. Pregnancy is the most common cause of hemorrhoids in young women.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A solution widely used in the current state of the art is cryotherapy, i.e. the direct application of cold on the body, and whose main and commonly known effects are the vasoconstriction, the analgesic/anesthetic effect of its application and anti-inflammatory action, since it decreases the arrival of blood to a specific place. The described effects generate a clear<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> and fast relief of inflammation, pain, itching and bleeding caused by hemorrhoids.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Therefore, the objective technical problem that solves the present invention is the development of a device for local symptomatic relief of hemorrhoids, wherein said device is based on the application of techniques of cryotherapy, and being of direct application both for internal hemorrhoids and external hemorrhoids.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Therapeutic ice packs are currently employed for the application of these techniques, which are used for the reduction of swelling, as well as the relief of the pain occurred after the reduction/removal surgery of hemorrhoid or for traumatic injury. Thus, the use of ice packs is not new and has been used extensively in the medical field for this therapeutic treatment.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">To date, different cold applicators for the treatment of hemorrhoids are known.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Thus, the document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4331151A"><text>US4331151</text></patcit> describes a device suitable for its introduction through anal, specifically in the anal canal, formed of an essentially cylindrical body, transversely divided into two parts by a central panel extending longitudinally between two upper and lower ends with a coaxial tube with the body between both ends and which is the continuous access of a fluid at a constant temperature, this fluid being subsequently drained. By using a relatively cool fluid, such as cool water, this device may be used to provide a controlled temperature, for extended periods of time.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">This document presents as a drawback the need for drainage of the fluid, since this comes in direct contact with the hemorrhoid. On the other hand, it is not clear that this device, by its constitution and geometry allows the simultaneous treatment of internal and external hemorrhoids.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP0672400A"><text>EP 0672400</text></patcit> describes a cooling cylindrical device for removal of pain and therapeutic treatment of hemorrhoids and anal fissures comprising a body capable of being inserted into the anus and comprising a series of channels for cold liquid circulation, this being pumped by a pump provided for this purpose or operated by gravity from a container carried by the user.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Obviously, this device is relatively complex since it involves: (i) a peristaltic pump; or<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> (ii) a container carried by the user in an raised position so that some effect of circulation due to gravity is produced.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Document <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="CA1313482"><text>CA1313482</text></patcit> describes a device for the cold application in external and internal hemorrhoids which includes in its interior a certain cooled liquid that can be ice water or a specific gel. This device has a geometry of enlarged head followed by a narrower region as a neck, ending in a region with a enlarged radio again, this region being which receives the cooled liquid through its base, this liquid remaining sealed by means for this purpose.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Despite the fact that this document can be considered as the background closest to the invention, the objective technical problem which the present invention solves with this device is the improvement of the ergonomics of the device. The device described in the document <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="CA1313482"><text>CA1313482</text></patcit> has a phallic geometry, that is not the most appropriate for use in hemorrhoids, since it requires the dilation of the anus for its introduction, the fact that most of the time is impossible to get. In addition, the introduction of the broad part or head of this device is certainly painful when there is presence of external and internal hemorrhoids, since in the process of the introduction, the head logically will press against hemorrhoids in the narrower area, until finally it can be stayed inside.</p><heading id="h0002">Explanation of the invention</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">The anatomical applicator for hemorrhoids aims to a device equipped with a inner solution capable of increasing, due to its anatomical geometry, the effectiveness and applicability of cryotherapy, which is a technique recommended by healthcare specialists in the treatment of hemorrhoids. Therefore, the technical problem which the present invention solves is to provide an ergonomic device for the cold application in the relief of symptoms of internal and/or external hemorrhoids.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The anatomical applicator object of the present invention is made of a plastic material, polyethylene in a preferred embodiment, and houses inside a freezable fluid. Said fluid is a eutectic mixture enabling to maintain a temperature range comprised between 7 °C and 13 °C for approximately 10 minutes.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Thus, the object of the present invention is an anatomical geometry device made of<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> polyethylene containing a cold storage medium thanks to the incorporation of a liquid eutectic mixture inside it, which allows to maintain the cryotherapeutic capacity of the product during an optimum effective time for the relief of hemorrhoids in the affected area. This is added to its particular anatomical shape to be adapted to the rectal area of the body.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The effect of reduction of temperature in the condition area facilitates the reduction of fluids in the intracellular compartment in interstitial areas (reducing inflammation by accumulation of fluids) that causes the swelling or edema. The application of cold is an effective technique for the reduction of swelling in that region.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The use of the cold applicator in a localized area reduces the pressure in the affected area and, thus reducing the pain within the first six to twelve hours. Similarly, the applicator helps in constriction and maintenance of capillary vessels to slow or reduce the bleeding from blood vessels cut.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Throughout the description and claims, the word "comprises" and its variations are not intended to exclude other technical features, additives, components or steps.

In such a way it is provided the cold required to reduce the swelling and relieve the painful symptoms of hemorrhoids, avoiding any risk of bums or cracks produced by the application of ice or an extreme cold. In addition, their anatomical design facilitates its introduction until the stop marked by the base, preventing an introduction higher than that recommended, avoiding accidents or damage to the customer in inner areas of the anus and the rectum.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Thanks to the applicator so described, it is possible to treat internal and external hemorrhoids, facilitating their introduction into the rectal area due to its special configuration, being a unique and simple tool for the treatment and relief of hemorrhoids and, in addition, it can be used easily by the patient without the help of a doctor or healthcare professional.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The use of the applicator object of the invention is shown in more detail in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>. On the other hand, the instructions for use of the applicator lies in keeping the applicator in the freezer, as indicated, until its application, leaving it out around between 1 and 5 minutes prior to use.
