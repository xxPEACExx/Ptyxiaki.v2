Commonly known such fastening arrangements comprise a screw-threaded bolt which passes through an aperture in the panel and a plastic retaining member which is screw threaded onto the free end of the bolt so that it is generally held in a fixed position on the bolt for rotation with it. The plastic retaining member is spaced from the head of the bolt a sufficient distance to enable the support to be gripped between the rear face of the panel and the opposed faces of respective transversely extending shoulders on the retaining element. The support is provided with an elongate hole and the retaining member has a similar elongate cross-section so that it can be passed through the slot and then turned or rotated so that its transversely extending shoulders grip the rear of the support. In order to ensure positive positioning of the retaining element when it is turned into the fastening position at its end nearer to the head of the bolt, the retaining element is formed with an axially extending protrusion effectively limit rotation of the retaining element to the desired degree of rotation, adjacent faces coming into engagement with the sides of the elongate aperture to define the inoperative and fastening position.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, it is seen that in many situations, the surface on which the electrical box is mounted is uneven or aforementioned cover or support are of different thickness. Prior arts show that different technologies have been used to account for such variations such as use of a corrugated spacer in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5108243A"><text>US 5,108,243 (Antonucci</text></patcit>) or use of a resilient member such as a spring in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US4166309A"><text>US 4,166,309 (Schenk</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In Schenk's patent, a quarter turn fastener of single stud length is used and the height of the receptacle is adjusted for the panel thickness after installation. After installation and insertion of the stud through the panels and into the receptacle, permits turning until the required tension are obtained between the stud<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> and the receptacle to hold the panels in fastened position. This automatically sets the height of the receptacle spring and from then on this height is maintained with normal quarter turned operation as the stud is fastened and unfastened during use. However, it is found the fastener arrangement in Schenk's patent provided low resistance to pull-out forces. Thus, the inventor's of the present invention endeavored to invent a fastening arrangement which allows for quick fixing adjustability and at the same time overcome prior art side effects to provide a high sustenance to pull-out forces.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><b><u>Summary of the invention:</u></b> The present invention relates to a quick fix fixing arrangement for quick installation of electrical equipment housed within electrical receptacle such that the arrangement comprises a fastener for engaging a fixing frame and an electrical receptacle. More particularly, the present invention relates to an adjustable fastening arrangement which has the feature of adjustability of the height of the frame to variable rotation and said arrangement can withstand high pull out force.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><b><u>Detailed description of drawings:</u></b> A full understanding of the invention can be gained from the following description of the preferred embodiments when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:

The arrangement <b>(10)</b> comprises of a fastener <b>(11)</b> having a central body <b>(12)</b> with enlarged head portion <b>(13)</b> and a small diameter end portion <b>(14)</b> for linking with top surface <b>(27)</b> of a non-metallic electrical receptacle <b>(24).</b> The enlarged head portion <b>(13)</b> allows steering of the fastener <b>(11)</b> by using hand-held projection <b>(15)</b> of the head portion <b>(13)</b> such as an arched thumb tab by which the fastener <b>(11)</b> can be held for fastening into the frame slot <b>(22).</b> In an alternate embodiment, the fastener <b>(11)</b> can be steered using any suitable tool <b>(16)</b> such as a plier, screw driver, allen key, pozi drive head as seen in <figref idrefs="f0006">figure 5 and 5A</figref>. In this alternate embodiment as seen in <figref idrefs="f0006">figure 5B</figref>, the fastener is provided with a groove <b>34</b> for receiving the tool <b>16.</b><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The electrical equipment <b>(20)</b> to be installed is housed in the enclosure <b>(23)</b> of electrical receptacle <b>(24).</b> The receptacle <b>(24)</b> comprises of a mounting base <b>(25)</b> surrounded by side walls <b>(26).</b> The top surface <b>(27)</b> of the receptacle <b>(24)</b> is formed by a continuous periphery formed at the base of side walls <b>(26).</b> Thus the top surface <b>(27)</b> provides a cavity <b>(31)</b> through which the electrical equipment <b>(20)</b> is introduced within the receptacle <b>(24).</b> The frame <b>(21)</b> may be provided with a cover <b>(29)</b> to protect the equipment <b>(20)</b> from dust, insects and moisture. A variety of electrical equipment can be installed using the arrangement of the present invention, such as switch, socket, movement detector, VDI devices, controls devices etc.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The arrangement <b>(10)</b> further comprises of a fixing frame <b>(21)</b> having at least one slot <b>(22)</b> corresponding to the shape of the central body <b>(12)</b> and for permitting passage of the fastener end portion <b>(14).</b> The number of slots per frame can be increased to as many as required to achieve perfect coupling with the electrical receptacle. The non-metallic electrical receptacle comprises an enclosure <b>(23)</b> for housing the electrical equipment <b>(20)</b> and includes on its top surface <b>(27)</b> at least one channel <b>(17)</b> having an aperture <b>(28)</b> on at least one of its ends for receiving the fastener end portion <b>(14).</b> Ordinarily the number of slots on the frame correspond to the number of apertures and hence the channels on the electrical receptacle. Further, the frame slot <b>(22)</b> is advantageously adapted to be in alignment <b>(A)</b> with the aperture <b>(28)</b> to allow the fastener <b>(11)</b> to pass through the aligned openings <b>(22, 28)</b> for coupling the receptacle <b>(24)</b> with the fixing frame. The degree of curvature (θ) of the slot <b>(22)</b> and aperture <b>(28)</b> is desired to be identical.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However, during day-to-day activities of installation, maintenance etc, one often finds that a receptacle which has to be coupled does not have a smooth top surface or where the surface on which the frame-coupled-receptacle is to be mounted such as wall or wooden surface is uneven. For such situations, the present invention advantageously provides that the dimensions of the frame slot <b>(22)</b> permits deviation of alignment <b>(A)</b> of the fixing frame <b>(21)</b> up to ±11° with respect to the receptacle <b>(24)</b> to achieve perfect coupling of the receptacle <b>(24)</b> thereto (<figref idrefs="f0008">Fig 7</figref>). Further, the central body <b>(12)</b> includes at least one flange <b>(18)</b> on its outer<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> surface which permits adjustment of height <b>(H)</b> of the frame <b>(21)</b> with respect to the top surface <b>(27)</b> of the receptacle <b>(24)</b> to a variable length. Accordingly the height <b>(H)</b> can be adjusted up to 30mm, preferably 20 mm and more preferably from 0mm up to 14 mm from the top surface <b>(27)</b> of the electrical receptacle <b>(24).</b> It is to be understood that the number of flanges may be increased so as to support sustenance of desired height of the fastener. The flange bears two co-linear end points <b><i>(x)</i></b> and <b><i>(y).</i></b> In an alternate embodiment represented by <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 1A</figref>, the flange <b>(18<sup>1</sup>)</b> is in shape of a helix and bears a helical angle of 1°-15° between two ends <b>(<i>x</i>)</b> and <b><i>(y)</i></b> of the flange. The helical angle advantageously prevents height slack when the fastener is reinserted within the same alignment of slot and apertures.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The enlarged head portion <b>(13)</b> of the fastener <b>(11)</b> extends into a stub <b>(32)</b> which prevents rotation of the fastener <b>(11)</b> beyond the degree of curvature (θ) of the slot <b>(22).</b> Thus the fastener <b>(11)</b> will not be allowed to rotate beyond the predecided amount of rotation. The degree of curvature (θ) of the slot is between 45°-180°, preferably 45°-135° and more preferably 60°-90°. The fastener <b>(11)</b> is partially metal or even completely metallic in nature whereas the fixing frame <b>(21)</b> can be made from either metallic or non-metallic.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">On receiving the fasteners <b>(11)</b> into the channels <b>(17),</b> the enclosure <b>(23)</b> is pierced or bit into by the sharp edges <b>(19)</b> of the flange (18). This ensures that the fastener has high resistance to pull out force and cannot be removed easily. The pull out force that can be achieved by the present invention is between 10-50 kgs, preferably between 10-35 kgs and more preferably between 15-30 kgs. The electrical receptacle <b>(24)</b> of the present invention is made up of any suitable non-metallic or metallic material including soft metals which can be easily pierced and at the same time permit high pullout forces.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present invention further provides for a method for quick installation of electrical equipment <b>(20)</b> by using the quick fix fixing arrangement <b>(10)</b> of the present invention. In accordance with <figref idrefs="f0005">figure 4</figref>, the method comprises of inserting fastener <b>(11)</b> into slot <b>(22)</b> of fixing frame <b>(21)</b> as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0005">figure 4A</figref>. As seen in <figref idrefs="f0005">figure 4B</figref>, the fastener-received-slot <b>(22)</b> is aligned with aperture <b>(28)</b> of the electrical receptacle <b>(24)</b> housed with the electrical equipment <b>(20)</b> to achieve alignment <b>(A).</b> The fastener end portion <b>(14)</b> is inserted into alignment <b>(A)</b> of slot<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> <b>(22)</b> and aperture <b>(28)</b> such that it is substantially received within the channels <b>(17).</b> The height <b>(H)</b> of the fastener <b>(11)</b> is adjusted with respect to the top surface <b>(27)</b> of the receptacle and the fastener <b>(11)</b> is rotated along the length (t) of the frame to the pre-determined degree of curvature (θ) of the slot <b>(22)</b> till further rotation is prevented by stub <b>(32)</b> to achieve quick fix fixing arrangement <b>(10).</b></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In accordance with <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 6</figref>, the present invention further provides for a method for quick installing of at least one electrical equipment <b>(20)</b> housed within an electrical receptacle <b>(24)</b> on a suitable mounting surface <b>(33),</b> the method comprises of inserting fastener <b>(11)</b> into slot <b>(22)</b> of fixing frame <b>(21)</b> as depicted in <figref idrefs="f0005">figure 4A</figref>. As seen in <figref idrefs="f0005">figure 4B</figref>, the fastener-received-slot <b>(22)</b> is aligned with aperture <b>(28)</b> of the electrical receptacle <b>(24)</b> housed with the electrical equipment <b>(20)</b> to achieve alignment <b>(A).</b> The fastener end portion <b>(14)</b> is inserted into alignment <b>(A)</b> of slot <b>(22)</b> and aperture <b>(28)</b> such that it is substantially received within the channels <b>(17).</b> The height <b>(H)</b> of the fastener <b>(11)</b> is adjusted with respect to the top surface <b>(27)</b> of the receptacle and the mounting surface <b>(33)</b> and the fastener <b>(11)</b> is rotated along the length (t) of the frame to the pre-determined degree of curvature (θ) of the slot <b>(22)</b> till further rotation is prevented by stub <b>(32)</b> to achieve quick fix fixing arrangement <b>(10).</b></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Thus the present invention advantageously provides for quick installation of electrical equipment without wasting time in using the convention methods of employing self-tapping screws and yet providing high pull out forces. The quick fix fixing arrangement of the present invention is preferably installed by hand i.e. use of tools is not mandatory. The arrangement also accommodates for surface irregularities of the receptacle as well as the mounting surface enabling it to be used in almost all situations without any limitations.
