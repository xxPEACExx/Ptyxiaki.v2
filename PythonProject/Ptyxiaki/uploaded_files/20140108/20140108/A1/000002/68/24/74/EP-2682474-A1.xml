studied with great efforts, among which the method of killing cells by forming ion channels on the cellular membrane of bacteria directly turns to be a promising approach. There are a lot of bacterial toxins working in said mechanism in the nature. The model example of such toxin is colicin, a bacterium toxin secreted by Escherichia coli. Early in 1946, H. Florey et al., the inventor of penicillin, had evaluated thoroughly about colicin on its antibacterial activity, safety and toxicology (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>British J. of Experimental Pathology. 1946(27), 378∼390</text></nplcit>). They found that colicin is of great antibacterial activity, with very good antibacterial effect even after being diluted by millions of times. However, the antimicrobial spectrum of colicin is very specific, aiming only at Escherichia coli and some gram-negative bacteria with near relationships. Colicin la was found by Jacob et al. in 1953 with great antibacterial activity at pH 6-7. In 1978, Finkelstein et al. found an ion channel inducible colicin K that could form voltage dependent ion channels on artificial bimolecular lipid membrane, thus fundamentally explaining the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> antibacterial mechanism of the bacterial toxin, namely, forming fatal ion channels at the membrane of target cells. In 1996, Qiu and Finkelstein et al. revealed the transmembrane spatial structure of colicin la when the ion channels formed at the artificial bimolecular lipid membrane open or close, and thus provides a theoretical basis for the design and preparation of new antibiotics at a molecular level. In 2001, Qiu constructed and prepared an engineered antibacterial polypeptide medicine against drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus by fusing colicin with Staphylococcus aureus pheromone, said polypeptide having bactericidal activity and selectivity both in vivo and in vitro. Likewise, Qiu constructed engineered antibacterial polypeptides against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, said polypeptides exhibiting, in experiments both in vivo and in vitro, a specific, stable and rapid bactericidal effect against those pathogenic bacteria formidable to antibiotics now available, with pharmaceutical effect of tens to thousands times more than those of vancomycin, oxacillin, or penicillin, etc. Relevant results were published in papers such as <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Nature Biotechnology (21(12): 1480-85, 2003</text></nplcit>), and <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (49(3): 1184-1189, 2005</text></nplcit>), etc.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In this project, new research idea and approach is provided for the construction of engineered antibacterial polypeptides by fusing colicin with antibody mimics against pathogenic bacteria antigens, and an engineered antibacterial polypeptide, the broad-spectrum antibiotic pheromone medicine, has been successfully prepared. The inventor provides unique ideas and theoretical innovation in the field of antibacterial polypeptide drugs, with patents filed and methods established for the artificial construction of miniature antibody mimics, and relevant results published in <nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Nature biotechnology (25(8): 921-929, 2007</text></nplcit>). Owing to its special bactericidal mechanism, the novel efficient and broad-spectrum antibiotic pheromone medicine of the project exhibits a good bactericidal effect against drug-resistant bacteria, stronger than those of antibiotics now available, such as multiple drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRPA), methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin resistant enterococcus (VRE), etc.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> The development and preparation of said medicine will play an important role in solving problems caused by treatment of drug-resistant bacteria as well as health care.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The broad-spectrum antibiotic pheromone medicine of the project is an entirely different material from small peptide antibiotics (e.g., human perforin and silkworm antibacterial peptide) studied home and abroad. There are several differences between the two: (1) Same as colicin, said antibacterial engineered polypeptide works in a monomer conformation, i.e., one single molecule constructing a whole working unit; whereas small peptide antibiotics work in polymer conformations, i.e., tens of molecules constructing a whole working unit. (2) Same as colicin, said antibacterial engineered polypeptide may function inside of blood circulation and in vivo; whereas small peptide antibiotics cannot. (3) Same as colicin, said antibacterial engineered polypeptide forms voltage dependent ion channels on the cellular membrane of target cells, leading to a better bactericidal mechanism and higher efficiency than the channel formed by small peptide antibiotics on the cellular membrane of target cells. According to literatures of the art searched till 2010, almost all of said small peptide antibiotics have a fatal defect in animal experiments in vivo, namely, being degraded by proteases inside of animals. Therefore, none of drugs developed from single small peptide antibiotics drug precursor had passed clinical test. However, the prototype of the new antibacterial engineered polypeptide drug developed and prepared in the project is per se a bacteriocin produced from bacteria coexisting in human and animal alimentary canals with entirely different structure and function mechanism from single small peptide. In the 8 years of tests both in vivo and in vitro, the medicine always shows great bactericidal activity, and performs good bactericidal and therapeutic effect in large animal (e.g., milk cows and goats) models either administrated by local injections or by intravenous injections. Thus, there is no limitation for the new drug of said antibacterial engineered polypeptide to be used in vivo as those for said small peptides.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It's shown by searching literature that at present, colicin, bacterial signal transduction polypeptides as well as antibody modifications are studied respectively abroad, but there is no research conducted with such research idea or technique route as in the present project, and no similar paper published. It's shown by searching at NCBI <u>(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</u>) in June, 2010 that there were over 2600 literatures listed about colicin, over 7300 about pheromone, over 2100 about antibody reconstitution, over 3800 about immunotoxin, and over 94000 about antibiotic resistance, among which none such scientific conception, design idea or research practice as in the present project reported. In June, 2010, it's manifested in a novelty search by the novelty search workstation (No.1) of the Ministry of Education, P.R. China that, except for the present project reports, there was no report, both at home and abroad, on the construction of antibacterial engineered polypeptide medicine against target bacteria that utilizes colicin to bind to the target bacterial pheromone or artificial designed target bacterial antibody mimics. Meanwhile, there was no report, both at home and abroad, on human or animal drugs or pesticides prepared according to construction method of the targeted antibacterial engineered polypeptide of the project.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Said <b>broad-spectrum antibiotic pheromone medicine</b> has been developed for animal (a drug for the treatment of bovine mastitis) and human (antibiotics) in accordance with actual demands.

In May, 2010, it's proven in a safety evaluation by the Veterinary Drug Supervision &amp; Test Center, Ministry of Agriculture, P. R.
