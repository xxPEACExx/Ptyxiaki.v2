One example of a molding method for composite materials is the resin transfer molding (RTM) method. The RTM molding method is a molding method that involves placing a fiber-reinforced base material inside a male/female pair of molding dies, fastening the dies and evacuating the inside of the dies to a state of reduced pressure, and then injecting a resin into the inside of the dies through a resin injection port, thereby impregnating the fiber-reinforced base material with the resin.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 9</figref>, in a typical RTM molding method, the resin is injected from a resin injection line 2 provided at one end of the device, flows through the inside of a fiber-reinforced base material 11 in an in-plane direction, and is discharged from a suction line 3 provided at the opposite end of the device. In the RTM molding method, because the resin flows through the inside of the fiber-reinforced base material, low viscosity and high fluidity are essential characteristics for the resin.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The RTM method offers the advantage that molding can be performed with an extremely high level of shape precision. However, in the RTM molding method described above, because the resin is impregnated from one end of the fiber-reinforced base material through to the opposite end, if the member is increased in size and/or thickness, problems may arise, including the resin impregnation requiring a very long period of time, and the occurrence of non-impregnated regions. If the injection pressure is increased in order to raise the resin injection rate with the aim of shortening the impregnation time, then pressure loss increases, and there is a possibility that this may cause wrinkling of the fibers.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In order to address the problems mentioned above, methods such as those illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 10 and FIG. 11</figref> have been<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> proposed, in which the resin impregnation is performed through the thickness direction. <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 10</figref> is a method in which a plurality of injection ports are positioned in the upper die, and the resin is supplied to the fiber-reinforced base material through these ports, thereby impregnating the fiber-reinforced base material in the thickness direction. <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 11</figref> is a method in which a porous plate 41 and an intermediate member 40 are placed on top of the fiber-reinforced base material, and impregnation is performed in the thickness direction across substantially the entire surface of the fiber-reinforced base material. A perforated resin film or the like is used as the intermediate member 40.</p><heading id="h0003">Disclosure of Invention</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the method in which a plurality of injection ports are provided, such as the method illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 10</figref>, optimizing the locations of the injection ports requires a great deal of effort, and using the method for members of even greater size or members of greater thickness is problematic. Further, following mold release, the molding dies are generally cleaned and reused, and providing a plurality of injection ports makes cleaning a time-consuming process.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> In the method in which an intermediate member 40 is provided, such as the method illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 11</figref>, because the intermediate member 40 lacks rigidity, when the region inside the dies is placed under vacuum, the intermediate member 40 deforms and acts as a damper, making it difficult to ensure good dimensional (thickness) precision for the molded product.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Furthermore, structural members for aircraft and the like require a high degree of toughness. It is generally said that the resin viscosity and the toughness of the molded body are opposing properties. In other words, the toughness of a resin molded body formed by impregnating a fiber-reinforced base material with a resin for which the viscosity has been lowered by reducing the molecular weight or the like is lower than the toughness of a molded body formed using a resin of high viscosity with a large molecular weight. Accordingly, it is desirable that the fiber-reinforced base material is impregnated with a resin of high viscosity.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention has been developed in light of these circumstances, and has an object of providing an RTM molding device and RTM molding method which enable resin impregnation of even large members and thick members without causing non-impregnated regions or fiber wrinkle, and yield a<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> molded body having superior toughness and excellent precision, as well as providing a semi-molded body that can be used in the RTM molding device.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In order to achieve the above object, the present invention provides an RTM molding device comprising a molding die inside which a cavity is formed, and a resin injection line and a suction line that are connected to the cavity, the device configured such that a fiber-reinforced base material is placed in the cavity, the pressure inside the cavity is reduced, and a resin composition is injected into the cavity to impregnate the fiber-reinforced base material and form a molded body, wherein a surface molding layer, which is disposed between the fiber-reinforced base material and the molding die, has a plurality of through-holes formed therein, and has sufficient rigidity that the thickness does not substantially change under the pressure inside the cavity when the inside of the cavity is placed under reduced pressure, and a resin diffusion portion, which is located on the side of the surface molding layer opposite the fiber-reinforced base material, and comprises a resin flow path formed so as to connect with the plurality of through-holes of the surface molding layer, are provided on at least one surface of the fiber-reinforced base material.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> In one aspect of the invention described above, the diameter of the through-holes in the surface molding layer is preferably not more than a predetermined value that ensures that the shape of the through-holes is not transferred to the molded body under the pressure that exists when the inside of the cavity is placed under reduced pressure.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In one aspect of the invention described above, it is preferable that the resin diffusion portion is provided on at least one surface of the fiber-reinforced base material, on the side from which the resin is injected or the side from which the resin is discharged, and when the resin diffusion portion is provided on the side of the fiber-reinforced base material from which the resin is injected, the resin flow path is connected to the resin injection line, whereas when the resin diffusion portion is provided on the side of the fiber-reinforced base material from which the resin is discharged, the resin flow path is connected to the suction line.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">By providing a resin diffusion portion of the configuration described above, an open region through which the resin injected into the cavity can rapidly diffuse in the in-plane direction can be maintained. As a result, the resin can be supplied across the entire surface of the fiber-reinforced base material, and impregnates the base material in<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the thickness direction. Further, by providing the surface molding layer and the resin diffusion portion on the resin discharge side of the fiber-reinforced base material, the resin can be discharged across the entire surface of the fiber-reinforced base material. As a result, the fiber-reinforced base material can be impregnated with the resin composition in a short period of time, in a more uniform manner, and without wrinkling of the fibers.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the surface molding layer that contacts the fiber-reinforced base material, the through-holes are formed with a size that ensures that the hole shape is not transferred to the fiber-reinforced base material, and therefore the surface of the molded body can be formed as a smooth surface having no unevenness. The surface molding layer has sufficient rigidity that the thickness does not substantially change under the pressure inside the cavity during resin injection. As a result, the rigid porous member does not act as a damper during the step of impregnating the fiber-reinforced base material with the resin, and therefore superior precision in the thickness of the molded body can be achieved. The expression that "the thickness does not substantially change" includes those cases where the thickness changes by an amount within a range permitted by the dimensional precision required for the molded body. For example, in the case of primary<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> structural members for aircraft, a dimensional precision of not more than approximately ±0.1 mm is sometimes required.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In one aspect of the invention described above, the resin diffusion portion may be composed of at least one resin diffusion layer, which has a plurality of through-holes formed therein, the through-holes having a larger diameter than the through-holes formed in the adjacent layer on the side of the fiber-reinforced base material, has sufficient rigidity that the thickness does not substantially change under the aforementioned pressure, and is disposed between the surface molding layer and the molding die, wherein the through-holes formed in each layer connect with the through-holes formed in the adjacent layer to form a resin flow path.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">By forming the resin diffusion portion as a resin diffusion layer, the fiber-reinforced base material can be impregnated with the resin composition without requiring processing of the molding die, and with the impregnation performed in a short period of time, in a more uniform manner, and without wrinkling of the fibers.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The resin diffusion layer has sufficient rigidity that the thickness does not substantially change under the pressure inside the cavity during resin injection. As a result, the rigid porous member does not act as a damper during the step<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> of impregnating the fiber-reinforced base material with the resin, and therefore superior precision in the thickness of the molded body can be achieved.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Because the through-holes formed in the resin diffusion layer are larger than the through-holes formed in the layer positioned on the side of the fiber-reinforced base material, the injected resin diffuses rapidly.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Because the holes formed in the resin diffusion layer narrow in a stepwise manner in the direction of the surface molding layer, one layer can be prevented from falling into the hole of another layer.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In one aspect of the invention described above, the resin diffusion layer is preferably a porous plate formed from a punched metal. Further, in another aspect of the invention described above, the surface molding layer is preferably a porous plate formed from a punched metal.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Because punched metal is less expensive than perforated films, it can be used and discarded. As a result, cleaning of the molding dies following mold release is simplified. Further, punched metal exhibits greater rigidity than perforated films or the like, and therefore the thickness of the punched metal does not substantially change under the pressure inside the cavity.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In one aspect of the invention described above, the diameter of the through-holes formed in the surface molding layer is preferably not less than 0.3 mm and not more than 2 mm.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The hole diameter is preferably not less than 0.3 mm and not more than 2 mm, and more preferably not less than 0.5 mm and not more than 1 mm. If the hole diameter is too large, then, depending on the conditions, the rigidity of the fibers may succumb, resulting in bending of the fibers and an increased possibility that the shape of the holes may be transferred to the surface of the molded body. If the hole diameter is too small, then, depending on the conditions, the flow of the resin composition may be impaired.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In one aspect of the invention described above, the through-holes formed in the surface molding layer and the resin diffusion layer are preferably formed with a different shape from the through-holes formed in an adjacent layer.

The surface molding layer and the resin diffusion portion may also be provided on the resin discharge side of the fiber-reinforced base material, or may be provided on both the resin injection side and the resin discharge side.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">According to the RTM molding device of the structure described above, by adjusting the number of resin diffusion layers and the thickness of those layers, the same molding die can be used to mold molded bodies of different thicknesses. In other words, a minor change in the thickness does not require preparation of a new molding die. Further, a semi-molded body prepared by subjecting a rigid porous member and a fiber-reinforced base material to shape formation can also be used. This type of semi-molded body can prevent damage and deformation during transport.</p><heading id="h0008">Explanation of Reference:</heading><p id="p0083" num="0083"><ul><li>1, 21: Molding die<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --></li><li>2, 22: Resin injection line</li><li>3, 23: Suction line</li><li>4, 24: Surface molding layer</li><li>5: Resin diffusion portion</li><li>6, 26: Sealing member</li><li>7, 9, 10: Hole</li><li>8, 8a, 8b: Resin diffusion layer</li><li>11,31: Fiber-reinforced base material</li><li>40: Intermediate member</li><li>41: Porous plate</li><li>100, 200: RTM molding device</li></ul></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56983068" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An RTM molding device comprising:
