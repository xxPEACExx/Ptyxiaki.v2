This is particularly true when processing polyimide (PI) coated silicon wafers, which are widely used in the semi-conductor and other related industries. Prior to metal deposition it is common and desirable to remove material from the wafer surface by a sputter etch process (typically using Ar) in order to ensure a high quality metal/metal interface. This step is normally conducted in a physical vapour deposition (PVD) pre-clean module. However, prolonged or frequent etching of PI wafers through the PVD pre-clean module can lead to a build-up of sputtered material around the chamber lid and walls. This carbonaceous material can accumulate to such a level that particles can become loose and begin to move around the chamber, particularly during processing, and there is the potential for them falling onto and contaminating the wafers.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is known to seek to combat this problem by frequent use of an oxygen plasma. The oxygen step may be relatively short (e.g. 60s) and act as a conditioning step where no platen bias is required. It is believed that the introduction of an oxygen plasma into a carbonised chamber will promote carbon oxidation, leading to CO/CO<sub>2</sub> which may readily be pumped away. The removal of the material lowers the particle count.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the Applicants have monitored the whole process through optical spectroscopy. During the initial stages of the oxygen plasma, O<sub>2</sub> levels within the chamber are low whilst CO levels appear high. Presumably the Oxygen is converting the carbon species, present from the PI etching, to CO before reaching equilibrium.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The frequency of the oxygen plasma treatment tends to be selected by the customer depending on the rate of particle formation they experience and any other requirements they may have. However, for a typical Ar sputter clean etch where 150-300Å SiO<sub>2</sub> (or equivalent) is removed prior to the subsequent deposition step, it is likely that, within 50 to 100 PI coated wafers, an O<sub>2</sub> plasma clean will be required. Although this process provides effective particle control, that the Applicants have discovered that following such oxygen treatment there is a sharp reduction in etch rate directly afterwards. The drop in etch rate has been measured to be between 20 to 30%. This obviously leads to significant lack of uniformity between successive wafers and many semi-conductor manufacturers would not have accepted this initial drop in etch rate or the resultant drop in throughput, if they had been aware of the problem.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention consists in a method of etching successive substrates on a platen in a chamber in which the etching process results in carbonaceous deposits in the chamber, the method including:

However, as is well demonstrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> on the left-hand side, if the normal argon plasma etch is carried out then there is a significant drop in etch rate. However, the Applicants have determined that surprisingly if the chamber is subjected to a biased Ar plasma then the drop in etch rate is almost negligible as can be seen on the right-hand side of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Specifically after the O<sub>2</sub> an Ar plasma is struck in the chamber and the platen subjected to bias.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A schematic representation of a PVD pre-clean module is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>. The module, generally indicated at 10, comprises a ceramic chamber 11 having a gas inlet 12, a platen 13, which is moveable between a wafer load position and a processing position, an encircling strap 14 for inductively coupling a plasma 15 in the chamber in a known manner and an exhaust port 16. The platen is connected to an RF supply 17 for biasing a platen.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">This module is used to clean a wafer prior to a metal deposition step in the PVD system. A wafer is placed on the platen assembly in the vacuum chamber which strikes a plasma using the strap 14, which is connected to an RF source not shown and the RF supply to the platen.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">After sputter etching the polyimide wafers with Ar containing plasma the ceramic walls and the chamber lid become coated with carbon deposits which are emitted from the high carbon surface. The carbon deposits are removed by an O<sub>2</sub>-based plasma step as previously described. After the oxygen treatment it is likely that some of the oxygen will reside within the internal chamber ceramic and the gas entry point at the top of the chamber; this oxygen may be agitated by the temperature rise during plasma processing and therefore diffuse out into the chamber, altering the nature of the plasma and consequently lowering the etch rate.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The Argon recovery plasma works by exposing the chamber to high temperature and this causes diffusion of oxygen trapped in the chamber body out into the plasma, in the gaseous state. After a certain amount of time enough oxygen will have been removed from the ceramic walls to restore the etch rate to its original value. This process is carried out either with a dummy wafer or on a ceramic-coated platen that is able to be etched.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The Ar sputter etch and the Ar conditioning step have very similar process conditions. The Ar conditioning step would preferably be carried out on a thick ceramic platen (e.g. several mm thick) in order that no conditioning wafer is required.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The etch data of the chamber at a given time can be determined by running a test on a SiO<sub>2</sub> wafer by measuring the thickness before and after of known duration of plasma etch. Results at various stages of Pi processing as shown below.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> -->

The etch rate is in general known to be related to the density of the plasma and hence the ion flux at the surface of the wafer. Plasma density can be monitored using an optical microscope to detect the intensity of the light emitted. Typically an optical emission spectrometer is used to detect the intensity of light emitted at various frequencies (e.g. in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig 5</figref> where O<sub>2</sub>=772nm and Ar=763nm) The integrated plasma intensity which is related to rotation flux is typically greater for an unbiased peak than in biased cases. However, when the intensity of a non-biased plasma was increased by increasing the gas flow (600sccm) and coil<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> power (1500w) to match the density of the bias plasma, the etch rate still did not improve.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref> shows the optical spectrum obtained during Ar and O<sub>2</sub> plasma processing, the high intensity non-biased Ar recovery step is highlighted and the measured etch rates are also displayed.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The plasma intensity observed for the recovery step is slightly higher than the biased argon plasma in this case and yet still the recovering etch rate is not as good as an equivalent biased plasma. It would therefore appear that the platen bias is playing a role separate from increasing plasma intensity in achieving the unexpected etch rate recovery.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref> illustrates the stability of etch rate recovery with 600s biased Ar plasma. This shows the results obtained after processing 550pi wafers, with O<sub>2</sub>/Ar recovery step occurring after every 50 wafers. The etch rate has a wafer to wafer non-uniformity 1σ(%) of 1.65 which is within most customer specifications.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The table in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref> illustrates the relationship between recovery and bias. Increasing bias improves the rate of recovery but between 400 and 800 watts the increase in improvement is limited and a preferred process would run at 600 watts.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56981952" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A method of etching successive substrates on a platen in an inductively coupled plasma chamber in which the etching process results in carbonaceous deposits in the chamber, the method including:
