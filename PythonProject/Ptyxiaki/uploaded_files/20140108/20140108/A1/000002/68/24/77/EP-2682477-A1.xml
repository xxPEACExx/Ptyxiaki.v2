The goal of the invention is to allow early detection and diagnosis of breast cancers as well as individualised treatment for patients. The markers are particularly suitable for the detection and assessment of Luminal A breast cancer.</p><heading id="h0002"><b><u>Background to the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Breast cancer is an extremely important disease in Irish Society. It is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in Irish women (with over 2,600 new diagnoses annually), and accounts for the greatest number of cancer related deaths in women. With 1 in 8 Irish women being diagnosed with breast cancer, it is a disease which impacts, in some way, most peoples lives. Breast cancer is an extremely prevalent disease accounting for the greatest number of cancers diagnosed and the greatest number of deaths from cancer in women in Ireland. When diagnosed and treated early, breast cancer is a highly curable disease, and the past decade has witnessed major advances in its management. However, many women continue to die from this disease process as a consequence of late diagnosis, with incurable metastases at the time of presentation. The focus of the invention is on the development of sensitive, specific, minimally invasive biomarkers for breast cancer that can be utilised to detect early tumours, as well as being applied to monitoring the response to treatment, and detecting disease recurrence. MiRNAs are a class of small, non-coding RNA fragments that have captured the attention and innovation of the scientific community since their discovery almost twenty years ago. The discovery that MiRNAs are dysregulated in several disease processes, including carcinogenesis, has unveiled their putative role as disease-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Currently diagnosis of breast cancer involves a combination of clinical examination, radiological imaging and an invasive tissue biopsy, to provide histological confirmation. Mammography is currently considered the gold standard for diagnosis, yet it is not without its constraints, with both ionisation exposure and a false positive rate of up to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> 10%. Small curable early cancers can potentially be missed. When diagnosed promptly, women are more likely to have early stage disease, confined to the breast. These cases are amenable to breast conserving surgery. In cases where tumour cells have metastasised to the lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis more extensive local surgery and auxiliary surgery (an auxiliary lymph node clearance is often required). This procedure carries the potential for severe complications, including lymphoedema, which impacts extensively on one's quality of life. More over, tumour cells in the lymph nodes may be an indicator of distant metastases elsewhere, that are undetectable by current strategies. Current practice demands that the majority of these women receive adjunct chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapies. The decision to commence such regiments should not be taken lightly as each of these treatment modalities has an associate cluster of adverse effects. The appropriateness of adjunct therapy is usually based on a culmination of histological and patient factors. Only two predicted markers are validated and routinely assessed in the management of breast cancer. One of these is Oestrogen Receptor (ER) status and the other is Her2/neureceptor status. These markers indicate that there is a likely benefit to be achieved from treatment with hormonal therapies or Trastuzumab, respectively.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNA fragments that are ideal biomarker candidates and therapeutic targets. MiRNAs have been demonstrated to play a key role in practically all aspects of the cell cycle. They function at a post-transcriptional level to cause either transcriptional cleavage or transcriptional repression. MiRNAs are abberently expressed in almost all pathological conditions, including carcinogenesis and have a putative role as oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes. MiRNAs have the advantage that they can be detected in the systemic circulation, and thus diagnostic assay is based on miRNAs are not invasive.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The concept of breast screening is now accepted internationally and is associated with an improved outcome from breast cancer due to its earlier diagnosis. However, it is not without its drawbacks; a high proportion of lobular carcinomas are mammographically occult dense breasts make the interpretation of the mammogram difficult and there are high false negative rates. Therefore, the development of a blood based diagnostic tool would be a significant advantage as it would permit screening to begin at a younger age and could potentially successfully diagnose tumours which are not detectable by mammography.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Over the past decade our understanding of breast cancer has advanced remarkably. It is a heterogeneous disease, with distinct molecular subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2/<i>neu</i> over-expressing and Basal). Luminal A is the most common sub-type of breast cancer with over 70% of breast tumours falling into this category. Luminal A tumours are characterised by hormone receptor positivity (oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) and HER2/<i>neu</i> negativity. Women diagnosed with Luminal A tumours typically have a good prognosis, with a five year survival over 90%. However, with most breast tumours being Luminal A, it forms a good starting point on which to base a diagnostic test.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>Object of the Invention</u></b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is an objective of the present invention to identify novel biomarkers which could be used in the diagnosis, prognosis or prediction of response to medical treatment of breast cancer.

Women with breast cancer were identified at the Symptomatic Breast Unit where they were referred by their General Practitioner for investigation of a newly palpable breast lesion, or other symptoms suggestive of malignancy. All women in the cancer group had Luminal A breast cancer which was confirmed by histology, immunohistochemistry and fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH). Demographic details and clinicopathological parameters were prospectively collected. Whole blood samples were prospectively collected from women with a new diagnosis of Luminal A breast cancer, at the time of diagnosis. Whole blood samples were also collected from healthy female volunteers who served as the control group.

Similarly, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>, <i>miR-652</i> was significantly down-regulated in the blood of women with breast cancer compared to those normal patients (p=0.001).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">It is an important attribute of any biomarker that it is able to detect both early and late stage disease. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">figure 5</figref>, both <i>miR-181a</i> and <i>miR-652</i> were down-regulated in both early and late stage disease. <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref> also shows that there is a correlation between the circulating expression level of <i>miR-181a</i> and invasive tumour size.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Binary logistics regression analysis was performed in order to determine the accuracy of a combination of both <i>miR-181a</i> and <i>miR-652</i> in predicting women with Luminal A<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> breast cancer from controls, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref>. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.77, which models a combination of the sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of the combination of <i>miR-181a</i> and <i>miR-652</i> for distinguishing between those with cancer and the controls was 70% and 65%, respectively.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref>, the two novel biomarkers identified in the present application, in combination, provide a sensitivity and specificity profile which exceeds that of several current clinical biomarkers.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The words "comprises/comprising" and the words "having/including" when used herein with reference to the present invention are used to specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps or components but does not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, components or groups thereof.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">It is appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment.
