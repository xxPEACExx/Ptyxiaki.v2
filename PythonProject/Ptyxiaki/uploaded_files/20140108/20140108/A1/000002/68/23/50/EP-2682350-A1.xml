Also, it has distinguished properties such as high mechanical strength in spite of its light weight. Hence, it is used as a liquid container in a wide range of fields.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Meanwhile, in recent years, positive development has been made for further weight reduction and thickness reduction to meet social needs for resources saving, alleviation of environmental loads.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, with progress in the thickness reduction of the synthetic resin liquid container, there occurs deterioration in its self-standing ability when the liquid container is placed under a standing posture on a table or the like, thus tending to invite difficulty in its storage. Further, the liquid container would be accidentally collapsed during it use, hence, there was the risk of leakage of the liquid contained therein. Thus far, there has been proposed no effective measure to cope with these problems (no relevant patent documents or non-patent documents being present).</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b>Object to be Achieved by Invention</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Therefore, in view of the above-described problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a liquid container unit capable of effectively maintaining the storability of its liquid container and readiness of use even in the event of further progress in the thickness reduction of the liquid container.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0005"><b>Means for Achieving the Object</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">According to a first characterizing feature of the present invention, a liquid container unit comprises:

Therefore, even when the liquid container comprises a resin container having insufficient self-standing ability due to its smaller thickness than the conventional article or a bag-like container formed of soft wrapping material of synthetic resin, and an amount of liquid is charged in this liquid container, the liquid container can still be supported under the standing posture in a stable manner inside the support holder.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further, since there is provided a rotation preventing mechanism for preventing rotation of the retained portion relative to the retaining portion, the orientation of the opening portion relative to the support holder can be stable. Therefore, in the case of use when a threading (screw) type cap is attached to the opening portion of the liquid container, it is possible to prevent the phenomenon of the liquid container being rotated with the cap inside the support holder when one tries to rotate the cap relative to the opening portion. Therefore, the cap can be threadingly attached or detached to/from the liquid container in an easy and reliable manner.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Moreover, since the orientation of the opening portion relative to<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the support holder is stabilized by the function of the rotation preventing mechanism, even when the opening portion is deformed to have its portion formed narrower along the lateral direction or when a handle is attached to the support holder, this laterally oriented opening portion can always be used with stable orientation.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to a second characterizing feature of the present invention, a liquid container unit comprises:

Moreover, when the support holder storing the liquid container therein is supported under the standing posture, the liquid container is retained and supported via its retained portion by the retaining portion of the support holder. Therefore, even when the liquid container comprises a resin container having insufficient self-standing ability due to its smaller thickness than the conventional article or a bag-like container formed of soft wrapping material of synthetic resin, and an amount of liquid is charged in this liquid container, the liquid container can still be supported under the standing posture in a stable manner inside the support holder.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Further, since there is provided a rotation preventing mechanism for preventing rotation of the retained portion relative to the retaining portion, the orientation of the opening portion relative to the support holder can be stable.

Therefore, through a simple improvement or modification of forming in advance a retained portion for retaining the preform to the molding machine in a polygonal shape at the time of the blow molding operation and forming a rotation preventing face having a shape corresponding to this polygonal shape at the retaining portion of the support holder, it has become possible to utilize the retained portion for retaining the preform to the molding machine also as the retained portion of the rotation preventing mechanism and also it became possible to store the contents by the cap under the sealed state.</p><heading id="h0006"><b>Brief Description of the Drawings</b></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>] is a front view of a support holder storing a liquid<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> container,</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>] is a vertical section of the support holder storing the liquid container ,</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>] is a vertical section showing the principal portion of the support holder storing the liquid container,</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>] is a plane view showing a preform of the liquid container,</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref>] is a front view showing the preform of the liquid container,</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref>] is a perspective view showing the preform of the liquid container,</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 7</figref>] is a perspective view showing portions of the liquid container and the support holder,</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 8</figref>] is a plane view in partial horizontal section showing a variation of a retained portion and a retaining portion,</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 9</figref>] is a plane view in partial horizontal section showing a variation of a retained portion and a retaining portion,</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 10</figref>] is a plane view in partial horizontal section showing a variation of a retained portion and a retaining portion,</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 11</figref>] is a plane view in partial horizontal section showing a variation of a retained portion and a retaining portion,</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 12</figref>] is a plane view in partial horizontal section showing a variation of a retained portion and a retaining portion, and</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 13</figref>] is a plane view in partial horizontal section showing a variation of a retained portion and a retaining portion.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0007"><b>Modes of Embodying the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">Next, an embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">Figs. 1 through 3</figref>, a liquid container unit according to the present invention is comprised of a bottle-like liquid container 3 and a capsule-like support holder 7 for supporting the liquid container 3 in such a manner as to surround it entirely.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The liquid container 3 is a bottle obtained by blow-molding a preform made of polyester (PET) or polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), etc.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">At an opening portion 1 through which contained liquid of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> liquid container 3 is to be introduced or taken out, a threaded portion 2 is formed.

When the liquid container 3 is stored in the support holder 7, this storage is done with the polygonal-shape of the brim portion 5 being in substantial agreement or registry with the polygonal-shape of the rotation preventing face 10.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">As the liquid container 3 is prevented from being rotated inside<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the support holder 7 by the above function of the rotation preventing mechanism 8, one can attach/detach the cap 4 to/from the threaded portion 2 of the liquid container 3 simply by rotating the cap 4 or the cover member 13 while holding the outer side of the support holder 7.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, as the inner face contour of the support holder 7 corresponds to the outer face contour of the liquid container 3, the thickness of the gap formed between the inner face of the support holder 7 and the liquid container 3 is substantially constant, except for the vicinity of the opening portion 1. However, the support holder 7 is not formed with uniform thickness throughout.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">As may be understood from the cross sectional shape of the support holder 7 shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, in its region corresponding generally to the lower half of the body of the stored liquid container 3, the cross sectional shape of the support holder 7 has a relatively small and approximately constant thickness, except for the locally thinner hinge portion 12. On the other hand, in its region corresponding generally to the upper half of the body, the cross sectional shape of the holder 7 has basically a thickness which is progressively increased toward the retaining portion 6 located upwardly.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Incidentally, although the lower half portion of the support holder 7 has a relatively small thickness, this has sufficient rigidness to withstand being maintained under a stable posture by the bottom face of the support holder 7 even when the liquid container unit is placed in a standing posture on a generally horizontal surface.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The cover member 13 has a cross sectional shape whose thickness progressively increases from the upper end thereof for receiving the vicinity of the upper end of the cap 4 toward the lower end thereof corresponding to the upper end face of the support holder 7.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Further, the diameter of the lower end of the cover member 13 is approximately equal to the diameter of the upper end of the closed support holder 7. Also, the inclination angle of the conical face of the cover member 7 extending upwards from its lower end is substantially equal to the inclination angle of the conical face of the closed support holder 7 extending downwards from its upper end.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">As a result, the outer contour of the liquid container unit under the condition when the cover member 13 is placed on the upper end of<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the closed support holder 7 exhibits a simple and smooth streamlined shape or bullet-like shape as a whole, except for the bottom face of the support holder 7 and the upper face of the cover member 13 which are generally flat.</p><heading id="h0008"><b>[Other Embodiments]</b></heading><p id="p0043" num="0043"><ol><li>&lt;1&gt; The liquid container unit can be configured to be used in such a manner that the opening portion 1 of the liquid container 3 is basically constantly opened with no cap 4 being provided. Further, the liquid container liquid can be configured such that the unit includes a lid which is opened just by being pulled away, just like a cork stopper. Further, the opening portion 1 may have a shape which is laterally narrowed for greater readiness in taking out contained liquid therethrough. In this case too, the unit can be used with the orientation of the opening portion 1 relative to the support holder 7 being constantly stable by the function of the rotation preventing mechanism 8.</li><li>&lt;2&gt; As an alternative configuration of the rotation preventing mechanism 8, the neck portion of the liquid container 3 between the body and the threaded portion 2 may be formed with a polygonal shape and a polygonal-shaped rotation preventing face 10 may be formed at the retaining portion 6 of the support holder 7 projecting radially inwards to be engaged into this neck portion.</li><li>&lt;3&gt; The shape of the brim portion 5 can be any other desired polygonal shape as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 8</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 9</figref>, than the octagonal shape or can be an elliptical shape as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 10</figref>. Still alternatively, uneven portions may be formed in its circumferential portion as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 11</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 12</figref>. By providing the retaining portion 6 of the support holder 7 with an inner circumferential face having substantially same shape as the outer shape of these brim portions 5, the configuration required of the rotation preventing mechanism 8 can be realized.</li><li>&lt;4&gt; As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 13</figref>, the outer circumferential shape of the brim portion 5 may be an externally toothed gear shape and in the retaining portion 6, there may be formed uneven portions having internally toothed gear shape engageable with the externally toothed shape.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></li><li>&lt;5&gt; The support holder 7 may be embodied such that the liquid container 3 is not provided in the form of a capsule, but in the form of a cage-like frame.
