However, recently, an examination also has been made for a high-output power supply of an electric vehicle, a hybrid vehicle, and an electric tool. High-speed charge and discharge characteristics have been in demand for the electrode active material of the battery that is used as the high-output power supply. In addition, application of the lithium ion battery for smoothing of a power generation load, and a large-sized battery such as a stationary power supply and a backup power supply has also been examined, and long-term safety, reliability, resource abundance, and inexpensiveness (without problem in the amount of resources used) are regarded as important.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The lithium ion battery includes a positive electrode and a negative electrode which have properties capable of reversibly intercalating and deintercalating lithium ions, and a non-aqueous electrolyte.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The positive electrode is constituted by an electrode<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> material that contains a lithium-containing metal oxide having properties capable of reversibly intercalating and deintercalating lithium ions called a positive electrode active material, a conductive auxiliary agent, and a binder. The electrode material is applied on a surface of metallic foil called a current collector, whereby a positive electrode is obtained.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As the positive electrode active material, commonly, lithium cobaltate (LiCoO<sub>2</sub>) has been used. In addition to this, lithium (Li) compounds such as lithium nickelate (LiNiO<sub>2</sub>), lithium manganate (LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), and lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO<sub>4</sub>) have been used.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, among these lithium compounds, lithium cobaltate or lithium nickelate has various problems such as toxicity for the human body or the environment, resources, and an unstable charged state. In addition, the lithium manganate having a problem due to the lithium manganate dissolving in an electrolytic solution at a high temperature has been pointed out.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Therefore, recently, a phosphate-based electrode active material represented by lithium iron phosphate, which is excellent in long-term safety and reliability and has an olivine structure, has attracted attention.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The phosphate-based electrode active material does not<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> have sufficient electron conductivity, and thus variously devising refinement of particles, and complexation with a conductive material, and the like is needed to perform charge and discharge of a large current, and much effort has been made.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">However, in a case of performing the refinement of particles or the complexation by using a large amount of conductive material, a decrease in an electrode density is caused. Therefore, there is a problem in that a decrease in a density of a battery, that is, a decrease in a capacity per unit area is caused. Therefore, as a method of solving the problem, the following carbon coating method was found. In the carbon coating method, an organic material solution is used as a carbon precursor that is an electron conductive material, the organic material solution and electrode active material particles are mixed, and the resultant mixture is dried. A dried product that is obtained is subjected to a heat treatment under a non-oxidizing atmosphere to carbonize the organic material, whereby the surface of the electrode active material particles is coated with carbon.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The carbon coating method has the following excellent characteristics. That is, the surface of the electrode active material particles may be coated with a necessary minimum amount of carbon in a very efficient manner.

Summary of Invention</p><heading id="h0005">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">However, actually, among various types of electrode materials that may be obtained by the carbon coating method in the related art, only an electrode material in which a compound containing a small amount of heterogeneous element is added to a LiFePO<sub>4</sub> elementary substance or a LiFePO<sub>4</sub> elementary substance exhibits the effect. An electrode material other than LiFePO<sub>4</sub>, for example, an electrode material of LiMnPO<sub>4</sub> has been expected from the viewpoints that resources are relatively abundant, operation at a relatively high voltage is possible, and a relatively high energy density may be obtained. However, practically, exhibition of satisfactory electrode performance by coating with a small amount of carbon which does not have an adverse effect on the electrode density has not been realized.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The reason for the above-described circumstance is considered as follows. Mn is known as a negative catalyst that suppresses a carbonization reaction, and this is the biggest factor leading to the following result. Even when the carbon coating method using an organic material, which is effectively used in LiFePO<sub>4</sub>, is applied to LiMnPO<sub>4</sub>, a sufficient effect may not be obtained.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">An example in which the carbon coating is performed with<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> an electrode active material obtained by solid-soluting LiFePO<sub>4</sub> in LiMnPO<sub>4</sub> has been reported. However, this example is not different from a result in which Fe that is a carbonization catalyst appears on a particle surface by constituting the electrode active material with the solid solution. Here, in order to obtain an amount of activity of Fe on the particle surface which exceeds the amount of activity of Mn as a negative catalyst, it is necessary to solid-solute Fe in a large amount to the extent in which at least a ratio of Fe/Mn exceeds 10/90. However, this leads to the following result. A region in which a relative electrochemical reaction potential is low exceeds 10% of the entire region. Therefore, the effect of high-energy LiMnPO<sub>4</sub> at high electric potential may not be sufficiently exhibited.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As an electrode active material to solve the above-described problems, the present inventors suggest an electrode active material in which only a surface of the electrode active material of LiMnPO<sub>4</sub> or LiCoPO<sub>4</sub> on which the carbon coating by carbonization of an organic material is difficult is coated with a coating layer containing the minimum amount of LiFePO<sub>4</sub> or LiNiPO<sub>4</sub>, an electrode active material in which the surface of the coating layer is further coated with a coating layer containing carbonaceous electron conductive material, or an electrode active material in which the surface<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> of particles of LiMnPO<sub>4</sub> or LiCoPO<sub>4</sub> is coated with a coating layer formed from a composite material of LiFePO<sub>4</sub> or LiNiPO<sub>4</sub>, and a carbonaceous electron conductive material (Japanese Patent Application No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2010045235A"><text>2010-45235</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">However, in these electrode active materials, high energy with high electrical potential may be reliably realized.

As a result, a high-resistance organic decomposed material is generated in the electrode active material that is obtained.

When the average particle size of the primary particles is less than 0.01 µm, it is difficult to sufficiently coat the surface of the primary particles with a thin film-shaped coating layer containing the Li<sub>y</sub>E<sub>z</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and the carbonaceous electron conductive material.

When the average particle size of the secondary particles is less than 1 µm, an amount of a binding agent necessary during coating increases, and thus securement of sufficient bonding strength may become a factor of causing a decrease in an electrical capacity of an electrode. On the other hand, when the average<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> particle size of the secondary particles exceeds 200 µm, it is difficult to smoothly coat an electrode plate.
