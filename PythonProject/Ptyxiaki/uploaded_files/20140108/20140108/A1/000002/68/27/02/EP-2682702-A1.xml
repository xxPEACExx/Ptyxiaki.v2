Attempts to improve the heat exchanging capacity of a heat exchanger is always interesting and even small improvements are highly appreciated.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to provide a plate for a heat exchanger and a heat exchanger for improved primary as well as secondary heat exchange.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The above and further objects are achieved by means of a plate wherein the first side of said plate is configured not only with at least one heat transferring elevation, but also with at least one heat transfer surface which surrounds said elevation and where dimples are provided at either or both of the heat transfer surface and the heat transferring elevation to permit provision of the through-flow duct for the first medium, and wherein the second side of the plate is configured not only with at least one heat transferring depression, but also with at least one bonding surface which corresponds to said heat transfer surface and which surrounds said depression.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Thus, the heat transferring elevation on the first side of the plate defines a primary heat transfer area for the first medium and the heat transfer surface surrounding said elevation a secondary heat transfer area for the first medium and the heat transferring depression on the second side of the plate defines a primary heat transfer area for the second medium. Thereby, a plate for a heat exchanger is provided, by means of which a larger heat transfer area for said first medium, which is the medium having the smallest coefficient of heat transmission, e.g. air in relation to water, which shall flow at a smaller speed/pressure, is defined.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">By configuring the heat transferring elevation and the corresponding heat transferring depression such that the width thereof is many times larger than their height/depth and such that they have an extension with two or more straight, parallel or substantially parallel portions, the primary heat transfer areas for the first and the second medium respectively, are enlarged.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The above and other objects are achieved also by means of a heat exchanger wherein said plates are not only arranged such that the first side of each plate is abutting the first side of an adjacent plate in the stack, but also such that said plates thereby provide, by means of the dimples on either or both of the heat transfer surfaces and the heat transferring elevations on the first sides of two adjacent plates in the stack, the through-flow duct for the first medium between said first sides of said plates, and said plates are not only arranged such that the second side of each plate is abutting the second side of an<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> adjacent plate in the stack, but also such that said plates thereby define, by means of the heat transferring depressions on the second sides of two adjacent plates in the stack, at least one through-flow duct for the second medium between said second sides of said plates.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Thus, since the through-flow duct for the first medium is provided by means of opposing dimples on the heat transfer surfaces on the first sides of two adjacent plates in the stack, and since the through-flow duct for the second medium is defined by opposing heat transferring depressions on the second sides of two adjacent plates in the stack, a heat exchanger is provided, by means of which a larger volume of the through-flow duct for said first medium is defined.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Since the through-flow duct for the second medium is defined by opposing heat transferring depressions having a width which is many times larger than their depth, i.e. the heat transferring surface of the through-flow duct is large in relation to its volume, and having an extension with two or more straight, parallel or substantially parallel portions, the primary heat transferring capacity of the heat exchanger is improved.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As defined, a heat exchanger is provided, the total heat-exchanging capacity of which is improved and the costs for its manufacture are reduced.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">As defined, the heat exchanger may be used to provide e.g. an improved air cooler, i.e. one medium is air and the other a liquid.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention will be further described below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which

The first and second medium referred to may also be two different media, e.g. gas/liquid or two different gases or liquids.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As illustrated in particularly <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006">figs. 1-6</figref>, the plate 1 has a first side A and a second side B. The first side A of the plate 1 is configured with at least one heat transferring elevation 2. The first side A of the plate 1 is also configured to permit provision of a through-flow duct X (see <figref idrefs="f0008">fig. 8</figref>) for the first medium. The second side B of the plate 1 is configured with at least one heat transferring depression 3 substantially corresponding to the elevation 2 on<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the first side A, i.e. the depression defines the elevation 2 on said first side of the plate, with substantially the same length and width and with a depth corresponding to the height of said elevation. The heat transferring depression 3 is configured to define a part of a through-flow duct Y (see <figref idrefs="f0007">figs. 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">8</figref>) for the second medium. The heat transferring elevation 2 and the heat transferring depression 3 are brought to correspond to each other by subjecting the plate 1 to e.g. a stamping or punching process. If desired, more than one elevation 2 and corresponding depression 3 may be provided on the first side A and the second side B respectively, of the plate 1.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As is apparent from particularly <figref idrefs="f0001">figs. 1</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">6</figref>, the first side A of the plate 1 is further configured with at least one heat transfer surface 4 which surrounds the heat transferring elevation 2. The heat transfer surface 4 is provided with dimples 5 which permit provision of the through-flow duct X for the first medium. The elevation 2 on the first side A of the plate 1 defines a primary heat transfer area for the first medium and the heat transfer surface 4 surrounding said elevation a secondary heat transfer area for the first medium. These primary and secondary heat transfer areas, i.e. the area of said elevation 2 and the area of said heat transfer surface 4 are together substantially equal to the entire area of the first side A of the plate 1. Correspondingly, as is apparent from <figref idrefs="f0002">figs. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">6</figref>, the second side B of the plate 1 is further configured with at least one bonding surface 6 which corresponds to, i.e. has the same extension as the heat transfer surface 4 on the first side A, and which accordingly surrounds the heat transferring depression 3. The depression 3 defines a primary heat transfer area for the second medium. This primary heat transfer area, i.e. the area of the depression 3, is substantially equal to the entire area of said second side of the plate minus the area of the bonding surface 6. From the above, it is apparent that the combined heat transfer areas for the first medium are larger than the heat transfer area for the second medium. This feature is advantageous when the first medium has a smaller coefficient of heat transmission, such as air in relation to water, and shall flow at a smaller speed/pressure then the second medium in order to provide for optimum heat transfer. A heat exchanger comprising plates constructed as described above, will have an improved heat-exchanging capacity.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Thus, a primary heat transfer area as defined above is provided by a surface on a member of the plate which is in direct contact with one medium and where the opposite surface on said member is in direct contact with the other medium, and a secondary heat transfer area is provided by a surface on a member of the plate which is in direct contact with one<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> medium and where the opposite surface on said member is not in direct contact with the other medium.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">To permit provision of the through-flow duct X for the first medium, the heat transferring elevation 2 on the first side A of the plate 1 is configured with a first height h1 and the dimples 5 on the heat transfer surface 4 on said first side has a second height h2 which is larger than said first height (see particularly <figref idrefs="f0005">fig. 5</figref>). Thereby, the dimples 5 protrude up above the elevation 2. The heat transferring depression 3 on the second side B of the plate 1, corresponding to the elevation 2, is consequently configured with a depth corresponding substantially to said first height h1. The heat transferring elevation 2 on the first side A of the plate 1 is in the illustrated embodiment of the plate provided with additional dimples 7 to permit provision of the through-flow duct X for the first medium. For this purpose, these additional dimples 7 have a height which together with the (first) height h1 of the elevation 2 is larger than said first height. In the illustrated embodiments, the height of the dimples 7 and the height h1 of the elevation 2 corresponds substantially to said second height h2, i.e. to the height of the dimples 5 on the heat transfer surface 4. Thus, the height of the dimples 7 is h2 minus h1. In the illustrated embodiment of a plate according to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008">figs. 1-8</figref>, the heat transferring elevation 2 on the first side A of the plate has a first height h1 from the heat transfer surface 4 of about 0,5-1 millimeter and the corresponding heat transferring depression 3 on the second side B of the plate a depth from the bonding surface 6 corresponding substantially to said first height, and the dimples 5 on the heat transfer surface of side A has a second height h2 from said heat transfer surface of about 2-2,5 millimeters. These heights however, may vary in view of the intended application and size of the heat exchanger in which the plate shall be used. The dimples 5 and 7 on the first side A of the plate 1 can be made in any suitable manner, e.g. by a similar stamping or punching process as the heat transferring elevation 2/depression 3 such that corresponding depressions are formed in the bonding surface 6 and in the depression respectively, on the second side B of the plate, and simultaneously with said elevation/depression. The size, shape and number of the dimples 5, 7 may also vary in view of the intended application and size of the heat exchanger and so may the patterns in which they are arranged. The larger the plate 1, the more dimples 5, 7 providing distances and supporting points to permit provision of the through-flow duct X for the first medium will be required. It should be emphasized however, that according to the invention, it is possible to permit provision of the through-flow duct X for the first medium also by means of the dimples 5 on the heat transfer surface 4 only or by means of the dimples 7 on the heat<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> transferring elevation 2 only. In the illustrated embodiment, the dimples 5, 7 are substantially round.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The dimples 5, 7 on the first side A of the plate 1 are suitable for abutment against and assembly in any suitable manner with corresponding dimples on the first side of another plate such that said dimples thereby permit provision of the through-flow duct X for the first medium (<figref idrefs="f0008">fig. 8</figref>). The bonding surface 6 on the second side B of the plate 1 is in the same way suitable for abutment against and leak-free assembly in any suitable manner with a corresponding bonding surface on the second side of another plate such that the heat transferring depressions 3 on said plates thereby define the through-flow duct Y for the second medium (<figref idrefs="f0007">figs. 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">8</figref>). However, the dimples 5, 7 on the first side A of the plate 1 may also be located such that abutment against and assembly with corresponding dimples on the first side of another plate is avoided, i.e. the dimples on the two plates are in some way located offset relative to each other. Similarly, it is also possible to locate the heat transferring depression 3 on the second side B of the plate 1 such that it is offset relative to a heat transferring depression on the second side of another plate.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The heat transferring depression 3 defining a part of the through-flow duct Y for the second medium on the second side B of the plate and the corresponding heat transferring elevation 2 on the first side A of the plate, may vary in shape, size, number and location. Accordingly, the depression 3 and the corresponding elevation 2 may e.g. be U-shaped, comprising two straight, parallel or substantially parallel portions. However, in order to prolong the time for heat exchange between the first and second media, the depression 3 and the corresponding elevation 2 may alternatively have a substantially sinusoidal shape with three or more straight, parallel or substantially parallel portions, i.e. an uneven (see <figref idrefs="f0010">fig. 10</figref>) or (as in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007 f0008">figs. 1-8</figref>) an even number of straight, parallel or substantially parallel portions. In order to maximize the heat exchange between the first and second media, it is advantageous if the heat transfer area of the depression 3 and of the corresponding elevation 2 is as large as possible relative to the volume of the through-flow duct Y for the second medium. Therefore, the width w of the depression 3 and of the corresponding elevation 2 is in the illustrated embodiments substantially larger than the depth of said depression and the corresponding height of the elevation, e.g. at least about 5 times larger and preferably, as in the illustrated embodiments, about 50-70 times larger. Accordingly, in the illustrated embodiments with a heat transferring elevation 2 with a first height h1 of about 0,5-1 mm and a corresponding heat transferring depression 3 with a depth<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> corresponding to said first height, the width w of the elevation and the corresponding depression will be at least about 2,5 mm and preferably about 25-70 mm. The width w of the depression 3 and the corresponding elevation 2 may be constant or may also vary along its length, as illustrated in particularly <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">figs. 1-4</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0006">6</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0010">10</figref>.

Thus, if the first height h1 and the corresponding depth is about 0,5 mm, the width w of the heat transferring elevation 2 and the corresponding heat transferring depression 3 may decrease from about 35 mm to about 25 mm and then again increase to about 35 mm. At the portions of the depression 3 and the corresponding elevation 2 connecting the straight parallel portions thereof, the width w is much smaller than at said straight portions, in the illustrated embodiments about 20 times larger than the first height h1 and the depth corresponding thereto. Also, the depression 3 and the corresponding elevation 2 may, as in the illustrated embodiments with a rectangular plate 1, be provided with the straight parallel portions thereof running in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction of the plate or substantially transverse thereto. If desired, said straight parallel portions may alternatively run in the longitudinal direction of the plate 1 or in any other desired direction.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">To prevent compression of the through-flow duct Y for the second medium, the heat transferring depression 3 on the second side B of the plate 1 is configured with pressure resisting dimples 8.

By ending at the same level as the bonding surface 6 on the second side B of the plate 1, said dimples 8 may engage the corresponding dimples on the second side of another plate to prevent compression of the through-flow duct Y for the second medium, and may also contribute to safe and effective assembly of said second side with the second side of said other plate. The dimples 8 also promote the flow of the second medium through the through-flow duct Y therefore, by creating turbulence in said flow such that the heat exchanging effect is improved.
