For example, in power electronic converters, power semiconductor devices are used to facilitate power conversion between AC and DC networks, and each power semiconductor device requires its own power supply to energise its control and protection circuits, which are referenced to the voltage potential of its gate drive or base drive electronics. It is however impractical to connect the power supply of each power semiconductor device to the ground level voltage power supply system due to the difference in voltage levels between the power supply system and the individual components of the high voltage equipment.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">One solution is to self-power the power electronic converter by harvesting power from each level, but this requires local isolation between components on the same level if each level utilises more than one power semiconductor switching device.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Power electronic converters include high numbers of power semiconductor devices to enable the formation of complex voltage waveforms so as to improve power conversion quality and to achieve a desired power rating. The high number of power semiconductor devices in the power electronic converter requires a high number of transformers to provide power to each power semiconductor device. This leads to an overall increase in converter size and weight because the structure of conventional transformers tends to be physically large when required to accommodate high voltage levels.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In addition, the manufacture of these conventional transformers tends to involve manufacturing methods with low production capacity and poor yield, such as hand-crafted potting and vacuum impregnation.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For example, in cast resin ferrite transformers, the ferrite core cannot be encapsulated in a completely rigid setting resin because magnetisation of the magnetic core causes it to mechanically flex, and inhibiting this mechanical flexing is detrimental to the core's magnetic characteristics. Moreover, curing forces of the resin can fracture or crack the core, thus ruining its performance. Great skill and care is also required to manufacture<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the cast resin ferrite transformers with high yield, since it is necessary to cast the resin to be void-free in order to produce a competitively sized transformer that can withstand high electrical stress.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a transformer comprising:
<ul><li>one or more printed circuit board (PCB) substrates, the or each printed circuit board substrate including at least one substrate layer, wherein at least one printed circuit board substrate is a first printed circuit board substrate including at least one first substrate layer having a dielectric relative permittivity of less than or equal to 3.5; and</li><li>a plurality of electrically conductive traces, each electrically conductive trace being patterned on a surface of the substrate layer or one of the substrate layers to form a winding portion, the plurality of winding portions including at least one first winding portion and at least one second winding portion to define mutually coupled first and second windings,</li><li>wherein the first winding is formed by one or more first winding portions, the second winding is formed by one or more second winding portions and at least one winding is formed on the first substrate layer or at least one of the first substrate layers.</li></ul></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The transformer may be, for example, in the form of a mains transformer or in the form of coupled inductors for a flyback converter.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The inventor has found that forming at least one winding on a first substrate layer with a dielectric relative permittivity of less than or equal to 3.5 provides a reliable insulation barrier between the or each winding and a magnetic core that is arranged, in use, about the windings.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">When the transformer is used with a magnetic core, a winding formed on a first substrate layer is separated from the magnetic core by a length of the first substrate layer and any air gap that is formed between the first substrate layer and the magnetic core. This air gap may be formed as part of the transformer design, or may arise unintentionally due to movement of the magnetic core relative to each winding. Also, movement of the magnetic core relative to each winding may cause the air gap to vary in size.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In use, the formation of a winding on a first substrate layer advantageously reduces the voltage across an air gap that is formed between the first substrate layer and the magnetic core. This is because the differential voltage applied between the winding and the magnetic core is shared among the length of the first substrate layer and the air gap<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> that separate the winding and the magnetic core using resistive and capacitive voltage division, and the low dielectric relative permittivity of the first substrate layer leads to a more balanced voltage division between the length of the first substrate layer and the air gap that separate the winding and the magnetic core. This prevents the occurrence of partial discharge within the air gap, which would otherwise lead to electrical breakdown, resulting in transformer failure.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In embodiments of the invention, the first winding may be separated from the second winding by at least one first substrate layer.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The inventor has also found that the use of at least one first substrate layer with a dielectric relative permittivity of less than or equal to 3.5 provides a reliable insulation barrier between different windings of the transformer when the different windings are separated by at least one first substrate layer.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In use, the arrangement of at least one first substrate layer to separate the first and second windings advantageously reduces the voltage across air voids that are formed in the or each first substrate layer. This is because the differential voltage applied across the or each first substrate layer is shared among the or each first substrate layer and the air voids using resistive and capacitive voltage division, and the low dielectric relative permittivity of the or each first substrate layer leads to a more balanced voltage division between the or each first substrate layer and the air voids. This prevents the occurrence of partial discharge within the air voids, which would otherwise erode the insulation surrounding the air voids over the short term until electrical breakdown occurs, resulting in transformer failure.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The use of at least one first substrate layer with a dielectric relative permittivity of less than or equal to 3.5 therefore not only provides a reliable insulation barrier between each winding and a magnetic core that is arranged, in use, around the windings, but also between the first and second windings of the transformer. This in turn allows higher differential voltages to be applied across the insulation barrier, which results in a transformer with increased isolation for signal or power transfer.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The dielectric relative permittivity of the or each first substrate layer is preferably less than or equal to 3, and even more preferably less than or equal to 2.5.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The use of one or more PCB substrates results in a planar transformer that is lightweight and relatively small in size, and is thereby easily transported to and from the converter station for installation or maintenance purposes. The compact profile and low weight of the planar transformer also leads to an overall size and weight reduction in equipment, into which the planar transformer is incorporated, which is beneficial in certain power applications with restrictions on converter station footprint, e.g. offshore wind farms.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Moreover, the use of PCB technology allows for simple design of the transformer structure at relatively low cost in order to operate at higher voltage levels, when compared to the design and manufacture of conventional transformers which require hand crafted potting or vacuum impregnation methods. This, coupled with the mass production capability of PCB technology, allows the manufacture of a high quality planar transformer using a consistent, repeatable manufacturing process with high yield and fast production lead times.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Each electrically conductive trace may have a copper-based composition, which is suitable for transformer applications due to the excellent thermal and electrical characteristics of copper.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Each winding may have a different number of turns to that of at least one other winding. This results in a transformer with voltage step-up or step-down capability. The step-up or step-down in voltage between the different windings is dependent on the ratio of the number of turns in one winding to the other.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In use, the magnetic field generated by each winding is proportional to the number of turns of the winding. As such, the number of turns in each winding may be adjusted to modify the strength of the magnetic field so as to provide optimal performance of the transformer.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Preferably the transformer further includes a magnetic core. The or each printed circuit board substrate may be shaped to include one or more openings to receive the magnetic core. This allows the magnetic core to be held in a specific position relative to each winding portion. For example, the magnetic core may be received in the or each PCB substrate such that each winding portion surrounds a portion of the magnetic core.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Each electrically conductive trace may be patterned onto a surface of the substrate layer or one of the substrate layers to form a winding portion that is arranged about the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> opening into which the magnetic core is inserted. This improves the mutual coupling between the different windings and thereby aids the transfer of electrical power between the windings.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The magnetic core may be made from different types of magnetic materials. For example, the magnetic core may have a ferrite-based composition. The high frequency performance of ferrite-based magnetic cores leads to a reduced size and a more efficient performance of the planar transformer and any supporting circuitry.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The magnetic core may be configured to have a variety of shapes to permit its assembly with the or each PCB substrate in a manner that results in a robust transformer assembly. For example, the magnetic core may include first and second core elements, the first core element having an E shape and the second core element having an E or I shape, or each of the first and second core elements having an ER shape.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In embodiments of the invention, the or each first substrate layer may have a substantially polytetrafluoroethylene-based composition. In such embodiments, the or each first substrate layer may be made from a material that is selected from, but not limited to, a group including Rogers RT Duroid® 5870, Rogers RT Duroid® 5880, Polyflon CuFlon® and Rogers RO3003<sup>™</sup>.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) has a high dielectric strength, a low comparative tracking index and a low dielectric relative permittivity of approximately 2, which renders it compatible for use in the or each first substrate layer. In addition, the comparable dielectric relative permittivities of PTFE-based material and air permit the presence of air voids within the or each first PCB substrate and/or air gaps between the or each first PCB substrate and the magnetic core at carefully arranged positions without the risk of partial discharge occurring across the insulation barrier. This obviates the need for a further potting process to cast the entire transformer in resin, thus reducing the complexity and variability of the manufacturing process. Moreover the use of PCB technology enables manufacture of a first PCB substrate with at least one PTFE-based first substrate layer that has little to no air voids.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In further embodiments of the invention, at least one printed circuit board substrate may be a second printed circuit board substrate including at least one second substrate layer having a dielectric relative permittivity that is higher than the dielectric relative permittivity of the or each first substrate layer.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The use of PCB technology permits the combination of the or each first PCB substrate with other types of PCB substrates. The or each second PCB substrate may be used to accommodate one or more of the winding portions, for which insulation is not critical. For example, the or each second PCB substrate may be made from FR-4, which is typically cheaper than PTFE.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In still further embodiments of the invention, at least one printed circuit board substrate may include a plurality of substrate layers to define a multi-layered printed circuit board substrate.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The use of one or more PCB substrates with a multi-layered structure allows for the implementation of complex circuitry layouts so as to improve device performance and efficiency, without having to greatly increase the overall footprint size of the transformer. In addition, the windings may be arranged in a variety of ways in a compact manner, whilst maintaining excellent insulation between the windings.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In such embodiments, at least one winding portion may be formed on an intermediate substrate layer of the multi-layered printed circuit board substrate. For example, a high voltage, isolated winding may be formed on an intermediate substrate layer of the multi-layered printed circuit board substrate, so as to provide the required insulation.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In other such embodiments, at least one winding portion may be formed on an outer substrate layer of the multi-layered printed circuit board substrate. At least one winding may be formed from a plurality of winding portions formed on opposite outer surfaces of the outer substrate layers of the multi-layered PCB substrate.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">When used in combination with a high voltage winding formed on an intermediate substrate layer, a low voltage winding formed on the outer surfaces of the outer substrate layers of the multi-layered PCB substrate may act as an electrostatic screen to force most of the differential voltage to be across the or each first substrate layer separating the high and low voltage windings.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In embodiments employing the use of a multi-layered printed circuit board substrate, the multi-layered printed circuit board substrate may further include at least one insulating layer, the or each insulating layer being sandwiched between two substrate layers of the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> multi-layered printed circuit board substrate so as to define a laminated structure of alternating insulating and substrate layers.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The first and second windings may be separated by at least one insulating layer.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The or each insulating layer not only provides additional insulation between the windings, but also may act as an intermediate bonding layer to bond neighbouring substrate layers together. In addition, the or each insulating layer may fully encapsulate, and thereby provide reinforced insulation to, any electrical component formed on intermediate layers of the printed circuit board.
