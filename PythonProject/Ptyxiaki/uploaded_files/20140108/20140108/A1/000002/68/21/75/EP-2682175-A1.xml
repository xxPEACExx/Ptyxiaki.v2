Ozone occurs in normal conditions as a blue gas, with an acrid odor, and has a strong oxidizing power. Ozone is prepared with ozonizers, which for example operate with known electric discharges as a crown effect, or by subjecting the air or oxygen to high-frequency ultraviolet irradiation. It is used as a disinfectant, deodorant, bactericide and sterilizer, especially of water, or as an oxidant in numerous organic syntheses.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is known to use a stream of ozone as an oxidant and decontamination agent for objects or products contained in a treatment cell. Due to its chemical properties, ozone can be irritating or toxic, if in an excessive concentration, for the human body or animals.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is therefore necessary, downstream of the treatment chambers, to abate the ozone content, so that the spent stream can be discharged into the environment without causing damage or pollution. Generally, it is provided to use active carbon filters, but these are expensive, since they need maintenance to be regenerated and in any case they have to be replaced, after a certain working life, with the problem of having to dispose of the spent material.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">At the same time, it is in any case necessary to make the decontamination process using ozone effective and reliable.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP59042025A"><text>JP-A-59042025</text></patcit> describes a known apparatus for removing ozone from a gas.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">One purpose of the present invention is to obtain an oxidization plant using ozone and the abatement thereof, and the corresponding method, used in particular for the decontamination using oxidization of objects contained in a suitable treatment cell, which allows to discharge the spent stream with a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> reduced, if not zero ozone content, so that it is not irritating or toxic and does not cause damage to persons or pollute the environment.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Another purpose of the present invention is to obtain a plant for oxidization using ozone and the abatement thereof, and the corresponding method, that is effective in the decontamination treatment using oxidization and that reduces the energy costs connected to its functioning.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The Applicant has devised, tested and embodied the present invention to overcome the shortcomings of the state of the art and to obtain these and other purposes and advantages.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention is set forth and characterized in the independent claims, while the dependent claims describe other characteristics of the invention or variants to the main inventive idea.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In accordance with the above purposes, a plant for oxidization using ozone and the abatement thereof according to the present invention is used for the decontamination using oxidization of objects contained in a treatment cell.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The plant according to the present invention comprises not only the treatment cell but also an ozone generator fed at inlet by a stream of air.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Moreover, in one form of embodiment of the present invention, the plant comprises a cell to abate the ozone disposed downstream of the treatment cell to receive the stream of ozone that passes into the treatment cell by means of oxidization before it is discharged into the environment.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Moreover, according to one form of embodiment of the present invention, the plant comprises a heat pump, or analogous or equivalent machine to transfer heat energy exploiting changes in the thermodynamic state of a heat-carrying fluid. The heat pump cooperates on one side with the treatment cell and on the other side with the abatement cell. The heat pump is configured to determine a cooling inside the treatment cell, advantageous for the purposes of stabilizing the oxidization using ozone and thus to allow increased effectiveness thereof in the decontamination action during treatment.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The heat pump is also configured to determine, in the abatement cell, a heating that is effective for abating the ozone content in the stream of ozone transiting in the abatement cell and thus to obtain an abatement, or at least a reduction if not<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> substantial elimination, of the ozone content in the stream exiting from the abatement cell.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In one form of embodiment, the heat pump is configured to cool the inside of the treatment cell to a temperature lower than about 12°C, advantageous for the purposes of the decontamination action performed by the ozone, and to heat the inside of the abatement cell to a temperature higher than at least about 58°C, advantageous for the purposes of abating the ozone.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">A method for oxidization using ozone and the abatement thereof, also comes within the spirit of the invention, used for the decontamination using oxidization of objects contained in an oxidization treatment cell, which comprises a generation of ozone and a treatment with the ozone generated of the objects in the treatment cell.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In one form of embodiment, the method comprises the abatement of the ozone downstream of the treatment, before the ozone is discharged into the environment or atmosphere. The method provides to use a heat pump that is selectively activated to cool the inside of the oxidization treatment cell during the treatment of the objects using ozone, and to heat the stream of ozone arriving from the treatment cell during the abatement of the ozone, so as to reduce if not eliminate the ozone content therein and thus to obtain an abatement of the ozone content in the exiting stream.</p><heading id="h0004">DESCRIPTION OF SOME FORMS OF EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">We shall now refer in detail to the various forms of embodiment of the present invention, of which one or more examples are shown in the attached drawing. Each example is supplied by way of illustration of the invention and shall not be understood as a limitation thereof. For example, the characteristics shown or described insomuch as they are part of one form of embodiment can be adopted on, or in association with, other forms of embodiment to produce another form of embodiment. It is understood that the present invention shall include all such modifications and variants.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">These and other characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of some forms of embodiment, given as a non-restrictive example with reference to the attached drawing which shows a plant 10 for oxidization using ozone and abatement thereof, used in particular for the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> decontamination of objects contained in a suitable treatment cell 12.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The treatment cell 12 is preferably made as the sealed type, in any case watertight, and provides suitable closable apertures, for the insertion of the objects to be treated and may provide means to extract and discharge the stream of ozone used for the treatment.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The objects that can be treated in the treatment cell 12 according to the present invention are of any type that need disinfection by means of oxidization or decontamination in order to be used or re-used. These include, by way of non-restrictive example, analysis instruments, laboratory, surgical or other instruments, and also food products, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics or suchlike or comparable, as well as devices, equipment, metal articles, machines or components used for the production or working thereof, but also personal care products or clothing, including professional clothing or other. It goes without saying that the present invention, which inevitably causes a decontamination action using oxidization also on the internal walls of the treatment cell 12, can also be used to decontaminate the inside of rooms, containers or similar limited spaces which, suitably adapted, possibly sealed, represent in themselves the treatment cell 12.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The plant 10 according to the present invention comprises the treatment cell 12 and also comprises, or is associated with, an ozone generator 14 fed at inlet by a stream of air, as indicated by arrow A.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Upstream of the ozone generator 14 a filter 16 may be provided, for example the HEPA type, to filter the air introduced before it enters into the ozone generator 14.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The ozone generator 14 sends the ozone produced at entry to the oxidization treatment cell 12 by means of a first ozone delivery pipe 18. The stream F of ozone in the treatment cell 12 performs its decontaminating action by means of oxidization at least on the objects contained in the treatment cell 12.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Moreover, a second delivery pipe 20, in this case exiting from the filter 16, is provided to introduce a stream of washing air, inside the treatment cell 12.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The treatment cell 12 is also provided with an outlet or discharge pipe 22 for the fluid contained therein, after the oxidization treatment has been carried out. The movement of the stream of ozone and/or air along the plant can be<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> guaranteed by suitable aeraulic machines, not shown in the drawings.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The plant 10 also comprises an ozone abatement cell 30, disposed downstream of the oxidization treatment cell 12 and connected to the exit of the latter by means of the outlet pipe 22. The abatement cell 30 also has, downstream, a final discharge 32 from which the stream, with its limited if not zero ozone content, exits as indicated by the arrow E.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The plant 10 comprises a heat pump 23, by means of which both to cool the ozone entering the treatment cell 12 and also the treatment cell 12 itself, so that the ozone, at lower temperatures, is more effective in its decontamination action; and also to heat the abatement cell 30 and hence the stream of ozone transiting therein, so as to reduce, if not eliminate, the ozone content therein.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Indeed, since ozone is a molecule that gradually becomes more unstable as the temperature increases, it is advantageous on the one hand to cool the stream of ozone and the oxidization treatment cell 12 in which it operates, in order to ensure the stability thereof and hence its effectiveness during decontamination, and on the other hand to render the ozone deliberately unstable, raising its temperature in the abatement cell 30 once it has come out of the treatment cell 12, and before being discharged into the environment, so as to abate the content thereof.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Furthermore, achieving the targeted cooling and heating using the heat pump 23 is very advantageous from the energy point of view, allowing a considerable economic saving.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In this way it is possible to ensure the effectiveness of the ozone treatment, containing the energy costs and guaranteeing an emission of the spent stream that does not damage persons, animals or the environment.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In particular, for the purposes of effectiveness of the decontamination action of the ozone, it is advantageous to cool the inside of the treatment cell 12 to a temperature lower than about 12°C, preferably lower than about 10°C. For example, a possible functioning range of cooling is between about 5°C and about 10°C.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">On the contrary, for the purposes of effectiveness of the abatement action on the ozone, it is advantageous to heat the inside of the abatement cell 30 to a temperature higher than about 58°C, preferably higher than about 60°C, even<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> more preferably higher than about 70°C, most preferably higher than 90°C.
