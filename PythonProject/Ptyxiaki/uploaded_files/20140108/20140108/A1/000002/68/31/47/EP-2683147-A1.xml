Field of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a method, apparatus and system for connecting a service between user devices. More particularly, although not exclusively, the present invention relates to a method, apparatus and system for connecting a service between user devices according to a user voice input through the user devices.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>2. Description of the Related Art</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Along with recent development of digital technologies, various portable user devices capable of performing communication and processing personal information, for example mobile communication terminals, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), electronic organizers, smart phones, tablet Personal Computers (PCs), etc., are being developed. Such user devices increasingly provide functionality extending beyond traditional usage, and are reaching a mobile convergence phase in which a single device typically provides functionality traditionally provided in separate terminals. For example, a user device may include various functions for performing voice calls, video calls, text message transmission, for example a Short Message Service (SMS) and a Multimedia Message Service (MMS) message transmission, electronic organizer functions, photography, e-mail transmission and reception, broadcast replay, video replay, Internet, electronic commerce, music replay, schedule management, Social Networking Service (SNS), a friend search service, a messenger, a dictionary, a game, and a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) link.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In particular, along with the development of wireless communication technologies, various wireless connections that may be used in providing a link service between user devices are being developed and applied. For example, wireless connection technologies for supporting a link service between user devices, for example Bluetooth, Zigbee and Ultra-Wideband (UWB), are being developed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In order to use such wireless connection technologies, relatively complicated processes, for example a search selection and authentication of a peripheral device, connection to the peripheral device, selection of data to be shared, and selection of transmission of the selected data, are required.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For example, in order to connect a service between user devices, one of the user devices is first operated as a master device (i.e., a master), in a state where user devices to be connected to each other recognize each others' addresses, and thereafter another user device is operated as a slave device (i.e., a slave), so as to perform a connection request to the already executed master. Further, the master performs a connection by checking a separate preset code to identify whether the slave is a slave that intends to be connected to the master.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Likewise, when intending to use a service connection function between existing user devices, many user interactions are required to perform necessary authentication and service connection, and thus the service connection between the user devices becomes inconvenient to users. Therefore, there is a need for a method, apparatus and system for improving user convenience by simplifying complicated pairing procedure of various wireless connections, in order to perform a link service between user devices.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is an aim of certain embodiments of the present invention to address, solve, mitigate or obviate, at least partly, at least one of the problems and/or disadvantages associated with the related art, for example at least one of the above problems and/or disadvantages.

When actuation of the voice command button is cancelled (e.g., when a user releases the pushed voice command button), the first device generates voice information including the time stamp, the recording data and the device address of the first device, and transmits the generated voice information to the server. In response, the first device receives service information corresponding to the voice information from the server, and checks the operation mode of the first device, the device address of a second device to which the first device is to be connected, and the type of the executed service from the received service information.

In response, the second device outputs a sound corresponding to second voice information through a speaker so that the first device may detect the sound through a microphone and receive the second voice information as an input. The first device checks the operation mode of the first device, the device address of the second device to which the first device is to be connected, and the type of the execution service from the first voice information and the second voice information.

For example, a voice waveform coinciding with the voice waveform of the received voice information is compared and detected in the database.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">When the same (e.g. matching) voice waveform is detected, the server 300 compares timestamps in the voice information sets of respective user devices having the same voice waveform, and determines the service type of the operation mode of each user device according to the time difference according to each timestamp.

Further, the server 300 respectively generates service information to be transmitted to each user device using the service type, connection information and execution information per user device, and respectively transmits the generated service information to the user devices determined as having the same voice waveform. As this time, assuming that the determined user devices are the first user device 100 and the second user device 200, another service information set may be provided to the first user device 100 and the second user device 200.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">For example, the service information transmitted to the first user device 100 may be service type information indicating operation at the master mode, connection information indicating the device identifier (e.g., the device address, etc.) of the second user device 200, and the first service information having the execution information on the service to be executed. Further, the service information transmitted to the second user device 200 may be service type information indicating operation at the slave mode,<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> connection information indicating the device identifier (e.g., the device address, etc.) of the first user device 200, and the second service information having the execution information on the service to be executed.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">According to an embodiment of the present invention having the above configuration, respective user devices 100 and 200 provide a hardware or software type voice command button 150 for supporting service connection based on a user voice. The user pushes respective voice command buttons 150 of two or more user devices to be mutually connected within a simultaneous or preset error range as in the first user device 100 and the second user device 200.

For example, the server 300 may receive the same waveforms (or similar voice waveforms within a certain error range) or may search for two or more user devices having similar timestamps within a certain error range. The server 300 may use any suitable technique, for example a heuristic approach, when comparing voice information. That is, the server 300 does not necessarily search for completely coincided or matched data (voice information), but may search for sufficiently similar data (same or similar data within a certain error range). For example, the server 300 may use a method of analyzing only certain variables (e.g. relatively important variables) without necessarily considering all variables at the initial step of analysis, gradually extending the range of variables, and narrowing corresponding data.

In one example according to an embodiment of the present invention, recording data of respective voice information sets may be the same recording data input from one user, and thus only one recording data set may be analyzed. For example, the server 300 may recognize a voice command (or a voice parameter) (for example, "device connection", "device connection current image file transmission", "device connection WiFi display", "device connection speaker", "device connection phonebook transmission", etc.) through the analysis (e.g., voice recognition) of recording data. Accordingly, the server 300 may recognize the type of a service intended to be performed through connection between devices.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">When the coinciding user device and the types of services intended to be performed are determined according to the above operation, the server 300 generates service information including the service type, connection information and execution information by determined user devices, and transmits the generated service information to each user device.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">A set of user devices (e.g., the first user device 100 and the second user device 200), which respectively receive service information from the server 300, determines the master mode or slave mode from the received service information according to the service type, and be connected to a user device (e.g., the first user device or the second user device 200) of an object to be connected according to the connection information at the corresponding mode, and may execute the service according to the execution information. For example, the first user device 100 and the second user device 200 may form a wireless LAN link, and when a mutual connection is established, the user device determined as master may transmit the currently displayed image file to the opponent user device. Further, the user device determined as master may operate as a left speaker and the user device determined as slave may operate as a right speaker (or vice versa), thereby respectively outputting audio of a media file replayed in the master device. Further, the user device determined as master may operate as an input means and the user device determined as slave may operate as a display means so that information input by the master user device may be displayed through the slave user device.
