The order of mixing the respective components, the mixing method, and the like are not particularly limited. The obtained mixture is preferably in a powder or granule state, since the mixture is easy to handle and transferred easily to the next step in this state. In addition, the mixing may be performed in the kneading step described below.</p><heading id="h0016">(ii) Kneading step</heading><p id="p0033" num="0033">In the kneading step, first, the agrochemical active ingredient, one or more kinds of hydrophobic substances, the substance capable of absorbing oil, and other optional additives are loaded in a kneading device. The order of loading the respective components into the kneading device is not particularly limited. The agrochemical active ingredient, one or more kinds of hydrophobic substances, the substance capable of absorbing oil, and other additives which are optionally added may be loaded into the kneading device after being made into a mixture by the above mixing step.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The temperature of the agrochemical active ingredient, one or more kinds of hydrophobic substances, the substance capable of absorbing oil, and other optional additives that are loaded into the kneading device, or the temperature of the mixture of these is not particularly limited, but is preferably 0°C to 50°C and more preferably 5°C to<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> 45°C.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Next, the agrochemical active ingredient, one or more kinds of hydrophobic substances, the substance capable of absorbing oil, and other optional additives are heated and kneaded in the kneading device. In the present invention, the heating temperature in the kneading device needs to reach a temperature equal to or higher than the highest melting point of the hydrophobic substances, at least once. The lower limit of the highest heating temperature is preferably 4°C higher than the highest melting point of the hydrophobic substances loaded into the kneading device, more preferably 8°C higher than the melting point, and even more preferably 10°C higher than the melting point. The upper limit of the heating temperature is not particularly limited, as long as the agrochemical active ingredient, one or more kinds of hydrophobic substances, the substance capable of absorbing oil, and other optional additives are not thermally decomposed. However, the upper limit is generally 130°C, preferably 120°C, and more preferably 115°C.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Heating can be performed by, for example, causing a medium such as steam or hot water to flow in a jacket mounted on the kneading device, or by applying electricity to an electric heater mounted on the kneading device. In view of ease of regulating temperature, a high thermal conduction efficiency, and the like, heating by a jacket is preferable.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The kneading device is not particularly limited as long as it can perform kneading by applying heat, and examples thereof include single-screw kneading devices,<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> double-screw kneading devices, roll kneaders, and the like. Among these, a continuous single-screw kneading device or a continuous double-screw kneading device is preferable, and a double-screw kneading device is more preferable in the respect that a temperature profile is easily controlled, and the kneading state is easily regulated. In a continuous kneading device, the portion from the opening for injecting raw material components to the opening for discharging the kneaded material can be divided into plural sections. Moreover, the respective sections can be controlled to have different temperatures and to be in different kneading states.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The kneading state can be designed by the combination of a paddle and a screw installed in the kneading device. Examples of the paddle include a paddle for kneading (flat paddle), a paddle having a function of feeding in addition to a function of kneading (helical paddle), a paddle having a function of backward feeding in addition to a function of kneading (backward helical paddle), and the like. When the paddle rotates, the kneaded material undergoes volumetric change by compression or stretching and is influenced by a shearing action between a trough and a paddle or between paddles.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Finally, the kneading material is discharged from the kneading device. The upper limit of the temperature (product temperature) at the time of discharging is preferably the same temperature as the highest melting point of the hydrophobic substances, preferably a temperature 2°C lower than the melting point, and more preferably a temperature 4°C lower than the melting point. The lower limit of the temperature (product temperature) at the time of discharging is not particularly limited as long as it is a temperature at which the kneaded material does not coagulate. However, the lower limit is generally 60°C, preferably 65°C, and more preferably 70°C.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0040" num="0040">By the heat applied from the outside or the heat caused by friction or the like, the product temperature of the kneaded material in the kneading device can slowly increase immediately after the material is loaded into the kneading device and reach a temperature equal to or higher than the highest melting point of the hydrophobic substances. In order to control the temperature (product temperature) at the time of discharging to fall within the above temperature range, in the section close to the opening for discharging kneaded material of the kneading device, it is preferable to regulate the product temperature of the kneaded material by causing hot water at low temperature or the like to flow in the jacket. The heating temperature in the section close to the opening for discharging kneaded material of the kneading device is preferably 30°C to 70°C and more preferably 35°C to 60°C.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Moreover, if a kneading device equipped with a vent is used, unnecessary volatile components can be removed by evaporation in the kneading step.</p><heading id="h0017">(ii) Extruding granulation step</heading><p id="p0042" num="0042">Subsequently, the obtained kneaded material is granulated by an extrusion molding method. If the extrusion molding device has a kneading function, this is preferable since the above kneading step and the extruding granulation step can be performed consecutively. The conditions of extrusion molding are not particularly limited. The upper limit of the temperature at the time of extruding the kneaded material is preferably the same temperature as the melting point that is the highest of the hydrophobic substances, more preferably a temperature 2°C lower than the melting point, and even more preferably a temperature 4°C lower than the melting point. The lower<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> limit of the temperature at the time of extrusion is not particularly limited as long as it is a temperature at which the kneaded material does not coagulate. However, the lower limit is generally 60°C, preferably 62°C, and more preferably 65°C. If the temperature at the time of extrusion is too high, sometimes the obtained granulated materials adhere to or are fused with each other and are shaped into Ame (a type of Japanese candy) or Dango (a type of Japanese dumpling). If the temperature at the time of extrusion is too low, sometimes the granulated materials have irregular shapes, or the amount of a powdery material increases. The extruded kneaded material having a string-like shape is cut with a cutter to a predetermined size. It is preferable that the granulated material obtained by the extruding and molding granulation step have an approximately cylindrical shape. The size of the granulated material can be appropriately adjusted according to the specification of the agrochemical granules.</p><heading id="h0018">(iv) Disintegrating step</heading><p id="p0043" num="0043">The obtained granulated material is cooled. Sometimes the cooled granulated material contains materials fused with or adhering to each other. In this case, a disintegrating step can be performed. The granulated material can be disintegrated using a known disintegrating device. Moreover, the granulated material can optionally be dried or classified.
