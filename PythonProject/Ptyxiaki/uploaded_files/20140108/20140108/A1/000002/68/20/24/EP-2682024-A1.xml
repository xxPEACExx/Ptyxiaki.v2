The conventional slide rail assembly generally comprises an outer rail fixed to the rack, the cabinet or a fixed object, an inner rail fixed to a chassis, a drawer or a movable member, and a mediate rail which is slidably connected between the inner and outer rails. By the mediate rail, the inner rail can be pulled outward relative to the outer rail. The slide rail assembly makes the chassis, the drawer or the movable member be pulled out relative to the rack, the cabinet or the fixed object.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The chassis usually has inner rails located on two sides thereof and the mediate rails are connected to the inner rails so that the chassis is conveniently pulled out from the rack or the chassis is pushed into the rack. The rack has a space so that multiple chasses are installed in the space. For some reasons, such as maintenance or replacement, the chasses need to be removed from the rack. When a chassis is to be removed from the rack, the inner rails are pulled from the rack and the mediate rails are pulled outward, and the inner rails are separated from the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> mediate rails. When the maintenance or replacement is completed, the mediate rails are installed to the outer rails and located in the rack. When the chassis is installed in the rack, because the mediate rails are located in the rack so that the assembler difficult to see the installation clearly when inserting the inner rails of the chassis into the mediate rails of the rack. Accordingly, the inner rails of the chassis may incorrectly engage with the mediate rails of the rack, and when the chassis is pushed into the rack whole the incorrect installation happens, the rails and the parts on the rails are easily damaged.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The present invention intends to provide a slide rail assembly which has a protection device to prevent the inner rails from inserting into the mediate rails. When the mediate rails are extended relative to the outer rails, the protection device is released and the inner rails are able to be inserted into the mediate rails.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention relates to a slide rail assembly and comprises a first rail having two first sidewalls and a first connection wall is connected between the two first sidewalls. The first sidewalls and the first connection wall define a first path. A second rail is slidably connected to the first path of the first rail. The second rail has two second sidewalls and a second connection wall connected between the two second sidewalls. The second sidewalls and the second connection wall define a second path. A third rail is slidably connected to the second path of the second rail. The third rail has two third sidewalls and a third connection wall connected between the two third sidewalls. The third rail can be pulled out from the second<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> path of the second rail and separated from the second rail. A front support is connected to the front end of the first rail and a rear support is connected to the rear end of the first rail. A stop member has an arm and a stop portion, wherein the arm has a fixed section and a resilient section extending from the fixed section. The fixed section is fixed to one of the front support and the first rail. The stop portion is located at the resilient section. When the third rail is separated from the second rail and the second rail is retracted in the first rail, the stop portion of the stop member is located in the second path of the second rail so that the third rail is stopped by the stop portion of the stop member and cannot be inserted into the second path of the second rail. When the second rail is pulled out from the first rail, the second sidewall of the second rail contacts the stop portion which is moved away.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Preferably, the second connection wall of the second rail has a positioning member and the first connection wall of the first rail has a restriction member which is located corresponding to the positioning member. When the second rail is partially pulled out relative to the first rail, the positioning member contacts the restriction member so as to restrict the second rail from being retracted relative to the first rail.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Preferably, the third connection wall of the third rail has a release member which is located corresponding to the positioning member of the second rail. When the third rail is inserted into the second rail, the release member pushes the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> positioning member away from the restriction member, so that the second rail is retracted relative to the first rail.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Preferably, the stop member has a guide portion extending from the stop portion. The guide portion is tilted relative to a front end of the second rail and the front end of the third rail.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Preferably, the first connection wall of the first rail has an opening defined in the front end thereof. The front support has a through hole. The fixed section of the stop member is fixed to the front support. The stop portion extends through the through hole and is located in the opening.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Preferably, the front support has an elongate slot. The stop member extends through the elongate slot and is connected to the front end of the adjacent first rail by the fixed section.

Because the second connection wall 32 continuously presses the stop portion 42, the stop portion 42 cannot be inserted into the second path 34 of the second rail 12.

Preferably, the third connection wall 38 of the third rail 14 has a release member 58 which is located corresponding to the positioning member 54 of the second rail 12. When the third rail 14 is inserted into the second rail 12, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>, the release member 58 pushes the positioning member 54 away from the restriction member 56, so that the second rail 12 can be retracted relative to the first rail 10.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref>, when the third rail 14 is inserted into the second rail 12, and the second rail 12 and the third rail 14 are retracted relative to the first rail 10, the guide portion 44 of the stop member 20 faces the front end of the second rail 12 and the front end of the third rail 14.
