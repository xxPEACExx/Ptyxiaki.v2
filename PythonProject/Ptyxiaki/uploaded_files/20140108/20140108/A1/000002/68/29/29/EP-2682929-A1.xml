The irradiating timing and the type of pattern light may be output to the pattern light irradiating device 21 as one pattern light information so as to associate the irradiating timing with the type of pattern light or output as individual information.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The in-vehicle camera 10 is connected to the vehicle information obtaining device 31 and may obtain the vehicle information such as a vehicle speed, a yaw rate, or a rudder angle.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Further, the in-vehicle camera 10 is further connected to a control ECU 41 which is a control device that controls the vehicle based on the determination result<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> in the collision determining unit 6 and a warning device 42 which issues an alert based on the determination result in the collision determining unit 6. For example, when the probability of collision is high as the determination result of the collision determining unit 6, the control ECU 41 controls the vehicle to put on the brake, release a gas pedal, or suppress an engine power to avoid collision and reduce damage. The warning device 42 issues an alert such as a sound, displays alert information on a screen of a car navigation system, or applies a vibration to a seat belt or a steering to give a warning to a user.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the present invention, the circumference of the vehicle, for example, a front side or a rear side is captured by the in-vehicle camera 10. Here, an embodiment of an in-vehicle camera system when the present invention is applied to the front side of the vehicle is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A capturing range 51 which is a range captured by the in-vehicle camera 10 and an irradiating range 52 which is a range irradiated by the pattern light irradiating device 21 need to face the same direction.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, a spotlight of<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the vehicle is used as the pattern light irradiating device 21, but a fog lamp or other light source may be used. Further, in the rear side, a taillight or a rear fog lamp of the vehicle may be used.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart illustrating an operational example of the in-vehicle camera 10 in the embodiment. Hereinafter, the operation of the in-vehicle camera 10 will be described according to the flow chart.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">First, in step S1, image data is obtained using the first image capturing device 1 and the second image capturing device 2. The first image capturing device 1 and the second image capturing device 2 may be synchronized with each other or a difference in image capturing times may be set in advance.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Next, in step S2, the vehicle information is obtained from the vehicle information obtaining device 31. The vehicle information is information including a vehicle speed, a yaw rate, and a rudder angle.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Next, in step S3, an image feature of the obtained image data is analyzed. The image feature refers to a feature amount such as an amount or a direction of edge or<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> a concentration value. The image processing unit 3 analyzes the image feature. Here, the image feature analysis may be performed on image data captured by both the first image capturing device 1 and the second image capturing device 2 or on image data captured by any one of the first image capturing device 1 and the second image capturing device 2.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In step S4, a disparity between the image data captured in the first image capturing device 1 and the second image capturing device 2 is calculated by the disparity calculating unit 4. Further, as the disparity calculating method, a known technique such .as an SSDA method or an area correlation method may be used and thus, the detailed description thereof will be omitted in this embodiment.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Further, steps S2, S3, and S4 may be performed in the above order or in parallel.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Continuously, in step S5, the irradiating timing determining unit 7 determines a timing to irradiate the pattern light, that is, whether to irradiate the pattern light.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> In some cases, the stereo camera may not detect a corresponding point from a wall which does not have a contrasting density as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4A</figref> or a surface on which identical stripes are continuously drawn as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4B</figref> and may not calculate the disparity. In this case, it is known that the pattern light is irradiated to effectively calculate the disparity. However, when the pattern light is consistently irradiated onto the object to be captured, there are problems in that the circumference may be dazzled and the power consumption is increased. Therefore, a timing when the irradiation is required is determined and the light is irradiated only at the timing so that the above problems may be lessened.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Specifically, the pattern light is irradiated when the disparity calculating unit 4 cannot calculate the disparity information for a predetermined time or longer. An irradiating time is one exposure cycle of the first image capturing device 1 and the second image capturing device 2 as the shortest time. In a general image capturing device, one thirtieth of a second or shorter is suitable for the irradiating time, and thus the above-mentioned problem may be significantly lessened.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Further, the pattern light may be irradiated, when a<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> situation at the front side or the rear side is unclear, for example, immediately after starting the engine. Accordingly, it is possible to more precisely perform a function that prevents an accident caused by putting a gearshift lever in a wrong position at the time of accelerating or erroneously pressing a brake pedal or a gas pedal.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Therefore, when the disparity calculating unit 4 may calculate the disparity information for a predetermined time or shorter, the pattern light is not irradiated and the distance calculating unit 5 calculates a distance to the object which is present in the image captured in step S6. The distance may be calculated from the disparity calculated by the disparity calculating unit 4, and internal parameters and external parameters of the first image capturing device 1 and the second image capturing device 2.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Thereafter, it is determined whether the distance calculated in step S7 is within a predetermined set distance, that is, whether an obstacle is present within a set distance to determine a probability of collision at the front side or the rear side. If there is an obstacle within the set distance, it is determined that there is a<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> probability of collision (step S13), and if there is no obstacle within the set distance, it is determined that there is no probability of collision (step S14).</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Next, the determination result of the collision information in step S7 is notified to the control ECU 41 or the warning device 42. If it is determined that there is a probability of collision, the control ECU 41 generates and outputs a control signal to put on the brake, that is, generate a braking force to each wheel or suppresses the output of the engine so as to avoid or reduce the severity of an accident. Further, the warning device 42 may notify danger to the user using a sound, an image, or a vibration.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">If it is determined that the pattern light needs to be irradiated in step S5, the pattern light is selected in step S8. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, in some cases, the stereo camera cannot calculate the disparity and in each case, it is known which pattern light is effective, and thus a type of the pattern light to be irradiated may be determined based on the image feature analyzed in step S3.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Continuously, in step S9, at the timing determined in step S5, irradiation information to irradiate the pattern light in a direction (at the front side of the vehicle in<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> this embodiment) captured by the first image capturing device 1 and the second image capturing device 2 using the pattern light selected in step S8 is output.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Next, in step S10, an image is captured again by the first image capturing device 1 and the second image capturing device 2. Here, at the capturing timing, the exposure is performed while the pattern light is irradiated.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In step S11, a disparity for the image captured in step S10 is calculated. The disparity is calculated by the disparity calculating unit 4. When the pattern light is irradiated, the disparity is calculated to easily detect the corresponding point by a stereoscopic vision and thus the disparity may be more desirably calculated as compared when the pattern light is not irradiated.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In step S12, it is determined whether the disparity is successfully calculated in step S11 or the disparity can be calculated. If the disparity is successfully calculated as a result of determination, it is considered that an obstacle is present in front of the vehicle and in step S6, a distance to the obstacle is calculated based on the image data captured in step S10. As a result of the determination, if the disparity calculation fails, that is,<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> the disparity is not calculated, it is considered that no obstacle is present in front of the vehicle and it is determined that there is no probability of collision (step S14).</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The above processings are repeated to effectively detect the obstacle while minimizing the problem caused by irradiating the pattern light. In other words, even when the image is captured by the stereo camera in a situation where it is difficult to calculate the disparity, it is possible to precisely detect the obstacle, avoid the collision, and reduce the damage.</p><heading id="h0011">Reference Signs List</heading><p id="p0040" num="0040"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>1</dt><dd>first image capturing device</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>second image capturing device</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>image processing unit</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>disparity calculating unit</dd><dt>5</dt><dd>distance calculating unit</dd><dt>6</dt><dd>collision determining unit</dd><dt>7</dt><dd>irradiating timing determining unit</dd><dt>8</dt><dd>pattern light type determining unit</dd><dt>10</dt><dd>in-vehicle camera</dd><dt>21</dt><dd>pattern light irradiating device</dd><dt>31</dt><dd>vehicle information obtaining device<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></dd><dt>41</dt><dd>control ECU</dd><dt>42</dt><dd>warning device</dd><dt>51</dt><dd>capturing range</dd><dt>52</dt><dd>irradiating range</dd></dl></p><p id="p0041" num="0041">All publications, patents, and patent applications which are cited in this specification are incorporated herein by reference.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982003" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An in-vehicle camera, comprising:
