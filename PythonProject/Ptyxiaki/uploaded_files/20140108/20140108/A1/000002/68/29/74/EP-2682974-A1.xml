Each switching pole usually comprises vacuum or special gas filled interrupter inserts containing a pair of corresponding electrical contacts, wherein one of both contacts is axial moveable arranged in order to form an electrical switch. The switching pole interrupts the current by creating and extinguishing the arc in the closed vacuum or gas filled container.

This object is achieved by the subject-matter of the independent claim 1. Further exemplary embodiments are evident from the dependent claims and the following description.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A first aspect of the invention relates to a push rod assembly for an electrical circuit breaker. For example, the circuit breaker may be a medium voltage circuit breaker and/or a vacuum circuit breaker.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to an embodiment of the invention, the pushrod assembly comprises a pushrod with an electrical insulating body. The pushrod assembly may further comprise an insulating housing that surrounds the pushrod in a longitudinal direction of the pushrod assembly. The pushrod may be an elongated body that extends in the longitudinal direction of the pushrod assembly. Furthermore, the pushrod may be adapted to be moved within the insulating housing in the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to the invention the pushrod is integrated in the electromagnetic actuator and thus part of the electromagnetic actuator. Preferably a guidance pin is arranged on an abutting face of the insulating body for mechanically connecting the pushrod with the electromagnetic actuator. Furthermore, the guidance pin is at least partially arranged inside the insulating body. This arrangement can be realized by pressing the guidance pin in a blind hole of the insulating body. Another possibility is to screw the guidance pin in a thread which is arranged in the blind hole of the insulating body. Another possibility is to mould or cast the guidance pin directly into the pushrod.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Preferably the guidance pin represents the axis of the electromagnetic actuator.

This makes it possible to design a smaller circuit breaker that uses less material and produces therefore lower costs.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to a preferred embodiment at least more than half of the extent area of the electrical conducting plate is covered by the insulating body. This may be an improvement of the dielectric properties and may have an influence on the possible direct distance between the electrical conducting plate and the electrical conducting terminal.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">These advantages may be used to find an integrated drive solution for a switch or circuit breaker, where the space for a drive is limited and high voltage requirements have to be fulfilled, though.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>Brief description of the drawings</u></heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">The foregoing and other aspects of the invention will become apparent following the detailed description of the invention, when considered in conjunction with the enclosed drawings.

The connection of the pushrod assembly 1 to the electromagnetic actuator 9 is realized by a guidance pin 10. The guidance pin 10 is mechanically connecting a pushrod 3 of the pushrod assembly 1 with the electromagnetic actuator 9. The pushrod 3 is surrounded by an insulating housing 5, which can also surround the switching chamber 12. The connection of the pushrod assembly 1 to the vacuum switching chamber is realized by a movable electrical conducting terminal 13.

This is an improvement regarding the size and the required material of the whole pushrod assembly 1.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref> shows a pushrod assembly 1 according to a further embodiment of the invention, in which more than half of the extent area of the conducting plate 11 is<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> covered by the insulating body 4. This may be an improvement of the dielectric properties and may have an influence on the possible direct distance 20 between the conducting plate 11 and the electrical conducting terminal 6.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, such illustration and description are to be considered illustrative or exemplary and not restrictive; the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments. Other variations to the disclosed embodiments can be understood and effected by those skilled in the art and practicing the claimed invention, from a study of the drawings, the disclosure, and the appended claims. In particular, the conducting plate 11 can be a mechanical stop of the drive, or it can be an armature that is attracted by the electromagnetic actuator 9 to define and hold the OFF-position.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><heading id="h0006"><b><u>Reference signs</u></b></heading><p id="p0028" num="0028"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>1</dt><dd>Pushrod assembly</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>Circuit breaker</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>Pushrod</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>Insulating body</dd><dt>5</dt><dd>Insulating housing</dd><dt>6</dt><dd>Terminal</dd><dt>7</dt><dd>First abutting face</dd><dt>8</dt><dd>Second abutting face</dd><dt>9</dt><dd>Electromagnetic actuator</dd><dt>10</dt><dd>Guidance pin</dd><dt>11</dt><dd>Plate</dd><dt>12</dt><dd>Switching chamber</dd><dt>13</dt><dd>Terminal</dd><dt>14</dt><dd>Terminal</dd><dt>15</dt><dd>Axis</dd><dt>16</dt><dd>Guiding connection</dd><dt>17</dt><dd>Terminal</dd><dt>18</dt><dd>Minimum length</dd><dt>19</dt><dd>Minimum length</dd><dt>20</dt><dd>Direct distance</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56981957" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A pushrod assembly (1) for a medium voltage vacuum circuit breaker (2), comprising a pushrod (3) with an insulating body (4), whereby an electrical conducting terminal (6) is arranged on a first abutting face (7) of the insulating body (4) and a guiding means is arranged on an opposing side of the electrical conducting terminal (6) on a second abutting face (8) of the insulating body (4) for mechanically connecting the pushrod (3) with an electromagnetic actuator (9),<br/>
