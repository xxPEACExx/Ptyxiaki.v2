Therefore, various attempts have been made to provide a cutting insert configured to have shapes suitable for the individual functions. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP9174308A"><text> 9-174308</text></patcit> discloses a cutting insert made up of a shaft part and a cutting head. The cutting head includes a major cutting edge having an edge part held down into a curve-like shape, and a pair of ridges extending in a longitudinal direction on a top surface of the cutting head. According to this configuration, chips generated by the major cutting edge in the grooving process are<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> discharged by being curved between the pair of ridges and compressed in a width direction of the chips.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, this type of cutting insert needs to ensure a large distance between the pair of ridges in order to satisfactorily curve the chips in the width direction in the grooving process as described above. On the other hand, only an end side of the major cutting edge is used to increase the width of a machined groove in the shoulder grooving process. It is therefore necessary to ensure a longer length of the cutting edge located further outward than the ridge part. The foregoing cutting insert is configured so that the distance between the pair of ridges is relatively large and the width of the top surface located further outward than the ridges is small. Consequently, it may be difficult to obtain sufficient performance in the shoulder grooving process.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Also in the foregoing cutting insert, the ridges are formed to become higher as separating from the major cutting edge. Therefore, the chips generated by the major cutting edge can be guided by the ridges, however, it may be difficult to control the chips because the curling diameter of the chips is increased. Hence, the discharge direction of the chips becomes unstable, that is, the chips travel while causing lateral vibration. As<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> a result, the curled chips are entwined with each other, and the chips are contacted with a machined surface, thereby deteriorating chip discharge performance and damaging a machined wall surface.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to provide a cutting insert and a cutting tool which are suitable for the grooving process, particularly the shoulder grooving process, as well as a method of manufacturing a machined product using the cutting insert and the cutting tool.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A further object of the present invention is to provide a cutting insert and a cutting tool which are suitable for the grooving process, particularly a face grooving process, as well as a method of manufacturing a machined product using the cutting insert and the cutting tool.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A cutting insert according to an embodiment of the present invention includes: an upper surface; a lower surface; a pair of side surfaces located on both sides in a longitudinal direction; an end surface located at a front end in the longitudinal direction; and a cutting edge located from a first intersecting line of the upper surface and the end surface to a pair of second intersecting lines which are respectively intersecting<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> lines of the upper surface and the pair of side surfaces. The cutting edge includes an end surface cutting edge which is located on the first intersecting line and includes a concave-shaped first cutting edge and a pair of second cutting edges located on both sides of the first cutting edge in an end surface view. The upper surface includes: a first concave groove which is connected to the first cutting edge and extends along the longitudinal direction; a pair of second concave grooves which are respectively connected to the second cutting edges and extend along the longitudinal direction; and a pair of protruded parts respectively located between the first concave groove and the pair of second concave grooves. The pair of protruded parts are respectively continuous with the end surface cutting edge and are separated from each other by a larger distance therebetween as separating from the end surface cutting edge.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A cutting tool according to an embodiment of the present invention includes the foregoing cutting insert, and a holder configured to attach the cutting insert to a front end thereof.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A method of manufacturing a machined product according to an embodiment of the present invention includes rotating a workpiece, bringing the workpiece<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> being rotated and the cutting edge of the cutting tool according to the foregoing embodiment into contact with each other, and separating the cutting tool and the workpiece from each other.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the cutting insert according to the embodiment of the present invention, the upper surface includes: the first concave groove which is continuous with the first cutting edge and extends along the longitudinal direction; the pair of second concave groove which are respectively continuous with the pair of second cutting edges and extend in the longitudinal direction; and the pair of protruded parts respectively located between the first concave groove and the pair of second concave grooves. The pair of protruded parts are continuous with the end surface cutting edge and are separated from each other by a larger distance therebetween as separating from the end surface cutting edge. Therefore, a middle part length and an end portion length of each of the cutting edges can be adjusted, and a groove continuous with each of the cutting edges can be formed. Consequently, the cutting edge length used for the shoulder grooving process can be sufficiently ensured, and the chip discharge performance both in the grooving process and the shoulder grooving process can be improved.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the case where each of the pair of protruded<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> parts includes the pair of descending top portions inclined so as to become closer to the lower surface as separating from the end surface cutting edge and where the first concave groove includes the first region which is located between the pair of descending top portions and has a larger depth as separating from the end surface cutting edge in the top view, the chips generated the cutting edge are easily guided to the first concave groove by the pair of protruded parts inclined so as to become closer to the lower surface. Additionally, the first concave groove configured to become deeper facilitates the compression of chips in the width direction thereof, and the chip curling diameter becomes further smaller. This makes it easier to stabilize the chip discharge direction, thereby improving the chip discharge performance.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(a)</figref> is a front view (end surface view) showing a cutting insert according to an embodiment of the present invention;

The concave-shaped first cutting edge 61 thus located between the pair of second cutting edges 62 and 62 makes it easier for the chips generated by the first cutting edge 61 and the second cutting edges 62 to be deformed in the width<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> direction of the chips, thereby preventing damage to the machined surface in the grooving process.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the present embodiment, from the viewpoint of reasonably facilitating the deformation of the chips in the width direction, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(a)</figref>, the first cutting edge 61 preferably has a curved line shape protruding toward the lower surface 3 and an arc-like shape in an end surface view.

In order to ensure a more satisfactory deformation of the chips in the width direction, the length of the first cutting edge 61 is from one second to two third of the length of the first intersecting line 81 of the upper surface 2 and the end surface 4.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2</figref> and<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, the cutting edge 6 further includes a pair of side surface cutting edges 63 and 63 respectively located on a pair of second intersecting lines 82 and 82 which are respectively intersecting lines of the upper surface 2 and the pair of side surfaces 5 and 5. This configuration allows the insert 1 to be used for a cutting process using the side surface cutting edges 63 (hereinafter referred to as "traversing process"). The side surface cutting edges 63 correspond to third cutting edges.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(c)</figref>, the pair of side surface cutting edges 63 and 63 are inclined so as to become closer to the lower surface 3 as separating from the end surface cutting edge 60 in a side view. This configuration reduces cutting resistance in the side surface cutting edges 63.

The term "land" denotes a narrow band-shaped surface with a fixed width<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> disposed along the cutting edge 6. The land is disposed for reducing a fracture of the cutting edge 6.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the upper surface 2 includes a first concave groove 21 that is continuous with the first cutting edge 61 and extends along the longitudinal direction of the body 10. This configuration allows the chips generated by the first cutting edge 61 and the second cutting edges 62 to be compressed and deformed in the width direction of the chips in a process of forming a machined groove by using the first cutting edge 61 and the second cutting edges 62 (hereinafter referred to as "grooving process"). Accordingly, the chips generated by the first cutting edge 61 and the second cutting edges 62 are narrower than the width of the body 10 (cutting section I), thereby preventing damage to the machined surface.

This configuration makes it easier for<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> the first cutting edge 61 to cut into a workpiece, thereby reducing cutting resistance.

According to this configuration, the cross section of the chips can be deformed at their middle part into a concave shape, specifically, a substantially laterally symmetric concave shape. Consequently, the balance of the chips in the width direction is enhanced to improve chip discharge performance.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The upper surface 2 further includes a pair of second concave grooves 22 and 22 which are respectively continuous with the pair of second cutting edges 62 and 62 and extend along the longitudinal direction of the body 10. In a process of enlarging the width of the machined groove by using the second cutting edges 62 (hereinafter referred to as "shoulder grooving process"), the second concave grooves 22 have a role in stabilizing a chip discharge direction by compressing the chips<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> generated by the second cutting edges 62 in the width direction of the chips.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, a width W22 of each of the pair of second concave grooves 22 and 22 is decreased as separating from the pair of second cutting edges 62 and 62 in a top view.

This configuration reduces the tendency that the chips are likely to be discharged to the machined surface by protruded parts 23 described later in the shoulder grooving process. Further, in the traversing process, because the distance between the side surface cutting edges 63 and the second concave groove 22 is further decreased, this configuration allows the second concave grooves to also function as a breaker groove against the chips generated by the side surface cutting edges 63. That is, the curling diameter of the chips generated by the side surface cutting edges 63 can also be satisfactorily controlled.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, each of the pair of second concave grooves 22 and 22 preferably has a curved line shape protruding toward the lower surface 3, more preferably an arc-like shape in a sectional view parallel to the second cutting edges 62 and perpendicular to the lower surface 3, namely, in a sectional view perpendicular to the foregoing longitudinal direction.

The pair of protruded parts 23 and 23 extend along the longitudinal direction. This configuration allows the generated chips to be easily drawn into the first concave groove 21 by a difference in height that occurs on the upper surface 2, thereby facilitating the compression of the chips in the width direction thereof in the grooving process. In the shoulder grooving process, because the protruded parts 23 are located so as to separate the first concave groove 21 and the second concave grooves 22 from each other, the chips generated by the second cutting edges 62 can be more surely drawn into the second concave groove 22, thus making it easier to maintain the chip discharge direction at the fixed direction. Additionally, in the traversing process, the protruded parts 23 function as a breaker wall, and the curling diameter of the chips generated by the side surface cutting edges 63 can be satisfactorily controlled to suitably divide and discharge the chips.

In the present embodiment, the reference plane H is parallel to a flat surface h with which the lower surface 3 is stably contacted when the body 10 is mounted thereon. As<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> used herein, the phrase "is stably contacted" denotes that the lower surface 3 and the flat surface h are contacted with each other at least three points. This configuration allows the chips to be more surely drawn into the first concave groove 21A and thus generates helical shaped chips with a stable curling diameter by the descending top portions 231 at the lower position than the cutting edge 6, particularly when the chips are helically curled and discharged without curling the chips in the spring shape and dividedly discharging them, as in the case of the face grooving process. In the grooving process, this configuration reduces the cutting resistance, and hence the damage to the cutting edge 6 can be reduced even under a high load cutting condition. In the grooving process, this configuration prevents the chips generated by the cutting edge 6 from staying in the machined groove.

When the chips generated by the end surface cutting edge 60 graze the ascending top portions 232, a front part of the chips is located higher than a rear part thereof, and a travel speed of the front part is lower than that of the rear part. Therefore, the front part of the chips travels by its own weight along the ascending top portions 232 in the opposite direction<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> to a chip travel direction, resulting in a smaller curling diameter of the chips.

According to this configuration, the depth of the second region 212 of the first concave groove 21A is decreased with increasing the height of the pair of ascending top portions 232 and 232.

From the viewpoint of improving durability, the holder 31 and the holding part 32 are integrally formed in the present embodiment. Alternatively, the holding part 32 and the holder 31 may be configured to be detachable from each other. The present embodiment employs a method in which a restraining force is adjustable with a screw 33 disposed at the front end of the holder 31, and the insert 1 is restrained by being pressed from above.
