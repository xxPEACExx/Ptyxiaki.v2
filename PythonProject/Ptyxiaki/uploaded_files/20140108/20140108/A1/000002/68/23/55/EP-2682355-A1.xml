The conveyor belt includes a body rubber extending in a longitudinal direction of the belt; a plurality of tension bodies that extend in the longitudinal direction of the belt, are disposed in a width direction of the belt, and are embedded in the body rubber; and a continuous canvas that extends in the longitudinal direction of the belt and is embedded in a portion within the body rubber, which is located between the tension bodies and a bottom surface of the body rubber.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the above-mentioned conveyor belt, flexural rigidity in the width direction of the belt is improved by including the continuous canvas. Thus, when the conveyor belt is rounded in the width direction of the belt so that both of the side end sections of the body rubber overlap with each other on the upper side in a vertical direction to form a pipe-shaped section extending in the longitudinal direction of the belt, it is possible to suppress the side end section of the body rubber in the pipe-shaped section from being excessively bent, for example, due to its own weight or the like. Accordingly, it is possible to suppress the pipe-shaped section from being deformed flat.

However, in order to cope with the demand for a wide width of the recent conveyor belts as described above, there is a need for a special continuous canvas having a larger size in the width direction of the belt than generally distributed continuous canvases. In order to form such a continuous canvas, a manufacturing device of special specifications is required. For this reason, there is a problem of rising manufacturing costs.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In addition, instead of including the continuous canvas, improving flexural rigidity of the conveyor belt in the width direction of the belt by a configuration in which the body rubber is formed to be thicker can also be considered. However, in this case,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> since the weight of the belt increases and maximum tension acting on the conveyor belt increases, for example, there is a need to increase an outer diameter of the tension body or the like. Accordingly, the manufacturing cost rises.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide a conveyor belt that is capable of being formed at a low cost at a wide width.</p><heading id="h0007">[Solution to Problem]</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to achieve the aforementioned objects, the present invention suggests the following means.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A conveyor belt related to a first aspect of the present invention includes a body rubber extending in a longitudinal direction of the belt; a plurality of tension bodies that extend in the longitudinal direction of the belt, are disposed in a width direction of the belt, and are embedded in the body rubber; and a reinforcement layer that extends in the longitudinal direction of the belt and is embedded in at least one of portions within the body rubber, which is located between the tension bodies and each of a top surface and bottom surfaces of the body rubber. Furthermore, the conveyor belt is rounded in the width direction of the belt so that the side end sections of the body rubber overlap on the upper side in the vertical direction to form a pipe-shaped section extending in the longitudinal direction of the belt, and an object to be carried is accommodated therein. The reinforcement layer is formed in which a plurality of fabric members extending in the longitudinal direction of the belt are continuously provided in the width direction of the belt. The side end sections of the fabric members among the fabric members, which are adjacent to each other in the width direction of the belt are connected to each other to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> form a fabric joint section. Furthermore, the fabric joint section is disposed on the inner side in the width direction of the belt rather than the both side end sections in the body rubber, and is disposed in an intermediate section that includes the center in the width direction of the belt.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Furthermore, a pipe conveyor related to a first aspect of the present invention has the conveyor belt, and a belt support device that has a plurality of idlers disposed around a pipe axis on the outer side of the pipe-shaped section in the radial direction, and supports the pipe-shaped section by the contact of the idlers with the pipe-shaped section from the outer side in the radial direction.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to the aspect of the invention, the reinforcement layer is formed in which the plurality of fabric members are disposed in the width direction of the belt. For this reason, even when one wide continuous fabric is not used, the wide reinforcement layer can be formed by the plurality of fabric members, and thus the conveyor belt can be formed at a low cost at a wide width.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Furthermore, since the fabric joint section is disposed in the intermediate section of the body rubber, when the conveyor belt is rounded in a pipe shape to form the pipe-shaped portion, it is possible to easily maintain the shape of the pipe-shaped section with high accuracy.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">That is, for example, the fabric joint section has a configuration in which the side end sections of the fabric members adjacent to each other in the width direction of the belt overlap or a configuration in which side end sections abut.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Among these, when the fabric joint section has a configuration in which the side end sections of the fabric member overlap, and flexural rigidity of the fabric joint section in the width direction of the belt is higher than flexural rigidity of other sections of the reinforcement layer in the width direction of the belt.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Furthermore, when the fabric joint section has a configuration in which the side end sections of the fabric member abut, flexural rigidity of the fabric joint section in the width direction of the belt is lower than flexural rigidity of other sections in the width direction of the belt.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As described above, flexural rigidity of the fabric joint section in the width direction of the belt is different from flexural rigidity of other sections of the reinforcement layer in the width direction of the belt. For this reason, in the conveyor belt, in the intermediate section of the conveyor belt formed by the intermediate section of the body rubber with the fabric joint section disposed thereon, a different-rigidity section, in which flexural rigidity in the width direction of the belt is different from flexural rigidity of other sections of the conveyor belt in the width direction of the belt, is formed.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Moreover, if the different-rigidity section is formed in the intermediate section of the conveyor belt, when the conveyor belt is rounded in a pipe shape, distortion is liable to occur in the intermediate section of the conveyor belt.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the conveyor belt, since the pipe-shaped section is formed by mutually overlapping the side end sections of the body rubber on the upper side in the vertical direction, in the pipe-shaped section, the intermediate section of the conveyor belt is located on the lower side in the vertical direction. Accordingly, it is possible to cause<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> load due to its own weight of the conveyor belt and weight of an object to be carried to act on the intermediate section of the conveyor belt. Thus, by bringing the support roller into contact with the intermediate section of the conveyor belt from the outer side of the pipe-shaped section in the radial direction, distortion occurring in the intermediate section of the conveyor belt can be corrected, and the shape of the pipe-shaped section can be easily maintained with high accuracy.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In contrast, for example, when the fabric joint section is disposed on the side end section of the body rubber, it is difficult to maintain the shape of the pipe-shaped section.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">That is, in the conveyor belt, the side end section of the conveyor belt formed by the side end section of the body rubber is located on the upper side in the vertical direction when the conveyor belt is formed as the pipe-shaped section. Accordingly, the fabric joint section is disposed on the side end section of the body rubber, and the different-rigidity section is formed on the side end section of the conveyor belt. Thus, for example, when distortion occurs in the side end section of the conveyor belt or the like, it is difficult to correct the distortion, and the shape of the pipe-shaped section may be distorted.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Furthermore, in the conveyor belt, since the plurality of tension bodies are disposed in the width direction of the belt, the above-mentioned working effect can be enhanced.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">That is, when the plurality of tension bodies are disposed in the width direction of the belt, the reinforcing effect of reinforcing the flexural rigidity of the conveyor belt in the width direction of the belt by the tension body is liable to be different for each<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> position in the width direction of the belt of the conveyor belt. Accordingly, for example, when the fabric joint section has a configuration in which the side end sections of the fabric member overlap and flexural rigidity in the width direction of the belt is increased, and the fabric joint section is disposed on a section of the conveyor belt in which the reinforcing effect due to the tension body is high, flexural rigidity in the width direction of the belt in the different-rigidity section of the conveyor belt is greatly different from flexural rigidity in the width direction of the belt in other sections of the conveyor belt.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In this case, when the conveyor belt is rounded in a pipe shape to form the pipe-shaped section, distortion is more liable to occur in the intermediate section of the conveyor belt. However, in the above-mentioned conveyor belt, as described above, the distortion occurred in the intermediate section of the conveyor belt can be corrected. As a result, the shape of the pipe-shaped section can be easily maintained with high accuracy.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Furthermore, in the pipe conveyor related to the first aspect of the present invention, the intermediate section of the body rubber may be a section of the body rubber that is located between the intermediate section boundaries separated from the center in the width direction of the belt to the outer sides in the width direction of the belt, by the same distance as the size in the width direction of the belt of the side end section of the body rubber.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In this case, the intermediate section of the body rubber is a section of the body rubber that is located between the intermediate section boundaries separated from the center in the width direction of the belt to the outer sides in the width direction of the belt,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> by the same distance as the size in the width direction of the belt of the side end section of the body rubber. For this reason, by forming the pipe-shaped section by mutually overlapping the side end sections of the body rubber with each other on the upper side in the vertical direction, the intermediate section of the conveyor belt can be reliably located on the lower side in the vertical direction. As a result, the above-mentioned working effect can be reliably achieved.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In addition, the size of the side end section of the body rubber in the width direction of the belt is equal to the distance in the width direction of the belt from the center in the width direction of the belt in the body rubber to the intermediate section boundaries, and the size in the width direction of the belt of the side end section of the body rubber is 1/7 of a body width W of the body rubber in the width direction of the belt. In this case, in the pipe-shaped section of the conveyor belt formed with each other by mutually overlapping the side end sections of the body rubber, a central angle around the pipe axis from the center of the body rubber in the width direction of the belt to each intermediate section boundary is 60°.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As described above, there is a case in which, in the pipe-shaped section of the conveyor belt, the central angle around the pipe axis from the center of the body rubber in the width direction of the belt to each intermediate section boundary is 60°. In this case, when the conveyor belt is rounded in a pipe shape to form the pipe-shaped section, and the side end sections of the body rubber overlap with each other on the upper side in the vertical direction, a basic posture in which the center of the body rubber in the width direction of the belt is disposed right below the pipe axis is set.
