controllability of the pneumatic tire.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventional techniques for reducing rolling resistance of a tire include those disclosed in Patent Literature 1, Patent Literature 2 and the like. The invention disclosed in Patent Literature 1, which aims at providing a pneumatic tire capable of reducing rolling resistance without sacrificing stability, controllability and riding comfort, is characterized in that: a fold-back end of a carcass is positioned at the height of ≤ 0.15 time the height SH of the tire section; and a short fiber reinforced layer of ≥ 0.3mm and ≤ 1.0mm in thickness is arranged on the outer surface of the carcass in a sidewall area between a belt end and the fold-back end of the carcass. The short fiber reinforced layer is constituted of: a rubber component obtained by blending 30-60 parts by weight of natural rubber and/or isoprene rubber with 40-70 parts by weight of butadiene rubber; short fiber; and carbon black. At least 90% of the short fiber is oriented at an angle in the range of ±20° relative to the circumferential direction of the tire and the ratio of the complex elasticity E*a in the direction of orientation of the short fiber, with respect to the complex elasticity E*b in the direction orthogonal to the direction of orientation, is ≥ 5.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Further, the invention disclosed in Patent Literature 2, which aims at providing a pneumatic tire capable of making weight reduction and good stability and controllability thereof compatible without reducing riding comfort, is characterized in that: a carcass layer is made to be a single layer structure; ends of the carcass layer are each folded around a bead core from the inside toward the outside of the tire to interpose a bead filler therein, to a position which exceeds a tire maximum width and does not reach a belt layer; and the height of the bead filler measured from a bead heel is 15-30% of a tire cross section height SH, the rubber thickness of a sidewall portion is 3.5-5.0 mm, an inner liner is formed of a thermoplastic elastomer composition having Young's<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> modulus of 5-50 MPa and thickness of 0.05-0.25 mm, and the sidewall portion is made of a rubber composition containing at least 70 wt. % of natural rubber.</p><heading id="h0003">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004"><ul><li>PTL 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP8175119A"><text>JP-A 08-175119</text></patcit></li><li>PTL 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2009001228A"><text>JP-A 2009-001228</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problems</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, the invention disclosed in Patent Literature 1, which decreases rolling resistance of a tire by reducing tire weight by reducing a dimension in the tire radial direction of a fold-back portion of a carcass and a bead filler, tends to experience deterioration of stability and controllability due to decrease in rigidity of sidewall portions of the tire and there arises a problem that this deterioration of stability and controllability cannot be addressed even by providing an additional reinforcing layers at the sidewall portions.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Similarly, the invention disclosed in Patent Literature 2, although it can realize reduction of tire weight by reducing size of a bead filler, i.e. a shorter bead filler, experiences decrease in rigidity of side portions of the tire and therefore there arises a problem that stability and controllability cannot be well prevented from deteriorating in spite of efforts of enhancing rigidity of the side portions by increasing rubber thickness of the sidewall portions and forming an inner liner by a thermoplastic resin or a thermoplastic elastomer composition having higher Young's modulus and lower specific gravity than rubber.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">More specifically, rolling resistance of a standard pneumatic radial tire for a passenger car, where height in the tire radial direction of a fold-back portion of a carcass is 40-50% of the tire cross section height SH, height in the tire radial direction of a bead filler is at least 25 mm and thickness of sidewall rubber is at least 2.5 mm, can be effectively reduced by decreasing the height in the tire radial direction of the fold-back portion to 10-40% of the tire cross section height SH, the height in the tire radial direction of the bead filer to 10 mm to 20 mm and the thickness of the sidewall rubber to 1 mm to &lt; 2.5 mm (such size reduction, in combination with resulting decrease in<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> eccentricity of the tire, effectively reduces rolling resistance). However, rigidity of side portions of the tire inevitably deteriorates by this modification and it is very difficult to reliably obtain sufficiently high durability and required stability and controllability in such a case as this even by increasing thickness of sidewall rubber and the like.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In view of such problems as described above of the prior art, an object of the present invention is to provide a pneumatic tire capable of effectively reducing rolling resistance, while ensuring sufficiently high durability and good stability and controllability thereof.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to the Problems</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention has been contrived to solve the aforementioned problems of the prior art. Specifically, a pneumatic tire of the present invention is characterized that it comprises: at least one carcass ply constituted of rubber-coated ply cords and including a main body portion extending in a toroidal shape across respective bead cores embedded in a pair of bead portions and turn-up portions respectively turned up around the bead cores from the main body portion to extend on the outer side in the tire radial direction; a bead filler provided between the main body portion and each of the turned-up portions to extend from the corresponding bead core on the outer side in the tire radial direction; and a side rubber, wherein a tip portion extending on the outer side in the tire radial direction than the outer end in the tire radial direction of the bead filler, of each of the turned-up portions, extends to a position of at least 5 mm distance from the outer end in the tire radial direction of the bead filler with maintaining distance of 1 mm or less between the tip portion and the main body portion of the carcass ply, a turn-up end as the outer end in the tire radial direction of each turn-up portion of the carcass ply is disposed on the inner side in the tire widthwise direction than a neutral axis of bending of the bead portion and a corresponding sidewall portion and at 10%-40% height of a tire cross section measured from the innermost end in the radial direction of the tire, and the side rubber, disposed on the outer side in the tire widthwise direction of the main body portion and each turn-up portion of the carcass ply, covers the turn-up end and constitutes a part of an outer surface of the tire.<br/>
In the present invention, when a cross section height SH of a tire is different between on the vehicle-outer side and inner side of the tire, the aforementioned requirement that "a turn-up end is disposed ... at 10%-40% height of a tire cross section SH" is independently applied to each of the vehicle-outer side and the vehicle-inner side of the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> tire. A "tire cross section SH" represents in the present invention 1/2 of dimensional difference between outer and inner diameters of a tire inflated at a predetermined internal pressure under no load applied thereon as prescribed by JATMA. A "neutral axis of bending" represents a boundary between a portion subjected to tensile stress and a portion subjected to compressive stress of a bead portion and a corresponding sidewall portion when these two portions experience bending deformation and can be determined by calculating strains at the bead portion and the sidewall portion and continuously linking boundary points of tensile stress and compressive stress by using Finite Element Method (FEM).</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the pneumatic tire of the present invention, resistance to crack growth of a tire can be enhanced to ensure good durability thereof by: disposing the main body portion and each turn-up portion of the carcass ply such that these two portions in a region on the outer side in the tire radial direction of the bead filler extend with distance therebetween of 1 mm or less; disposing the turn-up end of each turn-up portion at a position on the inner side in the tire widthwise direction than the neutral axis of bending; and providing side rubber on the outer side in the tire widthwise direction of each turn-up end. Further, it is possible to reduce weight and eccentricity of a tire to decrease rolling resistance thereof by making the tire smaller by disposing each turn-up end of the carcass ply at 10%-40% height of a tire cross section SH measured from the innermost end in the radial direction of the tire (i.e. the rim diameter line). Yet further, it is possible to suppress occurrence of separation troubles originating at end portions of the carcass and the bead fillers by setting distance between each turn-up end and the corresponding bead filler end to be at least 5 mm so that significant discrepancy in rigidity is prevented from being generated at a single position and stress is well dispersed.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A pneumatic radial tire of the present invention is preferably characterized in that: in a cross sectional view in the tire widthwise direction of the pneumatic tire in a state where the tire is assembled with an application rim, inflated at a predetermined air pressure and mounted on a vehicle under a predetermined load exerted thereon, provided that: L<sub>out</sub> represents an imaginary line, passing through the maximum width position remotest from the tire equatorial plane in a sidewall portion situated on the vehicle outer side, to extend to be orthogonal to the tire equatorial plane; L<sub>in</sub> represents an imaginary line, passing through the maximum width position remotest from the tire equatorial plane in a sidewall portion situated on the vehicle inner side, to extend to be orthogonal<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> to the tire equatorial plane; H<sub>out</sub> represents a distance in the tire radial direction between the imaginary line L<sub>out</sub> and a ground-contact end on the vehicle outer side of the tread; and H<sub>in</sub> represents a distance in the tire radial direction between the imaginary line L<sub>in</sub> and a ground-contact end on the vehicle inner side of the tread, H<sub>out</sub> &lt; H<sub>in</sub>; radius of curvature (R<sub>out</sub>) of an outer surface of the sidewall portion on the vehicle outer side, at the maximum width position thereof, is smaller than radius of curvature (R<sub>in</sub>) of an outer surface of the sidewall portion on the vehicle inner side, at the maximum width position thereof; and a negative ratio of a ground-contact surface of the tread of a half portion, on the vehicle outer side with respect to the tire equatorial plane, of the tire when the tire is mounted on the vehicle is smaller than a negative ratio of a ground-contact surface of the tread of a half portion, on the vehicle inner side with respect to the tire equatorial plane, of the tire when the tire is mounted on the vehicle.<br/>
In the present invention, "radius of curvature at the maximum width position of a tire" represents radius of curvature of an arc passing through the maximum width position, remotest from the tire equatorial plane, of a sidewall portion.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">When a vehicle with tires mounted thereon is run straight, a ground-contact length in the tread circumferential direction of a ground-contact surface portion situated on the vehicle inner side when the tire is mounted on the vehicle, of a tread of the tire, is relatively long, while a ground-contact length in the tread circumferential direction of a ground-contact surface portion situated on the vehicle outer side when the tire is mounted on the vehicle, of the tread, tends to be extremely short, such that an outline of a foot print takes on a substantially blunt triangle-like shape as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3A</figref>. The present invention, being aware of this phenomenon, attempts to increase in the pneumatic tire thereof a ground-contact length in the tread circumferential direction of a ground-contact surface portion situated on the vehicle outer side when the tire is mounted on the vehicle, of the tread of the tire, to be equal to a ground-contact length in the tread circumferential direction of a ground-contact surface portion situated on the vehicle inner side when the tire is mounted on the vehicle, of the tread, during rotation of the tire under a load exerted thereon, such that a relatively large ground-contact area is ensured and the tire exhibits good stability and controllability in both straight running and cornering even when the weight of the tire has been reduced.<br/>
Further, a negative ratio, i.e. a groove area ratio, of a ground-contact surface of the tread of a half portion, on the vehicle outer side with respect to the tire equatorial plane, of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> tire when the tire is mounted on the vehicle is made smaller than a negative ratio of a ground-contact surface of the tread of a half portion, on the vehicle inner side with respect to the tire equatorial plane, of the tire when the tire is mounted on the vehicle in the present invention, so that i) drainage performance of a ground-contact surface of the tread of the vehicle-inner side half portion of the tire is improved and ii) rigidity of land portions of a ground-contact surface of the tread of the vehicle-outer side half portion of the tire is enhanced to effectively generate cornering force, i.e. demonstrate good cornering performance.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Further, according to the pneumatic tire of the present invention, the aforementioned distance H<sub>out</sub> in the tire radial direction on the vehicle outer side is set to be smaller than the aforementioned distance H<sub>in</sub> in the tire radial direction on the vehicle inner side, thereby decreasing rigidity of a side portion and improving ground-contact properties on the vehicle-outer side of the tire. Yet further, the aforementioned radius of curvature R<sub>out</sub> of the sidewall portion on the vehicle outer side is set to be smaller than the aforementioned radius of curvature R<sub>in</sub> of the sidewall portion on the vehicle inner side, thereby further decreasing rigidity of the side portion on the vehicle outer side and ensuring a sufficiently large ground-contact area to improve stability and controllability on the vehicle-outer side of the tire.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the present invention, an "application rim" represents a rim prescribed by any one of the following standards in accordance with tire size, "predetermined air pressure" represents air pressure corresponding to the maximum loading capacity in an application tire size prescribed in the standard, and a "predetermined load" represents a load corresponding to the maximum loading capacity in an application tire size prescribed in the standard.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The "standard" represents an industrial standard which is valid in a region where a tire is manufactured or used.

More specifically, when the ratio H<sub>in</sub>/H<sub>out</sub> is less than 1.1, ground-contact properties of a ground-contact surface on the vehicle outer side of the tread do not improve in a satisfactory manner.

Specifically, a half portion on the right-hand side with respect to the tire equatorial plane E of the tire 1 is situated on the outer side of the vehicle and a half portion on the lefthand side with respect to the tire equatorial plane E of the tire 1 is situated on the inner side of the vehicle in the state shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. Indication portions (not shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) indicating a direction in which the tire is to be mounted and/or a direction in which the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> tire is to be rotated are provided at a tire surface to assist an operator in mounting the tire on a vehicle.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Reference number 3 represents a tread portion, 5 represents each sidewall portion continuous with each side part of the tread portion 3 to extend on the inner side in the tire radial direction, and 7 represents each bead portion provided to be continuous with an inner end in the tire radial direction of each sidewall portion 5 in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A main body portion 11 a of a radial carcass 11 constituted of at least one carcass ply (a single carcass ply in the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) is provided across a pair of bead cores 9 embedded in the respective bead portions 7 such that the main body portion 11a extends in a toroidal shape between the bead cores 9. The radial carcass 11 also has turn-up portions 11b respectively wound up around the bead cores 9 from the inner side toward the outer side of the main body portion 11a in the tire widthwise direction. A bead filler 13 is provided between the main body portion 11a and each turn-up portion 11b such that the bead filler 13 extends from a position adjacent to an outer peripheral surface of the corresponding bead core 9 toward the outer side in the tire radial direction to taper off to a point. In this connection, each of the turn-up potions 11b of the carcass 11 is disposed such that distance between the turn-up portion 11b and the main body portion 11a remains 1 mm or less at a tip portion of the turn-up portion 11b on the outer side in the tire radial direction than the bead filler 13. Each turn-up portion 11b may be separated from the main body portion 11a, although these two portions are in contact with each other in the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. The definition that "distance between the turn-up portion 11b and the main body portion 11a remains 1 mm or less" means that length of a line drawn normal to the main body portion 11 a from the turn-up portion 11b is constantly 1 mm or less in the tip portion of the turn-up portion 11b. Further, the end 11c on the outer side in the tire radial direction of each turn-up portion 11b (which end will be referred to as "the turn-up end" hereinafter) is to be separated by shortest distance of at least 5 mm from the tip end 13a in the outer side in the radial direction of the bead filler 13.<br/>
Yet further, the end 11 c on the outer side in the tire radial direction of each turn-up portion 11b, i.e. the turn-up end 11c, is disposed on the inner side in the tire widthwise direction than a neutral axis of bending of the bead portion and a corresponding sidewall portion and at 10%-40% height of a tire cross sectional height SH in the tire radial direction (the neutral axis exists between an outer surface of the tire and the carcass,<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> along the main body portion 11a with substantially constant distance between the main body portion and itself, in the bead portion and the sidewall portion).<br/>
Yet further, side rubber 5 a is disposed on the outer side in the tire widthwise direction of the carcass ply 11 to cover the turn-up end 11c and constitute a part of the outer surface of the tire. A belt 15 is provided on the outer periphery side of a crown region of the carcass 11.<br/>
Rigidity of the tire can be enhanced by disposing the main body portion 11a and each turn-up portion 11b of the carcass ply 11 to extend close to each other. Further, crack generation originating from the turn-up end 11c can be prevented to ensure good durability of the tire by disposing the turn-up end 11c of each turn-up portion 11b at a position on the inner side in the tire widthwise direction than the neutral axis of bending and providing side rubber 5a on the outer side in the tire widthwise direction of each turn-up end 11c. Yet further, it is possible to reduce weight and eccentricity of the tire to decrease rolling resistance thereof by making the tire smaller by disposing each turn-up end 11c of the carcass ply at 10%-40% height of a tire cross sectional height SH measured from the innermost end in the radial direction of the tire (i.e. the rim diameter line). In this connection, it is preferable to dispose each turn-up end 11c at 10%-30% height of a tire cross sectional height SH measured from the innermost end in the radial direction of the tire (i.e. the rim diameter line) because then an effect of reducing rolling resistance can be more effectively obtained. Yet further, it is possible to split a rigidity changing point into two sites to disperse stress and suppress occurrence of separation troubles by setting distance between each turn-up end 11c and the corresponding bead filler end 13a to be at least 5 mm.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Thickness of the side rubber 5a is preferably in the range of 1 mm to 2.5 mm (exclusive of 2.5 mm) and more preferably in the range of 1.5 mm to 2.0 mm.

evaluating performances)</heading><p id="p0040" num="0040">In the present invention, rolling resistance is determined by: assembling a tire with a standard rim (4.5J x 13) prescribed in JATMA; inflating the tire at air pressure of 210 KPa; running the tire at 80 km/hour on an indoor drum tester with load (2.81 kN) equivalent to 73% of the maximum loading capacity prescribed in JATMA exerted thereon; and measuring resistance in the tire travelling direction generated at a ground-contact surface. Stability and controllability is determined by: assembling a tire with a vehicle-designated rim (4.5J x 13); inflating the tire at the vehicle-designated air pressure (230 KPa) and mounting the tire on a passenger car; running the car on an outdoor test course at speed generally expected of a passenger car (60 km/hour to 120 k/hour) under a loading condition of two passengers (1.19 kN to 2.7 kN); and evaluating stability and controllability of the car by feelings from the passengers. Durability is evaluated by: assembling a tire with a standard rim (4.5J x 13) prescribed in JATMA; inflating the tire at the standard internal pressure; running the tire at 60 km/hour on an indoor drum tester with load equivalent to 100% of the maximum loading capacity prescribed in JATMA exerted thereon; and measuring a distance travelled prior to occurrence of a trouble originated from a turn-up end of the carcass. The larger index value represents the better result.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">It is understood from the evaluation results shown in Table 1 that the tires of Examples 1-13 each successfully reduced rolling resistance with maintaining good stability and controllability and sufficiently high durability, as compared with the tires of Comparative Examples.</p><heading id="h0013">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading><p id="p0042" num="0042">According to the present invention, it is possible to provide a pneumatic tire capable of effectively reducing rolling resistance with maintaining sufficiently high durability and good stability and controllability.</p><heading id="h0014">REFERENCE SIGNS LIST</heading><p id="p0043" num="0043"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>1</dt><dd>Pneumatic tire (tire)</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>Tread portion</dd><dt>5</dt><dd>Sidewall portion</dd><dt>7</dt><dd>Bead portion</dd><dt>9</dt><dd>Bead core</dd><dt>11</dt><dd>Carcass<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></dd><dt>13</dt><dd>Bead filler</dd><dt>15</dt><dd>Belt</dd><dt>17</dt><dd>Ground-contact surface of tread</dd><dt>19</dt><dd>Circumferential main groove</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56983027" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A pneumatic tire, comprising:
