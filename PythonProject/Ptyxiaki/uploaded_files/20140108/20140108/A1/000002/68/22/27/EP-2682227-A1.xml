The suction-pad supporting units 1 are constituted by independent blocks, which can be positioned, as desired, on the working surface P, according to the original size and shape of the plate to be machined and the size and shape that it is desired to obtain. Each supporting unit 1 is provided with a bottom suction-pad member 1a and a top suction-pad member 1b. The bottom suction-pad member 1a and the top suction-pad member 1b define, with the working surface P and with the surface of the plate L, respective chambers that can be set in communication with a source of vacuum S through a flexible connection hose 10 associated to each block. In this way, each suction-pad member provides for blocking of the unit 1 on the working surface P and for blocking of the plate L to be machined on the unit 1. Furthermore, for correct positioning of the plates L to be machined on the working surface P there are also available units 2 for locating the plates, against which the edges of the plates come to bear. The units 2 are equipped with retractable top locator members 2b and bottom suction-pad members 2a for blocking the units 2 on the working surface P. Also the bottom suction-pad members of the units 2 can be connected to a source of vacuum S to obtain anchorage of the units 2 to the working surface P.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The invention is designed in particular to be applied on machines M or work centres of the type comprising a workbench 3 (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>) defining the aforesaid working surface P, on which the plate to be machined L is located in position and fixed via the aforesaid units 2 and 1, and an operating head 4, which can be displaced on the workbench 3 along a number of mutually orthogonal axes (X, Y, Z) by means of respective electronically controlled motor means (not illustrated and not described in detail herein since they are in themselves known).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The main advantage of the above conventional solution lies in the fact that<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> each supporting and/or locating unit can be positioned and withheld on the working surface in any point thereof, since the hoses that supply the vacuum enable easy displacement of each block into the desired position.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The disadvantage of the conventional solution described above lies, instead, mainly in the fact that the flexible hoses 10 constitute an encumbrance on the working surface P that proves at times troublesome for the operator, who has to position the suction-pad supporting units 1 and the locating units 2 between the various hoses 10.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to overcome the above drawback, the document No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2012085446A1"><text>WO 2012/085446 A1</text></patcit> has proposed a unit for supporting plates according to the preamble of Claim 1. This unit is provided with a source of vacuum inside it so that the flexible hoses for connection to an external source of vacuum are eliminated.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Also in the case of this solution, however, there remains a further problem, due to the fact that machining of the plates is carried out with simultaneous delivery of a jet of water. With the known solutions it is possible for a certain amount of water and machining sediments to drop onto the top suction pad during unloading of a piece that has been machined and from here to reach, through the intake duct, the pump that serves as source of vacuum, causing damage thereof.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The object of the present invention is to provide a unit for supporting plates that is equipped with an incorporated source of vacuum that is designed to overcome also the aforesaid problem due to the water that tends to rise as far as the vacuum pump.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">With a view to achieving the above object, the subject of the invention is a unit for supporting plates having the characteristics specified in Claim 1.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Further preferred and advantageous characteristics of the above unit are specified in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The invention also regards a machine for machining plates according to Claim 20.

At the bottom and top ends of this body 1, two suction-pad members are present, and in particular a bottom suction pad 1a and a top suction pad 1b The suction pads 1a and 1b comprise, respectively, a first peripheral gasket 1a1 and a second peripheral gasket 1b1, which are carried by the body of the unit 1. The first and second gaskets are designed to delimit a first closed chamber 1a2 and a second closed chamber 1b2. In particular, the first gasket 1a1 defines the first closed chamber 1a2 between the bottom surface of the body 1 and the working surface P, whereas the second gasket 1b1 defines the second closed chamber 1b2 between the top surface of the body 1 and the plate to be machined L.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The two closed chambers 1a2 and 1b2 can be connected to a source of vacuum S1 to obtain anchorage, respectively, of the unit 1 to the working surface P and of the plate to be machined L to the unit 1.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">Figures 3-6</figref>, the source of vacuum S1 is provided within the body of the unit 1. The source of vacuum S1 comprises a pump 11 driven by an electric motor 12, for example an electric motor with 24-V supply. The electric motor 12 is controlled by an electronic control unit 13, which is also provided within the body 1 of the unit. In particular, the electronic unit 13 controls turning-on and turning-off of the aforesaid electric motor 12 of the source of vacuum S1.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Once again with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>, the source of vacuum S1 is connected to the aforesaid first chamber 1a2 of the bottom suction-pad member 1a by means of a duct 14 and to a first solenoid valve 15 controlled by the electronic unit 13.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The solenoid valve 15, by opening, is able to set in communication, through the duct 14, the source of vacuum S1 with the first closed chamber 1a2.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In particular, the electronic unit 13 is programmed for causing anchorage of the supporting unit 1 to the working surface P by activating, initially, the electric motor 12 of the source S1 and by opening the first solenoid valve 15 to communicate, through the duct 14, a vacuum to the first chamber 1a2, and by closing the first solenoid valve 15 so as to isolate the first chamber 1a2 at negative pressure, so that subsequently it is possible to de-activate the electric motor 12 without causing the vacuum to cease in the first chamber 1a2.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A first advantage as compared to known solutions of the type illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1 and 2</figref> is represented by energy saving. In known solutions, the source of vacuum S is constantly functioning, whereas in the case illustrated the source S1 is activated for the time necessary to create the vacuum and then, once the solenoid valve 15 has been closed, the source S1 can be de-activated.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Within the body 1 of the supporting unit an electric-supply battery 16 is provided. This battery 16 is connected to the source of vacuum S1, to the solenoid valve 15, and to the electronic control unit 13. Preferably, the battery 16 is of a rechargeable type. Otherwise, in an alternative embodiment (not illustrated) the supporting unit 1 is provided with means for connection to an external electric-supply source.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the currently preferred embodiment illustrated, the supporting unit 1 comprises a single source of vacuum S1 provided in the body of the unit 1. The source of vacuum S1 is connected both to the first chamber 1a2 of the bottom suction-pad member 1a and to the second chamber 1b2 of the top suction-pad member 1b. As an alternative, it is possible to envisage providing two different sources of vacuum, the first connected to the first chamber 1a2 of the bottom suction-pad member 1a and the second connected to the second chamber 1b2 of the top suction-pad member 1b.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">To return to the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>, in which a single source of vacuum S1 is present, this source S1 is connected, via the aforesaid first solenoid valve 15, to the bottom suction-pad member 1a and, via a second solenoid valve<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> 17, to the second chamber 1b2 of the top suction-pad member 1b</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The first solenoid valve 15 and the second solenoid valve 17 are controlled independently by the electronic control unit 13 provided in the body of the unit 1.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Once again in the case of the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>, the suction-pad supporting unit 1 moreover comprises also a sensor 18 for detecting the vacuum generated by the source of vacuum S1. The sensor 18 sends, via a communication line 18a, a signal to the electronic control unit 13 for governing start or arrest of the motor 12 of the source of vacuum S1. As soon as the degree of vacuum set is reached, the sensor will communicate to the control unit 13 this information, and the control unit will close the solenoid valves 15 and 17 and then will switch off the motor 12. The sensor 18 will be moreover able to detect a drop in the level of vacuum and to signal (once again by means of the communication line 18a) to the control unit 13 the need to re-activate the source of vacuum S1.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>, the source of vacuum S1 may be switched to an operating mode in which it operates as pressure source in order to generate a flow of pressurized air that can be used for favouring detachment of the plate L from the top suction-pad member 1b</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In this case, also a third solenoid valve 21 is present for connecting the second closed chamber 1b2 to the source S1 in the mode where it is functioning as pressure source. The third solenoid valve 21 is connected to the pressure source S1 by means of a duct 14a interposed in which is a pressurized-air tank 20. Moreover interposed in the aforesaid duct 14a is a non-return valve 19 that allows the flow only in the direction of the second closed chamber 1b2.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The electronic control unit 13 provided within the body 1 is configured to communicate by wireless transmission means 13a with an external electronic unit 22 for control of all the supporting units 1 and/or locating units 2 associated to the machine M. The electronic control unit 13 is remotely controlled, for example, with radio-frequency modalities (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.), by the external unit 22. As an alternative to the radio-frequency mode or equivalents, the communication may take place even in wired mode (solution not illustrated).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">According to the most important characteristic of the present invention, the supporting unit 1 comprises in the above duct 14 between the second solenoid valve 17 and the second closed chamber 1b2 a valve 29 that allows flow of air from and to the second closed chamber 1b2 and prevents flow of water and debris towards the source of vacuum S1.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The valve 29 may be a valve in itself of a known type, but is preferably, instead, obtained according to the invention, in compliance with what is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 7</figref>.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The above valve serves to safeguard the pump of the source of vacuum from the water used for machining purposes (in the case where materials are machined with the aid of water) and from the sediments produced during the abrasive action.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In fact, the current state of the art envisages that, during the action of vacuum pressure, in the duct there passes a small amount of water and machining sediments, which, during the step of unloading of the piece that has already been machined, drop onto the top suction pad. The pump of the source of vacuum is sensitive in regard to water and to the machining sediments. Hence, the presence of the valve 29 serves to prevent the water and sediments from entering the intake duct and reaching the pump. The valve 29 will consequently be able to discharge water and sediments that drop into the area of the second closed chamber 1b2 outside the unit 1 by means of a discharge duct, not illustrated in the figures.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 7</figref> of the annexed drawings shows the preferred embodiment of the valve 29. With reference to this figure, the valve 29 comprises a body 290 formed in which is a vertical channel 301, in which a valve member 300 is vertically mobile. The valve member 300 has a top nose 300a, which extends through an opening of the body of the suction-pad member 1b. The member 300 is recalled by a spring 300b towards a raised position, in which the tip of the top nose 300a projects above the body of the suction-pad member 1b. The spring 300b is set between the member 300 and an axial guide stem 303b, fixed with respect to the body of the valve, on which the member 300 is slidably mounted.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The guide stem 303b projects upwards from an element 303a fixed within the body of the valve, with interposition of sealing rings 303c.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The bottom part of the vertical channel 301 constitutes, together with the top face of the element 303a, a sump for draining the water. In the element 303a, starting from the top surface of the latter, an annular chamber 303 is obtained, which constitutes an opening for discharge of the water collected in the sump. The chamber 303 communicates on its bottom with a duct 306 for discharge of the water.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">When a plate L is rested on the suction-pad member 1b it keeps, with its own weight, the mobile member 300 in the lowered position, illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> 7</figref>, against the action of the spring 300b. In this condition, a sealing ring 300c carried by the bottom face of the mobile member 300 co-operates with the top face of the element 303a to isolate the space inside the channel 301 from the discharge opening 303. In this condition, the space inside the channel 301 can be set in vacuum in so far as it communicates with the source of vacuum via a duct 304a which gives out into a hole 304 on the wall of the channel 301, in a position raised with respect to the bottom sump having the discharge opening 303. Any possible reflux of water into the hole 304 is prevented by the fact that a skirt 305 is provided fixed with respect to the body of the valve and surrounding the mobile member 300 so as to define therewith an annular passage 306 which gives out onto the top surface of the suction-pad member 1b. The bottom end of the skirt 305 is beneath the level of the hole 304 so that the skirt masks this hole with respect to a possible flow of water through the annular passage 306.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Operation of the valve of <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 7</figref> is described hereinafter.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">When a plate L is rested on the unit with the suction-pad member 1b, the mobile member 300 is pushed into its lowered position, against the action of the spring 300b, and thus keeps the space inside the vertical channel 301 isolated from the draining opening 303. In this condition, the space inside the channel is set in communication with the source of vacuum via the hole 304 and the duct 304a, and the this vacuum is communicated to the chamber 1b2 of the suction-pad member via the annular passage 306 so that the plate L is withheld in position.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">When the plate L is raised at the end of the machining operation, it may happen that part of the flow of machining water and possible machining sediments drop into the sump through the annular passage 306. However, removal of the plate L causes return of the mobile member 300 into its raised position, under the action of the spring 300b. In this position, the sealing ring 300c is set at a distance from the top surface of the element 303a so that the water and any possible sediments are drained through the discharge opening 303 into the discharge duct 307. In this step, the skirt 305 masks the hole 304, preventing any reflux of water and/or sediments into the duct 304a.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">When a new plate to be machined is positioned on the unit, the mobile member 300 isolates again the space inside the channel 301 from the discharge opening 303. Any possible residual amount of water that were to collect still on the bottom of the sump after lowering of the member 300 will be discharged in the next cycle, when the plate machined is removed again.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0040" num="0040"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref> is a schematic representation of a unit 2 according to the invention, used for locating the plate L on the working surface P of the machine M.
