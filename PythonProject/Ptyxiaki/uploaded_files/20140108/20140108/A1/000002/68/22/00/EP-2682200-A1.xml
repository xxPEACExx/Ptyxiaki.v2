Moreover, when the places in which the springs are<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> disposed are increased, in most cases, the increments of the blank holding force are different from one another for each place in which the spring is disposed. Therefore, there is a problem that kinds of the springs to be prepared are increased.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Moreover, when adjustment of the increment of the blank holding force is needed after the spring is disposed in the die member, if the spring is exchanged with a spring having a different spring constant, it is necessary to increase the blank holding force to the same magnitude according to the exchanged spring, and thus, changing of the stroke is also needed. In addition, for the adjustment of the stroke, it is necessary to change a depth of a concave portion in which the spring is disposed, and thus, reprocessing of the die member may be needed.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As described above, in order to more greatly increase the blank holding force with a low stroke, the use of the coned disc spring is effective. The increment of the blank holding force is adjusted with the kind and the laminating number of sheets of the coned disc spring, and an application load to the blank holding die member becomes a desired value. Here, if the coned disc springs are laminated, the obtained application load can be changed. However, at the same time, the entire length of the laminated coned disc spring is also changed. Accordingly, adjusting both ofthe stroke and the application load to a desired value is not easy.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">From the situation, in a press-forming die which includes a plurality of die members, when application of a load to a specific die member is needed as such a case where the blank holding force is increased, a load-applying device capable of easily adjusting both of the stroke and the application load is preferable.
