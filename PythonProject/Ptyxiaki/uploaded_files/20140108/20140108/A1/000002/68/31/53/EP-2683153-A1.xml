Particularly, a stereo camera technique having two imaging units has been developed.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A stereo camera has imaging units on both the right and left sides, and an image control unit thereof controls imaging timings and image data transmission timings of the right and left imaging units.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Image data signals transmitted from the right and left imaging units are transmitted to an image processing unit at the center of the camera to be subjected to an image processing.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Thereafter, a recognition application or the like uses the images processed in the image processing unit to recognize an object, thereby performing vehicle control depending on the recognition result.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The signals transmitted from the right and left imaging units may be clock signals or image synchronization signals in addition to the image data signals. The image synchronization signal indicates a vertical synchronization signal or a horizontal synchronization signal for determining an aspect size of the screen.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The stereo camera needs to calculate a disparity based on the images shot in the right and left imaging units for calculating a distance. The right and left imaging units need to shoot images at the same time for calculating the disparity.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In a typical stereo camera, the image control unit sends an imaging instruction to the right and left imaging units at the same time such that the right and left imaging units shoot images at the same time. The image data shot at the same time is transmitted to the image processing unit at the same timing.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Thus, when the image data signals, the clock signals or the image synchronization signals are transmitted from the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> right and left imaging units to the image processing unit, there is a problem that switching easily occurs in many signal lines at the same time and unnecessary large radiation noises are generated.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The vehicle-mounted camera device such as a stereo camera is attached near the room mirror in the vehicle interior in many cases. The circumstances around the room mirror are disadvantageous for an attachment position of a TV antenna (attached to or embedded in the front glass), a GPS antenna (on or near the dashboard) or EMC (Electromagnetic Compatibility). That is, even unnecessary small radiation noises can be easily caught by the TV antenna or GPS antenna. Under the condition of the attachment around the room mirror, a vehicle-mounted camera has a laterally elongate structure such as antenna-like structure, so as not to break a view of the driver or the passenger, which is disadvantageous for EMC.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Against the problem, as described in PTL 1, there is disclosed a structure capable of reducing unnecessary radiation noises by

The<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> embodiment of the vehicle-mounted camera device as a stereo camera will be described below, but is also applicable to a vehicle-mounted camera device having two monocular cameras.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The stereo camera as a vehicle-mounted camera device has two imaging units (cameras) including a first imaging unit 101 and a second imaging unit 102 at the right and left sides thereof. An image control unit 100 outputs imaging timing signals via a control line 111 (first control line) and a control line 112 (second control line) to control imaging timings of the first imaging unit 101 and the second imaging unit 102. Typically, the imaging timing signals for controlling the imaging timings of the control line 111 and the control line 112 are shutter control signals, or register setting signals for imaging devices or AFE (Analog Front End: A/D converter).</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Image data (left image and right image) shot by the first imaging unit 101 and the second imaging unit 102 is transmitted to an image processing unit 103 via a signal line 113 (first signal line) and a signal line 114 (second signal line) together with image data signals, clock signals or image synchronization signals. The transmission timings of the signal line 113 and the signal line 114 are controlled by the transmission timing control signals output from the image control unit 100 via a transmission timing control signal line 115 (first<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> transmission timing control signal line) and a transmission timing control signal line 116 (second transmission timing control signal line). Herein, the transmission timing control signal line 115 and the transmission timing control signal line 116 are clock lines for reference clock, and the like.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The image processing unit 103 calculates a disparity by use of the right and left image data shot by the first imaging unit 101 and the second imaging unit 102. A recognition unit 104 performs a recognition processing to perform an object recognition processing or to calculate a distance based on the result of the image processing. A vehicle control unit 105 makes calculations for vehicle control and issues a vehicle control instruction based on the processing result of the recognition unit 104.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">For the stereo camera, the image data shot by the first imaging unit 101 and the second imaging unit 102 has to be shot at the same time for calculating a disparity.
