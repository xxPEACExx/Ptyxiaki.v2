Different antennas radiate signals differently. However, all antennas require that the radiated signal make a complete circuit with the signal source. For example, a portion of the signal radiating from an antenna formed by a single wire, i.e., a monopole antenna, will electrically couple with the electrical ground surrounding the antenna. The electrical ground is referred to as the "ground plane." Certain antenna types, such as inverted "F" or bent monopoles are susceptible to interference by other concurrent signal currents such as digital circuits, clocks and other fast switching signals. Often, shared return paths for the antenna currents and high speed digital signals interfere with one another. The use of different antenna configurations as well as shielding techniques can minimize the effects of the ground plane interference.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">One antenna configuration that may reduce ground plane interference is a dipole antenna. A dipole antenna includes a feeder conductor and a resonant conductor (also called an antenna conductor). Typically, the resonant conductor has an overall length that is approximately equal to a half wavelength. The feeder conductor provides signals to the resonant conductor. The resonant conductor may be envisioned as two conductors shorted together at the center. A parallel arm conductor may be connected to the resonant conductor to establish a desired resonance. The resonant conductor length is typically an odd number of half wavelengths long, which is shorter in length than the parallel arm conductor. The parallel arm conductor may couple parasitically to the feeder conductor, and re-radiate a signal if properly stagger-tuned to the resonant conductor. The resonant conductor is supplied by a signal source at a pair of feed points from the feeder conductor near its center, and the resonant conductor may connect to the feeder conductor near to one of feed points.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The signal source provides a signal having a current and a voltage. The length, diameter and volume of the antenna conductors affect the impedance and bandwidth of the antenna. At the center of the feeder conductor, the current value is at a maximum and the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> voltage value is at a minimum. This results in a low impedance at the center of the feeder conductor. By matching the impedance of the antenna, called "gamma matching," to the input impedance of the signal source, the optimum power transfer between the feeder and the signal source and the maximum operational efficiency may be attained for signal transmission and reception. The dimensions (conductor length and diameter (i.e. volume)) of the resonant conductor and the resonant conductor's placement on the feeder conductor are selected by gamma matching. Typically, most systems use a balun to provide a balanced current that is out of phase.</p><heading id="h0002">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">According to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter, a device including a dipole antenna, signal conductor and a transceiver may be provided.

By taking advantage of the properties of a dipole antenna, a system of networked devices may be implemented in a business or residence. In the presently described implementations, a dipole antenna may have a shape and configuration that may allow it to properly operate at the frequencies suitable for effective communication between networked devices and/or a controller in a system configuration.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In order to provide effective communications, an antenna that provides efficient communication and optimum power transfer may be selected to provide an appropriate frequency response for the system. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary dipole antenna according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. The dipole antenna 100 may include a conductor 110 and feed points 120. The conductor 110 may include an offset conductor 160 that moves the typical center feed of typical dipole antenna. The feed points 120 may be for receiving signals for processing by a signal processing device, and transmitting signals from a signal source, such as a transceiver.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In a simplistic description, the impedance at the feed points 120 of the antenna 100 may be approximately determined according to Ohm's law (i.e. V=IR, where V= voltage, I = current, and R = resistance or impedance). The signal provided by the signal source may be a sinusoidal signal in which the current is out of phase with the voltage. At the feed points 120 of the dipole antenna 100, the current I is a maximum and the voltage V is a minimum. As a result, the impedance R at the feed point 120 may be considered similar to that of a short circuit, in which V(Min)/I (Max)=R(Min). Conversely, at the ends of the antenna conductor 110, current is a minimum and voltage is a maximum. In this case, the impedance at the end points of the conductor 110 may be considered to be similar to that of an open circuit, in which V(Max)/I (Min)= R(Max). Therefore, it may be possible to tune the impedance by manipulating the current and voltage distribution along the conductor 110 by altering one or both of the feed points 120. For example, in the illustrated example, one of the feed points 120 may be located substantially at the end of the offset conductor 160, which may effectively move the feed point 120 from the center of the conductors 110. As a result, the signal connects, or feed points may be physically offset from one another.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As shown in the example configuration, a first of the feed points 120 may be near the end of the offset conductor 160 and a second of the feed points 120 may remain near the center of the conductor 110. The offset conductor 160 may be formed by a slot 170 that separates the offset conductor 160 from the conductor 110. The offset conductor 160 may have a length d, and the slot 170 may have a width w. The combination of the offset conductor 160 length d and the slot 170 width w may effectively put the feed point on the offset conductor 160 further away from the center of the conductor 110. As a result, the antenna 100 impedance may be tuned, for example, to substantially 50 ohms, so that the current and voltage distribution along the resonant conductor results in the resonant conductor. By effectively moving the feed point a certain distance from the center of the conductor 110, gamma matching is performed. Of course, other impedance values may be obtained, such as 75 ohms, by altering the length d of the offset conductor 160, the width w of the slot 170, or both (for a given thickness and material composition of conductor 110). The impedance of the dipole antenna 100 may be substantially gamma matched to a signal chain impedance according to an amount of offset of the feed points 120, or signal connections.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In addition, the effective bandwidth may also be manipulated by the volume of the conductor 110. When the antenna conductors 110 have less volume, the antenna has less bandwidth, and when the conductor 110 volume is greater, the antenna 100 has a higher bandwidth. Accordingly, the antenna volume may be appropriately scaled to accommodate different frequency ranges, such as Wi-Fi, for example. Additional methods of increasing bandwidth to accommodate variations in manufacturing of components in the networked devices, for example, and/or further tuning the antenna 100 to the desired frequency are also contemplated. For example, the bandwidth of antenna 110 may be increased by adding tuning elements 115 and 116 at the ends of the conductor 110. The elements 115 and 116 may increase the conductor 110 volume. The increased volume may alter the current distribution of the conductor 110. As a result, the current at the feed point 120 may be at a particular value that results in an appropriate antenna impedance and bandwidth for the respective application. The antenna 110 may have dimensions including a volume that are suitable for the frequency being used by the network system. For example, an antenna used in a 900 MHz environment may have different dimensions, including volume, than one used in a Wi-Fi environment.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Another tuning technique that may be used is delta matching. Delta matching may utilize multiple offset conductors having respective lengths and volumes that in combination provide the desired tuning.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">An example system configuration of a disclosed implementation will be described with respect to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>. The system 200 may include a dipole antenna 210, offset feed points 220, feed lines 225, a transceiver 230, a printed circuit board (PCB) 240 and a housing 250. A processor 243 may be coupled to the PCB 240. In an example system implementation, a dipole antenna 210 may be configured to be coupled to, or incorporated into, a wall switch plate or similar housing 250, and to transmit and receive signals usable by a transceiver. The conductors of the dipole antenna 210 may be formed from conductor wires, or other conductors. The PCB 240 may include additional electronic components and circuitry. The circuitry in combination with the processor 243 may function as a control unit of connected devices, such as light bulbs in the case of a switch implementation, or of an appliance, if the system 200 is implemented with a receptacle. Alternatively, the system 200 may act as a gateway and pass data between connected devices and a network (not shown).<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The dipole antenna 210 may be formed from two conductors having feed points offset from one another that provide an appropriate impedance matching, or gamma matching. The two conductors may be coupled together by a conductive member. Alternatively, the dipole antenna 210 may be a single antenna conductor having two effective conducting regions fed at respective feed points by balanced signal communication lines 225 via offset feed points 220. A first of the offset feed points 220 may be located on an offset conductor, and a second of the offset feed points 220 may be located near the center of the dipole antenna 210. As a result, the first of the offset feed points 220 may be physically offset from a second of the offset feed points 220.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The transceiver 230 may be arranged near the edge of the PCB 240 closest to the antenna 210 in order to mitigate the chances of any radiated signals interfering with the circuitry on the PCB 240, such as the processor 143. The PCB 240 may act as the ground plane of the system 200. The transceiver 230 may couple to a pair of balanced signal path communication lines 225 that may connect the transceiver 230 to the offset feed points 220 of the respective conductors. The transceiver 230 may be implemented on the printed circuit board 240. The printed circuit board 240 may include the balanced signal path communication lines 225. The balanced signal path communication lines 225 may have a pair of signal lines that have substantially equal impedance through which currents of equal value may pass between the transceiver 230 and the offset feed points 220. The balanced signal path communication lines 225 between the transceiver 230 and the offset feed points 220 may be a balanced signal path, such that a current value on each of the pair of signal connection is substantially the same. The balanced signal path communication lines 225 may be balanced without the use of a balun. The dipole antenna 210 may be tuned to operate at a frequency range suitable for the transceiver 230. For example, the transceiver 230 may operate at a frequency of approximately 900 MHz. Alternatively, the transceiver 230 may operate within an ISM band of frequencies (e.g., 915 MHz, 2.45 GHz or 5.8 GHz), Wi-Fi frequencies, or the like. However, the dipole antenna 210 may be configured to operate within a certain frequency range (e.g., approximately 10-15% around a center frequency) to allow for deviations from the respective frequency that may result from variations in manufacturing, component or fabrication processes used for devices that communicate with the device 200. The bandwidth may be further expanded using different techniques. For<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> example, the bandwidth may be expanded by adding a parasitic element and stagger tuning the parasitic element to the antenna conductor 210. The communication lines 225 may be soldered at the transceiver 230 and terminate at the offset feed points 220. The dipole antenna 210 may connect to a feed line 225 via connectors 220. The offset feed points 220 may be soldered to the conductors of the dipole antenna 210. However, for ease of manufacturing and replacement, the offset feed points 220 include signal conducting pins that may be, for example, spring-loaded touch connectors, known as "Pogo pins", or flexible connectors (e.g., spring clips), or any type of connector between the communication lines 225 and the conductors of the dipole antenna 210 that allows there to be acceptable performance of the device 200. For example, the offset feed points 220 may connect to the communication lines 225 directly or by some other method such as jumpers, plugs, cables, conductive solder bumps, or the like. The communication lines 225 may be formed from wires, etched metal waveguides, metallic strips, or the any other suitable conductor. The gamma matching of the dipole antenna 210 with the signal chain impedance may also take into account an impedance of the signal conducting pins and an impedance of the transceiver 230.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The housing 250 may be configured as a replacement for a standard switch plate, such as those used in residential or office lighting installations. The housing 250 may be formed from a material, such as plastic, and cover the dipole antenna 210 from view of users within the residence or office. The housing 250 may also have other configurations to allow it to be used in other appliances, such as a microwave or a television as described with respect to <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>. The conductors of the dipole antenna 210 may be conformed to the shape of the housing 250. For example, the conductors may be folded around obstacles, such as mounting hardware or a corner of the housing 250 and still provides suitable performance for the application. When the housing 250 is implemented as a switch plate and mounted on a wall, the antenna 210 and the PCB 230 may be built into the switch plate. The switch plate housing 250 may protrude slightly more from the wall than a standard wall-mounted switch plate. The dipole antenna 210 may either be printed (using plating techniques or conductive ink) on the back of the housing 250 or made as a stamped conductor (from wire similar in dimension to a paper clip) that is put into the housing 250.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The housing 250 may be made from a metal, plastic or some other moldable material. Stamped metal or conductive ink may be used to form the dipole antenna configurations. The housing 250 may be etched, using a laser for example, and plated forming a conductive path having substantially similar properties as the dipole antenna. The housing 250 may be covered with an aesthetically pleasing cover when made from a conductive material. The different housing configurations may affect the antenna radiation patterns as well as alter the antenna bandwidth. In an implementation, the system 200 may provide a balanced antenna implemented into a light switch that mitigates the ground plane interference of the PCB 240.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Alternatively, the housing 250 may be made from a conductive material, such as metal. By etching, stamping, or cutting of the housing 250, an antenna 210 configuration having the appropriate gamma matching properties may be produced. For example, a complementary slot antenna configuration may be produced in which an all metal switch plate with a hole cut into it produces a radiation pattern, effective bandwidth, and matched impedance similar to that of a dipole antenna. In a slot antenna configuration, the connectors 220 may have to be configured differently than in a dipole antenna configuration. For example, the connectors 220 may have to perpendicular to the housing.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Also shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref> is a processor 243 that may be hosted on the PCB 240 or otherwise incorporated into devices as disclosed herein.
