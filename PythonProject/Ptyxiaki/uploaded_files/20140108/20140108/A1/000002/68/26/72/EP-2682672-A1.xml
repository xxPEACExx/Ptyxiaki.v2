The LED is small in size in comparison with an incandescent bulb, and can allow the size of the lighting unit to be reduced. However, since the LED is an electronic part mounted on the surface of an electronic board, and the importance of thermal management increases together with an increase of the light amount of the LED, a different scheme from that for an incandescent bulb may be required for the arrangement structure of the LED.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2008192313A"><text>2008-192313</text></patcit> discloses an LED lighting unit which has two kinds of reflectors for a low beam and a high beam and wherein changeover between a low beam and a high beam is carried out by changing the irradiation direction of the LED using an actuator.

Therefore, heat generated from the LEDs as light sources can be dissipated from the sides of the plate-like members opposite to the mounting faces. Further, since the heat dissipation portion can be assured by a size of the plate-like members, a large heat dissipation area can be assured. Furthermore, since the cooling fins which configure a heat sink are disposed at a position at which they are less liable to be visible from the outside, the appearance of the LED lighting unit is not degraded.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Preferably, the cooling fins are disposed such that a longitudinal (lengthways) direction thereof is perpendicular to a longitudinal (lengthways) direction of the two plate-like members.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">With this arrangement, a large number of cooling fins can be formed, and the heat of the plate-like members can be dissipated effectively.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Preferably, the plate-like members and the reflectors are formed separately from each other.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Thus, the shape of the plate-like members is less likely to be influenced by the shape of the reflectors, and the degree of freedom for the designer in shaping the plate-like members is enhanced, and besides a great disposition space can be assured for the cooling fins. Further, various LED lighting units can be configured by changing only the reflectors.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Preferably, one of the two plate-like members configures a high beam while the other of the two plate-like members configures a low beam.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">With this arrangement, the cooling fins can be formed without complicating the shape of the plate-like members, and the space between the plate-like members for high and low beams can be utilized effectively as a disposition space for the cooling fins.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Preferably, erected portions having a face substantially perpendicular to the mounting faces of the LED apparatus are formed at one end portion of the plate-like members to the rear of the reflectors, and second cooling fins are provided on the erected portions.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">By the provision of the erected portions, the disposition space for the cooling fins can be expanded to enhance the cooling performance.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In a further preferred form, the second cooling fins are formed on both faces of the erected portions, and the second cooling fins on the front faces of the erected portions are formed so as to extend to a position in proximity to the reflectors conforming with a shape of the reflectors.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">With this arrangement, the cooling fins can be formed in an increased size.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Preferably, the two plate-like members are spaced from and fixed to each other with a spacer interposed therebetween, and the cooling fins are disposed so as not to contact any other member in the vertical direction thereof.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">With this arrangement, the assembling property is improved, and also the cooling performance for the LEDs and so forth can be improved.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Preferably, the two plate-like members have the same shape as each other.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Thus, by fabricating a common mould, the productivity can be improved.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Preferably, the cooling fins are formed so as to overlap with each other in the vertical direction without contacting each other when the two plate-like members are fixed.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">With this arrangement, the vertical dimension of the cooling fins can be increased.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example only, and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

The LED lighting unit 2 is configured such that, when it is attached to the rear of the front cowl 11 using threaded holes 22 formed in the attachment stays 21, only the part of the lens face of the LED lighting unit 2 within the broken lines in the drawings is exposed and visible from in front of the vehicle through the opening of the front cowl 11.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The LED unit 30 includes LED apparatus 60 and 70 formed from LEDs 32a and 42a and boards 32 and 42 which support the LEDs 32a and 42a, respectively. The LED unit 30 is supported so that it can pivot with respect to the base member 20, around a lower portion of the left side of the LED unit 30 (relative to the vehicle in use) with a support shaft 47 as a centre of rotation. Further, the LED unit 30 is configured such that adjustment of the optical axis in the vertical direction can be carried out by an adjustment mechanism 37 provided at an upper portion of the left side of the LED unit 30 (again, relative to the vehicle in use). The LED unit 30 is further configured such that adjustment of the optical axis in the horizontal direction can be carried out by another adjustment mechanism 58, provided at a lower portion of the right side of the LED unit 30 relative to the vehicle in use.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The extension 23 is formed from a coloured transparent resin, for example of a smoke colour, and has a function that only reflectors 34 and 44, which reflect light from the light source forwardly of the vehicle, are exposed and visible from the front of the vehicle through the through-hole 3, and portions other than the reflectors 34 and 44 are masked so that they are not visible from the outside.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Reference is made also to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, which is a perspective view of the LED unit 30. The LED unit 30 is configured by coupling a low beam plate-like member 31 (the upper plate member in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>) on which the low beam LED apparatus 60 is mounted to a high beam plate-like member 41 (the lower plate member in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>) on which the high beam LED apparatus 70 is mounted. The low beam LED apparatus 60 and the high beam LED apparatus 70 are attached to the low beam plate-like member 31 and the high beam plate-like member 41, respectively, by two screws 57. In the present embodiment, the low beam plate-like member 31 and the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> high beam plate-like member 41 have substantially the same structure, and therefore, in the following description, portions of them which have the same structure will only described in detail with reference to the low beam plate-like member 31.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In the low beam plate-like member 31 (high beam plate-like member 41), a mounting face 31b of the low beam LED apparatus 60 (high beam LED apparatus 70) is substantially horizontal, and the low beam reflector 34 (high beam reflector 44) is fixed to the mounting face 31b using mounting screws 54. The low beam reflector 34 (high beam reflector 44) is curved in such a manner as to cover the low beam LED apparatus 60 from above (cover the high beam LED apparatus 70 from below). Since the reflectors 34 and 44 are formed separately from the plate-like members 31 and 41, it is possible to form the plate-like members 31 and 41 from a metal which is superior in heat dissipation, and to form the reflectors 34 and 44 from a synthetic resin or the like to which metal deposition or plating is applied. Consequently, a lighting unit which is low in cost and weight and superior in heat dissipation can be formed.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">It should be noted that the LED unit 30 in the present embodiment is configured such that, upon selection of low beam, only the low beam LED 32a is turned on, and upon selection of high beam, only the high beam LED 42a is turned on. However, the LED unit 30 may be configured otherwise such that, for example, upon selection of high beam, both of the LEDs 32a and 42a are turned on simultaneously. Alternatively, the light amounts of the LED apparatus 60 and 70 may be made different from each other, or the reflectors 34 and 44 may have different shapes from each other.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In the LED lighting unit 2 according to the present embodiment, both of a high cooling performance for the LED apparatus 60 and 70 and reduction in size of the LED unit 30 are achieved by fixing the low beam plate-like member 31 and the high beam plate-like member 41 in a state in which a predetermined space 50 is assured between them.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The low beam plate-like member 31 and the high beam plate-like member 41 are fixed at opposite end portions thereof by bolts 51, with cylindrical spacers 52 interposed therebetween.

A plurality of cooling fins 35 are provided on a lower face of the low beam plate-like member 31 and a plurality of cooling fins 45 are provided on an upper face of the high beam plate-like member 41, and the cooling fins 35, 45 extend in<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> an opposing relationship to each other into the space 50. The cooling fins 35 and 45 are disposed such that the longitudinal direction thereof is perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the plate-like members 31 and 41 (the lateral direction of the vehicle).

Therefore, assembly is improved, and the cooling performance for the LEDs is also improved. It should be noted that the plate-like members 31 and 41 can be formed from a resin, a metal or the like, and the cooling fins 35 and 45 can be formed from a metal such as aluminium and fixed to the plate-like members 31 and 41 by a bonding agent, fastening members or the like.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Air which passes the space 50 flows in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle along the direction of the cooling fins 35 and 45, and also flows in the lateral direction of the vehicle through gaps 52a formed at end portions of the cooling fins 35 and 45.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Further, an erected portion 31a is provided at a rear end of the low beam plate-like member 31, such that it extends vertically upwardly.

The erected portions 31a and 41a form another plane, substantially perpendicular to the mounting faces 31b and 41b of the LED apparatus 60 and 70, respectively. Further, in the present embodiment, the plate-like member 31 and the erected portion 31a are formed integrally with each other, as are the plate-like member 41 and the erected portion 41 a, such that the plate-like members generally have a substantially L-shaped cross-section.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">An attachment stay 36 in the form of a plate is fixed to the upper erected portion 31 a, and the adjustment mechanism 37 is attached to a left end portion (relative to the vehicle in use) of the attachment stay 36.

The support shaft (aiming pivot) 47 is fixed to a lower end portion of the attachment stay 46, which is in turn fixed to a left end portion (relative to the vehicle in use) of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the lower erected portion 41a. An adjustment mechanism 58 is attached to a lower end portion of the attachment stay 55, which is in turn attached to a right end portion (relative to the vehicle in use) of the lower erected portion 41a. The attachment stays 46 and 55 are fixed by fixing screws 56a fitted in through-holes 56 formed therein. Cut-outs are provided on the attachment stays 36 and 55 such that they are engaged by the adjustment mechanisms 37 and 58, respectively, and a through-hole 46a is provided in the attachment stay 46 such that it is engaged by the support shaft 47. It should be noted that also it is possible to fix the attachment stays using through-holes 56 on the right side (relative to the vehicle in use) of the erected portion 31 a, depending on the structure of the base member 20.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">On a rear face (relative to the vehicle in use) of the erected portions 31a and 41a to which the attachment stays 36, 46 and 55 are fixed, a plurality of second cooling fins 38 are provided.
