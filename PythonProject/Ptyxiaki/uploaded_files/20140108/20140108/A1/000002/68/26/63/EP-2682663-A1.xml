However, the infrastructure for the supply of hydrogen used as the fuel has not yet been built sufficiently. For this reason, a hydrogen-rich fuel gas is generated by reforming a raw material, such as city gas (the gas supplied in cities using pipes), LP gas, and kerosene, by a hydrogen generator. Then, using the generated hydrogen and the oxygen in the air, they are caused to react in a solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell (hereinafter referred to as a "fuel cell") to generate electric power, and the heat produced by the reaction is collected and stored in the form of hot water in a hot water tank. The hot water stored in the hot water tank is effectively utilized for heat supplying to outside. Such a fuel cell system has been developed.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Such a fuel cell system is known in which a hydrogen generator and a fuel cell are enclosed in a package so as to generate electric power by utilizing, tor example, city gas (for example, see Patent Literature 1).<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the fuel cell, a hydrogen rich fuel gas is used as an anode gas, and the air is used as a cathode gas. The anode off gas and cathode off gas after electric power generation contain a large amount of water. For this reason, a gas-liquid separator is disposed in the anode off gas passage and the cathode off gas passage so as to separate water and off gas from the anode off gas and the cathode off gas, and the separated water is stored in a tank and is supplied to a hydrogen generator so that it can be used in a hydrogen generation process.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As a configuration of this gas-liquid separator, a gas-liquid separator is known in which an off gas inlet and an off gas outlet are provided in an upper portion of a hermetically-sealed tank, a condensed water outlet and a discharge water valve are provided in a lower portion of the tank, and a water level sensor for monitoring a water level is provided in the tank (for example, see Patent Literature 2).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref> is a configuration diagram illustrating the configuration of the conventional fuel cell system described in Patent Literature 1.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>, the interior of the casing 1 contains a hydrogen generating device 2 that generates a hydrogen-rich fuel gas from a raw material and water, a fuel cell 4 that performs electric power generation using the fuel gas obtained by the hydrogen generating device 2 and air supplied by an air pump 3, a cathode gas-liquid separator 5 that separates water from a cathode off gas discharged from the fuel cell 4, an anode gas-liquid separator 6 that separates water from an anode off gas discharged from the fuel cell 4, a condensed water tank 7 that stores condensed water collected from the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> cathode gas-liquid separator 5 and the anode gas-liquid separator 6, and a reforming water pump 9 that supplies the condensed water in the condensed water tank 7 to the hydrogen generating device 2.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref> is a configuration diagram illustrating the configuration of the gas-liquid separator described in Patent Literature 2.

However, in order to prevent the cathode off gas guided into the gas-liquid separator from leaking out of the gas-liquid separator, it is necessary to ensure hermeticity of the junction portion of the main body and the lid. For this reason, the conventional configuration employs a structure in which the main body and the lid are fastened by intimately fixing them using a technique such as welding and adhesion, or a structure that ensures the sealing performance by sandwiching a sealing material such as packing or an 0 ring between the main body and the lid and screw-fastening the main body and the lid.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The former structure, in which the main body and the lid are fastened by intimately fixing them using a technique such as welding and adhesion, cannot separate the lid and the main body from each other easily. Consequently, a problem with this structure is that, at the time of maintenance, it is difficult to remove the stain that has been deposited in the interior of the main body or the stain that has been attached to the inner wall of the main body over long-term use. Another problem is that it is difficult to repair or replace the sensors and the like in the main body.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">With the latter structure, the lid and the main body can be separated because the sealing performance is ensured by sandwiching a sealing material such as packing or an O ring between the main body and the lid and screw-fastening the main body and the lid. As a result, this structure offers easy maintenance because it is easy to remove the stain that has been deposited that has been deposited in the interior of the main body or the stain that has been attached to the inner wall of the main body at the time of maintenance.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In this case, however, in order to ensure the sealing performance between the main body and the lid, the attaching/removing work of the lid tends to become complicated. For example, there may be a case that the sealing performance between the main body and the lid is inappropriate because of rough attaching/removing work of the lid. In that case, due to the pressure ditrerence between the pressure of the gas inside the main body and the pressure of the gas outside the main body, one of the gases may flow out or flow in from the junction portion of the lid and the main body, and as a consequence, a problem arises that the two gases mix with each other (in other words, hemieticity cannot be ensured).</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Moreover, the configurations of the packing, the 0 ring, and the screws, which are the constituent elements for ensuring the sealing performance, are complicated, which becomes a cause of higher costs.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The present invention solves the foregoing problems in prior art, and it is an object of the invention to provide a gas-liquid separator that can achieve efficient attaching/removing work of the lid and simplification of the device configuration while ensuring good hermeticity and easy maintenance.</p><heading id="h0007">SOLUTION TO PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">In order to solve the foregoing problems, a gas-liquid separator of the present invention includes:
<ul><li>a main body including a bottom face portion and a tubular side wall, one end of the side wall being connected to the bottom face portion, the other end of the side wall<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> including a first opening;</li><li>a lid disposed so as to cover the first opening and including a gas inlet port and a gas outlet port; and</li><li>a tubular separating wall disposed inside the side wall, one end of the separating wall being connected to the lid, the other end of the separating wall including a second opening, wherein:
<ul><li>a gap is provided between the bottom face portion and an end portion on the side of the second opening of the separating wall; and the side wall includes a water outlet port provided at a location higher with respect to a vertical direction than the end portion on the side of the second opening.</li></ul></li></ul></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">With this, a hermetically closed space is formed by the lid, the separating wall, and the water stored in the main body to ensure the hermeticity for the off gas that passes through the inside of the gas-liquid separator. As a result, because the hermeticity at the junction portion of the lid and the main body is made unnecessary, in a gas-liquid separator in which the lid and the main body are separable, the structure of the lid and the main body is allowed to be a seal-less structure, which does not use packing, an O ring, or the like. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain a gas-liquid separator that achieves efficient attaching/removing work of the lid and simplification of the device configuration.</p><heading id="h0008">ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">The present invention enables the structure of the lid and the main body to be a seal-less structure, which does not use packing, an O ring, or the like.

As a result, the hermeticity at the junction portion of the lid and the main body is made unnecessary, and in a gas-liquid separator in which the lid and the main body are separable, the structure of the lid and the main body is allowed to be a seal-less structure, which does not use packing, an O ring, or the like. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain a gas-liquid separator that achieves efficient attaching/removing work of the lid and simplification of the device configuration.

<ol><li>(a) When the hydrogen generating device 2 (the hydrogen generator 2A) is supplied with a city gas and pure water supplied from the condensed water tank 7 via a water purifier 8 by the reforming water pump 9, a hydrogen-rich fuel gas is generated. In the hydrogen generating device 2, an excessive fuel gas of the fuel gas supplied to the fuel cell 4 is combusted by the combustor 2B so as to heat water to obtain steam, and the combustion exhaust gas from the combustor 2B is discharged outside. This combustion exhaust gas also contains water. For this reason, it is possible that the combustion exhaust gas discharged from the combustor 2B of the hydrogen generating device 2 may be guided into the cathode gas-liquid separator 5, and water may be separated and recycled from the combustion exhaust gas.</li><li>(b) The fuel cell 4 generates electric power using the hydrogen-rich fuel gas as the anode gas and using the air supplied by the air pump 3 as the cathode gas.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></li><li>(c) The cathode off gas after electric power generation is guided from the gas inlet port 14 of the lid 16 of the cathode gas-liquid separator 5 into the interior of the cathode gas-liquid separator 5. Note that water has been supplied into the main body 13 of the cathode gas-liquid separator 5 by opening a water feed valve 21 in advance so that water is filled to the position at least over the lower end of the separating wall 18 of the lid 16.</li><li>(d) The cathode off gas that has entered from the gas inlet port 14 goes into the space formed by the lid 16, the separating wall 18, and the water stored in the main body 13. In this region, water is separated from the cathode off gas, and the water is stored in the main body 13.</li><li>(e) The cathode off gas from which water has been removed is discharged out of the casing 1 from the gas outlet port 15 of the lid 16.</li></ol></p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In the cathode gas-liquid separator 5, because the lid 16 and the separating wall 18 are integrally molded with each other (or integrally formed with each other using weld, bonding, or the like), there is no leakage at the boundary line between the lid 16 and the separating wall 18. In addition, hermeticity for the cathode off gas is ensured by the space formed by the lid 16, the separating wall 18, and the water stored in the main body 13 (that is, the interior of the main body 13 is made to be a water sealing structure). Thus, the hermeticity at the junction portion of the lid 16 and the main body 13 is unnecessary because the junction portion of the main body 13 and the lid 16 is disposed outwardly relative to the separating wall 18 when viewed from a vertical direction. In other words, because the junction portion of the main body 13 and the lid 16 does not receive the internal pressure of the gas supplied from the gas inlet port 14, it is possible to prevent the gas inside the main body 13 and the gas outside the main body 13 from being mixed with each other.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0052" num="0052">As a result, the structure of the lid 16 and the main body 13 is allowed to be a seal-less structure, which does not use packing, an O ring, or the like. Therefore, in the cathode gas-liquid separator 5 in which the lid 16 and the main body 13 are separable, it is possible to achieve efficient attaching/removing work of the lid and simplification of the device configuration. Moreover, because of the simplification of the device configuration, the cost of the cathode gas-liquid separator 5 can be reduced.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In addition, the gap is provided between the side wall 12 of the main body 13 and the separating wall 18 of the lid 16. With this, because the gap between the side wall 12 and the separating wall 18 serves as a heat insulation layer, it is possible to suppress the heat dissipation loss resulting from the release of heat of the condensed water stored in the main body 13 to outside of the cathode gas-liquid separator 5. This prevents the temperature drop of the condensed water in the cathode gas-liquid separator 5 and reduces the amount of heating at the time when the condensed water is used by the hydrogen generating device 2. As a result, the operation efficiency of the fuel cell system can be improved.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">When operating the system continuously, the water level of the condensed water of the main body 13 gradually rises. However, the condensed water passes through the gap between the separating wall 18 of the lid 16 and the bottom face portion 10 of the main body 13, and the condensed water is discharged from the water outlet port 20 provided in the side wall 12 of the main body 13 into the condensed water tank 7. Thus, the water level in the main body 13 can be kept at a constant level. By discharging the condensed water from the water outlet port 20 in this way, the interior of the main body<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> 13 is prevented from being filled with the condensed water, and the cathode off gas passage is prevented from being clogged.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Moreover, the water level of the condensed water stored in the main body 13 can be changed by selecting the vertical location of the water outlet port 20 provided in the side wall 12 at an appropriate location in an up-down direction. Thus, the upper limit of the water level of the condensed water in the main body 13 can be kept constant at a target water level without using a special device, such as a water level sensor, a discharge valve, and a control unit. Note that the controlling of the lower limit of the water level of the condensed water in the main body 13 will be explained in the later-described modified example.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In addition, the water outlet port 20 is provided gravitationally upward relative to the end portion of the second opening 17 of the separating wall 18 (in other words, at a location higher with respect to a vertical direction than the end portion on the side of the second opening 17). Therefore, even when the condensed water is drained from the water outlet port 20, the water level of the condensed water in the main body 13 stays gravitationally above the end portion on the side of the second opening 17 of the separating wall 18. Thus, the hermeticity of the space formed by the lid 16, the separating wall 18, and the water stored in the main body 13 can be ensured.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">At this time, the first opening 11 of the main body 13 is provided so as to open gravitationally upward so that the water surface of the condensed water in the main body 13 becomes horizontal (that is, the opening face of the first opening 11 is orthogonal to the gravitational direction). With this, the distance between the water surface of the<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> condensed water in the main body 13 and the upper end of the side wall 12 is kept constant over the entire circumference of the side wall 12. Therefore, even when the water level of the condensed water in the main body 13 rises, the condensed water in the main body 13 can be prevented from leaking out of the cathode gas-liquid separator 5 from a portion of the upper end of the side wall 12.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">In addition, the second opening 17 is provided so as to open gravitationally downward so that the water surface of the condensed water in the main body 13 becomes horizontal (that is, the opening face of the second opening 17 is orthogonal to the gravitational direction). With this, the distance between the lower end of the separating wall 18 provided on the lid 16 and the water surface of the condensed water stored in the main body 13 (i.e., the water level of the condensed water with reference to the lower end of the separating wall 18) becomes equal over the entire circumference of the separating wall 18. Therefore, even when the water level of the condensed water in the main body 13 lowers, the cathode off gas can be prevented from leaking out from a portion of the lower end of the separating wall 18, and the hermeticity of the space formed by the lid 16, the separating wall 18, and the water stored in the main body 13 can be ensured.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Furthermore, because the gas inlet port 14 and the gas outlet port 15 are provided inwardly relative to the junction portion of the lid 16 and the separating wall 18, the cathode off gas passes through the inner side of the separating wall 18. As a result, the side wall 12 and the separating wall 18 serve as heat insulation walls to suppress the heat dissipation amount of the cathode off gas, and the temperature of the cathode off gas can be kept high when the cathode off gas is discharged outside from the casing 1. Therefore, condensation can be prevented in the gas discharge portion of the casing 1.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Although Embodiment 1 describes the cathode gas-liquid separator 5, it is also possible to apply the configuration of the present embodiment to the anode gas-liquid separator 6.

As a result, the gas leakage resulting from water shortage in the gas-liquid separator can be prevented because abnormality of the water level of the condensed water can be identified. Also, the gas leakage resulting from water shortage in the gas-liquid separator can be prevented because an appropriate amount of water can be supplied into the main body 13 from the water feed port 19.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The controller 40 may include, for example, a microprocessor, a memory, and the like, and it may control the operations of various portions of the fuel cell system 100 (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) in addition to the water feed valve 21 by a single controller, or may control the operations of various portions of the fuel cell system 100 by co-operation of a plurality of controllers.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">In particular, in this modified example, the float sensor 30 can be removed easily even when water is stored in the main body 13 because the float sensor 30 is mounted to the lid 16.
