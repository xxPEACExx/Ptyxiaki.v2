Examples of a common reinforcing member include a treatment formed by arranging reinforcing cords composed of steel or organic fiber parallel to one another and by rubberizing them. A technique in which such treatments are arranged by laminating such that the directions of the reinforcing cords are crossed with each other is generally used. Conventionally, by adjusting the end count of the cord or by improving the twisted structure of the cord in the reinforcing member using such reinforcing cord, the tire durability is improved.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A variety of improvement for a carcass ply of a tire have conventionally been studied. The carcass ply is a member which constitutes the skeleton of the tire, and is generally formed by arranging reinforcing cords composed of organic fiber or steel parallel to each other and by rubberizing them. Such a carcass ply has conventionally been improved from the viewpoint of the material of the cord or the twisted structure thereof.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Further, a variety of improvements of a reinforcing member used for reinforcing a tread portion of the tire also have conventionally been studied. For the purpose of reinforcing the tread portion, generally, a so-called cross belt layer formed by arranging the above-mentioned treatment by laminating such that the directions of the reinforcing cords are crossed with each other, a belt reinforcing layer formed by arranging the above-mentioned treatment on a cross belt layer such that the direction of the reinforcing cord is substantially the tire circumferential direction. In a tire for heavy load vehicles such as truck or bus, a reinforcing member which is a so-called belt protecting layer is further arranged on a cross belt layer formed by arranging a plurality of the above-mentioned treatments.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For example, Patent Document 1 discloses, as an improvement technique related to a reinforcing member which can be applied to a belt, a steel woven fabric for<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> reinforcing rubber articles which is a twill formed by weaving a warp thread and a weft thread wherein the steel woven fabric for reinforcing rubber articles is applicable to a tire. Patent Document 2 discloses a radial tire for a motorcycle including a triaxial woven belt ply in a triaxial woven fabric shape formed by weaving a first to third belt cords which are arranged diagonally and form a predetermined angle with respect to one another. Further, as an improvement technique related to a carcass structure, for example, Patent Document 3 discloses a toric tire carcass for a road vehicle having a mesh structure comprising two ring-shape beads, and many reinforcing elements which connect them and extend between them substantially in the radial direction with respect to the beads.</p><heading id="h0003">RELATED ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT DOCUMENTS</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2008A"><text>2008-</text></patcit><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP297658A"><text>297658</text></patcit> (Claims and the like)</li><li>Patent Document 2: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JPH05162508B"><text>H05-162508 </text></patcit>(Claims and the like)</li><li>Patent Document 3: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No.<patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JPH05254037B"><text> H05-254037 </text></patcit>(Claims and the like)</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, in a conventionally known reinforcing member, on the contrary to the improvement of the durability, the weight of a tire increases, which has been problematic.

The illustrated tire comprises a pair of left-and-right bead portions 11, side wall portions 12 extending from the bead portions 11 to the outside of the tire radial direction, and a tread portion 13 bridging both side wall portions 12, and comprises a carcass 1 composed of one carcass ply toroidally extending between a pair of left-and-right bead portions 11 as a skeleton. On the outside in the tire radial direction of the crown portion of the carcass 1, two belt layers 2a, 2b, and a cap layer 3 and a layered layer 4 are sequentially arranged.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The tire of the present invention is characterized in that, as illustrated, a reinforcing member 5 composed of a knitted fabric using a reinforcing cord is arranged in the tire circumferential direction in a ring-shape. By constituting a reinforcing member by a knitted fabric using a reinforcing cord, the tire durability can be improved without increasing the weight of the tire, and a tire achieving a good balance between the lightweight of the tire and the improvement of the durability can be attained. Since<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the reinforcing member 5 composed of a knitted fabric according to the present invention has an excellent elasticity and is flexible and easy to be extended, it is also excellent in formability. Further, due to a larger porosity which is the ratio of portion where there exists no cord in the reinforcing member 5 composed of a knitted fabric compared to that of a reinforcing member using a conventional woven fabric, rubber easily penetrates into a gap of cords of the member 5 and the member has an excellent adhesiveness, as well as reinforcing cords are less likely to be in contact with each other, thereby reducing fretting. These features can also contribute to the improvement of the tire durability. The term "woven fabric" herein refers to those formed by crossing warp threads arranged in parallel and weft threads at right angle according to a definite rule; the term "knitted fabric" refers to those formed by making a thread in a loop shape and continuing such a loop. In other words, they differ in that while warp threads and weft threads are indispensable for a woven fabric, a knitted fabric can be formed by only a single thread. It is indisputable that a knitted fabric composed of two or more threads is within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the present invention, a reinforcing cord used for the reinforcing member 5 is not particularly restricted, and may be any cord such as a steel monofilament, a steel cord obtained by twisting the same, or an organic fiber cord. From the viewpoint of increasing the tire durability, it is preferable that a steel filament or steel cord having a high strength is used; from the viewpoint of taking account of the lightweight, it is preferable that an organic fiber cord is used. For the material of the organic fiber cord, a suitable material can be selected from commonly employed materials such as polyesters such as polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET), nylon (registered trademark), aramid (aromatic polyamide), rayon, and polyketone to be used. The reinforcing member 5 according to the present invention can be constituted by at least one reinforcing cord composed of the same material or can also be formed by a plurality of reinforcing cords composed of different materials. Further, the thickness or the cross-sectional shape of the reinforcing cord is also not particularly restricted. The thickness or the cross-sectional shape of the reinforcing cord as well as the type of the above-mentioned reinforcing cord can be appropriately selected as desired. From the viewpoint of securing the adhesion with rubber, it is preferable that the surface is plated according to a common procedure when a steel material is used for a reinforcing<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> cord; it is preferable that the surface is treated with an adhesive treatment according to a common procedure when an organic fiber cord is used for a reinforcing cord.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A method of knitting a knitted fabric constituting the reinforcing member 5 is also not particularly restricted. From the viewpoint of moldability or the like, the method can be appropriately selected as desired. Concrete example of the knitting method include jersey stich, smooth stich (1 × 1, 2 × 2), inlay stich ((1), (2)), rib stich (1 × 1, 2 × 2, 3 × 3, 4 × 4). From the viewpoint of making the thickness of the obtained knitted fabric thin, jersey stich and smooth stich are preferred. When it is desired that the obtained knitted fabric has an elongation, rib stich is preferred. Inlay stitch has a characteristic intermediate therebetween.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The reinforcing member 5 according to the present invention can be manufactured by knitting the above-mentioned reinforcing cord using a knitting machine. For such a knitting machine, for example, an automatic seamless knitting machine (WHOLEGARMENT Knitting Machine) manufactured by SHIMA SEIKI MFG., LTD. can be favorably employed. By this, the reinforcing member 5 can be automatically manufactured without generating cutting loss.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Since the reinforcing member 5 according to the present invention is composed of a knitted fabric, as mentioned above, it can also be formed by only one reinforcing cord. In this case, since there are only two ends of a cord in the member, the point of beginning of knitting and the point of end of knitting, the generation of protrusion of the end of a cord (a so-called wild wire) can be inhibited, and at the same time, the effect of inhibiting separation from the end of the cord can be obtained, which are preferred. When the reinforcing cord is used up during manufacturing the reinforcing member 5 in the present invention, the ends of reinforcing cords can be twisted or bound together to be connected with each other and to be used. In cases where a steel material is employed, the ends of steel cords may be welded to be connected with each other.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the reinforcing member 5 according to the present invention, it is preferable that the reinforcing cord is endless at the both ends thereof in the width direction, and it is also preferable that the reinforcing cord is endless in the circumferential direction. Here, the term "endless" in the present invention means that there is no cutting end or junction at both ends of the member in the width direction or in the circumferential direction. Even when there exist end portions of the reinforcing cord present at the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> beginning of knitting and the end of knitting of the knitted fabric at both ends of the ember in the width direction or in the circumferential direction, the member is referred to endless. More suitably, the reinforcing member 5 is endless in the circumferential direction, and reinforcing cord is endless at the both ends of the reinforcing member 5 in the width direction. By manufacturing integrally the reinforcing member 5 in a final shape of the member by a knitting machine for each member, such a reinforcing member 5 which is endless in the circumferential direction and both ends in the width direction is obtained.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Concretely, when, for example, a reinforcing member 5 having a toric plate shape or a cylinder shape as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2, Fig. 3</figref> is integrally manufactured not to have a cutting surface, the reinforcing member 5 is endless in the circumferential direction and at the both ends in the width direction. When a knitted fabric in a belt shape is manufactured and the ends are joined together to form a cylinder shape or a truncated cone shape as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref>, a reinforcing member 5 which is endless in the both ends in the width direction is obtained. Here, the ends, the beginning of knitting and the end of knitting of the knitted fabric can be joined by sewing them together by using a reinforcing cord composed of the same material as or a different material from that of the reinforcing cord constituting the knitted fabric. A commercially available nylon thread or a PET thread, a cotton thread or the like may be used.

The circular arc portions are, from the viewpoint of the uniformity, arranged at a regular interval in the tire circumferential direction. By this, the stress applied to the side wall portion 32 can be dispersed into the stress in the radial direction and the stress in the tire circumferential direction, and thus the stress in the radial direction can be reduced compared to a shape not having a circular arc portion in the tire circumferential direction, whereby it becomes easy to sufficiently secure a pressure resistance performance (inner pressure) for a pneumatic tire used for a vehicle even when a thermoplastic material is used for the side wall portion 32.
