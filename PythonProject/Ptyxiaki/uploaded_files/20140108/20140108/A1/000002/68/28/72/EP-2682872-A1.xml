For example, portable devices are able to produce high resolution video data streams from either stored data or data received through either a wired or wireless data communications circuit. Portable electronic devices are increasingly able to process or create large volumes of data that are able to be provided to external data systems, such as storage or display devices. Such large volumes of data are sometimes communicated through special data interfaces or peripheral bus connectors to the device, causing several connectors to be generally required to provide high speed data communications and other electrical data communications interfaces, such as power or legacy data interfaces. Each peripheral bus connector of an electronic device introduces costs, and product reliability concerns.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Further, current design trends require smaller and smaller form factors and an increasing number of peripheral bus standards to support. For example, peripheral bus connectors, such as, Universal Serial Bus® (USB) 2.0 and High-Definition Multimedia<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Interface® (HDMI), are common. However, other peripheral bus connectors, such as USB 3.0 and Peripheral Component Interconnect Express® (PCIe), are often demanded by consumers. A tradeoff is typically made. On one side of the tradeoff, the industrial designers try to limit the number and type of peripheral bus connectors in an electronic product because of space and costs and to provide a sleek appearance. On the other side of the tradeoff, consumers demand the integration of additional peripheral bus connectors into electronic devices.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The accompanying figures where like reference numerals refer to identical or functionally similar elements throughout the separate views, and which together with the detailed description below are incorporated in and form part of the specification, serve to further illustrate various embodiments and to explain various principles and advantages all in accordance with the present disclosure, in which:</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1 and FIG. 2</figref> are electronic devices with connectors for communication ports;</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> is an enlarged example of the connectors of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1 and FIG. 2</figref>;</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref> is a peripheral bus interposer;</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref> is a USB Micro B Connector showing the USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 portions;<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 6</figref> is a pin out specification for the peripheral bus interposer of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref> with the input set of Micro USB 2.0 and Micro HDMI (Type D);</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 7</figref> is a functional diagram of an electronic device with a multiplexer coupling to the peripheral bus interposer of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 4</figref> or a docking station of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>;</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram of the multiplexer of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 7</figref>;</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow diagram of enumerating signal connections through the multiplexer of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 8</figref> when the peripheral bus interposer is coupled or the electronic device is in a docking station; and</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 10</figref> is a functional diagram of electronic devices of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1 and FIG. 2</figref>.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">As required, detailed embodiments are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely examples and that the systems and methods described below can be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present subject matter in virtually any appropriately detailed structure and function. Further, the terms and phrases used herein are not intended to be limiting, but rather, to provide an understandable description of the concepts.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The terms "a" or "an", as used herein, are defined as one or more than one. The term plurality, as used herein, is defined as two or more than two. The term another, as used herein, is defined as at least a second or more. The terms "including" and "having," as used herein, are defined as comprising (i.e., open language). The term "coupled," as used herein, is defined as "connected," although not necessarily directly, and not necessarily mechanically. The term "connector" is used to denote a physical connector, such as a receptacle or plug, used with a peripheral bus.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In one example a communication connector or interposer is described that provides an increase in the number and types of external communication ports available on an electronic device without increasing the number and types of external physical connectors. At least four (4) peripheral bus interfaces HDMI, USB 2.0, USB 3.0 and PCIe are possible from only two (2) physical connectors HDMI and USB 2.0. The interposer/cable includes a USB 2.0 connector and an HDMI connector. An output from the interposer/cable provides a third connector with a pin out specification compatible with a USB 3.0 connector. In one example, a set of conductors in the HDMI connector are repurposed or reassigned to carry high speed signals to a set of conductors in the USB 3.0 connector that are compatible with the USB 3.0 interface.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In another example an electronic device with a selectable internal switch is described. The switch, in one example, reassigns a set of conductors in the HDMI bus to carry high speed signals to a set of conductors in the USB 3.0 connector that are compatible with the USB 3.0 interface. In another example the switch reassigns a set of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> conductors in the HDMI bus to carry high speed signals to a set of conductors in the PCIe connector that are compatible with the PCIe interface.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The switch has at least two inputs. The first input is coupled to a first set of conductors compatible with an HDMI interface. The second input is coupled to a second set of conductors compatible with an USB version 3.0 interface. And, an optional, third input is coupled to a third set of conductors compatible with a PCIe interface. The switch has an output with a fourth set of conductors.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A control input to the switch receives a control signal to selectively couple one of the first set of conductors, the second set of conductors, and the third set of conductors to the fourth set of conductors of the bus output.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In one example, high speed signals from HDMI, USB 3.0 and PCIe are coupled to the switch and routed to an external HDMI compatible connector. Other non-high speed signals are coupled to the external HDMI and USB 2.0 compatible connectors.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><u>Electronic Device with Micro HDMI and Micro USB Connector</u></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, an electronic device 100 includes a front side 106 having a display 102, and a back side 160. A user 150 is holding the electronic device 100 so that the display 102 is viewable. A keyboard, such as a mechanical keyboard 110 is provided (although a touch-sensitive keyboard may be suitable), operative in cooperation within one or more processors described further below.

More specifically, the upper portion 722 of the diagram is a functional diagram of the switch or multiplexer 750 inside the electronic device of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1 or FIG. 2</figref>. The lower portion is a functional diagram 702 of the various peripheral buses available - HDMI, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and PCIe. The details of multiplexer 750 are shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 8</figref>.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Referring now to the upper portion 722, the switching function of the multiplexer 750 is described. The multiplexer 750 performs switching, in one example, using a high bandwidth multiplexer, similar to existing multiplexer used to switch between several sets of HDMI inputs into a high definition TV. In one example the multiplexer 750 switches only four (4) signals away from HDMI to either USB-SS function or PCIe2 function. In one example, the PCIe2 function is implemented as 1 lane (=2RX and 2TX) to switch 4 signals. And in another example, the PCIe2 function is implemented as 2<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> lanes (4RX and 4TX) to switch 8 signals. However all eight (8) fast HDMI signals are run through the multiplexer 750 so the impact of the multiplexer 750 on the electrical characteristics of the HDMI signals is uniform. In this example, the remaining slower signals that are part of MicroHDMI pin 1, 15, 17, 18(= HPD, CEC, DDC CLK, DDC Data) do not go through the switch 750 and hence bypass it; in the USB or PCIe switch configurations these are not used.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Three sets of bus inputs 760, 770, 780 are shown.
