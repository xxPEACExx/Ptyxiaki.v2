Moreover, in some embodiments, the second component in the digital form can be the OS (or CS) component of the Galileo signal 108.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069"><figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 11</figref> shows a diagram of the Galileo signal 108 received from the Galileo satellite navigation system 110 plotted over the frequency. The PRS components 302 and 304 are the quadrature-phase components of the Galileo signal 108, where the OS component 306 and the CS component 308 are the inphase components of the Galileo signal 108.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">In the following, the concept of the present invention is summarized by way of example and for illustration purposes using the PRS component of the Galileo signal 108 as the first component in the digital form.</p><heading id="h0001"><u>The Galileo PRS</u></heading><p id="p0071" num="0071">Galileo Public Regulated Service (PRS) is a special navigation service intended for governmental and governmental authorized users, e.g. police, border control, emergency, armed forces and Search and Rescue (SAR), as well as operators of critical infrastructures like telecommunication- and energy-networks and critical transports. The first PRS signals are already there since launch of the first Galileo IOV satellites in autumn 2011. Galileo PRS will be one of the first ready-to-use Galileo Services.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">The PRS features encrypted signals on two frequency bands with restricted access for specific authorized users as mentioned above. The access to the PRS is controlled by the Member states through an encryption key system. The standard user will not be able to access any information of Galileo PRS. Moreover the Galileo PRS availability will be<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> continuously monitored and will provide an inherently higher jamming robustness thanks to its sophisticated modulation scheme.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">As depicted in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 11</figref>, the Galileo PRS signals are transmitted in a coherent way together with the Open Service (OS) signals and Commercial Service (CS) signals over the E1A and E6A frequency bands, using BOCc(15,2.5) and BOCc(10,5) modulation (BOC = binary offset carrier), respectively. BOCc uses a cosine phased subcarrier resulting in higher frequency components than a sine phased subcarrier used in BOCs modulations of e.g. Galileo E1BC OS. As a result, more energy is shifted to the edges of the band what improves the spectral separation with the coexisting OS and CS signals and the theoretical tracking performance.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074"><figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 11</figref> shows Galileo PRS (302 and 304), CS and OS signals (306 and 308) in the E1 and E6 band.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">Thanks to the strong encryption used, spoofing the Galileo signal is not possible. This enables the guarantee of an authenticated position, velocity and timing service.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Due to the high security requirements needed in a Galileo PRS receiver, PRS receivers will not become mass-market devices. They only will be available for a certain well selected group of governmental authorized users and have to be constantly supervised and maintained with key refills.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Our idea of using Galileo PRS for Location-based Services (LBS) presents a method how also ordinary people can profit from Galileo PRS without having to care about the strong security requirements of PRS or even jeopardizing the PRS security ring of trust. No PRS security related functions are needed on the user side. The idea requires only the server side - being a governmental authorized user - to deal with the real PRS signal structure and its security requirements. The additional use of PRS in the mass market leads to more acceptance of Galileo and its added value compared to GPS, since the PRS is a service GPS cannot provide.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Description of the idea</u></heading><p id="p0078" num="0078">It is well known that Galileo PRS adds a legal value on a PRS PVT solution. This means it is guaranteed by the strong encryption used, that the PVT cannot be spoofed. This property is a key opener to a lot of critical and demanding application mostly in the security related<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> areas. The disadvantage of the standard PRS service is that only certain user groups can profit from PRS and that handling of the security related receiver is very demanding.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">The general idea behind PRS is that only someone having the encryption key is capable of receiving and processing the PRS signals and their messages. Without knowledge of the keys, the pseudo-random-noise (PRN) sequences used are like a one-time-pad - "a type of encryption which has been proven to be impossible to crack if used correctly" [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_time_pad].</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">By collecting a certain amount of raw data of the PRS frequencies with an adequate bandwidth, the actual position and time where the snapshot was taken can be traced back. In contrast to snapshot positioning with OS signals, position estimation is not mandatory, since the PRS 'one-time-pad'-like sequences have no ambiguities. Moreover, by combining this raw data with e.g. a document, a unique position and time stamp is added which can provide a legal value. Only institutions authorized to use Galileo PRS and having keys covering the pretended timeframe of the document's date are capable to check the position and time of the signature.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Three different "use cases" with possible practical applications will be described, to demonstrate the manifoldness the idea: privacy protected localization, authenticated environmental monitoring, and verification of location and time of a measurement.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">A position and time authentication based on the military GPS signals was proposed in [S. Lo et al, "Signal Authentication: A Secure Civil GNSS for Today", Inside GNSS September / October 2009]. In contrast to the idea presented here, they need to record constantly the raw data including the military GPS signals nearby the position of interest, to be able to prove the position and time later on by a cross correlation between the snapshot signal and its reference received counterpart.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">By using a PRS snapshot, no reference data collection network or a trusted reference station is needed, since the PRS constellation for a cross-correlation check can be regenerated afterwards according to the pretend position and time. Moreover the fact that only special authorized agencies are capable of doing this cross correlation with our proposed method, the privacy of the user is guaranteed.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">Since all PRS security related tasks are concentrated on the governmental authorized PRS user side, the method is without any risk for the PRS network of security. But the ordinary user can still profit from PRS as shown in the "use cases" section later on.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><u>Technical description and implementation of the idea</u></heading><p id="p0085" num="0085">A snapshot of raw-data, wideband enough to include not only the Galileo OS but also the Galileo PRS, with a certain length (in the range of a few tens of milliseconds) is recorded. The method can be applied to both E1 and E6 frequency bands. But since the CS service on E6 is not defined yet, only the E1 band including the Galileo OS signals E1BC (306 and 308) and Galileo PRS E1A (302 and 304), see <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 11</figref>, is used in the following.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Using a raw-PRS snapshot receiver 100 comprising of an integrated or external antenna, an RF-down converter chip 182, an analog to digital converter (ADC) 184, and a data transmission controller (e.g. USB, Bluetooth or WiFi) 186, raw Galileo PRS / OS snapshot data are recorded on hard disk. In the software running on the client's computer a Galileo E1 OS acquisition is done to check that the snapshot of raw data was successful. If the OS signals can be acquired, also the PRS signals are present since OS and PRS signals are transmitted together. After a successful signal check the Galileo OS components (including also the other open service signals like the GPS L1 C/A) are removed by a high-pass filter 124, leaving just the PRS-noise (see <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 11</figref>). The reason is twofold: Firstly by removing the OS components, only governmental authorized PRS agencies can use the raw data for a position and time check, guaranteeing the users' privacy. Secondly the removal of the OS components by a high-pass filter 124 reduces the file size of the snapshot significantly. This raw-PRS snapshot can already be used for some privacy protected localization applications described in the "use case 1" later on. Its architecture is depicted in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig.5</figref>.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">For other authentication applications like the one described in "use case 2" and "use case 3", the raw-PRS snapshot is further used as a digital fingerprint on the measurement, file or document to be authenticated. This architecture is depicted in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>. The reported position and time of the measurement, file or document itself and the raw-PRS snapshot are combined in a cryptographic way, e.g. using hash functions and a public key infrastructure. The combined data package is transmitted instantaneously to a customer's storage 116 server 200.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">For validation and authentication purpose the customer can now transmit this data package to a governmental authorized PRS agency server 180. Using the reported position and time 193, the governmental authorized PRS agency can recreate the given PRS scenario and do a cross correlation to check, if the pretended time and position match. Since a valid PRS key is necessary to do this check, only governmental authorized PRS agencies are capable of doing it. Then the integrity of the file signed with the raw-data snapshot can be decided.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> If a false position and/or time were provided, the correlation with the recreated scenario will not be successful. By extending the search space and with some more computational effort is possible for the authorized PRS agency even to find out the actual position and time of the snapshot.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>Use Cases</u></heading><heading id="h0005"><u>Use Case 1) Privacy protected localization</u></heading><p id="p0089" num="0089">A PRS-raw-data snapshot is recorded using the techniques described above: the OS signals are used to check if the PRS-information is likely to be included, the OS signals are removed from the snapshot and the raw data stamp is uploaded to a server. The uploaded data does not need to be specially protected since no one but PRS authorized agencies are capable to get the position out of the snapshot using their PRS server facility. As long as the user trusts the PRS enabled authorities, the user's privacy is very well protected. This enables the handling of the otherwise very sensitive personal localization data in a much more trustworthy way.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090"><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> shows a privacy protected localization architecture.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">One practical application for the privacy protected localization is e.g. the localization or tracking of elderly people e.g. suffering from dementia. The balance between the patient's privacy and the level of protection is floating. The described method of privacy protected localization helps these persons to age with dignity and respect even though their position is constantly made available with PRS snapshots. Since only authorized personal can access in emergency situation their position information, the privacy is very well protected in contrast to the simple GPS tracker already available on the market, exposing the position to everyone, opening doors to abuse the patient's rights.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">The same method can also be applied for prisoners' electronic tags used in minimal security or open prison. The prisoner profits from the better protection of his privacy and the guards from the higher spoofing and anti-jamming capability of Galileo PRS.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">Another practical application where privacy protected localization could be used is the emergency call (ecall) system installed in more and more cars. To protect the position information of the driver, e.g. from abuse by insurance or marketing companies, PRS snapshots as described above will remain the users' privacy without risking the lifesaving localization information in emergency situations. Another problem faced by the<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> conventional ecall GPS localization systems is that the time to first fix of current GPS receivers is often too slow to provide an instant position, especially in obstructed areas. The ecall could be canceled before a position was transmitted. With transmitting only a snapshot of the received data, the emergency agency can use its high processing power and invest more time to gain a position from this raw data snapshot. Moreover the robust signal design of Galileo PRS enhances the position accuracy and reconstruction robustness.</p><heading id="h0006"><u>Use Case 2) Authenticated environmental monitoring</u></heading><p id="p0094" num="0094">In Germany larger cities have to do regular monitoring of environmental parameters like particulate matter, carbon dioxide emissions, and so forth. Therefore some stationary equipment was installed. Due to the high cost of this equipment and its maintenance, only a few sites per city are monitored. Until now no mobile equipment is used, as the position and time of the measurement would have to be securely verified.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">With the concept of the authentication applications described in the section above and the architecture depicted in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref> it is possible to do this verification, even when the measurement equipment has no standalone PRS receiver. By uploading the recorded environmental data cryptographically combined together with a PRS-snapshot on a server, the customer is able to verify the position and time of the measurements afterwards with the help of a governmental authorized PRS agency.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">Since there is typically more than one environmental measurement stations involved, it is assumed that there is a basic correlation between the recorded environmental data and also between the PRS snapshot locations. This additional correlation can be used as a ring-of-trust making any spoofing attempt (e.g. replay-attacks of wrong PRS-snapshots or environmental data) very unlikely and extremely challenging. Moreover the complete measurement setup could also be tamper proof, so that neither the environmental measurements nor the snapshots can be faked.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">Furthermore the presented application could also be used for a disposal of waste monitoring. When the waste is disposed a system connected to the tailboard of the disposal truck could automatically initiate the collection of a raw-PRS snapshot and transmit this to the responsible agency. Now this agency can check that a container of waste was disposed at a predefined location according to the rules.</p><heading id="h0007"><u>Use Case 3) Verification of location and time of a measurement</u></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --><p id="p0098" num="0098">Measurements like photos, audio files, videos, but also documents often have the need to be verified and/or authenticated where and when they were made. Typical examples are evidence used in a trial, e.g. photos taken by the police of a crime scene. This verification process can be realized with our presented idea by using the raw-PRS snapshot to sign such a measurement for adding certain legal information to the object. Afterwards a governmental authorized PRS agency can be instructed to verify the location and time of the measurement. The procedure is basically the same as for the authentication applications described in use case 2 and depicted in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">Already in 1996 an approach for an "authenticated camera" was presented [<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Kelsey, J.; Schneier, B.; Hall, C.; , "An authenticated camera," Computer Security Applications Conference, 1996., 12th Annual , vol., no., pp.24-30, 9-13 Dec 1996</text></nplcit>; doi: 10.1109/CSAC.1996.569666] using a certain interaction between the camera and its base station before and after its usage. The biggest gap identified in their proposed architecture is the strong need for authenticated location data which was not provided or even foreseen by any GNSS back then in 1996. Our authentication of measurement idea can exactly provide this required authenticated location data and time, thanks to the Galileo PRS service used in the proposed raw-PRS snapshot way.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">Another very interesting field of application for the verification of location and time of a measurement use case could be the adoption of the described technique for a toll collect system.

Using the open service signals, recorded raw-data snapshots are verified if OS and PRS signals were successfully<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> recorded. Then the OS components are removed from the file to protect the privacy of the user and to shrink the snapshot size. Now only authorities equipped with PRS keys and equipment are able to reconstruct time and position out of the modified snapshot signal. Moreover the snapshot can also be used to sign a measurement, file or object just before it is transmitted to a server. This method can even add a legal value to the snapshot. Thanks to the spoofing and jamming resistant PRS signals, the use of these special PRS-snapshots leads to a much higher service availability. A demonstrator platform for realizing a proof of concept was described. Finally three different use cases (privacy protected localization, authenticated environmental monitoring, and verification of location and time of a measurement) with practical applications of the presented idea were discussed to demonstrate both the manifoldness and the advantages of our idea compared to other existing or conventional solutions.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">Although some aspects have been described in the context of an apparatus, it is clear that these aspects also represent a description of the corresponding method, where a block or device corresponds to a method step or a feature of a method step.
