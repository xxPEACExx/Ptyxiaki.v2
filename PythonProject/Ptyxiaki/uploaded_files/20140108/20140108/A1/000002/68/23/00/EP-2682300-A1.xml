The control unit outputs a command for permitting the position change to the interlock device when the vehicle is started and a brake pedal of the vehicle is operated and connection between the charging cable and the vehicle is undetected.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Preferably, the vehicle can operate in a running mode or in a charging mode. An operation mode is switched to the charging mode when charging of the power storage device by the external power supply is requested. The operation mode is switched to the running mode when running of the vehicle is requested.

Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a vehicle 100 includes a power storage device 10, a converter 12, an inverter 14, a motor generator 16, and a driving wheel 18. Vehicle 100 further includes an inlet 20, a charger 22, a quick DC charging inlet 24, a control device 26, and a shift selecting unit 28.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Power storage device 10 is a rechargeable DC power supply and is configured,<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> for example, by a secondary battery such as a lithium ion battery, a nickel-metal hydride battery or a lead storage battery, an electric double layer capacitor and the like. Power storage device 10 is charged by an external AC power supply 30 by using charger 22. Power storage device 10 can also be charged by a quick DC charging station 36. Furthermore, power storage device 10 stores electric power generated by motor generator 16 during braking of vehicle 100 and the like. Power storage device 10 supplies the stored electric power to converter 12.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Converter 12 is arranged between power storage device 10 and inverter 14. Converter 12 boosts a DC voltage outputted to inverter 14 into a voltage of power storage device 10 or a higher voltage. Converter 12 is configured, for example, by a DC chopper circuit of a current reversible type.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Inverter 14 is arranged between converter 12 and motor generator 16. Inverter 14 converts DC power supplied from converter 12 into AC power for driving motor generator 16. Inverter 14 also converts AC power generated by motor generator 16 into DC power and outputs the DC power to converter 12.

<claim-text>a control unit (26, 26A, 26B) that outputs a command for permitting said position change to said interlock device when said vehicle is started and a brake pedal of said vehicle is operated and connection between said charging cable and said vehicle is undetected.</claim-text></claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0002" num="0002"><claim-text>The shift-lock apparatus for a vehicle according to claim 1, wherein<br/>
said vehicle can operate in a running mode or in a charging mode,<br/>
an operation mode is switched to said charging mode when charging of said power storage device by said power supply is requested, and said operation mode is switched to said running mode when running of said vehicle is requested, and<br/>
said control unit stops output of said command to said interlock device when said operation mode is said charging mode.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0003" num="0003"><claim-text>The shift-lock apparatus for a vehicle according to claim 2, wherein<br/>
when determining that a connection state between said charging cable and said vehicle is abnormal, said control unit outputs an alarm for notifying a user that said connection state is abnormal, and<br/>
said control unit outputs said command to said interlock device when said vehicle is started and said brake pedal is operated in a case where it is determined that said connection state is abnormal.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0004" num="0004"><claim-text>The shift-lock apparatus for a vehicle according to claim 3, wherein<br/>
said interlock device includes:
<claim-text>a lock mechanism (61) for blocking movement of a shift lever from said parking position; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>a lock release mechanism (62) for releasing, by receiving current supply, blockage of movement of said shift lever by said lock mechanism, and</claim-text>
