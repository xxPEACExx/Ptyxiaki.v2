id="h0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a marking device that performs marking on a tire which has been subjected to a performance test.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Marking is performed on a tire which has been subjected to a performance test using a tire testing machine. In this marking process, a heated marking pin presses a marking tape against the tire, so that a desired mark is printed on the tire by a thermal transfer method.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Patent Document 1 discloses a marking device which disposes two adjacent tapes in a substantially circumferential direction (tangential direction) of a tire and assigns a separate marking pin to each of the two tapes so as to print two marks on the tire. In the marking device, the marks may be printed in different colors by causing the two tapes to have different colors.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, it is difficult to use the marking device of Patent Document 1 for a case where a printable area on the surface of the tire is small because the two printing positions on the surface of the tire are different from each<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> other in the circumferential direction. In addition, in a case where the marking is performed at the same positions of the same types of tires while switching the tapes in use, the position of the tire needs to be adjusted such that the printing position is positioned directly below the tape in use. For this reason, there is a need to perform control that adjusts a rotation stop position of a spindle or a rotation angle of the marking pin with respect to the tire in every tape in use.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Meanwhile, Patent Document 2 discloses a marking device which disposes two tapes in series in the radial direction of the tire. According to the configuration, when the marking is performed at the same positions of the same types of tires while switching the tapes in use, there is no need to adjust the position of the tire in the circumferential direction.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, since a separate marking pin is assigned to each of two tapes, additional mechanisms (a driving mechanism, a temperature adjusting mechanism, and the like) are necessary for each marking pin, so that the marking device of Patent Document 2 has demerits in the complexity of the device and the production cost of the device. Furthermore, when the marking is performed on the same positions of the same types of tires while switching the tapes in use, there is a need to adjust the position of the tire in the radial direction such that the printing position is positioned directly below the tape in use. For this reason, there is a need to perform control which adjusts the tire stop position by a conveyor or the stop position of the marking device in the radial direction of the tire whenever switching<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the tapes.</p><heading id="h0003">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT DOCUMENT</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2000329658A"><text>JP 2000-329658 A</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2006095738A"><text>JP 2006-95738 A</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a simplified marking device that is capable of performing marking on the same positions of the same types of tires while switching tapes in use.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A marking device according to the present invention includes a marking head which performs printing on a tire, and an approaching device which causes the marking head to approach the surface of the tire. The marking head includes: at least one marking pin, a heater which heats the marking pin, a support base which supports a first marking tape and a second marking tape such that the first marking tape and the second marking tape are disposed in series in a direction orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the marking pin, a driving device capable of moving the support base to a first position at which the first marking tape faces the marking pin and to a second position at which the second marking tape faces the marking pin, and an extrusion device which extrudes the marking pin<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> toward the marking tape facing the marking pin so as to press the marking tape facing the marking pin against the tire in order to perform the printing on the tire.</p><heading id="h0006">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1] Fig. 1(a)</figref> is a front view illustrating a marking device according to an embodiment of the present invention and <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(b)</figref> is a side view illustrating the marking device.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2] Fig. 2</figref> is an enlarged view illustrating a main part A in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(b)</figref>.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3] Fig. 3(a)</figref> is a top view illustrating a marking head of the marking device, <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(b)</figref> is a front view illustrating the marking head, <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(c)</figref> is a side view illustrating the marking head, and <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(d)</figref> is a side view illustrating a main part B in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(b)</figref>.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0007">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described by referring to the drawings.</p><heading id="h0008">(Configuration of Marking Device)</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)</figref>, a marking device 100 according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a marking head 1 which performs printing on a tire 7, a conveyor 14 which conveys the tire 7, and an<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> air cylinder (an approaching device) 16 which causes the marking head 1 to approach the surface of the tire 7.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The tire 7, which has been subjected to various performance tests by a tire testing machine (not illustrated), is delivered onto the conveyor 14 by a center conveyor (not illustrated). The marking head 1 which is supported by a lift frame 32 is disposed above the conveyor 14 for conveying the tire 7 so as to face the conveyor 14 in the vertical direction. The configuration of the marking head 1 will be described below.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The air cylinder 16 is uprightly provided on a frame 31, and elevates the lift frame 32 so as to move the marking head 1 in the vertical direction. As illustrated in the side view of the marking device 100 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(b)</figref>, guide members 15 which guide the elevation of the lift frame 32 are respectively provided at the front and rear sides of the air cylinder 16 in the conveyance direction of the conveyor 14. These guide members 15 extend upward in relation to the frame 31.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The side wall of the tire 7 is disposed on the conveyor 14 to be faced upward. When printing a mark on the tire 7, the conveyor 14 conveys the tire 7 to reach under the marking head 1, and stops the tire 7 at a printing position. Then, the air cylinder 16 moves the marking head 1 down to an approaching position at which the marking head 1 is caused to approach the surface of the tire 7. Herein, the approaching position indicates a position at which the mark may be printed on the tire 7 when air cylinders (extrusion<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> devices) 5a, 5b, and 5c to be described below extrude marking pins 2a, 2b, and 2c toward marking tapes 6a and 6b.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The stopping of the tire 7 at the printing position is appropriately controlled based on a conveyance distance of the tire 7 by the conveyor 14. For example, in a case where a sensor (not illustrated) is provided at a position (a conveyor passage position) where the tire 7 conveyed by the conveyor 14 passes so as to detect the rim of the tire 7, the conveyance distance is obtained by calculating the movement distance of the conveyor 14 from the position where the tire 7 is detected by the sensor. A controller (not illustrated) determines the size of the tire 7 in the radial direction based on the type information of the tire 7 to be conveyed by the conveyor 14. For example, the type of the tire 7 is determined by the detection of the tire 7 using sensors (not illustrated) on the conveyor 14, and the determined data is sent to the controller. Then, the tire 7 is accurately positioned at the printing position based on the passage information, the size information of the tire in the radial direction, and the movement distance of the conveyor 14 obtained by the above-described sensor.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The air cylinder 16 is provided with a braking mechanism so that the air cylinder may be stopped in the middle of the stroke. The braking mechanism brakes the air cylinder 16 when the tire 7 comes into contact with a tire contact switch 17 to be described below (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> which is an enlarged view of a main part A in<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1(b)</figref>, the marking head 1 is attached to a rotation shaft 27 in a swingable manner, in which the rotation shaft is horizontally suspended between a pair of approximately L-shaped support frames 26 and 26 attached to the lift frame 32. In addition, an angle adjusting mechanism 23 which swings the marking head 1 and a linear sensor 20 which measures the angle of the marking head 1 are provided at the lower portion of the lift frame 32. The angle of the marking head 1 is adjusted by the angle adjusting mechanism 23 such that the mark is printed on the tire 7 at an appropriated angle.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The angle adjusting mechanism 23 includes a ball screw 18, a movable body 23a which horizontally moves along the conveyance direction of the conveyor 14 by a motor (not illustrated) rotating the ball screw 18 and a link member 23b which links the movable body 23a and the upper portion of the marking head 1 to each other.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In such a configuration, when the movable body 23a moves to the right side in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the upper portion of the marking head 1 moves to the right side by the link member 23b. Thus, the marking head 1 rotates in the clockwise direction about the rotation shaft 27, and the lower portion of the marking head 1 swings to the left upper side. In addition, when the movable body 23a moves to the left side in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the upper portion of the marking head 1 moves to the left side by the link member 23b. Thus, the marking head 1 rotates in the counter-clockwise direction about the rotation shaft 27, and the lower portion of the marking head 1 swings to the right upper side. The angle of the marking head 1 is measured by the linear<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> sensor 20. Therefore, the angle of the marking head 1 is adjusted to an angle suitable for printing.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In addition, the tire contact switch 17 is provided in the lower portion of the marking head 1 to sense the contact with the tire 7. The tire contact switch 17 is provided with a rod-shaped body 17a and a limit switch (not illustrated). When the tip end of the rod-shaped body 17a comes into contact with the tire 7, the limit switch which is positioned at the base portion thereof is operated. When the limit switch is operated, the air cylinder 16 is braked to stop the operation of the air cylinder 16. Therefore, an appropriate distance is formed between the tire 7 and the marking head 1.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In addition, a support 21 is attached to the lower portion of the marking head 1 in a rotatable manner. The support 21 is used to press the tire 7 from the rear side thereof when the marking pins 2a, 2b, and 2c (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>) press the tire 7, so that the tire 7 is prevented from being crushed. The marking head 1 is attached with an air cylinder 22 such that a rod thereof is inclined downward. The air cylinder 22 drives the support 21 to rotate.</p><heading id="h0009">(Configuration of Marking Head)</heading><p id="p0023" num="0023">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the marking head 1 includes three marking pins 2a, 2b, and 2c, a heater 3 which applies heat to the marking pins 2a, 2b, and 2c, a support base 8 which supports two marking tapes 6a and 6b, an air<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> cylinder (a driving device) 10 which moves the support base 8, and the air cylinders (the extrusion device) 5a, 5b, and 5c which extrude the marking pins 2a, 2b, and 2c toward the facing marking tapes 6a and 6b.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Herein, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(c)</figref> which is a side view illustrating the marking head 1, the marking head 1 includes a main plate 1a to which the air cylinder 22 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>) is attached. The main plate 1a is provided with a hole 1b through which the rotation shaft 27 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>) passes and a hole 1c to which the link member 23b (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>) is connected.
