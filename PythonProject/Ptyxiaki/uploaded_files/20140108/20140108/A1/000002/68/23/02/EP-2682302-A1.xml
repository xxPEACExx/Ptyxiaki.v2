The lock device includes a base member including a base groove, into which a striker can be inserted, and a latch including a latch groove that can be engaged with and disengaged from the striker. The base groove and the latch groove restrain the striker, and a pawl restricts the rotation of the latch so that the locked state of the striker is maintained. In the locked state, a protrusion formed on the latch is pressed by a cam member according to the urging force of a spring so that the latch is rotated (urged) in the locking direction to reduce the backlash of the latch in the locked state.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The latch and the pawl are supported on the base member via different rotation shafts and arranged in the same plane perpendicular to the rotation shafts. Also, the pawl and the cam member are coaxial and stacked in the axial direction.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">When the latch in the locked state receives a major load in the releasing direction (unlocking direction), the pawl sustains the load. The cam member reduces the backlash in the locked state by the urging force of the spring. As mentioned above, the functions of the pawl and the cam member are clearly distinguished. For example, even if the function of the cam member is impaired, the function of the pawl, i.e., the function of maintaining the locked state, is guaranteed. That is, when a major load is applied to the latch, the cam member is not configured to sustain the load.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Accordingly, in the configuration in which the pawl and the cam member are coaxially arranged, it is necessary to ensure the range of rotation of the pawl, i.e., the range of the engagement of the pawl with the latch basically in accordance with the range of rotation of the cam member, which is rotated together with the pawl. Therefore, the amount of rotation of the pawl at the time of unlocking is increased. Thereby, the amount of operation of a control lever associated with the unlocking operation is increased as well so that manipulability and appearance are impaired.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Accordingly, for example, in the vehicle seat lock device disclosed in Patent Document 2, the pawl and the cam member are supported on the base member via different rotation shafts, and the pawl and the cam member are linked by a linkage.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Thereby, it is assumed that the ranges of the rotations of the pawl and the cam member are independent from each other, or the timing of locking and unlocking (releasing) by the pawl and the cam member is arbitrarily adjusted.</p><heading id="h0003">Prior Art Document</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Document</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2005271903A"><text>2005-271903</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2009057039A"><text>2009-57039</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">Problems that the Invention is to Solve</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the lock device of Patent Document 2, however, it is necessary to provide a link separately to link the pawl and the cam member with each other, which inevitably increases the number of components. As the number of components is increased, the likelihood of assembling error is increased. Accordingly, the number of assembling steps is likely to be increased to ensure accuracy as the entire device.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide a vehicle lock device that limits the increase of the number of components to reduce the likelihood of assembling error.</p><heading id="h0007">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">To achieve the above described object, according to an aspect of the present invention, a vehicle lock device includes: a base member configured to be fixed to one of a fixing member and a moveable member; a latch having a latch groove; a pawl; a cam member; an engaging protrusion formed on one of the pawl and the cam member; and an engaging recess formed in the other one of the pawl and the cam member. The base member has a base groove into which a striker that is connected to the other one of the fixed member and the moveable member is inserted. The base groove includes a bottom surface. The latch groove is capable of being engaged with and disengaged from the striker. The latch is rotationally coupled to the base member, and the latch can rotate between a locked position, in which the latch restrains the striker while the striker is between the latch and the base groove, and an unlocked position, in which the latch releases striker. The pawl is rotationally coupled to the base member by a rotation shaft and is rotational between an allowable position and a holding position. In the allowable position, the pawl allows the latch to rotate between the locked position and the unlocked position, and at the holding position, the pawl prevents rotation of the latch from the locked position to the unlocked position, and the pawl rotates from the holding position to the allowable position according to an<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> unlocking operation. The cam member is rotationally coupled to the base member by a rotation shaft that is different from the rotation shaft of the pawl. The cam member allows the latch to rotate between the locked position and the unlocked position and is engaged with the latch at the locked position to rotate the latch such that the striker contacts the bottom surface of the base groove. The engaging recess is engaged with the engaging protrusion to hold the cam member when the pawl is located at the allowable position, and the engaging recess is disengaged from the engaging protrusion to release the cam member from the pawl when the pawl rotates between the allowable position and the holding position.</p><heading id="h0008">Effects of the Invention</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the present invention, a vehicle lock device that controls the increase of the number of components to reduce the likelihood of assembling error is provided.</p><heading id="h0009">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is an exploded perspective view illustrating one embodiment of the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a side view illustrating the present embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3(a)</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line 3A-3A of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3(b)</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line 3B-3B of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 4(a) to 4(c)</figref> are explanatory views illustrating operations at the time of locking;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 5(a) to 5(c)</figref> are explanatory views illustrating operations at the time of releasing the lock; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a rear seat.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">Figs. 1 to 6</figref>, a vehicle seat lock device according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described. The device is mounted on a rear seat of a vehicle such as an automobile.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>, a rear seat 10 includes a seat cushion 11 forming a seat portion of an occupant, and a seat back 12 as a moveable member arranged at the rear end of the seat cushion 11. The seat back 12 is supported at the lower end thereof in a tiltable manner in the front-back direction. A lock body 21 is formed on an<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> outer surface of the seat back 12 in the lateral direction. A substantially U-shaped striker 20 formed by a metal bar, for example, is fixed on an inner surface of a vehicle body 13 as a fixing member. In the state where the seat back 12 stands rearward (shown by solid lines), the striker 20 is located on the inner surface of the vehicle body 13 such that the striker 20 faces the lock body 21 in the lateral direction. An end of a bar control lever 22 as an operation member is exposed to the outside of the seat back 12. The other end of the control lever 22 is linked with the lock body 21.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the state where the seat back 12 stands rearward, the striker 20 and the lock body 21 are engaged with each other to maintain the orientation of the seat back 12. When the control lever 22 is pulled, the engagement between the striker 20 and the lock body 21 is cancelled so that the seat back 12 is tiltable forward with respect to the seat cushion 11 (shown by broken lines in which a long dash alternates with a pair of short dashes).</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Next, the lock body 21 will be further described. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the lock body 21 includes a base member 23 forming a casing. The base member 23 is configured to be fixed to the seat back 12. The base member 23 is provided with a base plate 24 formed of a metal plate, for example, and a substantially box-shaped base housing 25 formed of a plastic material, for example. The base housing 25 is stacked on the base plate 24 in the plate thickness direction. The base plate 24 and the base housing 25 are formed to be substantially C-shaped, and respectively have substantially U-shaped base grooves 24a and 25a. The grooves 24a and 25a open to face the striker 20 on a moving track when raising the seat back 12 backward. Accordingly, the striker 20 is inserted into the base grooves 24a and 25a by raising the seat back 12 backward. In contrast, the striker 20 is released from the base grooves 24a and 25a by folding the seat back 12 forward. Recessed end surfaces, which are the deepest portions of the base grooves 24a and 25a, correspond to bottom surfaces 241 a and 251 a, which contact the striker 20.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">A circular fixing hole 24b is formed in the base plate 24 at a position above and left of the base groove 24a in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>. Further, a substantially rectangular fixing hole 24c is formed in the base plate 24 at a position opposite to the fixing hole 24b across the base groove 24a. Moreover, a circular fixing hole 24d is formed in the base plate 24 at a position above and right of the fixing hole 24c. In contrast, a cylindrical boss 25b is formed in the opening side of the base housing 25 such that the boss 25b protrudes coaxially with the fixing hole 24b. Further, a cylindrical boss 25c<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> is formed in the opening side of the base housing 25 in the same manner such that the boss 25c protrudes coaxially with a central axis of the fixing hole 24c. Moreover, a cylindrical boss 25d is formed in the opening side of the base housing 25 in the same manner such that the boss 25d protrudes coaxially with the fixing hole 24d. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> as well, a substantially arcuate wall-shaped spring holding portion 25e is formed in the base housing 25. The spring holding portion 25e is coaxial with the boss 25b and located on the left of the boss 25b in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>. A substantially arcuate wall-shaped spring holding portion 25f is formed in the base housing 25.

<ol><li>(1) When the pawl 32 is at the allowable position, the latch 27 is allowed to rotate between the locked position and the unlocked position.

The rotation ranges of the pawl 32 and the cam member 36 are limited to minimum necessary for a function of each so that the degree of freedom of arranging each of the pawl 32 and the cam member 36 is improved. Further, the pawl engaging protrusion 33 and the cam groove 37 associated with engaging and disengaging of the pawl 32 and the cam member 36 are integrally formed so that the increase of the number of components is limited.

Thereby, for example, the striker 20 is prevented from being left in the imperfect restrained state.</li><li>(3) Even if the latch 27 is rotated when the pawl 32 is at the holding position so that the striker 20 contacts the bottom surfaces 241 a and 251 a of the base grooves 24a and 25a by the cam member 36, the rotation is allowed by the second pawl engaging surface 32e so that the swinging of the pawl from the holding position is limited. The holding of the rotation of the latch 27 at the locked position to the unlocked position by the pawl 32 is performed in the stable orientation irrespective of the amount of rotation of the latch 27.</li><li>(4) A part of the cam member 36 is layered on the latch 27 in the axial direction within the entire range in which the latch 27 can rotate. Accordingly, for example, when the latch 27 rotates, the likelihood of disabling the cam member 36 due to shifting of the cam member 36 with respect to the latch 27 in the axial direction is limited.</li><li>(5) In the locked state, for example, even if the latch 27 is pressed by the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> striker 20, the rotation of the latch 27 in the direction to the unlocked position is limited by the slanted holding surface 36b, which is pressed against the latch holding protrusion 30.
<br/>
Also, even if the pressed state between the holding surface 36b and the latch holding protrusion 30 is released by the buckling of the cam member 36 due to application of extreme external force, the step 32c of the pawl 32 at the holding position faces the first latch engaging surface 29a of the latch 27 so that the rotation of the latch 27 in the direction to the unlocked position is limited. In particular, the radial distance from the axis of the rotation shaft (pawl bushing 31) of the pawl 32 to the step 32c is set shorter than the radial distance from the axis of the rotation shaft (cam pin 35) of the cam member 36 to the holding surface 36b so that the strength of the pawl 32 with respect to the external force is sufficiently ensured.
</li><li>(6) By setting the engagement relationship between the pawl engaging protrusion 33 and the cam groove 37, the rotation timing of the pawl 32 from the allowable position to the holding position and the operation timing (delay time) of the cam member 36 are adjusted so that the operations of the pawl 32 and the cam member 36 are more stabled.</li></ol></p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The above described embodiments may be modified as follows.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The latch engaging surface 30a may be shaped as a plane that is substantially perpendicular to the radial direction about the boss 25d as a center at the locked position of the latch 27.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Regarding the latch 27 and the cam member 36, the arrangement relationship between the latch holding protrusion 30 and the holding surface 36b may be inversed. That is, a protrusion that protrudes in the plate thickness direction of the cam member 36 may be formed on the cam member 36, and a holding surface that holds the protrusion may be formed on the end surface of the latch 27, accordingly. The protrusion may be pressed against the holding surface so that the latch 27 may be rotated such that the striker 20 contacts the bottom surfaces 241 a and 251 a of the base grooves 24a and 25a. In this case, the radial distance from the axis of the rotation shaft (pawl bushing 31) of the pawl 32 to the step 32c is set shorter than the radial distance from the axis of the rotation shaft (latch bushing 26) of the latch 27 to the holding surface.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The cam groove 37 as an engaging recess may be a cam hole into which the pawl engaging protrusion 33 is inserted with allowance, or a cam hole with which the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> pawl engaging protrusion 33 engages.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Regarding the pawl 32 and the cam member 36, the arrangement relationship between the pawl engaging protrusion 33 (engaging protrusion) and the cam groove 37 (engaging recess) may be inversed. That is, a groove (engaging recess) may be formed in the pawl 32, and an engaging protrusion may be formed in the cam member 36.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Regarding the vehicle body 13 (fixing member) and the seat back 12 (moveable member), the arrangement relationship between the striker 20 and the lock body 21 (base member 23) may be inversed. That is, the lock body 21 (base member 23) may be fixed to the vehicle body 13 (fixing member), and the striker 20 may be attached to the seat back 12 (moveable member). That is, the lock body 21 (base member 23) may only be configured such that it is fixed to one of the fixing member or the moveable member. The striker 20 may be fixed to the other one of the fixing member and the moveable member.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The present invention may be applied to devices such as a device (slide device) that adjusts the position of the seat cushion 11 in the front-back direction, a device (lift device) that adjusts a position in the vertical direction, a length adjusting device for the seat cushion 11, and an ottoman device. Alternatively, the present invention may be applied to an appropriate device that adjusts the position of the moveable member to be mounted on the vehicle. Specifically, the present invention may be applied to devices such as a tilt adjusting device for a steering wheel, and a door lock device.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56983011" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A vehicle lock device comprising:
