In addition, bridging of the sewing threads 22 over the fastener tapes 20 and the tape members 21 also indicates that the sewing threads 22 sews the fastener tapes 20 and tape members 21 alternately in a zigzag shape while being laterally swung in the right and left direction. In addition, in the longitudinal direction, the length of the fastener tapes 20 and the length of the tape members 21 are equal to each other. According to this embodiment, for example, the width of the fastener tape 20 is 25 mm, and the width of the tape member 21 is 15 mm. In addition, while the tape members 21 according to this embodiment are made by weaving, the tape members 21 may also be made by knitting. It is preferred that the size of the tape member 21 be smaller than the size of the fastener tape 20 in the width direction since the width of the tape member 21 can be easily changed at the time of weaving the tape member 21.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In addition, each of the fastener tapes 20 has a tape main body portion 20c between the one side edge portion 20a and the another side edge portion 20b. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>, the another side edge portion 20b of the fastener tape 20 is formed thicker than the tape main body portion 20c, and the sewing thread 22 is disposed so as to bridge over the another side edge portion 20b. That is, while the sewing thread 22 is a sewing thread that runs in the zigzag shape, the folding portions of the sewing thread 22 at the side of the fastener tape 20 are present on the tape main body portion 20c. In addition, the opposite folding portions of the sewing thread 22<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> are present on the tape member 21. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref>, the another side edge portion 20b is fastened by the sewing thread 22 so as to have a convex shape, whereby the sewing threads 22 can be prevented from being misaligned in position.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">While the sewing threads 22 according to this embodiment are sewn by laterally swinging the sewing needle of a sewing machine in accordance with three-point zigzag sewing, the sewing threads 22 may be sewn in accordance with two-point zigzag sewing or four-point zigzag sewing. Here, the zigzag sewing is also referred to as staggered sewing. The zigzag sewing means that sewing in which the sewing thread 22 is swung in the width direction which is perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the fastener tapes 20 and the tape members 21 and the swinging is performed alternately to the right and to the left. In the three-point zigzag sewing as an example of the zigzag sewing, the sewing machine 13 has a needle thread and bobbin a thread at the front side and the back side of the fastener tape 20, the needle thread and the bobbin thread are entangled at two points of the right and left ends which are the folding portions of the zigzag shape, and the needle yarn and the bobbin yarn is entangled at one point between the two points. In the two-point zigzag sewing, the sewing is performed only with the two points of the right and left folding, which are included in the three-point zigzag sewing and the needle thread and the bobbin thread are not entangled between the two points.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The sewing threads 22 are set to be thicker than the weft of the fastener tapes 20 and the tape members 21 which are respectively made by weaving. The thickness of thread is designated by decitex. It can be said that the greater the decitex is, the thicker the thread is. If the fastener tapes 20 and the tape members 21 are made by knitting due to warp knitted fabric, the sewing threads 22 are set to be thicker than insertion weft that connect wale formed so as to extend in the longitudinal direction of the tape. In addition, the fastener tapes 20 and the tape members 21 may be sewn with the sewing threads 22 after being respectively dyed or may be dyed after being sewn with the sewing threads 22.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, a waterproof layer 23 is formed on both of the front and back surfaces of the fastener tapes 20 and the tape members 21 and on the side surfaces of outer edge portions 21 a of the tape members 21 (on the opposite side of the fastener tapes 20). The waterproof layers 23 formed on both of the front and back surfaces are continued by the waterproof layer 23 formed on the side surface of the outer edge portions 21 a. The waterproof layer 23 is the layer that is made of thermoplastic elastomer (e.g. polyester elastomer or polyurethane elastomer), natural rubber or synthetic rubber and does not allow fluid, for example liquid, such as water or oil, or air, to pass therethrough. The portions of the waterproof layer 23 at the front side of the fastener tapes 20 and the tape members 21 cover the entire width of the fastener tapes 20 and the tape members 21. In addition, in a state where the fastener element<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> rows 30 are engaged with each other, the waterproof layers 23 formed on the right and left fastener tapes 20 and the right and left tape members 21 abut to each other at the side of the one side edge portions 20a, thereby preventing water or the like from passing therethrough. In addition, the portions of the waterproof layers 23 at the back side of the fastener tapes 20 and the tape members 21 extend from the outer edge portions 21a of the tape members 21 toward the one side edge portions 20a of the fastener tapes 20, and extend beyond the connecting portions by the sewing threads 22 which connect the fastener tapes 20 to the tape members 21. It is preferred that the waterproof layer 23 extend to the side of the one side edge portions 20a of the fastener tapes 20 beyond the center of the fastener tapes 20 and tape members 21 in the width direction. Although the attached object 14 is present only at the front side in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, the attached object 14 may be present at the back side. Here, the waterproof layer 23 is laminated on both of the front and back surfaces of the fastener tapes 20 and the tape members 21. A laminating method may be implemented as lamination or extrusion.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, the fastener element rows 30 are coil-shaped fastener element rows, each of which is formed by winding a monofilament made of synthetic resin in a constant direction. Each of the fastener element rows 30 has a plurality of fastener elements 31 having engagement portions. The fastener element rows 30 are woven into the one side edge portions 20a of the fastener tapes 20 at the time of weaving the fastener tapes 20. Specifically, the fastener element rows 30 are formed at the back sides of the one side edge portions 20a by being woven with warp threads 20d of the one side edge portion 20a. This type of slide fastener may be referred to as a woven slide fastener. The fastener element row 30 may be a fastener element row that is made by converting a monofilament made of synthetic resin into a zigzag shape. In addition, coil-shaped fastener elements may be sewn into the fastener tape using a sewing machine. A synthetic resin material for the monofilament may be polyester, nylon or the like. The fastener elements 31 may be made by extruding synthetic resin, and the fastener elements 31 may be made of metal. The present invention can be suitably used in the woven slide fastener. This is because it becomes necessary to significantly modify the manufacturing apparatus to change the width of the fastener tape 20 since the fastener element row 30 is woven at the same time as the fastener tape 20 is being woven. This consequently leads to delayed delivery or cost up.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the slider 40 includes an upper blade 41 and a lower blade 42 which are spaced apart from each other in the upward and downward direction so as to be disposed in parallel to each other, a guide post (not shown) which connects the front end portion of the upper blade 41 with the front end portion of the lower blade 42, a pull-tab attachment portion 45 which is provided on the upper surface of the upper blade 41, and a pull-tab<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 46 which is attached to the pull-tab attachment portion 45.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Next, a method for manufacturing a slide fastener according to the present invention will be described.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The method of manufacturing the slide fastener 10 according to this embodiment includes a process of attaching (weaving) the fastener element rows 30 to the one side edge portions 20a of the pair of right and left fastener tapes 20, a process of disposing the tape members 21 in parallel along the another side edge portions 20b of the pair of right and left fastener tapes 20 in a side-by-side arrangement, a process of sewing the tape members 21 to the another side edge portions 20b of the pair of right and left fastener tapes 20 with sewing threads 22, and a process of forming the waterproof layer 23 on both of front and back surfaces of the fastener tapes 20 and the tape members 21. After the tape members 21 are sewn to the another side edge portions 20b of the fastener tapes 20, the waterproof layer 23 is formed on both of the front and back surfaces of the fastener tapes 20 and the tape members 21. A process of dying the fastener tapes 20 and the taper members 21 may be performed before or after the sewing process.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As described above, according to this embodiment, the slide fastener 10 includes the pair of right and left tape members 21 disposed in parallel along the another side edge portions 20b of the pair of right and left fastener tapes 20 and the tape members 21 are sewn to the another side edge portions 20b of the fastener tapes 20 with the sewing threads 22 which bridge over the fastener tapes 20 and the tape members 21. Consequently, it is easy to change the widths of the fastener tapes 20 depending on the intended use of the attached object. In addition, since the widths of the fastener tapes 20 can be varied without changing the setting of the apparatus for manufacturing the slide fastener 10, it is possible to rapidly cope with customer needs and suppress an increase in manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">When the waterproof layer is formed on at least one side of one sheet of a wide fastener tape as in the related art, the bonding force between the fastener tape and the waterproof layer likely becomes weak near the center portion in the width direction. Thus, after attachment to the attached object by ultrasonic welding or high frequency welding or using an adhesive, the waterproof layer 23 may be peeled off. However, if the tape member 21 is sewn to the another side edge portion 20b of the fastener tape 20 as in this embodiment, the waterproof layer 23 is formed to cover the sewing portions of the sewing threads 22. Thus, since the sewing thread 22 is tightly attached to the waterproof layer 23, the bonding force can become strong. In addition, since the another side edge portions 20b which are formed thicker than the tape main body portions 20c form a plurality of bluged portions 24 along the longitudinal direction of the fastener tapes 20 due to the sewing threads 22, it is possible to increase the contact area to the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> waterproof layer 23, thereby increasing the bonding force near the center portion in the width direction (see the enlarged view of <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref>).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In addition, according to a first modified embodiment of this embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006 f0007 f0008">FIG. 7 to FIG. 10</figref>, the sewing threads 22 sew the tape members 21 to the fastener tapes 20 in accordance with four-point zigzag sewing. The waterproof layer 23 may be formed only on the front side of the fastener tapes 20 and the tape members 21. Here, the four-point zigzag sewing has two points of the right and left folding and additional two points where needle thread and bobbin thread are entangled between the two points, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 10</figref>.
