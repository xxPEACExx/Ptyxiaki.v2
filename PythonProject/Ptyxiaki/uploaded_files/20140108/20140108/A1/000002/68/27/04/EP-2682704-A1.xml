One such heat exchanger is constituted by: plate-shaped fins that are arranged at a fixed interval and between which gas (air) passes through; and heat transfer tubes that are inserted at right angle through these plate-shaped fins (hereinafter, simply referred to as "fins") and through which a refrigerant flows. Known factors of influence on the heat transfer performance of this fin and tube heat exchanger include a heat transfer coefficient on the refrigerant side between the refrigerant and the heat transfer tubes, a contact heat transfer coefficient between the heat transfer tubes and the fins, and an air-side heat transfer coefficient between the air and the fins.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In order to increase the heat transfer coefficient on the refrigerant side between the refrigerant and the heat transfer tubes, performance inside the tubes is facilitated by increasing area of the heat transfer tubes and by cutting inner grooves, which allows a stirring effect of the refrigerant to be obtained, in the heat transfer tubes. Furthermore, in order to enhance the air-side heat transfer coefficient between the air and the fins, slit<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> groups, which are formed by performing cutting and raising of the fins, are provided between adjoining heat transfer tubes. These slit groups are provided so that the edges of the slits face the wind direction. By thinning the hydrodynamic boundary layer and the thermal boundary layer of the air flow at these edges, heat transfer is facilitated and heat exchange capacity is increased. Furthermore, the contact heat transfer coefficient between the heat transfer tubes and the fins are influenced by the contact condition between the heat transfer tubes and the fins.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 8</figref>, when a heat transfer tube 10 is expanded and is fixed to fins 1, there occurs, between the outer surface of the heat transfer tube 10 and the fins 1, gaps caused by waviness of the outer surface of the heat transfer tube 10, gaps caused by deformation of the intermediate portion of a fin collar 2, and a gap between a fin 1 and a fin 1. The drop in contact heat transfer coefficient owing to these gaps is considered to be about five percent of the heat exchanger (see Non Patent Literature 1, for example).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Accordingly, in order to reduce these gaps and increase the contact heat transfer coefficient, a technique has been proposed, for example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 9</figref>, in which three or more bends R are provided for the fin collar 2 of the fin 1 along which the heat transfer tube 10 is inserted. In this technique, further, the bends R are smoothly connected to each other, the fin collar 2 is generally shaped to convex to the heat transfer tube 5 side, with no straight portion existing (See Patent Literature 1).</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP3356151B"><text>3356151</text></patcit> (Claims, <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>)</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> Non Patent Literature 1: <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Nakata, "Economic efficiency and optimal setting in heat exchanger for air-conditioner", Kikai No Kenkyu, 1989; Vol. 41, No. 9: pp.1005-1011</text></nplcit>.</p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, the conventional technique described above has the following problem.

Accordingly, due to defective fabrication of the bend R, when the heat transfer tube 5 is disposed into the fin collar 2, increase in insertion force is caused and mass production cost is increased; thus, a problem occurs in that the intended heat transfer performance cannot be obtained.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention is made to overcome the above problem and an object thereof is to provide a heat exchanger that can increase its heat exchange capacity by a reduced thermal contact resistance between the heat transfer tubes and the fin collars of the fins, and, further, to provide a refrigerator and an air-conditioning apparatus provided with this heat exchanger.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention is a fin and tube heat exchanger including a plurality of heat transfer tubes arranged in parallel to each other and a plurality of plate-shaped fins provided orthogonally to the heat transfer tubes.
