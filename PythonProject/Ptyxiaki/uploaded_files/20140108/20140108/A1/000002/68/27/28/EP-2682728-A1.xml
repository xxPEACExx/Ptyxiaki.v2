Here, the gas-gas heater is configured such that the heat recovery unit and the reheating unit are connected to a cool and hot water circulating line to perform a heat exchange with a flue gas through a circulating pump using water as a medium.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In this control apparatus, the flue gas of the boiler is guided to the air heater to be cooled to a temperature of, for example, 130 to 150°C by exchanging heat with combustion air and then is guided to the heat recovery unit of the gas-gas heater to be further cooled. Thereafter, after the flue gas is guided to the electronic precipitator to remove fly ashes, a high-temperature flue gas in an outlet of the electronic precipitator is further cooled to a low temperature by exchanging heat with water and then is guided to the wet desulfurization equipment. In the wet desulfurization equipment, SO<sub>2</sub> contained in the flue gas is absorbed and removed by absorber which is prepared by dissolving, for example, limestone in the form of slurry and remaining fly ashes in the flue gas are also removed in the gas-solution contact process. Then, the flue gas in<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> which SO<sub>2</sub> and the fly ashes are removed is guided to the reheating unit of the gas-gas heater. Here, the temperature of the flue gas temperature-dropped by SO<sub>2</sub> absorber and the like in the treatment process of the wet desulfurization equipment is raised by the heat exchange with heat medium water passing through an interior of a pipe disposed in the reheating unit of the gas-gas heater. This causes functions of preventing white smoke generation due to a reduction of the amount of water condensation and improving diffusion efficiency due to temperature rise, when the flue gas is released from the chimney to an atmosphere.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For example, a fin tube heat exchanger has been proposed as a heat exchange method of large-scaled heat recovery unit and reheating unit of the gas-gas heater in coal-fired power plant (Patent Literature 1).</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent Literature 1:Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP11304138A"><text>11-304138</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">Summary</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">In a case of performing maintenance of heat transfer bundles in a heat exchanger, however, following problems occur.
<ol><li>1) When wear over time occurs due to blast effect of combustion fly ashes to a heat transfer tube of a fin tube heat exchanger in a thermal power plant, or when the composition of the same ashes has adhesive properties and corrosive properties, the ashes are fixed to a heat transfer surface to proceed corrosion of the heat transfer tube, a thickness of the tube is decreased with time.
<br/>
When an unplanned stop is caused by massive update or<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> maintenance of the bundles, damage of power sales occurs due to inhibition of a commercial operation. For this reason, leakage of heat medium water has been a very important issue.
</li><li>2) As a monitoring method of grasping a heat medium leakage, there is a method of detecting a water level of a heat medium tank. In this method, when the water level is dropped to a predetermined level, a control device gives an alarm. When the alarm is activated, it estimates (confirms whether or not a drawdown of the heat medium tank occurs by closing heat medium in/out valves one by one) whether the leakage occurs in a heat recovery side or in a reheating side and then performs an airtight leak check with respect to an individual bundle of the specified side to perform additionally a refinement repair on a leakage tube location of the leakage bundle with an airtight test.</li></ol></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Detection by the water level of the heat medium tank takes several hours per one bundle with stability time rule of flue gas/heat medium temperature, and the airtight test takes a few minutes per one location.
