In some cameras, in addition to a course manual adjustment, focus may be fine tuned remotely. This may be carried out by either moving parts of the lens system or the image sensor. Mechanical defects, originating in the manufacturing of the camera and/or its parts often result in the image planes of the image sensor and the lens system not being parallel with each other. The image sensor and the lens will consequently have a certain tilt angle in relation to each other which results in that areas of the resulting image are unfocused. Fine tuning the focus adjustment by moving the image sensor, rather than the parts of the lens, often have the additional problem that this tilt angle is increased or at least changed.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">In view of the above, an objective of the invention is to solve or at least reduce one or several of the drawbacks discussed above.

This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided by way of example so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> a illustrates an embodiment of the inventive focusing device. The focusing device 100 comprises three guiding members 110, a belt 120, and a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> lens arrangement 130 comprising a threaded portion 135. As is visible in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig.1a</figref>, the three guiding members 110 are arranged around the lens arrangement 130 and surround the lens arrangement 130. In this embodiment, the three guiding members 110 each comprise a threaded portion 115. The threaded portions 115 and 135 of the guiding members 110 and of the lens arrangement 110 engage with each other.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The belt 120 is arranged around the three guiding members 110 such that the three guiding members 110 are urged towards the lens arrangement 130. The focusing device 100 further comprises a motor 140. When the motor 140 is rotated, the belt 120 is rotated, thus rotating the three guiding members 110. When the three guiding members 110 rotate, the lens arrangement 130 rotates. In this way, the lens arrangement 130 is arranged to travel upwards, as is illustrated by the arrow in <figref idrefs="f0001">fig. 1b</figref> and/or downwards (not shown).</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In one embodiment, see <figref idrefs="f0002">fig. 2</figref>, the motor is comprised in one of the guiding members. The focusing device 200 comprises three guiding members 210 and a lens arrangement 130. One of the guiding members 210 comprises the motor 240. When the motor 240 rotates, the guiding member 210 comprising the motor 240 rotates. This causes the belt 220 to rotate which makes the rest of the guiding members 210 rotate which cause the lens arrangement 130 to rotate.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The lens arrangement can comprise a lens having a threaded portion, as is shown in, e.g., <figref idrefs="f0001">figs. 1ab</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>. Alternatively, the lens arrangement can comprise a lens not having a threaded portion. Then, the lens is arranged in a lens holder having a threaded portion.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is a top view of an inventive focusing device. The focusing device 300 comprises three guiding members 310, a lens arrangement 130, a motor 340, and a belt 320. One of the guiding members 310 comprises a toothed portion 315.

Here the belt 420 is wrapped around the motor 440.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref> illustrates a focusing device 500. Focusing device 500 comprises three guiding members 510, a lens arrangement 130, a motor 540, and a belt 520. Only one of the guiding members comprises a threaded portion 515. Here the belt 520 is not wrapped around the motor 540. Two of the guiding members comprise a retainer 517 and the motor comprises a retainer 547. In one embodiment, all three guiding members can comprise a retainer and in one embodiment, one guiding member can comprise a retainer. The retainers 517 and 547 are arranged for retaining the belt 520. The retainers in <figref idrefs="f0003">fig. 5</figref> are embodied as grooves. Alternatively, the retainers can be embodied as lips.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">figs. 1-5</figref> are plates 170-570 illustrated. The motors 140-540 and the guiding members110-510 are attached to the plates 170-570. Image sensors can also be attached to the plates, e.g., in an underside of the plates (not shown). The plate has an opening so that light can travel from the lens arrangement to the image sensor. In some embodiments, the lens arrangement is not prevented from travelling through the opening in the plate. The guiding members can be attached to the plates using joints. Alternatively, the guiding members can be of cylindrical shape and each enclosing a projection protruding from the plates. Then, the projections can each comprise a retainer for retaining the respective guiding member. The retainer can, e.g., be a spring or a barb.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">It is to be noted that all sorts of combinations of the different embodiments are within the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The guiding members can be more than three. Preferably, the size of the guiding members is large enough so that the belt is not in contact with the lens arrangement. The focusing device experiences a small amount of friction<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> since the threaded portions of the lens arrangement and at least one of the guiding members engage with each other.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The threaded portions of the guiding members and of the lens arrangement preferably have the same pitch. The pitch of the lens arrangement can, e.g., be 0,5 mm/revolution. The diameters of the guiding members and of the lens arrangement need not be the same.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In one embodiment, the focusing device comprises a mechanical stop for stopping the rotation of the lens arrangement at a predetermined limit. In this way, the risk of damaging the image sensor by forcing the lens arrangement into the image sensor is mitigated. Also, the risk of damaging the lens arrangement due to the lens arrangement falling out of the focusing device is avoided.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In one embodiment, the belt is elastic and thus is able to urge the guiding members towards the lens arrangement. Alternatively, in the embodiment where the motor is not arranged in a guiding member, the belt is arranged around the motor and the motor is subject to an outwardly force for urging the motor in an outwardly direction such that the belt is stretched. This force can, e.g., be realized using a spring and/or a barb.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The belt can comprise longitudinal reinforcement so that the belt is stretchable only up to a limit.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The belt can surround the guiding members at different heights of the guiding members, e.g., in a middle, near a bottom or near a top of the guiding members.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The belt can be made of rubber and/or plastic.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">At least one of the three guiding members, the lens arrangement, the plate, and the projections can be made of plastic and/or metal.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">It is easy to obtain a high resolution of the motor. E.g., the motor rotates two revolutions; the lens arrangement rotates one revolution. The relation between the revolutions of the motor and the lens arrangement can be adjusted by adjusting the diameters of the motor and the lens arrangement.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The focusing device can be in a calibration mode. In one embodiment, in calibration mode, is the belt not arranged around the guiding members.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Therefore, it is possible to rotate one or several of the guiding members comprising a threaded portion in relation to the other guiding members. This makes it possible to tilt the lens arrangement. When rotating a guiding member having a threaded portion in relation to the other guiding members, the lens arrangement is adjusted in a direction essentially parallel with an optical axis of the focusing device. The other guiding members are usually not affected by this rotation. The focusing device can, e.g., be in calibration mode when installing or when manufacturing the focusing device.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The focusing device can be in operation mode. In operation mode, the belt is arranged around the three guiding members such that the three guiding members are urged towards the lens arrangement. If the at least one of the guiding members comprising a threaded portion is rotated, the lens arrangement is rotated. In this way, the lens arrangement is moved in a direction essentially parallel with an optical axis of the focusing device and the focusing of the focusing device is adjusted.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Next, a method for installing the focusing device will be described. When manufacturing the focusing device, the guiding members are attached to the plate. Alternatively, the guiding members and the plate are molded in one piece. After that, the lens arrangement is arranged in between the guiding members such that it is surrounded by the guiding members. The lens arrangement is, e.g., screwed in between the guiding members. The focusing device can then be calibrated. This calibration can be performed by rotating one or several of the guiding members comprising a threaded portion an amount such that the lens arrangement is adjusted a distance corresponding to said amount, said distance being essentially parallel with an optical axis of the focusing device. This results in that the lens arrangement can be tilted. In this way, the lens arrangement can be calibrated to be essentially parallel with the image sensor. The belt is then arranged around the guiding members such that the guiding members are urged towards the lens arrangement. Then, the guiding members cannot rotate in relation to each other, thus keeping the calibration.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The guiding members can comprise an indicator for indicating a starting position for the respective threaded portion. During installation, the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> guiding members can be rotated so that all indicators are facing one and the same direction.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">As is apparent from the above, it is quite easy to exchange the lens arrangement for another lens arrangement. Furthermore, the calibration of the focusing device is kept during the exchange.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">It is to be noted that all embodiments and features described in this application are applicable on all aspects of the invention.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, such illustration and description are to be considered illustrative or exemplary and not restrictive; the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Other variations to the disclosed embodiments can be understood and effected by those skilled in the art in practicing the claimed invention, from a study of the drawings, the disclosure, and the appended claims.
