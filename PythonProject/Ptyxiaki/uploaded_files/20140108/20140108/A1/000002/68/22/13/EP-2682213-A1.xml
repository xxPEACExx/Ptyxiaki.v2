On the other hand, the indexable ball end mills B1 and B2 of the present invention had insert lives of 240 minutes and 800 minutes, respectively. Thus, the indexable ball end mills B1 and B2 of the present invention exhibited excellent wear resistance in high-speed cutting of the vertical wall, achieving a long life. The reason why the indexable ball end mill<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> of the present invention has a long insert life even in high-speed cutting appears to be that it has four cutting edges due to the above first and second features.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">Apart from the above test, a vertical wall was cut at a speed of 500 m/min with the indexable ball end mills B1, B2 of the present invention. As a result, the insert life increased to 1200 minutes in B1, and to 2500 minutes in B2. This indicates that the indexable ball end mill of the present invention exhibits not only high efficiency and a long life in high-speed cutting of 1000 m/min, but also high wear resistance and a long life in a conventionally used cutting speed of 500 m/min.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">In the horizontal wall-cutting test, the conventional 2-flute indexable ball end mill B3 had an insert life of 550 minutes, and the brazed conventional four-flute ball end mill had an insert life of 100 minutes.
