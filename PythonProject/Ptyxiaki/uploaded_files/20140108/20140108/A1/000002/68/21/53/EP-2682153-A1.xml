Coronary artery is a disease of the heart caused by a buildup of fatty deposits of waxy (cholesterol, calcium, etc.) on the inner walls of arteries.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The bundling of such deposits determines the formation of atherosclerotic plaques that obstruct the coronary arteries causing the so-called hardening of the arteries or atherosclerosis, with consequent narrowing of the lumen of the arteries themselves, thus reducing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. The narrowing and obstructing of the coronary arteries prevents the heart from receiving amounts of oxygen and nutrients sufficient for its regular operation, and in the most severe cases can lead to a progressive death of cardiac muscle, i.e. the myocardial infarct.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">When the narrowing and the obstruction of the coronary arteries (so-called stenosis) occurs, it can be treated by angioplasty, which is an intervention aimed at restoring the direct circulation to the heart. Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) is usually the fastest and most modem treatment to reopen a blocked artery and is, according to the guidelines of the <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published in November 2008</text></nplcit>, the technique of excellence in the event of heart attack infarction.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Angioplasty is an interventional procedure which is less invasive than other surgical procedures, since it does not involve opening the chest and using general anesthesia; the cardiologist that operates the procedure makes a small skin incision suitable for the insertion of a small catheter in an artery in the groin (femoral artery) or in the region of the wrist (radial artery). This procedure is performed in cathlab, using an angiograph, and the analysis of the coronaries is performed by means of a contrast medium. The occluded coronary artery is opened, in the PTCA (Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty), by inserting the catheter, which is made of a small hollow, long and flexible tube, which supports a balloon at one of its end, in the femoral or radial artery. The balloon catheter is inserted by Seldinger technique to reach the coronary artery where the narrowing due to the atherosclerotic plaques is located, and when it arrives at the stenosis it is expanded causing plaques compression and stretching the artery wall. When the plaque has been sufficiently compressed and the artery has been re-opened, the balloon is deflated and removed.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The angioplasty balloon is not "compliant" and is inflated to about 6 atmospheres.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The angioplasty has a higher safety and efficacy if followed by stenting, i.e. the application of a coronary stent, a small tube having a metal net structure, adapt to provide a support to the dilated artery, to favor the patency and to avoid a new shrinkage of the same artery.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The stent is positioned on a catheter having a balloon at one of its ends and advanced along the guidewire to the selected artery. When it reaches the targeted location, the inflation of the balloon allows stent expansion which causes a compression of atherosclerotic plaques against the artery wall. At the end of the procedure and performed the complete inflation of the stent, the catheters and the guidewire are removed, whereas the stent stays implanted within the artery in order to prevent re-obstruction.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Currently, the majority of coronary angioplasty procedures are executed along with the placement of coronary stents and often also with the procedures in "direct stenting", that is the expansion of the stent without a previous dilatation of the balloon.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Coronary angioplasty and the application of stents are certainly effective interventions and they are able to successfully treat coronary heart disease but they may present complications such as the restenosis, that is the appearance of scar tissue around the metal net structure of the stent during a process called neointimal hyperplasia, which may lead to the appearance of a new shrinkage and occlusion (typically in the order of 5-20% at 8 months after treatment). The risk of restenosis is linked to an unfavorable early re-shaping process after the intervention, it is a collateral effect of the standard healing process so that, usually, once the risk period has expired (6-8 months after treatment) a good result can be considered definitive. The rate of restenosis after coronary angioplasty is 20-30%, a percentage that decreases dramatically with the implant of coronary stents, which can effectively prevent further occlusions of the coronary arteries. In fact, the results regarding the reduction of restenosis using stents are very different if bare or non-coated stents, the so-called BMS (bare metal stents), are used or if medicated stent, the so-called DES (drug-eluting stent), are used.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The latter have allowed a drastic decrease in cases of restenosis and therefore the need to re-revascularization of 50-70% compared with BMS. In patients with BMS, in-stent restenosis occurs in percentages varying between 12% and 30%, and may require different interventions to re-open the stent. Such interventions may include a new balloon angioplasty, a mechanical demolition of the obstructing tissue, an implant of a new stent within the previous stent, intracoronary radiation (also called brachytherapy), etc..</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The DES were introduced in the 2000s and are stents coated with a thin polymer containing a substance with antiproliferative and/or immunosuppressive action that inhibits the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and the neointimal hyperplasia within the stent. These substances are<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> composed of anti-cancer or anti-rejection drugs which are released in a short time or gradually and slowly in a certain number of days, or which after a long initial release phase, can remain in the polymer for an undefined time. Among the currently used drug-eluting stents, particularly important are those coated with paclitaxel, the so-called PES (paclitaxel-eluting stent). Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent belonging to the group oftaxanes and is used for the treatment of various neoplasies.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Paclitaxel interferes with cell migration and proliferation, thus reducing intimal hyperplasia caused by vascular trauma. The drug alters the activity of inflammatory cells that are directly involved in neointimal formation induced by the stent and thanks to its lipophilic and its mode of action results in a lasting antiproliferative effect. Numerous studies have shown that the Paclitaxel shows an antiproliferative effect more effectively than other pharmacological inhibitors of neointimal hyperplasia since, acting directly on intracellular micro-tubules, it permanently favors the formation thereof, and interferes with the cell capacity to maintain its shape and movement direction, to transmit intracellular signals and to carry out intracellular transport.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Randomized studies have shown that DES cause a net decrease in restenosis, thus decreasing the need for new revascularization compared with BMS.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">However, the since the metallic structure of the medicated stents remains uncoated, subsequently to the drug release, a stent thrombosis car occur.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The stent thrombosis is a thrombotic implant obstruction, with partial or complete occlusion of the blood flow of the corresponding myocardic area, and thus of a total vessel occlusion and ischemia of the perfused tissue.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The substances that coat DES stents inhibit both "negative" and "positive" cell proliferation; such substances also inhibit stent re-endothelisation (formation on the stent net of a neoendothelium which restores the physiologic functions of the vessel wall) so that the stent metal structure is exposed to the blood flow inside the arteries; such presence is deemed as a foreign body which, without an endothelium, becomes highly thrombogenic.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Therefore the drugs in question prevent endothelial cell re-growth and that of tissues necessary to vessel regeneration; the vessel thus remains uncoated so that a risk occurs that, in such zones, thrombus may be formed.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In order to avoid the discussed complications, new strategies have been adopted with respect traditional balloon angioplasty, thereby creating the balloon catheter coated with drugs and the local drug release balloon catheter.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The use of medicated balloons, the so called DCB (drug-coated balloon) for the prevention of restenosis in coronary and peripheral arteries has received a lot of attention and the first positive results have been reported for paclitaxel-coated balloons.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">This method has been tested in several studies which demonstrated a significant reduction in incidence of restenosis compared with conventional balloon. The DCB coated with Paclitaxel are devices with balloons coated with a matrix of paclitaxel that allow a quick transfer of the drug to the tissue of the target lesion. When the balloon is inflated to dilate the narrowed vessel, paclitaxel is released directly into the diseased area by contact. The DCB have a structure to permit their use in coronary territories in which the use of DES is problematic or not particularly effective as small vessels and bifurcations.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The local drug release balloon catheters, the so called DEB (drug-eluting balloons), are a valid alternative to medicated stents or to traditional balloons, since they are very flexible catheters and allow to prevent vascular trauma due to compression and stenting.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The balloons are devices that are temporarily inflated in order to release the drug during a 30 to 60 seconds period inside the vessel walls, and are subsequently removed without any implant remaining; differently, the stents are permanent implants.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">DEB allow an homogeneous transfer of drug to the vessel wall, a release of high concentration of the same drug and the absence of a polymer decreases the probability of chronic inflammation.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the described devices with the method of infusion of liquid drugs. In fact the balloon catheters for local release of drug currently on the market have various desirable characteristics such as their flexibility that allows its use for the tortuous vessels, their form which facilitates its advancement through the stenosis and their correct positioning with respect to the area to be treated.
