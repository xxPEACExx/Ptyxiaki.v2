In order that these waist elastics 44 can put the core material assembly 32 in close contact with the wearer's skin in spite of defining the inelastic region 61, it is desired for these waist elastics 44 to have a sufficient contractile force. From this viewpoint, these waist elastics 44 in this region have an elongation ratio set to be higher than that of the waist elastics 44 in the aforementioned other regions. When the waist elastics 44 are arranged to have such a relatively high elongation ratio, if the number of the waist elastics 44 per unit length in the longitudinal direction Y is relatively small, the waist elastics 44 apt to locally dig into the wearer's skin. To avoid such a situation, by arranging the number of the waist elastics 44 per unit length in the longitudinal direction<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> Y to be relatively large, a plurality of the waist elastics 44 may allow the core material assembly 32 overall come in close contact with the wearer's skin. In this way, it is possible to prevent the individual waist elastics 44 from locally digging into the wearer's skin.

For example, this invention is not limited to the diapers 1, 100 but applicable also to the toilet-training pants, the incontinent briefs or the like.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">While the above-mentioned embodiments have been described on the basis of the pull-on diapers 1, 100, this invention is applicable also to so-called open-type diapers.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">In the above-mentioned embodiments, the inner sheet 41 and the outer sheet 42 may be joined to each other with hot melt adhesive distributed to any one of the inner and outer sheets 41, 42 or hot melt adhesive distributed to both the inner and outer sheets 41, 42. In this regard, however, it is not essential to use adhesives such as hot melt adhesives to join the inner and outer sheets 41, 42 to each other but it is also possible, for example, to interpose a heat-sealable sheet between the inner and outer sheets 41, 42 and join each other by heating this heat-sealable sheet. It should be appreciated that the inner and outer sheets 41, 42 may be joined to each other by ultrasonic sealing technique without heating.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">It is also not essential that the inner and outer sheets 41, 42 are respectively divided into those in the front waist member 6 and the rear waist member 7 but the inner and outer<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> sheets 41, 42 may be prepared in the form of the sheets continuous from the front waist region 11 to the rear waist region 12, respectively.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">Specific numeric values such as the elongation ratios of the waist elastics 44 are not limited to them as have been described above but may appropriately varied.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">It is also possible to form the front and rear graphic sheets 51, 52, 151 on the non-skin-facing side thereof with concavities which are concave from the non-skin-facing side toward the skin-facing side.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">In one example of the method for forming such concavities, a surface treating device including a discharging electrode and a dielectric covered roll having a plurality of convexities on a peripheral surface thereof is used so that the desired treatment may be achieved by repeating pulse corona discharge. Specifically, the discharge electrode and the dielectric covered roll are set up to face each other with a predetermined distance therebetween. Keeping the graphic sheet in close contact with the roll and keeping an air gap between the lower surface of the graphic sheet and the discharge electrode, the graphic sheet is guided through this air gap. A local dielectric breakdown occurs between the discharge electrode and the convexities on the roll to initiate<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> discharge from the discharge electrode toward the convexities on the roll. Thereupon, electric current discharged toward the convexities forms the graphic sheets 51, 52, 151 with convexities/debosses.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">By forming the graphic sheets 51, 52, 151 with the convexities/debosses, the bonding effect between the inner and outer sheets 41, 42 and the graphic sheets 51, 52, 151 with hot melt adhesive or other techniques may be enhanced.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">The component elements of the diapers 1, 100 are not limited to those described in this specification but the other various types of material widely used in the relevant technical field may be used without limitation unless otherwise stated.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">The terms "first" and "second" used in the description and claims of this invention are used merely to distinguish the similar elements, similar positions or the other similar means.</p><heading id="h0013">{Reference Signs List}</heading><p id="p0091" num="0091"><dl id="dl0001"><dt>1</dt><dd>diaper</dd><dt>31</dt><dd>liquid-absorbent structure</dd><dt>41</dt><dd>inner sheet</dd><dt>42</dt><dd>outer sheet</dd><dt>44</dt><dd>waist elastics<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --></dd><dt>44a</dt><dd>end portions</dd><dt>51</dt><dd>front graphic sheet (graphic sheet)</dd><dt>52</dt><dd>rear graphic sheet (graphic sheet)</dd><dt>54</dt><dd>front graphic (graphic)</dd><dt>55</dt><dd>rear graphic (graphic)</dd><dt>51a</dt><dd>opposite side edges</dd><dt>52a</dt><dd>opposite side edges</dd><dt>71</dt><dd>first hot melt adhesive (first adhesive)</dd><dt>72</dt><dd>second hot melt adhesive (second adhesive)</dd><dt>151</dt><dd>graphic sheet</dd><dt>154</dt><dd>central graphic</dd><dt>159</dt><dd>lateral graphics</dd><dt>X</dt><dd>transverse direction</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982670" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A disposable diaper having a skin-facing side and a non-skin-facing side, comprising:
