In the electric precipitation type air cleaning filter provided in the conventional air conditioning apparatus, a charged filter to be a counter electrode is placed substantially in parallel with an end surface on the upwind side of the heat exchanger. A conventional electric precipitator is also known in which a counter electrode (ground electrode) of an ionization unit is placed to be tilted in a ventilation direction in order to reduce a thickness of the electric precipitator (for example, see Patent Literature 2).</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003"><ul><li>Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP6074903A"><text>06-074903</text></patcit><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></li><li>Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP3605206B"><text>3605206</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">There are several types of blower fans used in an air conditioning apparatus, including, for example, a sirocco fan, a propeller fan, and a line flow fan, and an appropriate type of blower fan to be used is selected depending on use of the air conditioning apparatus or desired characteristics. For example, the sirocco fan is small and provides high wind pressure but a rather small air volume, and the propeller fan provides relatively low wind pressure but is suitable for obtaining a relatively large air volume.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">When the propeller fan is used as a blower fan in an air conditioning apparatus, relatively low wind pressure is obtained, and thus pressure loss has a greater influence when air passes through an electric precipitation type filter, an electric discharge/electric field-generating device, or a heat exchanger. Also, the propeller fan is an axial fan that generates wind (air flow) in a direction parallel to a rotating shaft of the fan, and a speed and a volume of an air flow are different between a portion closer to the shaft of the propeller fan and a portion of blades (rotary blades).</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, in the conventional air conditioning apparatus shown in Patent Literature 1, the counter electrode (charged filter) of the electric precipitation type air cleaning filter is placed substantially perpendicularly to a direction of an air flow, which<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> increases pressure loss, causes a reduction in air volume or noise, and increases power consumption. Also, this air conditioning apparatus does not at all consider the characteristic of the propeller fan as described above, and does not have an appropriate configuration considering heat exchange efficiency of a heat exchanger and pressure loss of the heat exchanger and an electric discharge/electric field-generating device when a propeller type axial fan is used as a blower fan. Further, also when a line flow fan is used as a blower fan, a great influence is exerted on an air flow from the blower fan.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Also, the conventional electric precipitator disclosed in Patent Literature 2 does not consider a case where the electric precipitator is provided in an air conditioning apparatus nor consider the characteristic of the propeller fan as described above. Thus, like the apparatus described in Patent Literature 1, the electric precipitator does not have an appropriate configuration considering heat exchange efficiency of a heat exchanger and pressure loss of the heat exchanger and an electric discharge/electric field-generating device when a propeller type axial fan is used as a blower fan. The same applies to a case where a line flow fan is used as a blower fan.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention is achieved to solve such problems, and has an object to provide an air conditioning apparatus that can reduce an influence exerted on an air flow of a blower fan, provide high heat exchange efficiency of a heat exchanger, reduce pressure loss of the heat exchanger and an electric discharge/electric field-generating device, and prevent a reduction in air volume or generation of noise.</p><heading id="h0007">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><p id="p0009" num="0009">An air conditioning apparatus according to the present invention comprises: a body having an air intake port and an air outlet port; a blower fan which is placed on a downwind side of the air intake port in the body, and forms an air flow that takes air from the air intake port into the body and discharges air from the air outlet port, wherein the apparatus further comprises: a heat exchanger which is provided on the downwind side of the air intake port in the body; and an electric discharge/electric field-generating device which is provided on a upwind side of the heat exchanger on an air trunk of the air flow in the body, and houses a discharge electrode and a counter electrode in a box-shaped frame having respective opening surfaces on the upwind side and the downwind side, wherein the heat exchanger is placed to have a section of an inverted V or W shape with a vertex being directed toward the blower fan, and the opening surface on the downwind side of the frame of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device faces an end surface on the upwind side of the heat exchanger, and is placed to be tilted in a direction of the air flow of the blower fan.</p><heading id="h0008">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The air conditioning apparatus according to the present invention can reduce an influence exerted on an air flow of a blower fan, particularly reduce pressure loss of an electric discharge/electric field-generating device, and prevent a reduction in air volume or generation of noise.</p><heading id="h0009">Brief Description of the Drawings</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011"><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a sectional view of an air conditioning apparatus relating to Embodiment 1 of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is an exploded perspective view of an electric discharge/electric field-generating device provided in the air conditioning apparatus relating to Embodiment 1 of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> is a sectional view of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device provided in the air conditioning apparatus relating to Embodiment 1 of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> is an enlarged sectional view of a portion where the electric discharge/electric field-generating device is provided in the air conditioning apparatus relating to Embodiment 1 of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref> shows power consumption of the air conditioning apparatus when an inflow angle of wind is changed with respect to a counter electrode of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device relating to Embodiment 1 of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref> is a sectional view of another air conditioning apparatus relating to Embodiment 1 of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref> is an enlarged sectional view of a portion where an electric discharge/electric field-generating device is provided in another air conditioning apparatus relating to Embodiment 1 of the present invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">Description of Embodiments</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> The present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

An angle formed between the end surface on the upwind side of the heat exchanger 5 and the direction (B in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>) of the air flow generated by the blower fan 4 is determined in view of pressure loss of the air flow, a surface area of a contact portion between the air flow and the heat exchanger 5, heat exchange efficiency, or the like.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The end surface on the upwind side of the heat exchanger 5 thus determined to be placed and the opening surface on the downwind side of the frame of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 are substantially in parallel, or tilted so that the distance therebetween gradually increases toward the handle 9a, and the electrode surface 8a of the counter electrode 8 is provided to be tilted by the first angle θ1 in the direction of the air flow from the blower fan 4 with respect to the direction perpendicular<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> to the opening surface. Thus, the electrode surface 8a of the counter electrode 8 is placed to be tilted by a predetermined third angle θ3 with respect to the direction (B in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>) of the air flow from the blower fan 4.

Specifically, with the angle formed between the end surface on the upwind side of the heat exchanger 5 and the direction of the air flow from the blower fan 4, the first angle θ1 as the angle formed between the electrode surface 8a and the opening surface of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6, and the angle (forth angle θ4) formed between the opening surface on the downwind side of the frame of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 and the end surface on the upwind side of the heat exchanger 5 are changed to adjust the third angle θ3 as a tilt angle of the electrode surface 8a of the counter electrode 8 with respect to the direction of the air flow from the blower fan 4.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">Figures 1 to 4</figref>, an operation of the air conditioning apparatus body 1 configured as described above will be described mainly noting the air flow in the air conditioning apparatus body 1. In the drawings, the arrows indicate an air flow in the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> air trunk formed in the air conditioning apparatus body 1. When the blower fan 4 is rotated, air is taken from the air intake port 2 into the air conditioning apparatus body 1, and an air flow generated by the blower fan 4 is fed to the heat exchanger 5. At this time, the blower fan 4 is a propeller type axial fan, and in a portion close to the blower fan 4, a flow speed on a side closer to the shaft is relatively low, and a flow speed on an outer side with the rotatory blades is relatively high.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The heat exchanger 5 is placed to have the section of the substantially inverted V shape with the vertex being directed toward the blower fan 4, and the vertex of the substantially inverted V shape faces the rotating shaft of the blower fan 4. The blower fan 4 and the heat exchanger 5 are in such a positional relationship, and thus a portion with a relatively high flow speed of the air flow generated by the blower fan 4 can be efficiently fed to the heat exchanger 5. The air flow having passed through the heat exchanger 5 is merged inside the substantially inverted V shape, and discharged from the air outlet port 3 to the outside of the air conditioning apparatus body 1.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">On the air trunk on the upwind side of the heat exchanger 5 and the downwind side of the blower fan 4, the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 is provided. The blower fan 4 sucks bacteria, mold, virus, or the like suspended in air into the air conditioning apparatus body 1. When passing through the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6, the sucked suspended bacteria, mold, virus, or the like are destroyed and killed by application of a discharge and an electric field between the discharge electrode 7 and the counter electrode 8. From the air discharged<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> from the air outlet port 3, living suspended bacteria, mold, viruses, or the like are removed.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">When the propeller type axial fan is placed as the blower fan 4 on an upstream side of the heat exchanger 5, sucked air is forced into the heat exchanger 5. Thus, as compared to a case where the propeller type axial fan is placed on a downstream side of the heat exchanger 5 to suck air into the heat exchanger 5, wind speed distribution on the upstream side of the heat exchanger 5 is non-uniform to easily cause differences in wind speed, which increases pressure loss when the air flow passes through the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6. In particular, the wind speed distribution is larger close to the outer side of the blower fan 4 than on a central portion close to the shaft.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">There is a large space between the front surface side of the heat exchanger 5 of the substantially inverted V shape and a front panel of the air conditioning apparatus body 1, which is suitable for providing the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6. However, this space is located downstream of the outer side of the blower fan 4 (the portion with the blades of the blower fan), thus wind speed distribution is non-uniform to easily cause differences in wind speed, and cause variations in wind speed when air passes through the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6, thereby preventing a stable air cleaning capacity from being exerted.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The opening surface on the downwind side of the frame of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 is placed to face the end surface on the<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> upwind side of the heat exchanger 5, and the electrode surface 8a of the counter electrode 8 of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 is tilted by the predetermined first angle θ1 with respect to the direction perpendicular to the opening surface of the frame of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6, and is thus placed to be tilted by the predetermined third angle θ3 with respect to the direction (B in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>) of the air flow from the blower fan 4. The opening surface on the upwind side of the frame of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 is also placed substantially in parallel with the end surface on the upwind side of the heat exchanger 5, and tilted with respect to the direction of the air flow from the blower fan 4.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Thus, the air flow from the blower fan 4 can flow into the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 without resistance, and air can flow with reduced generation of pressure loss. This can prevent generation of noise and an increase in power consumption.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref> shows an amount of increase in power consumption of the air conditioning apparatus body 1 when the third angle θ3 as the tilt angle of the electrode surface 8a of the counter electrode 8 with respect to the direction of the air flow from the blower fan 4 is changed. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>, when the third angle θ3 is 90°, the amount of increase in power consumption is about 7 W. When the third angle θ3 is changed to 60°, the amount of increase in power consumption is reduced to about 2.5 W. Further, when the third angle θ3 is changed to 45°, the amount of increase in power consumption is reduced to about 1 W. When the third angle θ3 is 20°, the amount of increase in power consumption is less than about 0.5 W, which has little influence on<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> aerodynamic performance and does not increase a fan input. A smaller third angle θ3 as the tilt angle of the electrode surface 8a of the counter electrode 8 with respect to the direction of the air flow from the blower fan 4 is preferable, and 0° is the most preferable.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">As such, the third angle θ3 is set to 45° or less, thereby reducing the amount of increase in power consumption of the air conditioning apparatus body 1 to about 1 W or less. Thus, the first angle θ1 is preferably set so that the third angle θ3 is 45° or less.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">However, if the first angle θ1 is tilted to 45° or more, a shortest distance between the discharge electrode 7 and the counter electrode 8 is reduced to cause a local discharge. Also, a distance between the discharge electrode 7 and the counter electrode 8 is non-uniform to prevent a stable discharge. Thus, the first angle θ1 is preferably set to 45° or less.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">As such, the first angle θ1 is tilted and the tilt angle (third angle θ3) of the counter electrode 8 is closer to parallel to the direction of the air flow, thereby reducing pressure loss. However, even if the first angle θ1 is tilted, large pressure loss sometimes still occurs.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In such a case, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref>, the opening surface on the downwind side of the frame of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 is placed to be tilted toward the air intake port 2 by a predetermined fourth angle θ4 with respect to the end surface on the upwind side of the heat exchanger 5. <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref> shows a state where the opening surface on the downwind side of the frame of the electric discharge/electric field-generating<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> device 6 is placed to be tilted toward the air intake port 2 by the predetermined fourth angle θ4 with respect to the end surface on the upwind side of the heat exchanger 5 in a distance relationship between the opening surface and the end surface.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref>, for a shortest distance L between the opening surface on the downwind side of the frame of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 and the end surface on the upwind side of the heat exchanger 5, a distance L1 in a position closer to the shaft of the blower fan 4 and farther from the outer side of the blower fan 4 is compared with a distance L2 in a position closer to the outer side of the blower fan 4 and farther from the shaft of the blower fan 4, and then L1 is equal to or smaller than L2.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">This can reduce the angle θ3 close to 0° formed between the counter electrode 8 of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 and the air flow, reduce pressure loss, and prevent an increase in power consumption of the blower fan 4. This can also eliminate non-uniform wind speed distribution particularly on the outer side of the blower fan 4, which is a problem peculiar to the propeller fan, and increase heat exchange efficiency closer to the upstream side of the heat exchanger 5.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Generally, if air is sucked from a top surface side of the air conditioning apparatus body 1, the air substantially vertically proceeds. An upper front surface side unit of the heat exchanger 5 is tilted by about 30° to 45° with respect to the vertical direction, and thus when the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 is provided in parallel with the heat exchanger 5, and the counter electrode 8 is placed perpendicularly to the<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> opening surface of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6, there is a shift in angle of about 30° to 45° between the direction B of the air flow and the counter electrode 8, thereby causing pressure loss of the air flow passing through the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">It is preferable to minimize the angle (third angle θ3) formed between the counter electrode 8 and the air flow B in terms of a reduction in pressure loss. Thus, as described above, the counter electrode 8 is placed to be tilted from the direction perpendicular to the opening of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6, and further, the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 is placed to be tilted toward the air intake port 2 with respect to the heat exchanger 5. Then, a synergistic effect of the tilted placement can minimize the angle θ3 formed between the counter electrode 8 and the air flow B while maintaining a stable discharge state between the discharge electrode 7 and the counter electrode 8 in the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Specifically, with increasing angle of tilt of the counter electrode 8 from the direction perpendicular to the opening of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6, stability of a discharge between the discharge electrode 7 and the counter electrode 8 is reduced. Also, if the angle of tilt of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 toward the air intake port 2 (with the front surface side of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 being lifted) with respect to the heat exchanger 5 is increased, a tip of the front surface side of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 comes into contact with a structure of the air conditioning<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> apparatus body 1, thereby preventing the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 from being housed on the upwind side of the heat exchanger 5.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Thus, the first angle θ1 is set to 45° or less (preferably 15° to 30° for making the distance between the electrodes as uniform as possible and stabilizing the discharge), and the tilt angle θ4 toward the air intake port 2 of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 is set to about 5° to 20°. Thus, a synergistic effect of the tilted placement allows the angle formed between the counter electrode 8 and the air flow B to be closest to 0° with a stable air cleaning capacity.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The second angle θ2 formed between the front side surface 15 and the rear side surface 16 of the frame of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 and the direction perpendicular to the opening surface of the frame is equal to the first angle θ1. Specifically, the front side surface 15 and the rear side surface 16 as two side surfaces of the frame are placed substantially in parallel with the electrode surface 8a, the front side surface 15 and the rear side surface 16 of the frame form walls to prevent generation of pressure loss, thereby reducing pressure loss of the air flow in and around the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6. Also, the air flow can smoothly flow into the heat exchanger 5.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Further, the opening of the frame of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 has a grid shape, thereby producing a straightening effect and reducing non-uniform wind speed distribution or differences in wind speed that tends to occur in a<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> portion close to the outer side of the propeller type axial fan or around a peripheral portion of the air conditioning apparatus body 1.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 is provided downstream of the propeller type axial fan and upstream of the heat exchanger 5, and thus the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 itself functions as a straightening vane to make wind speed distribution uniform, and can eliminate a swirling flow component generated by the propeller type axial fan and increase by about 1% to 3% heat exchange efficiency on the upstream side of the heat exchanger 5.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Summarizing the above, the electrode surface 8a of the counter electrode 8 of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 is placed to be tilted by the predetermined angle θ1 1 in the direction of the air flow of the blower fan 4 with respect to the direction perpendicular to the opening surface on the downwind side of the frame of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6, and the opening surface on the downwind side of the frame of the electric discharge/electric field-generating device 6 is placed to be tilted by the predetermined angle θ4 toward the air intake port with respect to the end surface on the upwind side of the heat exchanger 5. Thus, the angle θ3 formed between the direction B of the air flow from the blower fan 4 and the counter electrode 8 is further close to 0° and significantly reduced.
