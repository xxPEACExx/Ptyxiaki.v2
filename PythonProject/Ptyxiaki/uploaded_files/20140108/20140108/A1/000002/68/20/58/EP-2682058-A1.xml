Such an image that allows stereoscopic viewing (which will hereinafter be referred to as "stereoscopic image" or "stereo image") is generated based on a plurality of images that are obtained by imaging the same subject from different directions and therefore have a parallax therebetween.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Generation of a stereoscopic image in this manner is used not only in the fields of digital cameras and televisions but also in the field of radiographic imaging. Namely, radiation is applied to the subject from different directions, and each radiation transmitted through the subj ect is detected with a radiographic image detector to obtain a plurality of radiographic images having a parallax therebetween, and a stereoscopic image is generated based on these radiographic images (see, for example, Patent Document 1). By generating a stereoscopic image in this manner, a radiographic image that provides feel of depth can be observed, which is more suitable for diagnosis.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">On the other hand, a tomosynthesis imaging apparatus, wherein a radiation source is moved to apply radiation to the subject from different imaging directions, similarly to a radiographic imaging apparatus for taking the above-described stereoscopic image, has been proposed (see, for example, Patent Document 2). This tomosynthesis imaging apparatus performs imaging operations with applying radiation to the subject from different imaging directions,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> as described above, and adds up a plurality of radiographic images obtained by the imaging operations to provide an image where a desired slice plane is emphasized.</p><heading id="h0003">Prior Art Documents</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2010279516A"><text>2010-279516</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2010131170A"><text>2010-131170</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Radiographic imaging apparatuses, in general, are configured such that a series of operations of an imaging sequence including application of radiation are performed while the imaging switch of the apparatus is pressed by the operator, and the imaging sequence is stopped when the operator has released the imaging switch, in view of safety.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, for example, in a case where the operator has accidentally released the imaging switch for a brief instant of time or the imaging switch is turned into OFF state for a brief instant of time due to chattering or electrical noise, it may be inconvenient to stop the entire imaging sequence.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Specifically, in a case where mammographic imaging, for example, is performed using the above-described apparatus for taking a stereoscopic image or the tomosynthesis imaging apparatus, a plurality of imaging operations are performed in a state where the breast is compressed with a compression paddle. In this case, if the compression by the compression paddle is released when the imaging sequence is stopped, as described above, then, when the imaging switch is pressed again to restart the imaging sequence and the breast is compressed again, it is almost impossible to provide the shape of the breast that is the same as the shape before the imaging sequence is stopped. Therefore, different shapes of the breast are imaged by the plurality of imaging operations and it is impossible to obtain an appropriate stereoscopic image or tomographic image.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further, if a shut-down operation of the X-ray tube is performed when the imaging switch is turned into OFF state and the imaging sequence is stopped during the plurality of imaging operations, it takes a long time for completing a start-up operation of the X-ray tube when the imaging switch is pressed again and the imaging sequence is restarted, resulting in a longer imaging time.
