The whole of the tip and cantilever is commonly referred to as a probe. By using a laser light which is focused on the back of the cantilever during scanning and by detecting the reflected light by a photodiode, it is possible to image the 3D topography profile of the sample. Additionally also electrical properties of the sample may be measured by applying a voltage between the sample and a conductive tip.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Many different electrical AFM measurement techniques are available, such as scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM). In SSRM a bias voltage is applied between a conductive tip and the sample and a resistance profile of the sample is measured (in combination with a topography profile). The resistance profile is then linked to the carrier distribution (doping profile) of the sample.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is an advantage of these techniques that sub nanometer spatial resolution may be achieved with a low signal to noise ratio.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For SSRM in air a high force is necessary between the tip and the sample to induce the so-called beta-thin phase which is crucial for obtaining a good electrical contact with the sample. A disadvantage related to this high force is damaging of the sample surface while scanning.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B, Vol. 28, No. 2, Mar/Apr 2010, P. Eyben</text></nplcit> et al. present the analysis and model of using high vacuum (HV) SSRM instead of SSRM in (atmospheric) air. It is shown that a better performance is achieved for HV SSRM, more specifically a better signal to noise ratio, an improved spatial resolution and a reduced<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> measurement force (compared to the signal to noise ratio, the spatial resolution and measurement force achieved with SSRM in air).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">A reason for this improvement is linked to the quality of the sample surface and tip surface. The presence of different kinds of contaminants such as for example organic contaminants, the presence of hydrogen, the presence of hydrocarbons and/or the presence of a (native) oxide at the sample or tip surface may be detrimental for the performance of the AFM measurement when performed in (ambient) air. By measuring under high vacuum the presence and thus the influence of these contaminants is drastically reduced.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Such an AFM measurement system under high vacuum is however expensive as the complete measurement tool must be located in and adapted to an environment which can be put under vacuum. The use of this environment also significantly reduces the usability of the equipment since the system has to be kept under vacuum during the whole measurement procedure resulting in a more complex and difficult handling of the tool, sample and probe. More specifically, it is not possible to manually handle the sample, probe and tool as easily as compared to a regular AFM measurement system in air.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">There is a need to overcome these disadvantages.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to a first aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for performing atomic force microscopy is disclosed, the apparatus comprising an AFM measurement unit operating in a first controlled atmosphere; a pretreatment unit operating in a second controlled atmosphere being different from the first controlled atmosphere, the pretreatment unit being connected to the AFM measurement unit.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to embodiments the second controlled atmosphere has a pressure lower than the pressure of the first controlled atmosphere.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to embodiments of the invention the first controlled atmosphere consists of at least one inert gas.

The apparatus 100 comprises an AFM measurement unit 102 configured to operate in a first controlled atmosphere 300 and a pretreatment unit 101 configured to operate in a second controlled atmosphere 400, the second controlled atmosphere 400 being different from the first controlled atmosphere 300. The pretreatment unit 101 is connected 110, 111 to the AFM measurement unit 102.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The AFM measurement unit 102 comprises AFM measurement equipment 106 and may further comprise additional (optional) equipment 107. With AFM measurement equipment 106 is meant the measurement tool used for analyzing a sample by moving a probe (i.e. cantilever with tip) across the sample and monitoring the vertical displacement of the probe when moving the probe across the sample by a detection system. The sample is typically mounted on an AFM sample holder or AFM sample stage which is part of the AFM measurement equipment 106. The probe is typically mounted on an AFM probe holder, which is part of the AFM measurement equipment 106. The additional (optional) equipment may for example be a cleaving tool, an optical microscope, a heating plate.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The AFM measurement unit 102 and thus the AFM measurement equipment 106 and any optional equipment 107 is configured to operate in a first controlled atmosphere 300. This means the AFM measurement unit 102, comprising the AFM equipment 106, when in use, is operating in a first controlled atmosphere 300.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The pretreatment unit 101 comprises a sample and/or probe holder 103 in a second controlled atmosphere 400.

The method 400 comprises performing the AFM measurement 406 of the sample with the AFM probe in an AFM measurement unit operating under a first controlled atmosphere wherein the sample and/or the AFM probe is treated 410 in a pretreatment unit operating under a second controlled atmosphere prior to performing the AFM measurement 406, and the second controlled atmosphere being different from the first controlled atmosphere.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The step of treating 410 the sample and/or AFM probe in the pretreatment unit under a second controlled atmosphere comprises introducing 401 the sample and/or AFM probe in the pretreatment unit and depressurizing 403 the pretreatment unit to a predetermined pressure, with the sample and/or AFM probe placed in the pretreatment unit. The predetermined pressure is preferably a vacuum pressure.

After the pressurizing step, the interior of the pretreatment unit will be in the another atmosphere, being preferably identical to the first atmosphere.

By putting the sample and/or AFM probe under a vacuum atmosphere, contaminants present on the surface of the sample and/or AFM probe such as organic contaminants, the presence of a water film and/or the presence of (native) oxides are eliminated and any surface modifications of the sample and/or AFM probe induced by ambient air and its contaminants can be avoided. After the vacuum pretreatment 410 of the sample and/or AFM probe, the sample and/or AFM probe surface are thus substantially free of any contaminants and modifications which may influence the subsequent atomic force microscopy measurement 406.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Additionally, the sample and/or the probe (or parts of it) may also be heated before, during, or after the abovementioned pretreatment procedure to further improve the surface and/or tip quality ultimately leading to higher quality AFM measurements.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">After performing a treatment 410 of the sample, and/or AFM probe the atomic force microscopy measurement 406 is performed.

The pretreatment unit may be a box which can be pumped using vacuum pumps to a (ultrahigh/high/medium) vacuum environment and may also allow for heating (part of) the sample and/or the probe. The pretreatment unit may comprise a heating system. The pretreatment unit may be connected to the AFM<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> measurement unit; either directly or indirectly , for example by a load lock system, such that the pretreated sample or probe (i.e. the sample or probe which underwent a pretreatment in the pretreatment unit) may be transferred easily to the AFM measurement unit without being exposed to air or any other contaminant. The pretreatment unit may also be located inside the AFM measurement unit. Using for example a glove box, the pretreated sample and/or AFM probe may be transferred from the pretreatment unit to the stage or sample holder and/or AFM probe holder of the AFM measurement unit without exposing the sample or probe to air or any other contaminant.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">In <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, the proof-of-concept is illustrated for certain embodiments. The deviation (%) is shown as a function of time. Deviation is defined as the average relative difference between individual AFM measurements obtained on several single scans and the mean of those individual AFM measurements scans. During a time period of 8 hours a sample was exposed in different cycles to various environments: 'air' 301 refers to regular ambient air as present in the lab at ambient pressure, while 'nitrogen' 302 refers to a pure nitrogen (industrial grade) atmosphere at ambient pressure. 'Medium vacuum' 303 represents a typical pressure of about 10<sup>-2</sup> mbar and can be reached with a regular roughing pump. 'High vacuum' 304 is reached when the pressure on the sample is below about 10<sup>-4</sup> mbar and can be reached with a turbo pump. The various environments 301, 302, 303, 304 are indicated in the graph and the AFM measurements are performed in the corresponding atmosphere.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">The sample is thus first pretreated in a second atmosphere, in this case a vacuum atmosphere. In this example, the sample was first exposed to high vacuum and subsequently measured in a first atmosphere (nitrogen). Clearly, the deviation drops significantly. Thereafter, the sample is exposed for a longer time to the second atmosphere (nitrogen) and the AFM measurements show an increase of the deviation. Subsequent exposure of the sample to another atmosphere (medium vacuum) reveals a further increase of the deviation. Only the subsequent exposure to a high vacuum atmosphere results in a decrease of the deviation. The procedure was repeated for a different nature of the atmosphere (air instead of nitrogen) revealing similar behavior. This experiment proves that the prior exposure to a high vacuum atmosphere results in<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> a significantly lower deviation and thus leads to higher quality AFM measurements even though the atmosphere in the measurement unit is not high vacuum.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982158" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An apparatus for performing atomic force microscopy, the apparatus comprising:
