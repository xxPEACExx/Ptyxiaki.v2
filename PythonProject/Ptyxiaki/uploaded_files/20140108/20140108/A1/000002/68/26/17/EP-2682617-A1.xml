Moreover the present invention is directed to a crank-shaft of a crank-drive, a radial bearing for such a crank-drive and a radial bearing itself.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In the last few decades a lot of research has been done in the field of plain bearings in general. Most of the investigations have been done in the field called "micro grooves" or "micro ramps" in at least one of the surfaces of the radial<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> bearing partners. It consists of inserting micro geometrical modifications in the hydrodynamic bearing surface in order to improve its performance under actual operating conditions. But in the special field of radial bearings for crank-drives, which are operated under difficult operational conditions due to continuously changing load directions and load conditions, a deeper research in improving the radial plain bearings has not been performed.</p><heading id="h0001">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">Document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5725314A"><text>US 5,725,314 A</text></patcit> refers to a hydrodynamic bearing including a cylindrical body having an inner wall and an outer wall, a plurality of gutters along the inner wall and a number of wedge-shaped recesses in fluid receiving communication with the gutters. Thus, the wedge-shaped recesses and the gutters form a number of micro grooves in one of the bearing surfaces. The wedge-shaped recesses has a wide portion along the circumference of the inner wall but none of the disclosed embodiments feature micro structures in the inner or outer bearing surface, which are only partly applied in the bearing surface, and the shown gutters and microgrooves lead to a decrease of maximal mechanical load.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Document <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US4747705A"><text>US 4,747,705 A</text></patcit> discloses another hydrodynamic bearing haying a plurality of pads on the inner bearing surface forming ramp shaped peaks. The bearing is optimized for high speed turbo machines which require special journal bearings to support their high speed rotating parts. Hydrodynamic bearings operate under the principle of hydrodynamic generation, wherein pressure is generated in the clearance between the bearing surface and the rotating part, such pressure producing a net load capacity and film stiffness. The hydrodynamic bearing herein disclosed is performed for special high speed applications and do not allow low rotating speeds and are optimized for about 40.000 rpm. Thus, a bearing having ramps in the bearing surface as herein disclosed are not applicable for crank-drive and in particular for supporting a crank-shaft in a crank-housing, because the bearing is not performed to provide a sufficient mechanical load.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0002">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Thus, the invention has the objective to provide a radial bearing with an improved load behavior which can be applied for a crank-drive and in particular for a crank-shaft.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">This objective is achieved by a crank-drive according to claim 1, a crank-shaft according to claim 9, a radial bearing according to claim 10 and a bearing element according to claim 12 of the present invention. Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined by the sub claims.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The invention discloses that in at least one of the bearing surfaces are arranged micro-ramp structures with an asymmetric form having a first concave section between the bearing surface and a bottom point of the micro-ramp structure and a second concave section between the bottom point and the bearing surface, whereas between the micro-ramp structures are arranged sections of the bearing surface.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Simulations and tests with different types of micro-ramp structures in crank-drives showed that the improvements in the operational parameters of the hydrodynamic radial bearings were extremely high when featuring micro- ramp structures according to the present invention. All bearing operating parameters, namely a lowered maximum oil film pressure, a maximized minimum oil film thickness, a maximized axial oil flow rate and a minimized power loss due to friction were improved by the inclusion of micro-ramp structures in a radial hydrodynamic bearing inner or outer surface featuring a design as described above. Therefore, this is a quite clear indication that the inclusion of these micro-ramp structures on a hydrodynamic radial bearing sliding surface will indeed significantly improve its performance.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Moreover, considering the extremely high improvements shown by simulation results, real tests show that the inclusion of properly designed asymmetric micro-ramp<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> structures having a first concave section between the bearing surface and a bottom point of the micro-ramp structure and a second concave section between the bottom point and the bearing surface with sections of the basic bearing surface in between lead to extremely well suited bearings in crank-drives. Such bearings can be applied to support a crank-shaft in a crank-housing or as a crank-journal for connection a connecting rod to the crank-shaft or e.g. between a connecting rod and a piston pin.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The main reason for improving the bearing parameters is a positive impact on the so called wedge effect. The improved load carrying capacity of a hydrodynamic radial bearing having micro-ramp structures as disclosed above is mainly based on a wedge mechanism in the convergent zone between the bearing journal and the bearing housing due to the eccentric position of the journal in the housing. Due to the invention between each of the micro-ramp structures are arranged zones of conventional basic bearing surfaces and according to the invention each of the micro-ramps form a single wedge zone in front of the following basic bearing surface with no cavity. Thus, the oil pressure in the gap between the inner bearing partner and the outer bearing partner increases in the micro-ramp zone and is kept up in the basic bearing surface or, respectively, does at least not feature a significant deviation.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As a result a bearing with a number of micro-ramps in front of zones of conventional basic bearing surfaces the bearing obtains an extremely high load capacity and is thus well suited to be applied in a crank-drive, because in a crank-drive high and peak-like loads in continuously changing directions stress the bearings in the crank-drive, but a bearing with a design according to the invention is able to withstand said peak loads in an excellent way.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to the invention in at least one bearing surface, i.e. in the bearing inner surface and/or in the bearing outer surface, are arranged micro-ramp structures with an asymmetric design. The asymmetric design bases on different shapes of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the first concave section and the second concave section. The asymmetry is formed related to the rotating direction of the opposite bearing partner. The concave shape of the sections describe a shape according to a quadrant of a circle or at least a deformed circle or of an ellipse and the first concave section features a different length compared to the second concave section, whereas the bottom point describes the lowermost point or line, respectively, in the micro-ramp structure. This point or line forms the transition from the first into the second concave section. In general, the design of non-symmetric regions forming the micro-ramps could be geometrically or mathematically defined as concavity shapes, sets of straight lines, polynomial functions or splines, among others, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">For another improvement the length of the first concave section is smaller than the length of the second concave section, but in particular both sections are present and thus greater than zero. The length is measured relating to the rotating direction of the bearing partner. When the length of the first concave section is smaller than the length of the second concave section, the bottom point is arranged closer to the beginning of the micro-ramp with regard to the rotating direction. Consequently the first concave section leads to a diverging zone until the bottom point is reached and the subsequent second concave section leads to a converging zone beginning from the bottom point to the end of the micro-ramp into the basic surface of the bearing. The second concave section forms the wedge-ramp, whereas the wedge-effect is inherent to the radial bearing geometry. Thus, the wedge-effect is increased by the use of a long second concave section. In the present invention, the use of micro-ramps allows that, in comparison width a bearing without micro-ramps, for the same oil film thickness, there is an increasing in load carrying capacity or, for a specific load carrying capacity, the minimum oil film thickness is increased.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Additionally, it occurs a peak reduction on the hydrodynamic pressure and a reduction on the engine power loss when the crank-drive with the inventive<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> bearings is in use, regarded to the reduction of the fluid friction due to the smaller hydrodynamic resistance regarded and to the smaller fluid shear stress.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The wedge-effect on the micro-ramp is described by the fluid passage inside the micro-ramp. In each micro-ramp, there is a gradual reduction of volume between the second concave section and the subsequent bearing surface. The gradual reduction of volume occurs between the maximum depth of the micro-ramp and the main or basic diameter of the journal and/or the housing. The fluid is restricted to flow from the second concave section to the subsequent bearing surface, dragging a constant quantity of fluid from a bigger to a smaller volume region, increasing the fluid pressure inside the micro-ramp.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the region formed by the subsequent bearing surface is generated a hydrodynamic stabilization, reducing the Reynolds number and conditioning the fluid for the entrance in the next micro-ramp.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to another embodiment of the inventive micro-ramp structure the bottom point features a depth below the bearing surface with an amount which is at least 50 times, preferably 100 times, more preferably 200 times and most preferred about 500 to 1000 times smaller than the total length of the first and second concave sections. This aspect ratio between the total length of the entire micro-ramp and the depth of the micro- ramp leads to a very flat shape of the structure, and in the groove formed by the micro-ramp a huge aggregation of lubricant is avoided and bubbles in the lubricant do not appear.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to yet another embodiment between the bearing partners is provided a radial clearance, whereas the depth of the micro-ramp structure amounts 1% to 50% and preferred 2,5% to 20% of the clearance. An advantageous amount of the depth of the micro-ramp the structure can be about 1µm to 8µm and preferred 4µm, in particular when the clearance amounts about 40µm. This means that the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> depth of the micro-ramp structure can be about 5% to 20% and preferred 10% of the clearance value.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Yet another improvement embodied in the present invention is formed by a bearing surface between the micro-ramp structures which feature a length which is 20% smaller or larger and preferably 10% smaller or larger than the total length of the first and second concave sections or which most preferred features the same total length of the first and second concave sections. The total length of the first and second concave sections amounts about 1mm to 7mm, preferably 2mm to 5mm and most preferred 2,7mm, e.g. when the diameter of the inner or outer bearing partner features a diameter of about 69mm. Thus, the length of the intermediate bearing surfaces also amounts about 2mm and 5mm and preferred 2,7mm.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to yet another improvement of the present invention the radial bearing features an axial length perpendicular to the rotating direction, whereas the micro-ramp structure features an axial width which is smaller than the axial length of the radial bearing. The axial length is measured with the contact length of the bearing partners in axial direction. Accordingly the micro-ramp structure does not extend across the entire axial length of the bearing, and beside the micro-ramp structure the bearing surface is continuously formed over the entire circumference. This leads to the positive effect that lubricant, which is received in the micro-ramp structure, cannot leakage sideways in axial direction and the maximum pressure of the lubricant within the micro-ramp structure remains at high values. Advantageously the oblong extension of the micro-ramp structure is formed perpendicular to the rotation direction and thus the micro-ramp structure extends in axial direction of the bearing, e.g. parallel or coaxial with the shaft axis.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The present invention is also directed to a crank-shaft for a crank-drive, in particular for a crank-drive of an internal combustion engine, whereas the crank-shaft features an inner bearing partner of at least one radial bearing for supporting<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the crank-shaft in a crank-housing, an inner bearing partner of at least one radial bearing for connection a connecting rod to the crank-shaft, whereas the inner bearing partners feature a bearing outer surface.
