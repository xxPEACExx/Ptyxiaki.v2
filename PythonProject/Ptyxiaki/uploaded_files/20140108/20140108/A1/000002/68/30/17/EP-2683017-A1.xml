The valve regulated lead-acid battery is constructed in a manner to lead the gas from the exhaust (control) valves throughout the space formed between the container lid and the upper lid and release it collectively through a filter.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the valve regulated lead-acid battery, each exhaust valve consists of a cap-type rubber valve and a valve seat portion which is molded integrally with the container lid in a way that the mentioned cap-type rubber valves are fitted together by insertion. Valve opening pressures of the valve regulated lead-acid battery which is constructed in this manner need to be inspected to assure the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> normal operation of the exhaust valve at the stage of manufacturing it.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, the inspection of the valve opening pressures of the exhaust valves needs to be carried out after the cap-type rubber valve bodies are fitted together by insertion in the valve seat portions. Then, the inspection of the valve opening pressures of the exhaust valves is followed to inspect the whole container lid in which the exhaust valves are inserted or to inspect the whole lead-acid battery, if the container lid is fixed to the container, which makes the inspection task very difficult and reduces its workability and also requires another working space. Moreover, if the inspection of the valve opening pressures is conducted after the container lid is fixed to the container, another problem will arise that their inspection itself becomes difficult..</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As disclosed in Patent Document 3, there is a type of lead-acid battery in which vent plugs with control valves to open in response to changes in internal pressures inside battery are mounted in a container lid. The electrolyte filling openings are formed at the container lid of the lead-acid battery, which correspond to respective cells and through which electrolyte or water is filled into the cell compartments, and the vent plugs are mounted in the electrolyte filling openings. In the vent plugs, exhaust holes are formed through which gas emitted from the control valves can be released outside the battery.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">When the container lid constructed in this manner is applied to a valve regulated lead-acid battery, it is necessary to prevent gas inside the cells from releasing through paths other than the control valves and the exhaust holes of the vent plugs, and therefore airtightness needs to be secured between the electrolyte<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> filling openings and the vent plugs when the vent plugs are mounted in the electrolyte filling openings.</p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT DOCUMENTS</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2005353324A"><text>JP-A-2005-353324</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2008262864A"><text>JP-A-2008-262864</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 3: <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2008034167A"><text>JP-A-2008-34167</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention has solved once for all the above-described problems and its main objects of which aim not only to make inspections of operating pressures of exhaust valves easy and accuracy of the operating pressures of the exhaust valves improved but also make reliability of mounting of vent plugs increased by carrying out inspections with the vent plugs being mounted and quality of a valve regulated lead-acid battery with a collective exhaust vent structure more advanced.</p><heading id="h0007">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the present invention, there is provided a method for manufacturing a lead-acid battery including: a container divided into a plurality of cell compartments; a container lid for sealing an upper opening of the container; a plurality of vent plugs which are mounted in the container lid to correspond to the respective cell compartments and incorporating exhaust valves to open or close in response to internal pressures in the cell compartments; and an upper lid<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> for sealing an upper space above the plurality of vent plugs in which exhaust opening vents are formed so as to release gas emitted from the plurality of vent plugs, to outside, the method comprising: a vent plug mounting process of mounting the vent plugs in the container lid, after conducting an operating pressure inspecting process of inspecting operating pressures of the exhaust valves; a mounting state inspecting process of inspecting mounting states of the vent plugs mounted in the container lid at the vent plug mounting process; and an upper lid attaching process of attaching the upper lid to the container lid, when the vent plugs are confirmed to be normally mounted in the container lid at the mounting state inspecting process.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">With this method, the operating pressure inspecting process, the vent plug mounting process, the mounting state inspecting process, and the upper lid attaching process are carried out in this order and therefore the inspections of the operating pressures of the exhaust valves become easier to be done and accuracy of the operating pressures of the mounted exhaust valves can be improved. Consequently, the manufacturing method according to the present invention is an optimal one for manufacturing a valve regulated lead-acid battery.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In this invention, by carrying out the operating pressure inspecting process, it is possible to sort the vent plugs by use of both measured values of valve opening pressure and valve closing pressure of the exhaust valve. As a result, it is possible to select the vent plugs within a normal range of valve opening pressures while discarding the vent plugs having valve opening pressures out of the specified range. The operating pressure inspecting process can be followed by the vent plug mounting process, which makes the inspection task easy<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> and workability improved, and also a required working space reduced in comparison of the case that the inspection process is carried out after the vent plugs are mounted to the container lid. Therefore, it is possible to enhance accuracy of the inspection without substantially increasing the cost for the inspection. This effect is especially beneficial for mass production of the lead-acid batteries.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In this invention, airtightness between the vent plug and the container lid can be inspected at the mounting state inspecting process, which can make reliability of mounting of the vent plugs improved. Carrying out of the mounting state inspecting process can contribute to make an increased percentage of the normally mounted vent plugs among ones mounted in the container lid. The normally mounted vent plug is confirmed to operate at a predetermined valve opening pressure, because the airtightness between the vent plug and the container lid is secured. If the mounting state is detected not to be normal, the vent plug mounting process is carried out again so as to mount the vent plug normally. Because the mounting state inspecting process is followed by the upper lid attaching process, the inspection task is extremely easier than the case that the inspecting process is carried out after the upper lid attaching process.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In this invention, both carrying out of the operating pressure inspecting process and the mounting state inspecting process contribute to make control of the operating pressures of the exhaust valves more reliable. Therefore, if the invention is applied to the valve regulated lead-acid battery, a valve regulated lead-acid battery with extremely high performance can be manufactured. Because variability of the valve opening pressures and the valve closing pressures<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> among a plurality of lead-acid batteries can be reduced, the invention is optimal to mass production, which therefore contributes to improve quality of the valve regulated lead-acid battery with a collective exhaust vent structure.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Preferably, at the same time as the operating pressure inspecting process is carried out by 100% inspection of the vent plugs, the mounting state inspecting process is carried out by random inspection of the container lids mounted with the vent plugs. In this way, lead-acid batteries with high quality can be manufactured efficiently by applying 100% inspection of the vent plugs which can discard every defective, and additionally by random inspection of mounting states of the mounted vent plugs which improper mounting is less likely assumed to occur.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In order to make a manufacturing process of the lead-acid battery more simplified, both the vent plug mounting process and the mounting state inspecting process are preferably carried out simultaneously.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">At the vent plug mounting process where the vent plugs are engaged by screwing with internal thread portions of electrolyte filling openings formed at the container lid, as in a case where the vent plug mounting process and the mounting state inspecting process are carried out simultaneously, torque regulation can be assumed to be conducted during tightening the vent plug into the internal thread portion at the electrolyte filling opening. As a result, by tightening the vent plug into the internal thread portion with over the predetermined value of torque, both the vent plug mounting process and the mounting state inspecting process can be done simultaneously.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As a specific embodiment of carrying out the mounting state inspecting process, at the above-described vent plug mounting process, the vent plugs are engaged by screwing with the internal thread portions of the electrolyte filling openings formed at the container lid, meanwhile the mounting state inspecting process is preferably carried out by turning round in an opposite direction to a tightening direction the vent plugs, which are screwed with the internal thread portion. Specifically, it is inspected whether or not torque value of turning the vent plug mounted to the internal thread portion in the opposite direction (unscrewing direction) to the tightening direction is higher than a predetermined one (e.g., a value which is slightly smaller than the tightening torque.) If the torque is measured smaller than the predetermined value in this inspection, the tightening is detected to be improper and the following process will feed back to the mounting process. In this manner, since workability of turning round the vent plugs in the opening direction is expected to be extremely high, the mounting state inspecting process can be conducted easily.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">At the upper lid attaching process, the upper lid is preferably fixed to the container lid so as not to be removable. In this way, it is possible to substantially eliminate events for users to touch the vent plugs. As a result, the users cannot maintain the fabricated lead-acid battery to increase safety of the user.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A lead-acid battery appropriately manufactured by the above-described manufacturing method is characterized by comprising: the container divided into a plurality of cell compartments; the container lid for sealing the upper opening of the container; a plurality of the vent plugs which are mounted in the container lid<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> to correspond to the respective cell compartments and incorporating the exhaust valves to open or close in response to the internal pressures of the cell compartments; and the upper lid which seals the upper space above a plurality of vent plugs and contains the exhaust opening vent for releasing gas emitted from the plurality of vent plugs, to outside. The vent plugs are removable and fixed to the container lid meanwhile the upper lid is fixed to the container lid so as not to be removable. Here, what the vent plugs are detachable is defined that they can be screwed or unscrewed freely. What the upper lid is not removable means it can be attached, but once it is attached, it cannot be removed unless it is forced to be broken to be removed.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">With this lead-acid battery, by installing the removable vent plugs in the upper lid from which they cannot be removable, it is possible to appropriately carry out the operating pressure inspecting process, the vent plug mounting process, and the mounting state inspecting process in the manufacturing factory. At the same time, because the upper lid cannot be removed by users after the manufacture, safety of a user can be assured. The lead-acid battery according to the present invention can be manufactured by carrying out a set of processes where the operating pressure inspecting process, the vent plug mounting process, the mounting state inspecting process, and the upper lid sealing process are conducted in this order.

The six-cell monoblock battery is described in this embodiment but the invention can be also applied to twelve-cell monoblock battery and the like and the number of cells is not especially restricted.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, the valve regulated lead-acid battery 100 includes a container 2 in a shape of a roughly rectangular parallelepiped divided into six cell compartments by five partitions placed parallel to each other, a container lid 3 in a roughly rectangular plate shape for sealing an upper opening of the container 2, six vent plugs 4 installed in the container lid 3 to correspond to the respective cell compartments, and an upper lid 5 for collectively<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> sealing upper space above the vent plugs 4. In the respective cell compartments of the container 2, element of plate groups and electrolyte of dilute sulfuric acid (not shown) are put in respectively.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3 and 4</figref>, each of the vent plugs 4 includes an exhaust valve 6 which opens or closes in response to an internal pressure of the corresponding cell compartments and consists of a vent plug main body 41 in a roughly cylindrical shape, a valve seat portion 42 placed inside an inner peripheral face of the vent plug main body 41 and formed in a roughly cylindrical shape along a direction of a rotation axis, a cap-type rubber valve element 43 attached to an upper opening of the valve seat portion 42, and a lid body 44 inserted to the vent plug main body 41 above the rubber valve element 43. The valve seat portion 42 and the rubber valve element 43 constitute the exhaust valve 6.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The vent plug main body 41 includes a cylindrical portion 411 inserted into an electrolyte filling opening 31 placed in the container lid 3 to correspond to each of the cell compartments and a flange portion 412 provided at an upper portion of the cylindrical portion 411. On an outer peripheral face of the cylindrical portion 411, an external thread portion 411a is formed to be engaged by screwing with an internal thread portion 31a formed on an inner peripheral face of the electrolyte solution filling opening 31. In this manner, the external thread portion 411a of the vent plug main body 41 is engaged by screwing with the internal thread portion 31a in the electrolyte filling opening 31, and thus the vent plug 4 is freely removed and fixed to the container lid 3.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> On a under surface of the flange portion 412, a single seal member 45 is set to assure an airproof sealing between the under surface of the flange portion 412 and a top surface of the container lid 3. The seal member 45 plays a function of the airtight sealing between the under surface of the flange portion 412 and the top surface of the container lid 3, when the external thread portion 411a of the vent plug main body 41 is engaged by screwing with the internal thread portion 31a in the electrolyte filling opening 31 (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>). Because the vent plug 4 and the electrolyte filling opening 31 are mounted airtightly by using the single seal member 45, the number of parts can be reduced and a structure of the lead-acid battery 100 can be simplified. Furthermore, the lid body 44 is fixed to the upper opening of the vent plug main body 41, and exhaust holes 44a are formed in the lid body 44 for releasing the gas emitted from the exhaust valve 6 to outside of the vent plug 4. A lower end face of the lid body 44 is preferably located at a predetermined distance from an upper end face of the rubber valve element 43 so as to prevent the rubber valve element 43 from coming off the valve seat portion 42.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">At the upper portion of the vent plug 4, specifically on a top face of the flange portion 412 of the vent plug 4, a tool engagement portion 46 is formed with which a mounting tool (not shown) for mounting the vent plug 4 in the container lid 3 is engaged. As particularly shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>, the tool engagement portion 46 is constructed by a plurality of engagement protrusions 461 placed at equal intervals in a circumferential direction on the top face of the flange portion 412. Because the engagement protrusions 461 project upward with respect to the flange portion 412, the tool can be engaged with and disengaged from the engagement protrusions 461 when the tool is moved up and down in a vertical<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> direction. The operation of moving the tool in the vertical direction is done more easily than that of horizontal movement in a right-left direction or a front-back direction, because there are fewer obstructions such as a side wall of the electrolyte filling opening 31 in case of the vertical movement. The advantage of fewer obstructions such as the side wall of the electrolyte filling opening 31 makes it possible to employ a design where upper faces of the engagement protrusions 461 do not project from the top face of the container lid 3 and beneficially results in to the reduced height of the container lid 3. Each of the engagement protrusions 461 is formed along a radial direction and consists a tightening engagement face 461a engaged with the mounting tool when vent plug 4 is turned round in a tightening direction to screw with the internal thread portion 31a and a loosening engagement face 461b engaged with the mounting tool when vent plug 4 is turned round in a loosening direction to remove from the internal thread portion 31a. The tightening engagement face 461a is a side face formed roughly perpendicular to the tightening direction and the loosening engagement face 461b is a side face formed roughly perpendicular to the loosening direction.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The upper lid 5 covers and seals the upper space above a plurality of vent plugs 4 and contains filters 7 through which the gas emitted from the exhaust holes 44a of the plurality of vent plugs 4 is collectively released to the outside. The upper lid 5 is fixed to the upper face of the container lid 3 to be airproof and cannot be removable and, specifically, fixed to the upper face of the container lid 3 by thermal weld.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">6</figref>, the upper lid 5 has a roughly<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> rectangular shape extending along a direction of arrangement of the vent plugs 4, where exhaust opening vents 51 are formed so as to release the gas from the vent plugs 4 to the outside in both right and left lateral side, and the filters 7 are located upstream of the exhaust opening vents 51. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>, each of the filters 7 is located at a certain distance upward from the top face of the container lid 3 so that the gas emitted from the vent plugs 4 passes through the filters 7 upward from a bottom side to reach the exhaust opening vents 51. In this way, the gas from the vent plugs 4 is released outside but the electrolyte leaked from the vent plugs 4 is hard to pass out through the filters 7.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref>, the upper lid 5 includes a plurality of flow path walls 8 between the container lid 3 and the upper lid 5 by which electrolyte leaked from the vent plugs 4 will pass through a roundabout path to the exhaust opening vents 51 from the vent plugs 4. The flow path walls 8 in the embodiment are formed by partition walls 52 which surround peripheries of the respective vent plugs 4 and compartment the respective vent plug 4. As for the partition wall 52, communication holes 52a are formed which connect the adjacent compartmented areas each other to lead the gas to the exhaust opening vents 51</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Specifically, the partition walls 52 aim to lead the gas emitted from the vent plugs 4 to a central portion and then divide it in the right and left directions of the upper lid 5 and finally guide it to the exhaust opening vents 51 formed in both right and left lateral side. In the embodiment, the partition walls 52 are lattice-shaped along both a longitudinal direction and a short side direction of the upper lid 5 and each of the compartmented areas (A to F) formed for the respective vent plug 4 is in roughly rectangular shape. The communication holes 52a are<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> formed in the partition walls 52 which connect the compartmented areas adjacent to each other (e.g., A and B, B and C) in both the right and left direction (longitudinal direction). Moreover, the communication holes 52a are formed in the partition walls 52 which connect the compartmented areas (C, D) located on a central part and the compartmented areas (G, H) adjacent to each other in the short side direction (vertical direction). If the electrolyte leaked from vent plug4 reach the compartmented areas (G, H), the electrolyte need to get round a plurality of partition walls 52 and the communication holes 52 until arriving at the exhaust opening vents 51. Because the partition walls 52 which play a role of the flow path walls 8 are formed in this manner, the electrolyte leaked from the vent plugs 4 can hardly get out from the exhaust opening vents 51 in the upper lid 5.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Next, a method for manufacturing the valve regulated lead-acid battery 100 constructed in this way will be described with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 7</figref>, the manufacturing method according to the embodiment includes: an operating pressure inspecting process S1 of inspecting the exhaust valves 6 mounted in the vent plugs 4 to inspect operating pressures before the vent plugs 4 are mounted in the container lid 3; a vent plug mounting process S2 of mounting the vent plugs 4 in the container lid 3, in which opening pressures of exhaust valves are confirmed to be in a normal range at the operating pressure inspecting process S1; a mounting state inspecting process S3 to inspect mounting states of the vent plugs 4 mounted in the container lid 3 at the vent plug mounting process S2; and an upper lid attaching process S4 of attaching the upper lid 5 to the container lid 3 when the vent plugs 4 are confirmed to be<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> mounted normally to the container lid 3 in mounting state inspecting process S3.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Before the vent plug mounting process S2, the elements of plate groups are inserted in the respective cell compartments of the container 2 and the container lid 3 is fixed to the upper opening of the container 2 (process S5), and the electrolyte is filled into the respective cell compartments through the electrolyte openings 31 formed at the container lid 3 (process S6). Then, following filling the electrolyte, the elements of the plate groups inside the container lid 3 are charged (process S7). The vent plug mounting process S2 is carried out for the container lid 3 of the lead-acid battery in which the elements of the plate groups are charged. The container lid 3 is fused to the upper opening of the container 2 by thermal weld.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The inspection of the operating pressure at the operating pressure inspecting process S1 is conducted before mounting the vent plug 4 in the container lid 3, where gas such as air are forced to inlet into the vent plug 4 from underneath until the exhaust valve 6 will open and the air pressure at valve opening is measured as an opening gas pressure of the exhaust valve 6. The operating pressure inspecting process S1 is carried out for all the vent plugs 4 before mounting them in the container lid 3. If the valve opening pressure measured here is not within the predetermined normal range, the exhaust valve 6 of the vent plug 4 is detected to a defective and discarded before mounting in the container lid 3. On the other hand, if the measured valve opening pressure is within the predetermined normal range, the exhaust valve 6 of the vent plug 4 is confirmed to be normal and installed in the vent plug 4 mounted in the container lid 3. In the invention, instead of inspecting the valve opening pressures, a<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> process of inspecting valve closing pressures of the exhaust valves 6 can be carried out as the operating pressure inspecting process and thus the exhaust valves 6 with the valve closing pressures in a normal range can be selectively used. In the invention, as well as by carrying out the process of inspecting the valve opening pressures of the exhaust valves 6, by carrying out the process of inspecting the valve closing pressures as the operating pressure inspecting process, it is possible to selectively use the exhaust valves 6 which are within the normal ranges of both the valve opening pressures and the valve closing pressures.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The vent plug mounting process S2 is a process of mounting the vent plugs 4, which exhibits valve opening pressures are confirmed within a normal range, in the electrolyte filling openings 31 at the container lid 3. Specifically, the tool engagement portion 46 formed at the upper portion of the vent plug 4 are engaged with the mounting tool and each of the vent plugs 4 is mounted in the electrolyte filling opening 31 by screwing. At the vent plug mounting process S2, for example, tightening torque of the vent plug 4 can be controlled by using a torque wrench, and then the vent plug 4 is mounted in the container lid 3 by tightening with over the predetermined values of tightening torque.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The mounting state inspecting process S3 is carried out by operating each of vent plugs 4 which are engaged with the internal thread portion 31a in the container lid 3 by screwing, in an opposite direction (loosening direction) to the tightening direction. The mounting state inspecting process S3 is carried out by inspecting by sample the lead-acid batteries in which all the vent plugs 4 are mounted in the container lids 3 at the vent plug mounting process S2.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> Specifically, for example, reverse torque is measured which is generated when the vent plug 4 is turned in the loosening direction by using the torque wrench, and check whether or not the measured reverse torque is larger than a predetermined value (e.g., a value slightly smaller than the predetermined value of the tightening torque in the vent plug mounting process S2). If the reverse torque is smaller than the predetermined value, the tightening is detected to be insufficient (improper mounting), the process reverses to the vent plug mounting process S2 , and the vent plug 4 which is determined to be defective is tightened again with over the predetermined tightening torque.
