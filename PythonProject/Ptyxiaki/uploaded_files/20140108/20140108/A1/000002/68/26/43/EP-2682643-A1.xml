The non-smooth engagement can cause so-called "reverse shift gear whining."</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, to shift to reverse in a manual transmission on an FR (front engine, rear wheel drive) vehicle, the vehicle is often halted. After that, it is started to engage a reverse idler gear with a reverse gear on the countershaft which is rotating under inertia (hereinafter, will be referred to as a "reverse drive gear" or a "counter gear"), which is further followed by starting of engagement of the reverse idler gear with a reverse gear on the output shaft (hereinafter, will be referred to as a "reverse driven gear").</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">When that is the case, the reverse idler gear, now rotating due to its engagement with the rotating reverse drive gear, will be engaged with the non-rotating reverse driven gear (the reverse driven gear is not rotating because the vehicle has been halted). There exists, however, a rotational difference between the (rotating) reverse idler gear and the (not-rotating) reverse driven gear, and the difference can impede smooth engagement and may cause reverse shift gear whining.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A rotational difference also arises between the reverse drive gear and the reverse idler gear when they are to be engaged. Nevertheless, since the reverse idler gear has a sufficiently smaller inertia than a combination of the countershaft and the reverse drive gear, gear whining is unlikely to occur. In contrast, when the reverse idler gear is to be engaged with the reverse driven gear, gear whining is likely to occur because the reverse idler gear, having been already engaged with the reverse drive gear, is rotating integrally with the countershaft and thereby has a greater inertia.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Gear whining prevention devices (reverse synchronizers) are proposed as disclosed in, for example, Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2 with an object to prevent the reverse shift gear whining.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Each patent document discloses a manual transmission fitted with a selective sliding reverse mechanism, wherein: a reverse synchronizer is disposed between a reverse idler shaft and a reverse idler gear, the reverse idler shaft supporting the reverse idler gear in a freely rotatable manner; and when the reverse idler gear slides in such a direction that it can engage a reverse drive gear and a reverse driven gear, the reverse synchronizer synchronizes the (rotating) reverse idler gear to the (non-rotating) reverse idler shaft to stop the rotation of the reverse idler gear.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: Japanese Examined Utility Model Publication, Jitsukousho, No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP62022694A"><text>62-22694</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Application Publication, Tokukaihei, No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP9236178A"><text>9-236178</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of the Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The conventional reverse synchronizers, however, have the following<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> problems. When the driver of the vehicle shifts gears to reverse, the reverse idler gear slides, in response to a gear shifting operation of a shift lever, in such a direction that it can engage the reverse drive gear and the reverse driven gear. If the driver suspends the gear shifting operation of the shift lever while the reverse idler gear is sliding, the reverse idler gear may possibly stop sliding without properly engaging (semi-engaging) with the reverse drive gear and the reverse driven gear. Thus, improper engagement occurs where the reverse idler gear stops sliding before completely engaging the reverse drive gear and the reverse driven gear. That may hinder good transfer of rotational driving force and/or negatively affect durability of gears.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to Patent Document 1, the rotating reverse idler gear is synchronized with the reverse idler shaft by frictional contact between a tapered cone surface formed on a friction member constituting the reverse synchronizer and a tapered cone surface formed on the reverse idler gear, so that the reverse idler gear stops rotating. Therefore, if the gear shifting operation of the shift lever is suspended while the reverse idler gear is sliding, the frictional contact between the tapered cone surfaces continues. The tapered cone surfaces may wear out badly due to the friction, which could lead to poor reliability of the synchronization operation of the reverse synchronizer.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In view of these problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a reverse synchronizer for a manual transmission capable of improving reliability of gear shifting operation in shifting to reverse.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><heading id="h0008">Principles in Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention, conceived to accomplish the object, has the following principles for solving the problems. After stopping the rotation of the reverse idler gear by synchronizing the reverse idler gear to the reverse idler shaft, the frictional contact section (tapered cone surface) of the reverse<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> idler gear and the frictional contact section (tapered cone surface) of the reverse idler shaft, which have been exhibiting synchronization effect, are forcibly separated. The separating force is then utilized to move the reverse idler gear to a reverse gear establishing position.</p><heading id="h0009">Means to Solve Problems</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">Specifically, the present invention is made on a reverse synchronizer for a manual transmission including a reverse idler gear capable of moving reciprocally between a reverse gear establishing position where rotational driving force can be transferred from a reverse drive gear to a reverse driven gear and vice versa and a non-reverse gear establishing position where no rotational driving force can be transferred from the reverse drive gear to the reverse driven gear and vice versa, wherein in moving the reverse idler gear toward the reverse gear establishing position, a shaft-side synchronization section provided on a reverse idler shaft side and a gear-side synchronization section provided on a reverse idler gear side are brought into contact with each other so that rotation of the reverse idler gear is synchronized with rotation of the reverse idler shaft. The reverse synchronizer is configured to include synchronization section separating means for applying, after synchronizing the reverse idler gear to the reverse idler shaft by the contact between the shaft-side synchronization section and the gear-side synchronization section in moving the reverse idler gear toward the reverse gear establishing position, a biasing force to the shaft-side synchronization section in such a direction as to move the shaft-side synchronization section away from the gear-side synchronization section.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">With this feature, the reverse idler gear is engaged by another gear (e.g., reverse driven gear) after the synchronization operation is done through the contact between the shaft-side synchronization section provided on the reverse idler shaft side and the gear-side synchronization section provided on the reverse idler gear side in moving the reverse idler gear toward the reverse<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> gear establishing position. Accordingly, occurrence of reverse shift gear whining is prevented. After synchronizing the reverse idler gear to the reverse idler shaft, the synchronization section separating means applies a biasing force to the shaft-side synchronization section in such a direction as to move the shaft-side synchronization section away from the gear-side synchronization section. Accordingly, the frictional contact between the shaft-side synchronization section and the gear-side synchronization section is released, and the biasing force can be utilized to move the reverse idler gear to the reverse gear establishing position. Therefore, even if the driver of the vehicle suspends the gear shifting operation of the shift lever while the reverse idler gear is moving, the reverse idler gear properly engages the reverse drive gear and the reverse driven gear. Consequently, incomplete engagement is prevented. Frictional wear is also prevented from increasing due to continuing frictional contact between the shaft-side synchronization section and the gear-side synchronization section. A high level of reliability is thus maintained for the synchronization operation of the reverse synchronizer over an extended period of time.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The synchronization section separating means may be configured, specifically, so that: the shaft-side synchronization section is a tapered cone surface provided on a reverse idler gear side of a synchronization member supported so as to reciprocally move freely relative to the reverse idler shaft; the gear-side synchronization section is a tapered cone surface formed on an outer circumferential surface of the reverse idler gear; and the synchronization section separating means includes: a non-synchronizing incline portion formed on the synchronization member so as to incline outward when viewed in such a direction that the reverse idler gear moves toward the reverse gear establishing position; and a press mechanism for exerting a pressing force on the non-synchronizing incline portion in a direction which is orthogonal to the direction in which the reverse idler gear is moved.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Accordingly, when the press mechanism is applying a pressing force to the non-synchronizing incline portion, a component of the pressing force acts as a biasing force which separates the tapered cone surface of the synchronization member from the tapered cone surface of the reverse idler gear. Therefore, the tapered cone surfaces can be separated from each other at any time by appropriately specifying the shape of the non-synchronizing incline portion formed on the synchronization member.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The reverse idler gear being moved to the reverse gear establishing position using the biasing force may be achieved, as a specific example, by the synchronization member being retained by a snap ring attached to an outer circumferential section of the reverse idler gear so as to move in conjunction with movement of the reverse idler gear.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In other words, when the press mechanism is applying a pressing force to the non-synchronizing incline portion, a component of the force acts on the reverse idler gear from the synchronization member via a snap ring, thereby moving the reverse idler gear to the reverse gear establishing position.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The synchronization member may be configured, specifically, so that in moving the reverse idler gear toward the reverse gear establishing position, the reverse idler gear starts to engage the reverse driven gear after having started to engage the reverse drive gear. In addition, the synchronization member may include a synchronizing incline portion provided contiguously with an end, of the non-synchronizing incline portion, toward which the reverse idler gear moving toward the reverse gear establishing position moves, and the synchronizing incline portion may incline inward when viewed in such a direction that the reverse idler gear moves toward the reverse gear establishing position. Furthermore, the synchronizing incline portion and the non-synchronizing incline portion may have an interface at a place where in moving the reverse idler gear toward the reverse gear establishing position, a point of application of the pressing<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> force exerted by the press mechanism advances from the synchronizing incline portion to the non-synchronizing incline portion at a time when the reverse idler gear starts to engage the reverse driven gear.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">With this configuration, when the reverse idler gear has moved toward the reverse gear establishing position and started to engage the reverse drive gear, but is yet to start to engage the reverse driven gear, the pressing force exerted by the press mechanism is acting on the synchronizing incline portion. A component of the pressing force acts so as to bring the tapered cone surface of the synchronization member and the tapered cone surface of the reverse idler gear closer to each other. In other words, the component acts so as to synchronize the reverse idler gear and the reverse drive gear to the reverse idler shaft. Thereafter, as the reverse idler gear starts to engage the reverse driven gear, the press mechanism applies a pressing force to the non-synchronizing incline portion as mentioned above. The component of the pressing force separates the tapered cone surface of the synchronization member from the tapered cone surface of the reverse idler gear. By switching the direction of a component of the pressing force exerted by the press mechanism in this manner, an appropriate shape design for the synchronization member can achieve good synchronization operation and prevention of frictional wear through separation of the tapered cone surfaces from each other.</p><heading id="h0010">Advantageous Effects of the Invention</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the present invention, after synchronizing the reverse idler gear to the reverse idler shaft, the shaft-side synchronization section and the gear-side synchronization section, which have been exhibiting the synchronization effect, are separated. Hence, the reliability of the gear shifting operation is improved, and the frictional wear of the shaft-side synchronization section and the gear-side synchronization section can be reduced.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><heading id="h0011">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0022" num="0022"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a skeleton view showing a gear layout for a manual transmission in accordance with an embodiment.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is a schematic view showing the positions of the centers of shafts and an arrangement of the gears supported by the shafts in a transmission case.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> is a diagram showing a sketch of a shift pattern for a 6-speed manual transmission.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a reverse gear train and a reverse synchronizer.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5(a)</figref> is a diagram showing a state of a reverse synchronizer when a reverse idler gear and a reverse drive gear start to engage, and <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5(b)</figref> is a diagram showing the position of a lock ball at that time.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6(a)</figref> is a diagram showing a state of the reverse synchronizer when the reverse idler gear and the reverse drive gear are about to engage, and <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6(b)</figref> is a diagram showing the position of the lock ball at that time.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 7(a)</figref> is a diagram showing a state of the reverse synchronizer when the reverse idler gear and a reverse driven gear start to engage, and <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 7(b)</figref> is a diagram showing the position of the lock ball at that time.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 8(a)</figref> is a diagram showing a state of the reverse synchronizer when the reverse idler gear is about to engage the reverse drive gear and the reverse driven gear, and <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 8(b)</figref> is a diagram showing the position of the lock ball at that time.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 9(a)</figref> is a diagram showing a state of the reverse synchronizer when a reverse gear is established, and <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 9(b)</figref> is a diagram showing the position of the lock ball at that time.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0012">Description of Embodiments</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --><p id="p0023" num="0023">The following will describe embodiments of the present invention in reference to drawings.

Since the reverse gear synchro plate 83 and the reverse idler gear 18 are capable of relative movement (capable of as much relative movement as the difference between the groove width of the snap ring insertion grooves 81a and 82a and the thickness of the snap ring SR) as mentioned above, the tapered cone surfaces 18g and 83f are capable of moving relative to each other between a state where they are in contact with each other and a state where they are separated.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The tapered cone surfaces 18g and 83f face each other separated by a narrow gap when the reverse idler gear 18 is not slid to the gear forward moving side (non-synchronized state). On the other hand, when the reverse<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> idler gear 18 is slid to the gear forward moving side, the reverse idler gear 18 relatively moves slightly toward the reverse gear synchro plate 83 (moves closer to the reverse gear synchro plate 83), so that the tapered cone surface 18g of the reverse idler gear 18 moves forward toward the tapered cone surface 83f of the reverse gear synchro plate 83. This forward movement enables the tapered cone surfaces 18g and 83f to make frictional contact with each other (synchronized state). The synchronization member of the present invention is configured as above by the guide shaft 82 and the reverse gear synchro plate 83.</p><heading id="h0016">Detent Mechanism</heading><p id="p0067" num="0067">The present embodiment features a detent mechanism (synchronization section separating means) 9 provided to the guide shaft 82, i.e., a lower one of the guide shafts 81 and 82.

The lock ball insertion hole 51a is contiguous with the through holes 53 and contains the lock ball 93 therein. The coil spring 94, disposed between the lock ball 93 and a spring seat 10a formed on the transmission case 10, is compressed between the lock ball 93 and the spring seat 10a.

When the reverse idler gear 18 starts to engage the reverse drive gear 17a, the lock ball 93 reaches the gear retracted side end of the horizontal portion 95 (the gear forward moving side end of the synchronizing incline portion 96) because the guide shaft 82 has moved together with the sliding reverse idler gear 18 (see <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref>).</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">The synchronizing incline portion 96 is formed contiguous with the gear retracted side of the horizontal portion 95 and inclines at a predetermined inclination angle (e.g., 30°) toward the outer circumference (the bottom of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>) on the gear retracted side.

In this state, as mentioned above, the countershaft 4 and the<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> reverse drive gear 17a are rotating under inertia, whereas the reverse idler gear 18 and the reverse driven gear 17b have stopped.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">The reverse idler gear 18 slides toward the gear forward moving side. When the reverse idler gear 18 has slid to a position where the reverse idler gear 18 starts to engage the reverse drive gear 17a as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref>, the lock ball 93 of the lock ball mechanism 92 reaches the gear retracted side end of the horizontal portion 95 (see <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5(b)</figref>). So far into the reverse shifting operation, the pressing force exerted by the lock ball 93 onto the detent groove 91 (horizontal portion 95) has not produced a horizontal component of the force. Therefore, the reverse shifting operation only requires a relatively weak manipulation force.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">As the shift lever L is manipulated further toward the reverse-gear position REV for gear shifting, the reverse idler gear 18 starts to engage the reverse drive gear 17a and receive a rotational driving force from the reverse drive gear 17a, thereby starting to rotate, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref>. In this state, the reverse idler gear 18 is yet to engage the reverse driven gear 17b. Meanwhile, the lock ball 93 of the lock ball mechanism 92 has moved from the horizontal portion 95 to the synchronizing incline portion 96. The reverse idler gear 18 is about to slide, with the pressing force exerted by the lock ball 93 being applied to the synchronizing incline portion 96. A horizontal component of the pressing force exerted by the lock ball 93 on the synchronizing incline portion 96 (see arrow F1 in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6(b)</figref>) acts on the guide shaft 82 so as to move the guide shaft 82 toward the gear retracted side. In other words, the component acts on the guide shaft 82 and the reverse gear synchro plate 83 as a pressing force toward the gear retracted side (reverse idler gear 18). Meanwhile, the manipulation force on the shift lever L is being exerted on the reverse idler gear 18 via the shift mechanism 7 as a pressing force toward the gear forward moving side (see arrow F2 in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6(a)</figref>). Therefore, the reverse gear synchro plate 83 and the reverse idler gear 18 receive the pressing forces F1 and F2, respectively, which act in<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> such directions as to bring the plate 83 and the gear 18 closer to each other. That brings the tapered cone surface 83f of the reverse gear synchro plate 83 and the tapered cone surface 18g of the reverse idler gear 18 into frictional contact. The frictional contact synchronizes the reverse idler gear 18 with the reverse idler shaft (fixed shaft member) 5 via the reverse gear synchro plate 83 and the guide shafts 81 and 82. The reverse idler gear thus stops rotating.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">The shift lever L is further manipulated toward the reverse-gear position REV for gear shifting until the reverse idler gear 18 slides to a position where the reverse idler gear 18 starts to engage the reverse driven gear 17b, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 7</figref>. As this happens, the lock ball 93 of the lock ball mechanism 92 reaches the gear retracted side end of the synchronizing incline portion 96. As a result, the pressing force exerted by the lock ball 93 on the synchronizing incline portion 96 (pressing force F1 indicated by an arrow in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6(b)</figref>) is relieved. Accordingly, the frictional contact force between the tapered cone surface 83f of the reverse gear synchro plate 83 and the tapered cone surface 18g of the reverse idler gear 18 decreases. From this time on, the point of application of the pressing force exerted by the lock ball 93 changes from the synchronizing incline portion 96 to the non-synchronizing incline portion 97.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Thereafter, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 8</figref>, the reverse idler gear 18 starts to engage the reverse driven gear 17b. In this state, since the reverse idler gear 18 has already stopped rotating, the engaging operation on the non-rotating reverse driven gear 17b is performed smoothly, causing no reverse shift gear whining. Meanwhile, the lock ball 93 of the lock ball mechanism 92 has moved from the synchronizing incline portion 96 to the non-synchronizing incline portion 97. The reverse idler gear 18 is about to slide, with the pressing force exerted by the lock ball 93 being applied to the non-synchronizing incline portion 97. A horizontal component of the pressing force exerted by the lock ball 93 on the non-synchronizing incline portion 97 (see arrow F3 in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figures 8(a) and 8(b)</figref>) acts on the guide shaft 82 so as to<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> move the guide shaft 82 toward the gear forward moving side. In other words, the component acts on the guide shaft 82 and the reverse gear synchro plate 83 as a pressing force toward the gear forward moving side (in a direction moving away from the reverse idler gear 18). Therefore, the tapered cone surface 83f of the reverse gear synchro plate 83 is moved away from the tapered cone surface 18g of the reverse idler gear 18 and hence out of frictional contact. This pull-in force continuously acts until the lock ball 93 of the lock ball mechanism 92 reaches the gear retracted side end of the non-synchronizing incline portion 97. Even if the driver of the vehicle suspends the gear shifting operation of the shift lever L in the state shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 8</figref>, the reverse idler gear 18 is automatically moved to the reverse gear establishing position.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">The horizontal component, F3, of the pressing force exerted by the lock ball 93 also acts as a pressing force exerted by the reverse gear synchro plate 83 on the snap ring SR toward the gear forward moving side, that is, as a force which pulls the reverse idler gear 18 in toward the gear forward moving side. This reduces the manipulation force required for the manipulation of the shift lever L.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 9</figref>, when the lock ball 93 of the lock ball mechanism 92 reaches the gear retracted side end of the non-synchronizing incline portion 97, the positions of the widthwise centers of the teeth of the reverse idler gear 18 match those of the reverse drive gear 17a and the reverse driven gear 17b, establishing reverse gear.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">As described above, in the present embodiment, even if the driver suspends the gear shifting operation of the shift lever L while the reverse idler gear 18 is sliding (even if the driver lets go of the shift lever L), the reverse idler gear 18 is forcibly pulled in to the reverse gear establishing position by the horizontal component, F3, of the pressing force exerted by the lock ball 93 on the non-synchronizing incline portion 97. As a result, the reverse idler gear 18 properly engages the reverse drive gear 17a and the<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> reverse driven gear 17b. The configuration permits no incomplete engagement of the reverse idler gear 18 with the reverse drive gear 17a and the reverse driven gear 17b. Consequently, the rotational driving force is transferred better, and the gears 17a, 17b, and 18 are more durable.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">In addition, after the reverse idler gear 18 is synchronized with the reverse idler shaft 5, the force F3 separates the tapered cone surface 83f of the reverse gear synchro plate 83 from the tapered cone surface 18g of the reverse idler gear 18 (pulls the tapered cone surface 83f of the reverse gear synchro plate 83 away from the tapered cone surface 18g of the reverse idler gear 18). Therefore, the frictional contact between the tapered cone surfaces 83f and 18g is discontinued which would otherwise add to frictional wear. A high level of reliability is thus maintained for the synchronization operation of the reverse synchronizer 8 over an extended period of time.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">In addition, the separation of the tapered cone surface 83f of the reverse gear synchro plate 83 from the tapered cone surface 18g of the reverse idler gear 18 allows for tapered cone surfaces 18g and 83f with small taper angles (cone angles) in order to create a large contact area between the tapered cone surfaces 18g and 83f for improved synchronization capability More specifically, conventional art needed large taper angles to reduce frictional wear of the tapered cone surfaces. It was therefore difficult to create a large contact area. That restricted improvement in synchronization capability. In contrast, in the present embodiment, since the tapered cone surfaces 18g and 83f are forcibly separated (disengaged) from each other, small taper angles are yet able to reduce frictional wear. The configuration allows for improved synchronization capability and synchronization operation reliability.</p><heading id="h0018">Other Embodiments</heading><p id="p0085" num="0085">The embodiment described so far is an application of the present invention to the manual transmission 1 with six forward gears which is mounted on an FR vehicle.
