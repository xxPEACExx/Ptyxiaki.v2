Therefore, alloy tool steels of the SKD61 system, for example, which is a JIS steel grade have been conventionally used as a steel grade for use in the field of hot work tools (hereafter, referred to as a hot work tool steel). So, there is proposed a technique for improving the toughness of a hot work tool steel by reviewing the added amounts of principal elements constituting the hot work tool steel, and further restraining and controlling various kinds of impurities such as As, Bi, Sn, Zn, and Sb (see Patent Literature 1). However, adjusting various kinds of impurity elements respectively within a specified range may lead to increase in production cost.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In contrast to this, the present inventors have conducted diligent studies on elements, which have not been positively used as an alloying element in the field of steel materials, instead of expensive and special elements, and consequently found that toughness can be significantly improved by adding Zn, which conventionally has been treated as an impurity, in a predetermined content range (see Patent Literature 2). That is, the hot work tool steel contains, in mass%, C: 0.3% to less than 0.55%, Si: not more than 1.5%, Mn: not more than 1.5%, and Cr: 3.00 to 5.65%, wherein the hot work tool steel contains Zn: 0.001 to 0.015%.</p><heading id="h0003">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT LITERATURE</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><p id="p0004" num="0004"><ul><li>Patent Literature 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2003155540A"><text>JP-A-2003-155540</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Literature 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2007224418A"><text>JP-A-2007-224418</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">TECHNICAL PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The technique of adding Zn proposed in Patent Literature 2 is effective as a novel method for improving the toughness of a hot work tool steel. Further, utilizing the method of Patent Literature 2 allows scraps of Zn-plated steel to be used as a recycling raw material, which is also suitable for reducing an environmental load. While focusing on the toughness improving effect by positive addition of Zn, the present inventors have studied on the possibility to compensate for the deterioration of toughness due to other impurity elements. If the permissible amount of those impurity elements can be appropriately increased, it becomes possible to reduce the amount of energy usage required for removing impurities while increasing the usage rate of low level scraps with a high impurity content, the discharge amount of which is expected to increase in the future, thereby further reducing a load on the environment in the production process of hot work tool steels.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to provide a hot work tool steel having excellent toughness and capable of reducing an environmental load, and a method for producing the same.</p><heading id="h0007">SOLUTION TO PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present inventors have investigated the effects of impurity elements contained in hot work tool steels on the toughness thereof and the environment. Consequently, they have found that in particular P (phosphorus) is the element that significantly reduces the toughness of the hot work tool steel, and also the element that takes a large amount of energy to be removed and, for those reasons, hinders promotion of usage of low grade scraps to impose a large load on the environment. Accordingly, to reduce the environmental load, the present inventors have studied a method of maintaining sufficient toughness even when the permissible amount of P is increased. Consequently, they have determined that deterioration of toughness due to increase in P content can be ceased by adding an appropriate amount of Zn with respect to<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the P content. Then, the present inventors have arrived at the present invention by making clear the quantitative relationship between P and Zn in which the supplemental effect of toughness can be sufficiently utilized, and a method of adjusting the chemical components suitable for achieving the quantitative relationship.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">That is, the present invention is a hot work tool steel having excellent toughness, including, in mass%, C: 0.3% to less than 0.6%, Si: not more than 1.5%, Mn: not more than 1.5%, and Cr: 3.0 to less than 6.0%, characterized in that Zn is more than 0.0025 to 0.025% and P is not less than 0.005%, and Zn/P is more than 0.5.

That is, the relationship between P, which is an element that significantly reduces toughness, and the adding amount of Zn of the present invention is made clear so that the content of P is permitted within a certain limit. That is, the present inventors have found that utilizing Zn as an alloying element for a hot work tool steel can exhibit the effect of improving toughness, even if the content of P have increased. Thus, since the content of P, which conventionally needed to be reduced to a very low level, can be permitted up to an increased level, the use amount of expensive low-P scraps can be reduced when selecting raw materials, which is suitable for recycling of scraps. Further, the energy and time needed for removing P in the refining process can be reduced. Hereafter, the reasons for limiting the chemical components of a hot work tool steel to be produced by the present invention will be described (mass% will be simply denoted as "%").</p><heading id="h0011">- Zn: more than 0.0025 to 0.025%</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">Zn is the most important additive element for the present invention, and its addition remarkably improves the toughness of steel. This effect can be sufficiently achieved by adding an amount of more than 0.0025%. A preferable adding amount is not less than 0.003%. On the other hand, even if a larger amount of Zn is added, its effect will be saturated. Further, if extreme segregation occurs in grain boundaries due to the excessive addition, it may rather be a factor to cause deterioration of toughness. Moreover, since the adding technique thereof will become complicated, the upper limit of Zn is set to 0.025%. It is preferably not more than 0.020%, and more preferably not more than 0.015%.</p><heading id="h0012">- P: not less than 0.005%</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">P (phosphorous) is an element that segregates in original austenite grain boundaries during a heat treatment such as tempering, thereby embrittling the grain boundaries. Therefore, to improve the toughness of a hot work tool steel, P is an impurity element which has been controlled generally to be as low as possible. However, according to the present<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> invention, it is possible to compensate for the deterioration amount of toughness due to P by making full use of the above-described toughness improvement effect by Zn addition. Thus, a remarkable effect of Zn addition, which is required for the toughness improvement, can be achieved by adjusting the amount of Zn addition with respect to the P content to be described below. As a result of this, a hot work tool steel of the present invention can permit a P content of not less than 0.005%. Sufficient toughness can be maintained even when the P content is preferably not less than 0.01 %, or more preferably not less than 0.02%.</p><heading id="h0013">- Zn/P: more than 0.5</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">In a hot work tool steel of the present invention, it is necessary to ensure an enough amount of Zn addition to allow sufficient toughness to be maintained even when not less than 0.005% of P is included. For that purpose, the adjustment of the amount of Zn addition with respect to the P content is needed. To be specific, sufficient toughness can be ensured by maintaining the value of Zn/P to be more than 0.5. Preferably, Zn/P is more than 0.55. It is noted that a Zn/P value more than 0.55 is also a preferable condition even when not less than 0.01 % of P, and further not less than 0.02% of P is included.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">To obtain a hot work tool steel satisfying the above-described relationship between P and Zn by a melting and casting process, there is a method of component adjustment suitable therefor. That is, if the chemical composition of molten steel at the time of casting is adjusted so as to include Zn as described above by various methods, a steel ingot of a hot work tool steel according to the present invention can be obtained by just casting the molten steel. However, metallic Zn is a volatile element having a low melting point, and is removed from the molten steel with passage of time. Therefore, for the amount of Zn to be maintained in the molten steel at the time of casting, it is effective to set a larger amount to the amount of Zn at the time of addition to the molten steel by taking account of the above-described amount of removal. However, for controlling the amount of Zn in the molten steel to adjust it at the time of casting to be an appropriate value for the present invention, an adding method which just takes into consideration the above-described amount of removal is poor in reproducibility and therefore it is difficult to achieve the appropriate value. Accordingly, in the present invention, Zn is added to the molten steel at a timing when the P content is fixed by adjusting the chemical composition of the molten steel to that of the hot work tool steel in advance, not by adjusting Zn at the same timing as for other additive elements, thereby making it possible to reduce the passage of time to subsequent casting and to suppress the variation of Zn/P ratio due to the evaporation of Zn, and<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> so on.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">That is, to be specific, the present invention includes a first step of obtaining a molten steel having a chemical composition of a hot work tool steel including not less than 0.005 mass% of P; a second step of adding Zn to the molten steel having the chemical composition of the hot work tool steel; and a third step of casting the above-described molten steel to which Zn has been added to obtain a steel ingot. In the method for producing a hot work tool steel, Zn is added in the second step such that the chemical composition of the steel ingot after casting in the third step becomes the hot work tool steel including Zn: more than 0.0025 to 0.025 mass% and P: not less than 0.005 mass%, with Zn/P being more than 0.5. The content of P included in the steel ingot after casting in the above-described third step is preferably not less than 0.01 mass%, and more preferably not less than 0.02 mass%. Each of the steps will be described below.</p><heading id="h0014">- First Step: a step of obtaining molten steel having a chemical composition of a hot work tool steel including not less than 0.005 mass% of P.</heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">By adjusting the chemical composition of the molten steel to be matched with that of the hot work tool steel in advance, the second step to be described later can be fully specialized to the adjustment of Zn content. Since it is possible to quickly change over to the casting in the third step to be described later after the addition of a predetermined amount of Zn, the Zn content of the steel ingot after casting can be appropriately adjusted with ease. It is noted that "to prepare molten steel having a chemical composition of a hot work tool steel" in the first step of the present invention means that a state of molten steel of a hot work tool steel which is adjusted to have various chemical compositions is obtained before the second step to be described later. The chemical composition at this time is preferably adjusted to the chemical composition of the target steel ingot. Further, at this time, if the chemical composition varies before and after the Zn addition depending on the kind (chemical composition) of the Zn source to be used for the next Zn addition, it is preferable to take this variation amount into consideration. Therefore, the first step is not limited to a treatment such as alloy addition to molten steel, and may be the work for preparing raw materials before melting for example. After melting, the molten steel may be subjected to various refining processing for removing inclusions and impurities. It is noted that the P content included in the molten steel obtained in the first step is preferably not less than 0.01 mass%, and more preferably not less than 0.02 mass%.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><heading id="h0015">- Second Step: a step of adding Zn to the molten steel of the hot work tool steel according to the first step.</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the present invention, it is important, as described above, to control the second step of adding Zn separately from the above-described first step. If Zn is added to the molten steel which is adjusted to have the chemical composition of a hot work tool steel in advance, it is easy to adjust the Zn content with respect to P, and it is possible to change over to the casting in the third step to be described later. It is noted that the second step of the present invention does not exclude processing for purposes other than for adding Zn. Therefore, at this time, if there is slight difference for any kind of element other than Zn in the chemical composition from that of the targeted steel ingot, an additional fine adjustment may be performed provided that new refining process is not conducted.</p><heading id="h0016">- Third Step: a step of casting the molten steel according to the second step to obtain a steel ingot.</heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">By casting the molten steel, which is subjected to the first and the second steps, to obtain a steel ingot, a hot work tool steel satisfying the chemical composition of the present invention is produced by melting.

Therefore, the object of the present invention is limited to hot work tool steels. A hot work tool steel refers to a steel having a chemical composition specified by, for example, JIS-G-4404, etc. Besides standard steel grades of JIS etc., hot work tool steels which have conventionally been proposed can be applied.
