There are a contact type and a plug type as a method for charging a battery for vehicle installation in the related art.</p><heading id="h0003">&lt;Related art 1: Contact type in a battery mount state&gt;</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">As a battery charging method in the related art in an electric vehicle (EV vehicle) such as a carrier that is used for the work in the yard, charging is performed by simply making front ends of a vehicle side terminal and a charger side terminal come into contact with each other (see Patent Document<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> 1).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In this case, in order to secure connection reliability, one terminal pushes the other terminal by the repulsion of a spring to make the terminals come into certain contact with each other. According to this battery charging method 1 in the related art, the battery has already been installed in the vehicle, and thus it is not necessary to make the battery disengaged from an in-vehicle electric device side connector. Therefore, as advantages, terminals rarely rub each other, and thus the lifespan of the battery terminal is not shortened. By contrast, as problems, the electric vehicle is stopping during charging and thus is not usable.</p><heading id="h0004">&lt;Related art 2: Plug type in a battery exchange method&gt;</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In order to solve a problem called shortening of the charge time (=stoppage time), there is a battery exchange method to take out a battery which has been discharged from an undercarriage of a vehicle and to replace the discharged battery by a battery which has been charged.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><figref idrefs="f0009">Figs. 9A and 9b</figref> are views explaining a battery exchange method in the related art. <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9A</figref> is a conceptual view of the battery exchange method, and <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9B</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating terminal shapes of connectors of respective devices. According to the battery exchange method as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9A</figref>, when a battery B1 for vehicle installation that is installed in a vehicle A comes to have been discharged, the battery B1 for vehicle installation that has been discharged is taken out from the vehicle A, and another battery B2 for vehicle installation which has already been charged is loaded on the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> vehicle A. Accordingly, since the charge time can be reduced, the stoppage time is with time only for connector connection, and thus the stoppage time can be greatly reduced.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the work of the meantime, a battery side connector terminal 20T which is the male terminal of a connector 20 of the battery B1 that has been discharged is taken off from the female terminal 100T of a vehicle side connector 100 that feeds in-vehicle electric devices 50 that are various motors such as power windows in the vehicle through a wire (electric wire), and then is put into a hollow part 100V of the female terminal 100T of a charger side connector 100 (that is, a connector for feeding from a charger 60 which supplies DC current that is obtained by rectifying an AC power AC to the wire W) outside the vehicle. On the other hand, another battery B2 for vehicle installation that has been charged is carried to the inside of the vehicle, and the battery side connector terminal 20T of the connector 20 of the battery B2 for vehicle installation is put into the hollow part 100V of the female terminal 100T of the vehicle side connector 100 that feeds the in-vehicle electric devices 50.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In this case, a connector housing 10 and the female terminal 100T of the vehicle side connector 100 have the same shapes as a connector housing 10 and the female terminal 100T of the charger side connector 100, respectively, and the battery side connector terminal 20T of the battery B1 or B2 for vehicle installation is taken off from the hollow part 100V of the female terminal 100T of one side connector 100, and then is put into the hollow part<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> 100V of the female terminal 100T of the other side connector 100.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the case of adopting such a battery exchange method, since the vehicle side connector is affected by vibration and dust during traveling of the vehicle, contacts may come off or dust may get in the contact type connector, and thus satisfactory reliability may not be achieved. Therefore, plug-type connector is generally used to achieve the secure connection between the connector terminals.</p><heading id="h0005">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0006">Patent Document</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">[Patent Document 1] <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPH515073A"><text>JP-A-H5-15073</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0007">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0008">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">As described above, in the related art, it is necessary to make a connector in which in order to secure certain contact between contacts of a vehicle side connector, a plug-type terminal is locked in and fixed to the inside of a connector housing, and a locking structure with the terminal is provided in the connector housing.</p><heading id="h0009">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> In order to solve the above-described problems, according to the present invention, the following configuration may be provided.
<ol><li>(1) A connector including a connector housing and a connector terminal accommodated in the connector housing to be connected to a battery for vehicle installation,<br/>
wherein the connector terminal has one end at which a terminal connection portion, which is connected to a battery side connector terminal that is installed in the connector housing of the battery for vehicle installation, is installed, and the other end at which a wire connection portion, which is connected to a wire that is drawn from the rear side of the connector housing, is installed, wherein a flange portion that extends outwardly of the connector terminal is installed between the terminal connection portion and the wire connection portion,<br/>
wherein the connector housing includes a wire connection portion accommodation portion which is successively formed in an opening into which the connector terminal is inserted from the rear side, has a diameter that is substantially equal to a diameter of the flange portion, and is adapted to accommodate the wire connection portion, and a terminal connection portion accommodation potion which is installed forward than the wire connection portion accommodation portion, has a diameter that is smaller than a diameter of the wire connection portion, and is adapted to accommodate the terminal connection portion, and<br/>
wherein a rear holder, in which a through-hole into which a part of the wire connection portion is adapted to be penetratingly inserted is formed, is installed to cover the opening of the connector housing, and the part of the wire connection portion is penetratingly inserted into the through-hole of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> rear holder to form an accommodation space in which a pipe-shaped spacer or a spring, into which the wire connection portion is penetratingly inserted, is adapted to be disposed.</li></ol></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the connector having the above-described configuration, since the accommodation space that accommodates the spacer or the spring is provided between the flange and the rear holder, the connector terminal can be fixed to the inside of the connector housing by the spacer, and thus it is not necessary to lock and fix the connector terminal inside the connector housing. Further, since the combination of the connector terminal having the concave shape portion at the front end of the terminal connection portion and the spring can be applied to the charger side connector that forces the concave shape portion toward the battery for vehicle installation, and the combination of the connector terminal having the female terminal, into which the battery side connector terminal is inserted, at the front end of the terminal connection portion and the spacer can be applied to the vehicle side connector that is fitted with the battery for vehicle installation, the connectors can be commonized.</p><heading id="h0010">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1A and 1 B</figref> are

At this time, although the vehicle side connector terminal 12 of the vehicle side connector 11 is pushed upward, the flange portion 12F (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref>) becomes in contact with the rear holder H through the spacer S, and thus the vehicle side connector terminal 12 does not move upward. Accordingly, the battery side connector terminal 20T of the battery side connector 20 is inserted and fitted into the vehicle side connector terminal 12 to complete the insertion.</p><heading id="h0018">&lt;Insertion of charger side connector 13&gt;</heading><p id="p0031" num="0031">In <figref idrefs="f0006 f0007 f0008">Figs. 6A to 8C</figref>, in the case of inserting the battery side connector 20 into the charger side connector 13, the charger side connector 13 is brought down from right above the battery side connector 20 toward the battery side connector 20, and the front end of the battery side connector terminal 20T of the battery side connector 20 becomes in contact with and is inserted into the concave portion 14K formed at the front end of the terminal connection portion 14S (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3A</figref>) of the charger side connector terminal 14 of the charger side<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> connector 13 while pressing the concave portion 14K.

Since the charger side is not affected by vibration and dust during traveling of the vehicle, it is not necessary to make the terminal a plug type, and it is sufficient if the front end of the battery side connector terminal 20T is inserted into and becomes in contact with the concave portion 14K of the charger side connector terminal 14. Accordingly, since the opportunity when the terminals rub when the battery is installed in the vehicle or when the battery is removed from the vehicle is reduced to half, the state of the terminal surface is kept well for a long time that is double the time in the related art, and thus contacts may come off or dust may get in the contact type connector, and thus poor contact is hard to happen.</p><heading id="h0019">&lt;Related technique: combination of plug type connector and contact type connector in the battery exchange method&gt;</heading><p id="p0032" num="0032">Here, as the related technique, it has been considered that the vehicle side connector being carried adopts the plug type to secure the certain contact between the terminals, and the charger side connector that is put outside the vehicle adopts the contact type connector with a little rubbing.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">According to the battery exchange method of the related technique, as<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1 A</figref>, when a battery B1 for vehicle installation that is installed in a vehicle A comes to have been discharged, the battery B1 for vehicle installation that has been discharged is taken out from the vehicle A, and another battery B2 for vehicle installation which has already been charged is loaded on the vehicle A. Accordingly, the charge time can be reduced, and thus the stoppage time can be greatly reduced. According to the work of the meantime, the battery side connector terminal 20T of the connector 20 of the battery B1 for vehicle installation that has been discharged is taken off from the hollow part 12V of the vehicle side connector terminal 12 that is the female terminal of the vehicle side connector 11, and then is put "in contact with" the concave portion 14K of the charger side connector terminal 14 of the charger type connector 13 outside the vehicle.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">According to this related technique, unlike the related art of <figref idrefs="f0009">Figs. 9A and 9B</figref>, it is assumed that the vehicle side connector terminal 12 of the vehicle side connector 11 and the charger side connector terminal 14 of the charger side connector 13 are separated from each other. That is, the vehicle side connector terminal 12 of the vehicle side connector 11 is of a plug type same as the female terminal 100T of the connector 100 (see <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9B</figref>) in the related art, and has a terminal lock structure such as a typical lock structure so that the female terminal 100T does not retreat during the insertion operation thereof. In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1B</figref>, a stepped portion is provided on the boundary between the wire connection portion 12C of the vehicle side connector terminal 12 and the terminal connection portion 12S, and this stepped portion is locked with a stepped portion formed on the inner wall of the connector housing 10 to make the retreatment thereof impossible. Through this, the charger side connector<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> terminal 14 of the charger side connector 13 applies a regular force to the counterpart terminal side since the spring C is inserted into the circumference of the wire connection portion 14C to be accommodated in the housing 10, and one end of the spring C becomes in contact with the inner wall of the housing. Further, the lower part of the charger side connector terminal 14 forms the concave portion 14K at the front end of the terminal connection portion 14S formed on the cylindrical portion, and the concave portion 14K is shaped as if the front end portion of the battery side connector terminal 20T of the battery side connector 20 becomes in contact with the concave portion 14K. Further, if the concave portion 14K of the terminal connection portion 14S is pressed by the front portion of the battery side connector terminal 20T of the battery side connector 20 during the insertion operation thereof, the charger side connector terminal 14 comes to retreat.</p><heading id="h0020">&lt;Advantages of the related technique&gt;</heading><p id="p0035" num="0035">In <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1B</figref>, if the battery side connector terminal 20T of the battery B1 for vehicle installation that has been discharged is taken off from the hollow part 12V of the vehicle side connector terminal 12 of the vehicle side connector 11 on the side of the in-vehicle electric devices 50 and then is pushed toward the concave portion 14K of the charger side connector terminal 14 of the charger side connector 13 outside the vehicle, the charge side connector terminal 14 is pushed by the battery side connector terminal 20T into the inside of the charger side connector 13 to be urged by the spring C, the battery side connector terminal 20T of the battery side connector 20 becomes in contact with the concave portion 14K of the charger side connector terminal 14 of the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> charger side connector 13 in a state where the both housings are completely fitted into each other to start the charging.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">As described above, since the front end of the battery side connector terminal 20T of the battery side connector 20 is in a simple contact state with the concave portion 14K of the charger side connector terminal 14 through pressing thereof, but is not of the plug type in the related art that the terminals strongly rub each other, promotion of abrasion of the connector terminal and abrasion of the terminal surface treatment can be avoided, and the lifespan of the terminal is prolonged for double soon in comparison to that in the related art.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Further, since the battery is outside of the vehicle during charging by this contact type, no vibration occurs, and there is not the fear that dust invades the contact portion since the charge environment is regulated well.</p><heading id="h0021">&lt;Problems of related technique&gt;</heading><p id="p0038" num="0038">In the related technique as described above, the plug connector is used as the vehicle side connector in order to secure certain contact between the terminals, and the contact type connector with a little rubbing is used as the charger side connector. Here, according to the vehicle side connector that is the plug type connector, there is the need that the plug type terminal is locked in and fixed to the inside of the connector housing, and thus the vehicle side connector that is completed by locking and fixing the terminal is unable to be converted into the charger side connector in which the spring is provided to move the terminal. Accordingly, it is necessary to separately make a connector with a terminal locking structure.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><heading id="h0022">&lt;Conclusion&gt;</heading><p id="p0039" num="0039">As described above, according to an embodiment of the present invention, by diverting the technique in the related art and securing reliability and by changing the combination to match the use terms, the use terms of the battery can be extended.
