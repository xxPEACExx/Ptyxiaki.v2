In addition, in another damper with variable damping force which has been proposed (for example, in Patent document 2), a valve element which is arranged in a flow channel formed in a piston contained in a cylinder is opened or closed by electromagnetic attractive force generated by an electromagnetic solenoid so as to change the damping force of the damper.</p><heading id="h0003">Prior art documents</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent documents</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003"><ul><li>Patent document 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPH09236147B"><text>H09-236147</text></patcit></li><li>Patent document 2: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2008275126A"><text>2008-275126</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, since the valve element in the damper with variable damping force disclosed in Patent document 1 is opened or closed by the electromagnetic solenoid actuator, the construction of the damper with variable damping force disclosed in Patent document 1 is complicated, and the number of the constituent parts of the damper with variable damping force disclosed in Patent document 1 becomes large. Therefore, the manufacturing cost of the damper with variable damping force disclosed in Patent document 1 becomes high.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">On the other hand, in the damper with variable damping force disclosed in Patent document 2, the valve element is directly brought into contact by the electromagnetic solenoid,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the construction of the damper with variable damping force disclosed in Patent document 2 is simple, and the number of the constituent parts of the damper with variable damping force disclosed in Patent document 2 is small. Therefore, the manufacturing cost of the damper with variable damping force disclosed in Patent document 2 can be lowered. However, the electromagnetic force (attractive force) generated by the electromagnetic solenoid is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. Therefore, when the valve opens and the valve element comes apart from the electromagnetic solenoid by a certain distance, the effect of the electromagnetic force generated by the electromagnetic solenoid rapidly attenuates, so that there is a possibility that great power consumption is needed for generation of electromagnetic force which is necessary for attracting the valve element and closing the valve.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In view of above, the object of the present invention is to provide a damper with variable damping force which has a simple structure and can suppress the power consumption.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">An aspect of the present invention provides a damper with variable damping force comprising:
<ul><li>an inner cylinder which defines an inner chamber therein, where a piston is in slidable contact with the inner chamber;</li><li>an outer cylinder which is arranged outside the inner cylinder and defines a reservoir chamber between the inner cylinder and the outer cylinder; and</li><li>a damping-force control device which controls a damping force by controlling a flow rate of an operating oil between the inner chamber and the reservoir chamber;</li><li>wherein</li><li>the damping-force control device includes,</li><li>a valve seat which is formed to externally project from the outer cylinder, and in which an opening for a first communicating channel connected to the inner chamber and an opening for a second communicating channel connected to the reservoir chamber are formed,</li><li>a valve element which opens and closes on the valve seat by electromagnetic force, and controls a flow of the operating oil between the first communicating channel and the second communicating channel, and</li><li>a cap which defines a variable pressure chamber between the valve seat and the valve element, and integrally holds the valve element and the valve seat, where the variable pressure chamber can be connected to the first communicating channel and the second communicating channel.</li></ul></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the present invention, the damper with variable damping force includes the inner and outer cylinders, the piston, the reservoir chamber, and the damping-force control<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> device which includes the valve seat, the valve element, and the cap. Therefore, the damping-force control device and the damper with variable damping force can be constructed to have a simple structure. In addition, since the number of parts can be reduced, the manufacturing cost is lowered.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In addition, in the state in which the valve element is opened, the valve element comes into contact with the cap when the extent of opening of the valve element increases. Therefore, the increase in the extent of opening can be suppressed, and the electromagnetic solenoid can attract the valve element and close the valve even when the electromagnetic force is small. Consequently, the power consumption can be reduced.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In addition, preferably the first communicating channel communicates the second communicating channel through an opening of the valve element in a state in which the valve element is open, and an biasing force which impels the valve element to a direction of closing the valve element is exerted on the valve element by a differential pressure generated between a front side and a back side of the valve element when the operating oil flows.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the case where the damper with variable damping force has the above feature, the flow channel from the first communication channel to the second communication channel in the variable pressure chamber is formed to pass the side of the valve element opposite to the valve seat, and the operating oil flowing through the flow channel applies to the valve element a pressure in a direction of closing the valve. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the valve element from coming apart from the electromagnetic solenoid, and thus close the valve with a small electromagnetic force. Consequently, the power consumption can be reduced.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In addition, preferably, the valve element comprises,
<ul><li>a first through hole arranged in a vicinity of an open and close portion which opens and closes the opening for the first communicating channel,</li><li>a support portion which supports the open and close portion in a part of an outer peripheral portion of the valve seat in such a manner that the open and close portion can be freely opened and closed, and</li><li>a second through hole arranged to overlap a part of the opening for the second communicating channel. Preferably, the first through hole is more apart from the support portion than the second through hole.</li></ul></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the case where the damper with variable damping force has the above feature, a flow channel of a flow from the opening for the first communicating channel through the first hole and the side of the valve element opposite to the valve seat can be formed in the variable pressure chamber. This flow channel further passes through the second hole and reaches the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> opening for the second communicating channel. Since the first hole is more apart from the support portion than the second hole, the portion of the valve element in the vicinity of the second hole is more close to the valve seat than the portion of the valve element in the vicinity of the first hole. Therefore, when the operating oil flows from the variable pressure chamber to the second communicating channel, the damping force is generated by the second hole, which is close to the valve seat (the opening for the second communicating channel). At this time, the inner pressure on the side of the valve element opposite to the valve seat in the variable pressure chamber becomes higher than the inner pressure in the second communicating channel (on the valve seat side of the valve element in the variable pressure chamber), so that a force in the direction of closing the valve is generated.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In addition, preferably, the damper with variable damping force, further comprises a spacer arranged between the valve element and the valve seat to provide an intermediate channel through which the first communicating channel communicates with the second communicating channel without passing through the valve element.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the case where the damper with variable damping force has the above feature, even when a rapid stroke or the like occurs, it is possible to suppress the driving force of the valve element and prevent a rapid rise of the damping force.</p><heading id="h0008">Advantageous Effect of Invention</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the present invention, there is provided a damper with variable damping force which has a simple structure and can suppress the power consumption.</p><heading id="h0009">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a damper with variable damping force according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a damping-force control device arranged in the damper with variable damping force according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a (lateral) cross-sectional view viewed in an A-A direction indicated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is a (lateral) cross-sectional view viewed in a B-B direction indicated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are a longitudinal cross-sectional view and a lateral cross-sectional view of the damping-force control device in the state in which a valve element is open, and indicate flow channels from a first communicating channel to a second communicating channel in a variable pressure chamber.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a damping-force control device which<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> is arranged in a damper with variable damping force according to a second embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a damping-force control device which is arranged in a damper with variable damping force according to a third embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8</figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a damping-force control device which is arranged in a damper with variable damping force according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 9</figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a damping-force control device which is arranged in a damper with variable damping force according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 10</figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a damping-force control device which is arranged in a damper with variable damping force according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 11</figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a damping-force control device which is arranged in a damper with variable damping force according to a seventh embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 12</figref> is a lateral cross-sectional view of a damping-force control device which is arranged in a damper with variable damping force according to an eighth embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0012">FIG. 13</figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a damping-force control device which is arranged in a damper with variable damping force according to a ninth embodiment of the present invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">Description of Embodiments</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">Hereinbelow, the embodiments of the present invention are explained in detail below with reference to drawings when necessary.

In the damper 1 with variable damping force, a piston 3 is slidably fitted into a cylinder 2, i.e., the piston 3 is in slidable contact with the cylinder 2, where the cylinder 2 is filled with an operating oil 5. An upper chamber (inner chamber) 2a is defined by the cylinder 2 and the piston 3, and an end of a piston rod 3a is connected to the piston 3. The piston rod 3a extends across the upper chamber 2a and passes through an upper end portion of the cylinder 2 and a buffer member 2d. The piston rod<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> 3a is slidably fitted into the upper end portion of the cylinder 2 and the buffer member 2d without leakage of the operating oil 5 outside. A bottom valve 4 is arranged below the piston 3 in the cylinder 2. A check valve 4a is arranged in the bottom valve 4. The check valve 4a allows the operating oil 5 to flow from a reservoir chamber 7 through a through hole 2f and a lower chamber 2c to a middle chamber 2b, and does not allow the operating oil 5 to flow from the middle chamber 2b to the reservoir chamber 7. Alternatively, the bottom valve 4 (the check valve 4a) may be arranged at the through hole 2f. In this case, no partition exists between the lower chamber 2c and the middle chamber 2b, so that one of the lower chamber 2c and the middle chamber 2b can be omitted. In addition, a check valve 3b is arranged in the piston 3. The check valve 3b allows the operating oil 5 to flow from the middle chamber 2b to the upper chamber (inner chamber) 2a, and does not allow the operating oil 5 to flow from the upper chamber (inner chamber) 2a to the middle chamber 2b.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">An outer cylinder 8 is arranged outside the cylinder 2. The reservoir chamber 7 is defined by the cylinder 2 and the outer cylinder 8. The reservoir chamber 7 is filled with the operating oil 5 and a gas. The reservoir chamber 7 is connected to the middle chamber 2b through the bottom valve 4, which is arranged in the lower portion of the cylinder 2.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Further, a through hole 2e is arranged in the upper portion of the cylinder 2. The upper chamber (inner chamber) 2a is connected to an upper portion of an intermediate oil channel 6 through the through hole 2e. The intermediate oil channel 6 is arranged outside the cylinder 2 inside the outer cylinder 8 and defined by a portion of the side wall of the cylinder 2. The intermediate oil channel 6 is arranged along the axis direction of the cylinder 2, and the lower portion of the intermediate oil channel 6 is connected to a damping-force control device 9.

The damping-force control device 9 is connected to the upper chamber (inner chamber) 2a through the intermediate oil channel 6, and to the reservoir chamber 7. The damping-force control device 9 controls the damping force generated by the damper 1 with variable damping force, by controlling the flow rate of the operating oil 5 through the intermediate oil channel 6, i.e., by controlling the flow rate of the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> operating oil 5 flowing from the intermediate oil channel 6 into the damping-force control device 9.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">When the piston rod 3a is drawn out of the cylinder 2 in the damper 1 with variable damping force, the piston 3 is raised with the piston rod 3a, and the volume of the upper chamber (inner chamber) 2a is reduced.

Further, the operating oil 5 flows out of the damping-force control device 9 to the reservoir chamber 7, so that the liquid level of the operating oil 5 in the reservoir chamber 7 is raised, and the gas above the liquid level is compressed.

In other words, both when the piston rod 3a is drawn out of the cylinder 2 and when the piston rod 3a is pushed into the cylinder 2, the operating oil 5 in the damping-force control device 9 always unidirectionally flows in a direction from the intermediate oil channel 6 into the damping-force control device 9 and from the damping-force control device 9 to the reservoir chamber 7.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of the damping-force control device 9 arranged in the damper with variable damping force according to the first embodiment of the present invention. The damping-force control device 9 includes a valve seat 11 having a cylindrical post shape. An electromagnetic solenoid 14 is embedded in the valve seat 11 along the circular periphery of the cylindrical post shape of the valve seat 11. It is preferable that a soft magnetic material exhibiting a low hysteresis (having a small coercive force) and having a great magnetic permeability, such as soft iron, be used in the valve seat 11. A first communicating channel 12 and a second communicating channel 13 are formed in the valve seat 11. The first communicating channel 12 and the second communicating channel 13 are arranged apart from each other, and each penetrate the valve seat 11. The first communicating channel 12 is connected, on the outer cylinder 8 side, to the intermediate oil channel 6 (as<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) and further to the upper chamber (inner chamber) 2a (as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>), so that the operating oil 5 flows from the outer cylinder 8 side into the damping-force control device 9. The second communicating channel 13 is connected, on the outer cylinder 8 side, to the reservoir chamber 7 (as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>), so that the operating oil 5 flows out of the damping-force control device 9 to the outer cylinder 8 side (i.e., to the reservoir chamber 7).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The side of the valve seat 11 opposite to the outer cylinder 8 is approximately flat, and a valve element 15 having an approximately flat shape is arranged on the side of the valve seat 11 opposite to the outer cylinder 8. An opening (liquid outlet) 12a of the first communicating channel 12 and an opening (liquid inlet) 13a of the second communicating channel 13 are arranged on the approximately flat surface of the valve seat 11 located opposite to the outer cylinder 8. The outer peripheral portion of the valve element 15 is held between a step portion 17a of a cap 17 and the valve seat 11. It is preferable that a soft magnetic material exhibiting a low hysteresis (having a small coercive force) and having a great magnetic permeability, such as soft iron, be used in the valve element 15 as in the valve seat 11. In the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the valve element 15 is formed by laminating four plates. Alternatively, the number of plate(s) constituting the valve element 15 may be other than four. A variable pressure chamber 16 is arranged on the side of the valve element 15 opposite to the valve seat 11. The variable pressure chamber 16 is defined by the cap 17 and the valve element 15 (or the valve seat 11). In particular, when the variable pressure chamber 16 is regarded to be defined by the cap 17 and the valve seat 11, the valve element 15 can be regarded to be contained in the variable pressure chamber 16, and the variable pressure chamber 16 can be regarded to be connected to the first communicating channel 12 and the second communicating channel 13. The cap 17 limits the maximum opening of the valve element 15. When the opening of the valve element 15 increases, a portion of the valve element 15 comes more apart from the valve seat 11, and approaches the cap 17. When the opening of the valve element 15 further increases, the portion of the valve element 15 comes into contact with the cap 17, and the opening of the valve element 15 does not further increase. An oil packing 18 is arranged between the side surface of the valve seat 11 and the cap 17, and the variable pressure chamber 16 is sealed up by the cap 17 in such a manner that the operating oil 5 in the variable pressure chamber 16 does not externally leak even when the operating oil 5 in the variable pressure chamber 16 is pressurized. It is preferable that a nonmagnetic material such as resin or aluminum be used in the cap 17 for preventing exertion of an attractive force on the valve element 15. The cap 17 is coupled to the outer periphery of the valve seat 11 by fitting, press fitting, or the like and held on the outer periphery of the valve seat 11. In order that the step portion 17a in the cap 17 can exert sufficient holding force on the outer peripheral portion of the valve element 15, the cap 17 and the seat face of the valve seat 11 are formed to be so close to each other that compressive force is exerted on the valve element 15.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028"><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a state in which the valve element 15 is closed. Current flows in the electromagnetic solenoid 14 and electromagnetic force (attractive force) generated by the electromagnetic solenoid 14 and the valve seat 11 is exerted on the valve element 15, so that the valve element 15 is attracted by the electromagnetic solenoid 14 and the valve seat 11 and attracted with contact with the valve seat 11. Therefore, the opening (liquid outlet) 12a of the first communicating channel 12 is closed by an open/close portion 15a in the valve element 15, i.e., the opening (liquid outlet) 12a is closed. In addition, first through holes 15c penetrating the valve element 15 are arranged at positions spaced from and close to the open/close portion 15a (in a vicinity of the opening (liquid outlet) 12a).

However, the cross-sectional areas of the first and second communicating channels 12 and 13 need not be equal. For example, the cross-sectional area of the second communicating channel 13 (the aperture area of the opening 13a in the second communicating channel 13) may be greater than the cross-sectional area of the first communicating channel 12 (the aperture area of the opening 12a in the first communicating channel 12). In this case, when the flow rate is high, increase in the conduit resistance of the second communicating channel 13 can be suppressed, and therefore the damping force can be reduced (since the piston rod 3a can be easily displaced with respect to the cylinder 2).</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is a (lateral) cross-sectional view of the B-B cross section indicated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.

The aperture area of the second through holes 15d is smaller than the aperture area of the opening 13a of the second communicating channel 13.

The first through holes 15c are more apart from the support portion 15b than the second through holes 15d. The valve element 15 can be opened or closed on the valve seat 11 by the electromagnetic solenoid 14, so that open/close control of the opening 12a of the first communicating channel 12 can be performed.

In the state in which the valve element 15 is open, a flow channel F1 extending from the opening (liquid outlet) 12a of the first communicating channel 12 through the first through holes 15c and the side of the valve element 15 opposite to the valve seat 11 can be formed in the variable pressure chamber 16. The flow channel F1 further passes through the second through holes 15d and reaches the opening (liquid inlet) 13a of the second communicating channel 13. Since the second through holes 15d are nearer to the support portion 15b than the first through holes 15c, the portion of the valve element 15 in the vicinity of the second through holes 15d is closer to the valve seat 11 than the portion of the valve element 15 in the vicinity of the first through holes 15c in the state in which the valve element 15 is open. In addition, the aperture area of the second through holes 15d is smaller than the aperture area of the first through holes 15c. Therefore, when the operating oil 5 (illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) flows from the variable pressure chamber 16 to the second communicating channel 13, the damping force is generated by the second through holes 15d, which is close to the valve seat 11 (the opening 13a of the second communicating channel 13). At this time, the pressure of the operating oil 5 is approximately equally applied to the valve seat 11 side (front side) of the valve element 15 and the opposite side (back side) of the valve element 15. Therefore, the valve element 15 is prevented from coming apart from the electromagnetic solenoid 14 and the valve seat 11, so that the electromagnetic solenoid 14 can attract and close the valve element 15 even with a small electromagnetic force.
