The bracket is attached to a hanger so as to be capable of rotatable about an axis whose axial direction is as the same direction of the axial direction of a spool. When a retractor base is tilted about an axis whose axial direction is as the same axial direction of the spool axial direction, the bracket accordingly rotates relative to the retractor base, as the bracket attempts to maintain the same attitude as in a state prior to the retractor base rotating.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The bracket is configured so as to be capable of rotating with respect to the retractor base such as described above. Accordingly, the angle of incline of the face on which the inertia mass body is placed is made small such that the inertia mass body rolls in the event of the bracket rotating at a time of sudden vehicle deceleration. However, the bracket does not rotate in the axial direction of rotation thereof (mainly in the vehicle left-right direction). The inertia mass body accordingly readily rolls in the axial direction of rotation of the bracket, resulting in a difference in rolling sensitivities of the inertia mass body between in the rotation axial direction and in the direction orthogonal to the rotation axial direction (mainly in the vehicle front-rear direction).</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">In consideration of the above circumstances, the present invention is to obtain a webbing take-up device capable of reducing the difference in rolling sensitivities of an inertia mass body between in an axial direction of rotation of an acceleration sensor with respect to a device main body and in a direction orthogonal to the axial direction of rotation.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A webbing take-up device according to a first aspect of the present invention includes: a device main body comprising a spool, the spool taking up a webbing from a base end side thereof in a webbing length direction onto an outer peripheral portion of the spool by<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> rotating in a take-up direction that is one direction about a center axis of the spool; an acceleration detection section that is provided at the device main body so as to be capable of rotating with respect to the device main body about an axis whose axial direction is a specific direction such that, accompanying tilting of the device main body, the acceleration detection section maintains the same orientation as orientation of the acceleration detection section in a state prior to the device main body tilting, a placement face, formed in a concave shape that is open upwards, being formed at the acceleration detection section, a spherical shaped inertia mass body being placed on the placement face, the inertia mass body rolling on the placement face due to inertia at a time of a sudden vehicle deceleration, the placement face being configured to include a general face and a restriction face, the general face being a shape that an inner peripheral profile is open upwards, the restriction face being formed on at least one side further than a center of the placement face in a vehicle left-right direction as seen in plan view from an open direction side of the placement face, an angle of incline, with respect to a horizontal direction, of the restriction face being larger than an angle of incline, with respect to the horizontal direction, of the general face, such that rolling of the inertia mass body on the placement face in the vehicle left-right direction is restricted to a greater extent than rolling of the inertia mass body on the placement face in a vehicle front-rear direction; and a lock section that is actuated by the spool rotating in a pull-out direction that is the opposite direction from the take-up direction in a state in which the inertia mass body of the acceleration detection section rolls on the placement face, rotation of the spool in the pull-out direction being restricted by actuation of the lock section.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the webbing take-up device of the first aspect, the inertia mass body of the acceleration detection section moves across on the placement face under inertia at a time of a sudden vehicle deceleration in a state in which the webbing has been pulled out from the spool of the device main body and is being worn by an occupant. In this state, when the body of the occupant, attempting to move under inertia towards the vehicle front, pulls the webbing and rotates the spool in the pull-out direction, the lock section is actuated and rotation of the spool in the pull-out direction is restricted. The webbing is accordingly restricted from being pulled out from the spool, the webbing effectively restraining the body of the occupant that is attempting to move towards the vehicle front under inertia.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the present webbing take-up device, when the device main body tilts accompanying tilting (reclining) of the vehicle seat back, the acceleration detection section rotates with respect to the device main body about a shaft portion of the acceleration detection section such that it attempts to maintain its attitude prior to tilting of the device main body. There is accordingly no change to the attitude of the acceleration detection section, or any<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> such change in attitude is small, even when the device main body tilts as described above. The acceleration detection section can accordingly be made to function similarly to prior to tilting, even when the device main body has tilted.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Note that the inner peripheral profile of the general face of the placement face is configured in a shape that is open upwards. When vehicle acceleration (deceleration) exceeds a specific amount during deceleration of the vehicle, the inertia mass body accordingly rises up as it rolls and moves across an inclined face of the general face. A lock mechanism is actuated when the spool rotates in the pull-out direction in this state.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The restriction face(s) is formed at the placement face at least one vehicle left-right direction side with respect to the center of the placement face as seen in the plan view. The angle of incline of the restriction face(s) with respect to the horizontal direction is larger than the angle of incline of the general face with respect to the horizontal direction. The inertia mass body is accordingly suppressed from rolling towards the restriction face side(s) since the inertia mass body has to rise up the restriction face(s) with a larger angle of incline than the general face in order to roll up to the restriction face side(s).</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The inertia mass body accordingly rolls less readily in the vehicle left-right direction than in the vehicle front-rear direction. In other words, the sensitivity (ease of rolling) of the inertia mass body in event of a sudden vehicle deceleration is greater (the inertia mass body rolls more readily) in the vehicle front-rear direction than in the vehicle left-right direction. Accordingly, in event of a sudden vehicle deceleration, in a case in which the acceleration detection section has rotated about the axis whose axial direction is in the vehicle left-right direction (in this case, the inertia mass body rolls less readily in the vehicle front-rear direction, on the other hand, rolls readily in the vehicle left-right direction), the sensitivity of the inertia mass body in the vehicle front-rear direction can be made substantially the same as the sensitivity of the inertia mass body in the vehicle left-right direction, this being different to the direction of rotating of the acceleration detection section.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A webbing take-up device according to a second aspect of the present invention is the first aspect of the present invention wherein: the restriction faces are formed on both sides further than the center of the placement face in the vehicle left-right direction as seen in the plan view; the restriction faces are configured as faces that are inclined towards the center side of the placement face as seen in the plan view from the open side of the placement face; and the restriction faces are set such that, in a state in which the inertia mass body is placed at the center of the placement face as seen in the plan view, the inertia mass body contacts the general face at a lower side than the restriction faces.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the webbing take-up device of the second aspect, the restriction faces are formed<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> on both the plan view left and right sides with respect to the center of the placement face. Here, the restriction faces are configured as faces that are inclined towards the center side of the placement face as seen in the plan view from the open side of the placement face, and the restriction faces are set such that, in a state in which the inertia mass body is placed at the center of the placement face as seen in the plan view, the inertia mass body contacts the general face at a lower side than the restriction faces.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the aspects, the general face has preferably a circular cone shape. Here, since the general face has a circular cone shape, the contact portion between the spherical shaped inertia mass body and the general face is a circular ring shape. Unintended movement of the inertia mass body can accordingly be suppressed.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the above aspects, it is possible that the restriction face(s) is (are) flat face(s).</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As described above, the webbing take-up device according to the present invention is capable of reducing the difference in rolling sensitivities of an inertia mass body between in the rotating axial direction of an acceleration sensor with respect to a device main body, and in a direction orthogonal to the rotating axial direction.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">Embodiments of the invention will be described in detail with reference to the following figures, wherein:

As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the webbing take-up device 10 includes a device main body 12. The device main body 12 is provided with a frame 14. The frame 14 is provided<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> inside a seat back configuring a vehicle seat, and is integrally fastened and fixed for example to a frame (seat back framework) of the seat back, by for example bolts.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The frame 14 includes a pair of leg plates 16 and 18. The leg plates 16 and 18 are respectively formed in plate shapes with thickness direction oriented along the seat back width direction, and face each other in the seat back width direction. A spool 20 is provided between the leg plate 16 and the leg plate 18. The spool 20 is configured as a hollow shaft member whose axial direction is oriented in the facing direction of the leg plate 16 and the leg plate 18.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A base end side in a length direction of a webbing 22 is anchored to the spool 20. The webbing 22 is formed in an elongated belt shape, with the webbing 22 width direction being along the spool 20 axial direction. The webbing 22 is taken up and stored on an outer peripheral portion of the spool 20 from the length direction base end side of the webbing 22 when the spool 20 rotates in a take-up direction that is one direction about the spool 20 axial center. When the leading end side of the webbing 22 is pulled, the webbing 22 that is taken up on the spool 20 is pulled out, and the spool 20 rotates in a pull-out direction that is the opposite direction to the take-up direction.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A spring case 26 is attached to the leg plate 18 at the outside of the leg plate 18 (on the opposite side of the leg plate 18 to the leg plate 16). A spiral spring serving as a spool biasing member is housed inside the spring case 26. A spiral direction outside end of the spiral spring is anchored to the spring case 26, and the spiral direction inside end of the spiral spring is directly or indirectly anchored to a leg plate 18 side end portion of the spool 20 that passes through the leg plate 18 and enters inside the spring case 26. When the spool 20 is rotated in the pull-out direction, the spiral spring is wound tighter and biases the spool 20 in the take-up direction.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A pawl housing portion 36 is formed to a leg plate 16 side portion of the spool 20 so to be open at the outer peripheral face of the spool 20. A lock pawl 38 is provided inside the pawl housing portion 36. The portion of the spool 20 at which the pawl housing portion 36 is formed penetrates a ratchet hole 40 formed in the leg plate 16, when a portion of the lock pawl 38 comes out from the pawl housing portion 36, a ratchet teeth formed at a leading end side of the lock pawl 38 mesh with ratchet teeth of the ratchet hole 40. Rotation of the spool 20 in the pull-out direction is accordingly restricted.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A sensor holder 52 is attached to the leg plate 16 at the leg plate 16 outside (on the opposite side of the leg plate 16 to the leg plate 18). The sensor holder 52 is formed in a bottomed shape such that a portion of the sensor holder 52 is open towards the leg plate 16 side, with a V gear 54 provided inside the sensor holder 52. A shaft portion 56<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> corresponding to the V gear 54 extends from the spool 20 towards the sensor holder 52 side. The shaft portion 56 is provided coaxially to the spool 20, and the V gear 54 is rotatably supported on the shaft portion 56.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The V gear 54 is provided with a spring, not shown in the drawings.

When the V pawl 180 rotates in this manner, the engagement claw 186 accordingly moves upwards, meshing with the ratchet teeth formed to the outer peripheral portion of the V gear 54.

When such relative rotation occurs between the V gear 54 and the spool 20, the lock pawl 38 moves such that a portion of the lock pawl 38 projects out from the pawl housing portion 36 that is formed at the spool 20, and ratchet teeth at the leading end side of the lock pawl 38 thereby meshes with the ratchet teeth of the ratchet hole 40 formed at the leg plate 16.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Rotation of the spool 20 in the pull-out direction is thus restricted due to the ratchet teeth of the lock pawl 38 meshing with the ratchet teeth of the ratchet hole 40.

The device main body 12 of the webbing take-up device 10 tilts together with the seat back, however the sensor housing 92 of the acceleration sensor 72 rotates relative to the hanger 74 (namely the device main body 12) as the sensor housing 92 attempts to maintain the same attitude as the attitude in a state prior to the device<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> main body 12 reclining.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Accordingly, even when the device main body 12 tilts, from a state illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, the attitude (orientation) of the sensor housing 92 of the acceleration sensor 72 does not change, with the opening direction of the placement face 96 being maintained to direct upwards.

From this state, in order for the sensor ball 110 to roll further along the axial direction of the rotating shafts 142 and 152, the sensor ball 110 has to rise up the restriction face 100 or the restriction face 102 that respectively have a larger angle of incline than angle of incline of the general face 98.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">On the other hand, in order for the sensor ball 110 to roll along the direction orthogonal to the axial direction of the rotating shafts 142 and 152 as seen in plan view, the sensor ball 110 only has to roll over the general face 98.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">For example at the time of sudden vehicle deceleration, the sensor housing 92 rotates (swings) about the rotating shafts 142 and 152 under inertia.

However, the sensor ball 110 rolls readily along the axial direction of the rotating shafts 142 and 152 even in this case, since the sensor housing 92 does not rotate (swing) towards the axial direction of the rotating shafts 142 and 152.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">As explained above, the present exemplary embodiment is therefore configured with a structure such that the sensor ball 110 less readily rolls along the axial direction of the rotating shafts 142 and 152.
