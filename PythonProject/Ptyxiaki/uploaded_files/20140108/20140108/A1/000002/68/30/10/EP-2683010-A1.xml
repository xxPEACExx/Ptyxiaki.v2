Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the secondary battery includes a first electrode assembly 110, and a second electrode assembly 120 wound in a roll form along an outer circumference of the first electrode assembly 110. The two electrode assemblies 110 and 120 have a length direction Z1, which is the longest dimension of the parallelepiped they schematically represent, and two width directions, one in the Z1 direction and the other one perpendicular to the Z1 direction.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The first electrode assembly 110 may include a connection member 11a' that has a first polarity and is formed at one side of the first electrode assembly 110 in a width direction (in a Z1-axis direction), and a connection member 21a' that has a second polarity and is formed at the other side of the first electrode assembly 110. Similarly, the second electrode assembly 120 may include a first connection member 31a' that has the first polarity and is formed at one side of the second electrode assembly 120 in the width direction (in the Z1-axis direction), and a second connection member 41a' that has the second polarity and is formed on the other side of the second electrode assembly 120.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The first and second electrode assemblies 110 and 120 are connected to each other in parallel by commonly binding together the connection members 11a' and 31a' having the first polarity and by commonly binding together the connection members 21a' and 41a' having the second polarity. The connection members 11a' and 31a' having the first polarity and the members 21a' and 41a' having the second polarity may respectively form negative and positive electrodes that form two ends of a flow of charging/discharging power.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In detail, the connection members 11a' and 31a' having the first polarity of the first and second electrode assemblies 110 and 120 may be commonly bound at one side in the width direction (in the Z1-axis direction) of the first and second electrode assemblies 110 and 120 to form one polarity, for example, a negative electrode. Moreover, the connection members<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> 21a' and 41a' having the second polarity of the first and second electrode assemblies 110 and 120 may be commonly bound at the other side of the connection members 11a' and 31a' in the width direction (in the Z1-axis direction) of the first and second electrode assemblies 110 and 120 to form an opposite polarity, for example, a positive electrode.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The connection members 11a' and 31a' having the first polarity and the connection members 21a' and 41a' having the second polarity may be formed as parts, for example, non-coated portions, of first to fourth electrode plates 10, 20, 30, and 40 for forming the first and second electrode assemblies 110 and 120.

In other words, the first and second electrode plates 10 and 20 formed to have a predetermined size may be alternately stacked by interposing the first separator 51 therebetween.

This is because as the thicknesses t3 and t4 increase, the second electrode assembly 120 may not be flexibly deformed and also if the corner portion 120c is forced to be deformed, breakage of the third and fourth electrode plates 30 and 40 or loss of the active material may occur. In other words, the stacked thickness t1 of the first electrode assembly 110 (hereinafter, referred to as a stacked thickness) may be determined according to the thicknesses t3 and t4 of the third and fourth<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> electrode plates 30 and 40 (hereinafter, referred to as electrode plate thicknesses) of the second electrode assembly 120.

However, in all types of electrode plates, a lower limit of the stacked thickness t1 increases as the electrode plate thicknesses t3 and t4 increase. In general, the stacked thickness t1 increases in proportion to the electrode plate thicknesses t3 and t4. For example, the minimum stacked thickness t1 of the first electrode assembly 110 may correspond to the electrode plate thicknesses t3 and t4 of the second electrode assembly 120, that is, to about ten to thirty times the thickness t3 of the third electrode plate 30 or the thickness t4 of the fourth electrode plate 40.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">As such, as the stacked thickness t1 of the first electrode assembly 110 increases, the curvature radius of the second electrode assembly 120 surrounding the outer circumferential surface of the first electrode assembly 110 increases, and thus the second electrode assembly 120 may be prevented from being damaged. However, considering charging/discharging efficiency, although the edge portions 110c formed in two sides of the first electrode assembly 110 may not provide an electrical storage region, the second electrode assembly 120 may provide an electrical storage region where the third and fourth electrode plates 30 and 40 having opposite polarities face each other throughout the entire oval trace.
