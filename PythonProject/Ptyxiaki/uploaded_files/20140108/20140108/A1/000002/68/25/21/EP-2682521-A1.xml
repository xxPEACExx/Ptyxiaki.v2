More especially the present invention relates to a process according to preamble part of claim 1 and to a device according to the preamble part of claim 8.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">As known from the prior art in fiber web producing processes typically comprise an assembly formed by a number of apparatuses arranged consecutively in the process line. A typical production and treatment line comprises a head box, a wire section and a press section as well as a subsequent drying section and a reel-up. The production and treatment line can further comprise other devices and sections for finishing the fiber web, for example, a sizer, a calender, a coating section. The production and treatment line also comprises at least one winder for forming customer rolls as well as a roll packaging apparatus. In this description and the following claims by fiber webs are meant for example a paper, board and tissue webs.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Calendering is generally carried out in order to improve the properties, like smoothness and gloss, of a web-like material such as a paper or board web. In calendering the web is passed into a nip, i.e. calendering nip, formed between rolls that are pressed against each other, in which nip the web becomes deformed as by the action of temperature, moisture and nip pressure. In the calender the nips are formed for example between a smooth-surfaced press roll such as metal roll and a roll coated with resilient material such as a polymer roll. The resilient-surfaced roll adjusts itself to the forms of the web surface and presses the opposite side of the web evenly against the smooth-surfaced press roll.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO03064764A"><text>WO publication 03/064764</text></patcit> is disclosed a processing device and a method applying the same for processing a coated or uncoated fiber web. The device comprises a belt adapted to extend around a guiding element, at least one counter element being disposed outside the belt to provide contact area with the belt such that the belt and the counter element establish there between a web processing zone for passing the web to be processed there through. The processing zone length is defined by means of disposition of the belt's guiding element and/or by means of design of the counter-elements. A contact pressure applied to a web in the processing zone is adapted to be adjustable within<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the range of about 0,1 MPa to about 70 MPa. In this prior art belt calender the dwell time i.e. the contact time of the web in the processing zone is about 5 - 200 ms, preferably about 20 - 80 ms, and this <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO03064764A"><text>WO publication 03/064764</text></patcit> mentions that dwell time can be even up to 2 s or even in order of 10 s. This publication does not mention any special uses or advantages for these long dwell times nor describes any examples or embodiments using these long and merely mentions them as farfetched examples and instead focuses to dwell times of 5 - 200 ms for actual implementations of the process and method presented.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO200612856A"><text>WO publication 2006/12856</text></patcit> is disclosed a method and equipment for manufacturing fiber web, comprising the formation of at least one layer of fiber web from stock with solids content over 1,5 %, water being removed from the fiber web by first pressing the fiber web to solids content of about 45 to 65 %, then evaporating the fiber web to solids content of about 75 to 95 %, after which the fiber web is treated by means of a pressing contact to increase its smoothness, the fiber web being treated in the manufacturing process before the reeling stage by at least one pressure and heat treatment, wherein the forming pressure exerted on the fiber web is not higher than 20 MPa. In this prior art method dwell time from 20 to 100 ms and mentions as a preferable example for the method that before the pressure and heat treatment, at the evaporation stage of drying the fiber web, the fiber web is treated by means of smooth contact surface, such as a drying cylinder or the cylinder of Yankee dryer so that the total contact time is at least 1000 ms. The pressure and heat treatment equipment comprise a metal belt conveyor, long nip calender, conventional belt calender, and Condebelt dryer or Yankee dryer.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO2007110472A"><text>WO publication 2007/110472</text></patcit> is disclosed a method producing coated paper or board. In the method the fiber web is conveyed to a precalendering device before coating and the paper or board is dried in one or more stages and dried after coating in at least one coating stage. In the method is used a precalender and/or intermediate calender which is selected from a group comprising a metal belt calender and a long nip calender. In this prior art method dwell time of the fiber web on the nip or in the calendering zone is 10 ms.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In prior art no special focus has been given to longer dwell times for example to dwell times over 200 ms since this is sufficient when prior art type belt calendering<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> process is used and it has not been an attractive alternative due to long belt contact zone required for fast production speeds.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Paper and board are available in a wide variety of grades and can be divided according to basis weight in two grades: papers with a single ply and a basis weight of 25 - 300 g/ m<sup>2</sup> and boards manufactured in multi-ply technology and having a basis weight of 150 - 600 g/ m<sup>2</sup>. It should be noted that the borderline between paper and board is flexible since board grades with lightest basis weights are lighter than the heaviest paper grades. Generally speaking, paper is used for printing and board for packaging.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The subsequent descriptions are examples of some values presently applied for fibrous webs, and there may be considerable variations from the disclosed values.

Boards can be divided e.g. in the following main groups cartonboards, containerboards and specialty boards. Cartonboards are mainly used for consumer product packaging and they comprise boxboards, used for making boxes, cases, which boxboards include e.g. liquid packaging boards; FBB = folding boxboard, WLC = white-lined chipboard, SBS = solid bleached sulfate board, SUS = solid unbleached sulfate board and LPB = liquid packaging board. Containerboards comprise f. ex. linerboard, fluting board and other corrugated boards and specialty boards comprise wallpaper base, plaster board etc. Graphic boards are used for making e.g. cards, files, folders, cases, covers, etc. and wallpaper bases. Each end use sets its own demands on the mechanical and functional properties of boards. Basically a certain mechanical strength and stiffness, especially bending stiffness is required, and in the optimum structure middle-ply is very bulky and top and back plies have high modulus of elasticity. Often also purity and cleanliness requirements are very high and also almost all boards have defined printing properties and for example the printing requirements of folding box board are usually very high and also high bulkiness is required of folding box board.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">One problem in production of boards is that due to their thickness in treatment of board the effect is not deep enough in the web.
