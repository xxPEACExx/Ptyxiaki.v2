In recent years, chew is more and more popular in pet owners. Long-term consumption of chew for pet dogs can achieve following advantages of: strengthening teeth, cleaning mouth and slowing down formation of dental plaque and tartar, stimulating generation of saliva by chewing pet chews, which is capable of neutralizing eburicoic acid, keeping cleanness of pet mouth, decreasing sufferings of gum in teething stage, protecting goods at home from being damaged and serving as toys of pet dogs, and helping to lose weight.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Main component of the conventional pet chews is the second split leather of animals such as cows or pigs. Pet chew made of cow leather or pig leather are various shapes, such as bone shape, ball shape, ring shape, stick shape, shoes shape and particle shape. Leather of animals such as cow and pig is rich in protein, and has advantages of high toughness, high flexibility and strong abrasive resistance, which satisfy biting nature of pet dogs. However, sheet of the conventional cow leather pet chew or pig leather pet chew has various sizes and thickness, various colors, has holes and large amount of leftover bits and pieces, and utilization rate of raw materials thereof is only 30∼70%. Furthermore, since main component of the conventional cow leather pet chew or pig leather pet chew is protein (raw material for production of edible gelatin) which is lack of tastes and smells, and thus is difficult to attract the pet dogs. Therefore, with no other<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> choices or being forced, a lot of pet dogs chew the conventional pet chew for a while and stops, which causes a waste pet chew. In order to overcome the problem mentioned above, some pet food manufactures add flavor additives to cow leather and pig leather, which is still not capable of attracting pet dogs for eating. Some pet food manufactures directly add meat into pet chew to produce pet chew with meat, which is capable of attracting pet dogs, but the cost thereof is 2-3 times higher than conventional cow leather pet chew or pig leather pet chew, and thus the pet chew with meat is hard to popularize.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>Summary of the Present Invention</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">In order to overcome shortcoming in the prior art, the present invention provides an artificial pet chewing leather, which achieves that raw material is easily obtained, products thereof have good shape, good taste and safety, so as to attract pet dogs to eat initiatively.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An artificial pet chewing leather, wherein raw material thereof comprises:
<ul><li>water and leather powder obtained by grinding leather, or</li><li>leather pulp obtained by grinding leather in damp condition with water, or</li><li>the leather powder obtained by grinding leather and the leather pulp obtained by grinding leather in damp condition with water (with water content of 50∼85%).</li></ul></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Furthermore, manufacturing method of the leather powder comprises steps of:
<ul><li>washing and denaturalizing the leather to a pH of neutrality,</li><li>drying,</li><li>grinding to a coin size, and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></li><li>grinding into wadding and powder shapes,</li><li>wherein the wadding and powder shapes contains 1∼10% of powder by weight.</li></ul></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Manufacturing method of the leather pulp comprises steps of:

No pet chew is reported manufactured utilizing the third split leather and the leftover bits and pieces and by the method mentioned above. The cost of artificial pet chew manufactured by the third split leather and the leftover bits and pieces is one half or one third thereof utilizing the second split leather, and utilization rate thereof reaches 100%.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Furthermore, mass ratio of the leather powder and the leather pulp is 3 - 8: 2 - 7. After the leather powder and the leather pulp are mixed, both filiform tension and viscosity thereof satisfy requirements for manufacturing pet chew.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Furthermore, the raw material further comprises one or more members selected from the group consisting of livestock bone powder, livestock meat powder, livestock meat paste, starch, protein powder, glycerol, flavoring agents, edible pigment and trace elements. An additive amount of the glycerol is 1∼10% of a total weight of the pet chew, and preferably 3∼5%. The glycerol added thereof has effects of preserving moisture and softening. An additive amount of the flavoring agents is 0.5-3.5 % of the total weight of the pet chew, and preferably 1∼1.5%. The flavoring agents comprise salt, sugar, monosodium glutamate and meat flavor such as chicken flavor, beef flavor and pork<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> flavor. An additive amount of the livestock meat powder or the livestock meat paste is 5∼95% of the total weight of the pet chew, and preferably 40∼55%. An additive amount of the starch is 5∼40% of a total weight of the pet chew, and preferably 8∼15%. A mass ratio of the leather powder and the livestock bone powder is 2 - 9: 1 - 8, and preferably 6:4.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Furthermore, the livestock bone powder is produced by drying, smoking and grinding livestock bone frame. The livestock bone frame is soaked in boiled water for 1∼10mins before drying. The livestock bone frame is dried until 20∼35% water content, then smoked before grinding, wherein smoking has a good effect when the livestock bone frame has water content of 20-35%. The process of smoking is not only capable of dying the livestock bone frame, but also adding a smoky flavor to attract pet dogs. The livestock bone frame is remaining bones of livestock after slaughtering.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Another object of the present invention is to provide a manufacturing method of the artificial pet chewing leather, which achieves advantages of easy operating, low manufacturing cost and high utilization of raw material.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The method for manufacturing the artificial pet chewing leather comprises following steps of: mixing the raw materials mentioned above, forming under a temperature of 30∼75°C, preferably 45∼55°C, wherein the forming is extrusion molding by extruder, molding by biscuit machine or press molding by mould. After forming, the pet chew is smooth, and has uniform shapes (a common thickness thereof is 0.7∼3.5mm), no holes, and good surface fineness. Physical and chemical properties thereof (hardness, chewiness, flexibility and etc.) are basically the same with conventional cow-leather chew and pig-leather chew, and thus the artificial pet chewing leather of the present invention can completely replace the conventional cow-leather chew and pig-leather chew.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention further provides applications of the artificial pet chewing leather. The artificial pet chewing leather of the present invention can be widely utilized<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> in pet diets. By simply processing the artificial pet chewing leather of the present invention, new products of pet chew with various shapes and sizes are obtained.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A stuffed pet chew, comprises a stuffing and an external layer covered thereon, wherein the stuffing is the artificial pet chewing leather , the external layer is cow-leather chew or pig-leather chew.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A multilayer pet chew, comprises a cow-leather chew or pig-leather chew, and at least one layer of the artificial pet chewing leather covered thereon.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">An embedded pet chew, comprises a main body and an edible inlay embedded therein, wherein the main body is the artificial pet chewing leather.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The raw materials of the present invention are easily obtained, formula is reasonable and manufacturing method thereof is easy operating.
