Attempts have also been made to reduce a load on the oil pump by adjusting a hydraulic pressure supplied to each of a valve gear lubrication circuit and a crank shaft lubrication circuit to a value needed for the circuit.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">To achieve such an object, an invention disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2009264241A"><text>2009-264241</text></patcit> has been provided. The invention in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2009264241A"><text>2009-264241</text></patcit> will be described below in brief. Reference numerals in the following description are the same as reference numerals described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2009264241A"><text>2009-264241</text></patcit>. First, oil is pumped from an oil pan 10 by an oil pump 12 and fed to a first feeding path 16a and a second feeding path 16b.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The first feeding path 16a is a path that supplies oil mostly to a bearing portion 18 of the crank shaft. The second feeding path 16b is a path that supplies oil to, for example, a valve gear mechanism 20. A hydraulic control valve 22 is disposed on the first feeding path 16a to control the amount of oil supplied to the bearing portion 18 of the crank shaft. The hydraulic control valve 22 is configured such that an output hydraulic pressure from the hydraulic control valve 22 is controlled by a control unit 24.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The control unit 24 is controlled by an engine rotation speed sensor 26, an engine load sensor 28, an oil temperature sensor 30, and a hydraulic pressure sensor 32. A relief valve 34 is provided<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> to transfer an excessive hydraulic pressure to the oil pan 10 through an oil path portion between the oil pump 12 and a filter 14 when the hydraulic pressure exceeds a predetermined value. In the above-described configuration, the hydraulic control valve 22 is controlled by the control unit 24.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The invention in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2009264241A"><text>2009-264241</text></patcit> and conventional techniques including similar configurations have the following problems. The invention in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2009264241A"><text>2009-264241</text></patcit> utilizes electronic control as control means. To allow the hydraulic control valve 22 to be controlled utilizing electronic control, much information on the rotation speed of the engine, an oil temperature, an engine load, the hydraulic pressure, and the like needs to be acquired. Furthermore, complicated control such as MAP control and oil temperature compensation is needed. This may significantly increase costs. Moreover, driving the hydraulic control valve 22 leads to power consumption, and a power generator needs to be driven, possibly increasing the engine load.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Additionally, if an electric system for any of the various sensors, the hydraulic control valve 22, the control unit 24, and the like becomes defective, the control is prevented from being sufficiently performed, thus precluding expected effects from being produced. Thus, an object of the present invention (technical problem to be solved) is to provide an inexpensive and reliable control valve by using a hydraulic driving mechanism to avoid the inherent problem of electronic control.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Thus, the inventors earnestly studied in order to achieve the object. As a result, a first aspect of the present invention is a control valve including a main channel, a channel cross section adjustment spool installed in a middle of the main channel to increase and reduce a channel cross section, a downstream side branching channel that branches from the main channel on a downstream side of a position of the channel cross section adjustment spool, a communication channel through which oil is fed<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> from the downstream side branching channel toward the channel cross section adjustment spool, a channel open and close spool installed between the downstream side branching channel and the communication channel to allow and block communication between the downstream side branching channel and the communication channel, a channel open and close valve installed in a middle of the communication channel, and an upstream side branching channel that branches from the main channel on an upstream side of the position of the channel cross section adjustment spool to supply a hydraulic pressure to the channel open and close spool, wherein, in a low rotation speed region of an engine, the channel open and close valve blocks the communication channel to maximize a channel cross section of the main channel, and in a medium rotation speed region of the engine, the channel open and close spool allows the communication between the downstream side branching channel and the communication channel, and the channel open and close valve allows the communication channel to communicate to slide and move the channel cross section adjustment spool in a direction in which the channel cross section of the main channel is reduced, and in a high rotation speed region of the engine, the channel open and close spool blocks the communication between the downstream side branching channel and the communication channel to maximize the channel cross section of the main channel. Thus, the control valve has achieved the object.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A second aspect of the present invention is a control valve including a main channel, a channel cross section adjustment spool installed in a middle of the main channel, a downstream side branching channel that branches from the main channel on a downstream side of a position of the channel cross section adjustment spool, a communication channel which is in communication with the downstream side branching channel and through which oil is fed to the channel cross section adjustment spool, a channel open and close valve installed in a middle of the communication channel to allow and block communication of the communication<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> channel, and an upstream side branching channel that branches from the main channel on an upstream side of the position of the channel cross section adjustment spool to supply a hydraulic pressure to the channel open and close spool, wherein the channel open and close spool blocks communication between the downstream side branching channel and the communication channel as a hydraulic pressure in the upstream side branching channel increases, the channel open and close valve allows the communication channel to communicate as a hydraulic pressure in the downstream side branching channel increases, and the channel cross section adjustment spool is elastically biased in such a manner as to maximize a channel cross section of the main channel, and moves in such a manner that the channel cross section is reduced as a hydraulic pressure from the communication channel increases. Thus, the control valve has achieved the object.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A third aspect of the present invention is the control valve according to the first or second aspect, wherein a hydraulic pressure needed for the channel open and close valve to allow the communication channel to communicate is set lower than a hydraulic pressure needed for the channel open and close spool to block the communication between the downstream side branching channel and the communication channel. Thus, the control valve has achieved the object.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A fourth aspect of the present invention is the control valve according to any one of the first to third aspects, wherein a drain channel is provided between a channel cross section adjustment spool chamber in which the channel cross section adjustment spool is installed and a channel open and close valve chamber in which the channel open and close valve is installed, a discharge channel is formed in the channel open and close valve chamber, and the drain channel and the discharge channel are allowed to communicate with each other when the channel open and close valve blocks the communication channel. Thus, the control valve has achieved the object.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A fifth aspect of the present invention is the control valve according to any one of the first to fourth aspects, wherein a channel cross section adjustment spool chamber in which the channel cross section adjustment spool is installed is constituted by a main chamber portion and a sub-chamber portion which are orthogonal to the main channel, and the channel cross section adjustment spool reciprocates between the main chamber portion and the sub-chamber portion in such a manner as to traverse the main channel. Thus, the control valve has achieved the object.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the first and second aspects, the hydraulic pressure on the downstream side of the control valve is controlled according to a change in engine rotation speed, that is, a change in the hydraulic pressure in the main channel, using only a mechanical hydraulic mechanism without the use of a solenoid valve or a sensor which needs electric driving.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">This eliminates the possibility of preventing appropriate hydraulic control as a result of a defect in an electric system. Thus, operating reliability is ensured which is higher than the operating reliability of a lubricant supply apparatus according to the conventional technique, and a possible increase in costs resulting from additional components and control can be suppressed.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In operation, in the medium rotation speed region of the engine, a hydraulic pressure is applied to the channel cross section adjustment spool to move the channel cross section adjustment spool in an axial direction thereof to reduce a channel cross section of an oil circuit. The reduced cross section of the oil passage enables a reduction in the hydraulic pressure on the downstream side of the channel cross section adjustment spool.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Furthermore, in the high rotation speed region of the engine, oil flowing through the communication channel is blocked by the channel open and close spool. The drain channel and the discharge channel in the channel open and close valve chamber are allowed to communicate with each other to reduce the hydraulic pressure applied to the channel cross section adjustment spool. The elastic<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> bias force of the channel cross section adjustment spool moves the channel cross section adjustment spool in a direction in which the channel cross section of the main channel is maximized. This allows the flow rate and pressure of oil to be increased according to the rotation speed of the engine.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Thus, the aspects of the present invention prevent the downstream side hydraulic pressure from decreasing, and in the low rotation speed region of the engine, allow the hydraulic pressure to gradually rise from the time of start of the engine. In the medium rotation speed range of the engine, the aspects of the present invention can suppress a rise in hydraulic pressure to prevent wasteful use of oil. In the high rotation speed region of the engine, a high hydraulic pressure can be supplied as necessary if such a hydraulic pressure is needed for lubrication or cooling.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the third aspect of the present invention, a hydraulic pressure needed for the channel open and close valve to allow the communication channel to communicate is set lower than a hydraulic pressure needed for the channel cross section adjustment spool to block the communication between the downstream side branching channel and the communication channel. Thus, the hydraulic pressure of oil flowing through the main channel rises to move the channel open and close valve earlier than the channel open and close spool. As a result, an appropriate operation is performed according to the rotation speed of the engine simply by using the elastic bias force of an elastic member.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to the fourth aspect of the present invention, the channel open and close valve blocks the communication channel to allow the channel cross section adjustment spool to operate smoothly even if the supply of the hydraulic pressure to the channel cross section adjustment spool chamber is stopped. According to the fifth aspect of the present invention, the channel cross section adjustment spool reciprocates in the axial direction in a stabilized manner.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">An example of a control valve according to the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:-

However, the channel open and close valve 42 and the channel open and close spool 43 are prevented from performing an opening or closing operation because the hydraulic pressure is sufficiently low compared to the elastic bias force of the elastic members 46 and 47. Thus, a hydraulic pressure on the downstream side of the channel cross section adjustment spool 41, that is, a crank shaft supply hydraulic pressure, is substantially equal to a hydraulic pressure on the upstream side of the channel cross section adjustment spool 41, that is, a valve gear supply hydraulic pressure.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Furthermore, in the low rotation speed region of the engine, control is avoided which reduces the hydraulic pressure.

The oil flowing through the main channel 11 also flows through the upstream side branching channel 13. However, the force of the upstream side hydraulic pressure in the medium rotation speed region is lower than the elastic bias force of the elastic member 47, which elastically biases the channel open and close spool 43.
