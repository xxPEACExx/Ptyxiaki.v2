The dependent claims delineate preferred and/or especially advantageous aspects of the invention.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>BEST WAY OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">In particular, the invention provides a power take-off device connectable to a tractor having a power take-off, which comprises a support frame fixable to a tractor and suitable for rotatably supporting at least an input shaft for taking drive from the power take-off of the tractor and at least a first output shaft suitable for activating at least a work tool.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the invention, the device comprises at least a second output shaft, parallel to the first output shaft and suitable for activating at least a further work tool, and drive transmission means interposed between the input shaft and the second output shaft.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Thanks to this solution, the number of power take-offs on the tractor can be multiplied such as even contemporaneously to provide a plurality of attachments points for different tools.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">This solution is especially advantageous when more than one tool is required to be used, for example more than one wood hewer or more than one agricultural tool or another tool besides, drawn by a single tractor.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">An aspect of the invention is, further, that the drive transmission means comprise at least a drive pulley keyed on the input shaft and at least a driven pulley associated to the second output shaft, and a flexible organ loop-wound on itself for transmission of the drive from the drive pulley to the driven pulley. Thanks to this solution the various output shafts of the device can be kept at a congruent distance such as to make it possible to associate a plurality of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> tools to the device, including tools of considerable dimensions, in a way that is simple and functional.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The device also comprises a pair of the drive pulleys connected, by means of respective flexible organs, to a respective pair of the driven pulleys, the driven pulleys of the pair being made selectively solid in rotation with the second output shaft via selection means, for example of a type having a manually-activatable sleeve selector.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In this way, the angular velocity of rotation of the second output shaft can be varied according to requirements.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">For example, the angular velocity of the second output shaft can be varied between a first and a second angular velocity, for example greater than the angular velocity of the input shaft respectively by a multiplication factor of 2 and 4.5.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Two of the second output shafts are advantageously present in the device, parallel to one another and connected in the same way as described above to the input shaft, thus providing overall up to three power take-offs for respective tools activatable even at the same time by the same power take-off of the single tractor.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will emerge from a reading of the following description provided by way of non-limiting example, with the aid of the figures illustrated in the appended figures of the drawings.
