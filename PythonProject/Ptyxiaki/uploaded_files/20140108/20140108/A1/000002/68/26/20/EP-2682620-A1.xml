More particularly, the present invention relates to a sliding bearing for supporting rollers (roller to be heated) such as a fixing roller and a pressure roller of a fixing device of an image-forming apparatus such as a copying machine, a printer, a facsimile, and the like.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In the fixing device of the image-forming apparatus, toner is attached to an electrostatic latent image formed by an optical device. Thereafter a toner image is transferred to a sheet of copying paper and fixed thereto. At a fixing process, the toner image is passed between the fixing roller and the pressure roller both of which incorporate a heater. Thereby a transfer image consisting of the toner image is fixed to the copying paper by thermal fusion.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The fixing roller is made of a soft metal and incorporates a linear or bar-like heater in its shaft center portion. The fixing roller is cylindrical and has a small-diameter shaft projected from both ends thereof. The fixing roller is made of a metal material such as aluminum or an aluminum alloy (A5056, A6063) excellent in its thermal conductivity. The surface finish of the fixing roller is performed by turning or polishing.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> The surface of the fixing roller is coated or covered with a highly unadhesive resin such as fluororesin. The temperature of the surface of the fixing roller is heated to about 180 to 250°C.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The pressure roller is made of an iron material or a soft material both coated with silicone rubber or the like and is rotated with copying paper being pressed against the fixing roller. The pressure roller is heated to 70 to 150°C by heat transferred from a heating roller. Alternatively, similarly to the fixing roller, the pressure roller is heated up to 150 to 250°C by a heater mounted inside it. Rollers such as the fixing roller, the pressure roller, and the like to be heated by a heater accommodated therein or by heat transferred from other members are hereinafter referred to as "heat roller".</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The heat roller which is heated to a high temperature is rotatably supported at both ends of its shaft by a housing through ball bearings consisting of a deep groove ball bearing. A heat insulation sleeve made of synthetic resin or the like is interposed between each ball bearing and the shaft of the heat roller. This construction is to prevent the temperature distribution along the axial direction of the heat roller from becoming nonuniform and the ball bearing from being deteriorated at a high temperature owing to the escape of heat from the ball bearing disposed at both ends of shaft of the heat roller when the heat roller is heated.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is known that as a bearing for supporting the heat roller, a sliding bearing made of resin is used in dependence on types of the heat roller. The sliding bearing is formed of a synthetic resin such as polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), polyamide (PA), polyamideimide (PAI), polyimide (PI) or polyether ether ketone (PEEK). As an example, in a known art (see patent document 1), the ring-shaped bearing body is made of the PPS resin excellent in its heat resistance and mechanical strength, and a fluororesin layer is bonded to the sliding contact surface of the bearing body or the sliding bearing is formed by integrally molding the PPS resin to which the fluororesin has been added.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the case where the sliding bearing made of resin is used, the heat insulation sleeve is not interposed between the sliding bearing made of resin and the shaft of the heat roller because the sliding bearing made of resin has thermal insulation properties. Normally, in the fixing device of middle-class and high-class image-forming apparatuses, the ball bearing is used for the heat roller thereof, whereas in the fixing device of an image-forming apparatus in wide use, the sliding bearing made of resin is used for the heat roller thereof.</p><heading id="h0002">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h0003">PATENT DOCUMENT</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">Patent document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0005">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The deep groove ball bearing for the heat roller of the fixing device of the image-forming apparatus is complicated in its construction and the cost for producing it is high. In addition, to prevent the temperature distribution along the axial direction of the heat roller from becoming nonuniform and the bearing from being deteriorated at high temperatures, it is necessary to provide the bearing with the heat insulation sleeve. Thus the deep groove ball bearing is expensive. Further there is a fear that the bearing is damaged owing to flexure of the supporting shaft of the heat roller caused by precision error in mounting the supporting shaft of the heat roller on the image-forming apparatus and a moment load.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">On the other hand, the sliding bearing made of resin such as the PPS resin can be used without interposing the heat insulation sleeve between the shaft of the heat roller and the ball bearing, has a simple construction, and can be formed by injection molding. Therefore the sliding bearing made of resin has an advantage that it can be produced at a low cost. But the frictional torque to be applied to the sliding bearing made of resin two to five times higher than that to be applied to the deep groove ball bearing. When the sliding contact surface<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> of the bearing of the heat roller has a high degree of roughness, a higher frictional torque is applied to the sliding bearing made of resin and at the same time, the sliding bearing made of resin is subjected to a high degree of wear. Thus there is a fear that the specification is not satisfied.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Even though grease is applied to the sliding contact surface of the bearing to decrease the frictional torque, the grease becomes short at a portion where a load is applied to a high extent. Thus there is a fear that the specification is not satisfied.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In a sliding bearing which has an inner ring, an outer ring, and a sliding contact member interposed therebetween, there is a fear that the sliding contact member holds the inner ring with the sliding contact surface of the former in close contact with that of the latter. Thus the sliding bearing has a high coefficient of friction between the sliding contact member and the inner ring. The reason the sliding contact member holds the inner ring with the sliding contact surface of the former in close contact with that of the latter is as follows: The sliding bearing is routinely used in the form in which an atmospheric temperature rises owing to the operation of a device, and thus the sliding bearing is heated and thereafter cooled owing to the stop of the operation thereof. Because the sliding contact member contracts after it thermally expands, the butting portion thereof becomes narrow. As a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> result, the sliding contact member holds the inner ring with the sliding contact surface of the former in close contact with that of the latter. Because the sliding contact member holds the inner ring with the sliding contact surface of the former in close contact with that of the latter, the sliding bearing has a high coefficient of friction between the sliding contact member and the inner ring. In addition, because grease is pressed out of the sliding contact surfaces, the sliding bearing has a higher coefficient of friction between the sliding contact member and the inner ring. Thus there is a fear that the sliding bearing is subjected to wear.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present invention has been made to deal with the above-described problems. Therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide a sliding bearing which has a simple construction and thus can be produced easily and at a low cost and yet eliminates the need for the use of a heat insulation sleeve and the like and is capable of maintaining a frictional torque to a low extent. It is another object of the present invention to provide a sliding bearing capable of preventing the rise of its coefficient of friction and the generation of friction caused by a phenomenon that a sliding contact member holds an inner ring with the sliding contact surface of the former in close contact with that of the latter.</p><heading id="h0006">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --><p id="p0014" num="0014">The sliding bearing of the present invention has an inner ring, an outer ring, and a sliding contact member interposed therebetween, wherein the inner ring has a curved surface formed along an outer circumference thereof and a shaft-receiving hole which fits on a supporting shaft along an inner circumference thereof; the sliding contact member is a molded body, made of a resin composition, which has a curved surface making sliding contact with the curved outer circumferential surface of the inner ring with the curved surface of the sliding contact member being opposed to the curved outer circumferential surface of the inner ring; and the outer ring does not contact the inner ring and holds the sliding contact member on an inner circumferential side thereof with the outer ring covering the sliding contact member.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The sliding contact member is an annular body having one butting portion.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The outer ring has a projection on an inner circumferential surface thereof; and the projection is fitted on the butting portion of the sliding contact member.

Therefore the sliding bearing is constructed of a smaller number of parts than a ball bearing and thus has a simpler construction than the ball<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> bearing. Thus it is possible to easily produce the sliding bearing and shorten the process of producing the sliding bearing and the period of time in which the sliding bearing is assembled. Thereby it is possible to provide the sliding bearing at a low cost. In addition, because the sliding contact member interposed between the inner ring and the outer ring which does not contact the inner ring is a molded body made of the resin composition, the sliding contact member has a self-thermal insulation effectiveness the ball bearing does not have. Thus it is unnecessary to provide the sliding bearing with a heat insulation sleeve.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The sliding bearing has the form in which the curved outer circumferential surface of the inner ring makes sliding contact with the curved surface of the annular sliding contact member with the curved outer circumferential surface of the inner ring and the curved surface of the sliding contact member being opposed to each other. Therefore unlike a sliding bearing, made of resin, which makes sliding contact with the supporting shaft with which the sliding contact member mates, the frictional torque does not depend on the surface roughness of the supporting shaft and the material thereof. The sliding bearing has the form in which the inner and outer rings do not contact each other. This form allows the frictional torque to be applied to the sliding bearing of the present invention to be lower than that to be applied to the conventional sliding<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> bearing, made of resin, which has the above-described form. Therefore the sliding bearing of the present invention has a property intermediate between that of the ball bearing and that of the conventional sliding bearing made of resin in its frictional torque and the production cost.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Because the sliding contact member of the present invention is the annular body having one butting portion, the sliding contact member can be easily combined with the inner ring. In addition, it is possible to prevent the sliding contact member from being broken owing to a stress concentration caused by its thermal expansion.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The outer ring has the projection on the inner circumferential surface thereof. The projection is fitted on the butting portion of the sliding contact member. Therefore the sliding contact member does not rotate relative to the outer ring and thus the rotation torque of the sliding bearing is stable. Further the sliding contact member does not hold the inner ring with the sliding contact surface of the former in close contact with that of the latter. Thus it is possible to prevent the rotation torque and friction coefficient of the sliding bearing from increasing and wear from being generated.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The annular body is so constructed that at one side of the annular body in the axial direction thereof, the butting portion has the abutting surface disposed on the sectional surface of each of both end portions of the annular body; and<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> at other side of the annular body in the axial direction thereof, the butting portion has the stepped portion on which the projection of the outer ring fits on the sectional surface of at least one of both end portions of the annular body. The circumferential length of the fit-on portion, consisting of the stepped portions, on which the projection of the outer ring fits is set longer than the circumferential length of the projection of the outer ring. Therefore the sliding bearing is excellent in combining its annular body with its outer ring.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The length of the gap between the abutting surfaces is set shorter than the length of the gap between the fit-on portion, consisting of the stepped portions, and the projection of the outer ring. Therefore when the developed length of the sliding contact member is extended owing to its expansion caused by heating, the gap between the abutting surfaces of the butting portion is closed earlier than the gap between the fit-on portion and the projection of the outer ring. Thus it is possible to prevent the sliding contact member from holding the inner ring with the sliding contact surface of the former in close contact with that of the latter.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The length of the gap between the abutting surfaces before the sliding contact member is combined with the outer ring is set equally to the length of the gap between the abutting surfaces after the sliding contact member is combined with the outer ring. This construction does not adversely affect the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> rotation torque of the sliding bearing.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Because the outer ring is the molded body of the resin composition, the sliding bearing is allowed to be lightweight and excellent in its heat insulation.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The outer ring has the open portion formed on the axial one end surface thereof and the pawl portion formed at the edge of the open portion. The sliding contact member is combined with the outer ring by inserting the sliding contact member thereinto from the open portion thereof and fixed by the pawl portion. Therefore it is possible to produce the sliding bearing easily by combining the sliding contact member with the outer ring by snap fit. This construction allows the sliding contact member to be held inside the outer ring and combined therewith. The snap-fittable construction makes it possible to shorten the process of producing the sliding bearing and the period of time in which the sliding bearing is assembled. Thereby it is possible to provide the sliding bearing at a low cost.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The base resin of the resin composition forming the sliding contact member or the outer ring is at least one synthetic resin selected from among PPS resin, PEEK resin, PAI resin, and PI resin.

Thus the sliding bearing of the present invention can be preferably used as the shaft<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> for supporting the heat roller.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Because the resin composition forming the sliding contact member contains the solid lubricant, a frictional torque is decreasingly applied to the sliding bearing. The fibrous reinforcing agent contained in the resin composition forming the sliding contact member reinforces the sliding contact member or the like and allows the sliding contact member to have a high wear resistance. In addition, because the fibrous reinforcing material allows the sliding contact member to have a high elasticity, the sliding contact member can be used at a high temperature environment.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The solid lubricant is at least one substance selected from among PTFE resin, graphite, and molybdenum disulfide. The use of the solid lubricant for the sliding contact member allows it to have an excellent lubricating property and a stable frictional torque. The fibrous reinforcing material which can be used for the sliding contact member is at least one fiber selected from among carbon fibers and aramid fibers. The use of these fibers for the sliding contact member restrains the inner ring which mates the sliding contact member from wearing. The use of these fibers for the sliding contact member is also capable of enhancing the wear resistance thereof and the retention property of the elastic modulus thereof at high temperatures. Because the fibrous reinforcing agent which can be used for the outer ring is at least one fiber selected from<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> among carbon fibers, glass fibers, and aramid fibers, the constructive strength of the outer ring can be enhanced.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The outer ring has the flange formed along the outer circumference thereof.

By using at least one grease selected from among fluorine grease and urea grease as the lubricant for the resin composition, the inner ring and the sliding contact member are allowed to have a stable lubricating property and a low frictional torque at high temperatures. By forming the lubricant-holding pocket on the sliding contact surface of the sliding contact member, the lubricant can be stably supplied to the sliding contact surface.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The curved outer circumferential surface of the inner ring is formed as the concave curved surface. The curved surface of the sliding contact member is formed as the convex curved surface which slidingly contacts the concave curved surface with the convex curved surface being opposed to the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> concave curved surface. Therefore it is possible to prevent the inner and outer rings from being axially dislocated. The non-curved surface portion is formed along the entire circumference of the central portion of the convex curved surface of the sliding contact member in the axial direction thereof. Therefore the lubricant can be held in the non-curved surface portion. The sliding contact member is an injection-molded body of the resin composition. The parting line is formed on the non-curved surface portion when the resin composition is injection-molded. Therefore the sliding contact member can be easily produced by injection-molding the resin composition, and the convex parting line does not interfere with the sliding contact surface of the inner ring.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Because an inner ring for a ball bearing is utilized as the inner ring of the present invention, the curved outer circumferential surface of the inner ring which makes sliding contact with the sliding contact surface of the sliding contact member is the rolling contact surface of the inner ring and is formed highly accurately, which allows the inner ring to have stable rotational performance.</p><heading id="h0008">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0042" num="0042"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a perspective view showing one example of a sliding bearing of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a sectional view of the sliding bearing in an<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> axial direction thereof.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> shows an assembling process of the sliding bearing of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a front view of a sliding contact member of the sliding bearing shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> and a sectional view thereof in its axial direction.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is a front view of an outer ring of the sliding bearing shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> and a sectional view thereof in its axial direction.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> is a front view of an inner ring of the sliding bearing shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> and a sectional view thereof in its axial direction.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> is a partly enlarged view of an inner circumferential surface of a sliding contact member where a groove-shaped lubricant-holding pocket having another form is formed.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref> is a front view of an outer ring having another form and an axial sectional view thereof.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref> is a front view showing another example of the sliding bearing of the present invention and an axial sectional view thereof.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10</figref> is a partly enlarged view in the axial sectional view thereof in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 11</figref> is a front view of the sliding contact member of the sliding bearing shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref> and a sectional view thereof<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> in its axial direction.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 12</figref> is a perspective view of a sliding contact member of the sliding bearing shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0013">Fig. 13</figref> is a front view of an outer ring of the sliding bearing shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref> and a sectional view thereof in its axial direction.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0014">Fig. 14</figref> is a front view of an inner ring of the sliding bearing shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref> and an axial sectional view thereof.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 15</figref> shows the length of a gap of a fit-on portion where the sliding contact member is fitted on the outer ring.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0016">Fig. 16</figref> is a perspective view of a sliding contact member having another mode.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0017">Fig. 17</figref> is a schematic view of a shaft-heating high temperature radial tester.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0018">Fig. 18</figref> shows a bar graph showing results of a rotation torque comparison test.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0019">Fig. 19</figref> shows a change of the coefficient of kinetic friction of a test sliding bearing A.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0020">Fig. 20</figref> shows a change of the coefficient of kinetic friction of a test sliding bearing B.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0009">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0043" num="0043">One embodiment of the sliding bearing of the present invention is described below with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a sliding bearing of one<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> embodiment of the present invention. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is an axial sectional view of the sliding bearing and a partly enlarged sectional view thereof. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, a sliding bearing 1 has an inner ring 2, an outer ring 3, and a sliding contact member 4 interposed between the inner ring 2 and the outer ring 3. The sliding bearing 1 is a radial bearing. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the inner ring 2 has a curved surface 2a formed along its outer circumference and a shaft-receiving hole 5 which fits on a supporting shaft along its inner circumference. The sliding contact member 4 has a curved surface 4a which slidingly contacts the curved surface 2a with the curved surface 4a being opposed to the curved outer circumferential surface 2a of the inner ring 2. The outer ring 3 consists of one member and holds the sliding contact member 4 on its inner circumferential side with the outer ring 3 covering the sliding contact member 4. There is a gap 3f formed between the inner ring 2 and the outer ring 3 so that both members 2 and 3 do not contact each other. The sliding contact member 4 is held in a space surrounded with a plurality of pawl portions 3a formed at the edge of an open portion 3d provided along one end surface of the outer ring 3, an inner circumferential surface 3c of the outer ring 3, and an end surface side inner surface 3b of the outer ring 3. More specifically, one end surface 4b of the sliding contact member 4 contacts the end surface side inner surface 3b of the outer ring 3. An outer circumferential surface 4d of the sliding<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> contact member 4 contacts the inner circumferential surface 3c of the outer ring 3. Other end surface 4c of the sliding contact member 4 is caught by the pawl portions 3a of the outer ring 3 and fixed thereto. In this manner, the sliding contact member 4 is held by the outer ring 3.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> shows the assembling process of the sliding bearing 1. In the assembling sequence, initially the sliding contact member 4 is fitted on the inner ring 2 by an elastic deformation of the sliding contact member 4 to allow the curved outer circumferential surface 2a of the inner ring 2 to contact the curved surface 4a of the sliding contact member 4 with the curved surface 2a being opposed to the curved surface 4a. Thereafter the combined member consisting of the sliding contact member 4 and the inner ring 2 is combined with the outer ring 3 by inserting the combined member from the open portion 3d thereof.

When the combined member is pressed to the above-described position, the other end surface 4c thereof is caught by a plurality of the pawl portions 3a.

By performing the above-described assembling operations, it is possible to obtain the sliding<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> bearing 1 composed of the inner ring 2, the outer ring 3, and the sliding contact member 4 combined with one another. A series of the assembling operations can be accomplished by snap fit. In the case where a lubricant such as grease is applied to a sliding contact surface of the inner ring 2 and that of the sliding contact member 4, it is preferable to apply the lubricant thereto in advance before combining the sliding contact member 4 with the inner ring 2.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> shows a front view of the sliding contact member 4 and a sectional view thereof in its axial direction (direction shown by the arrow in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>).

The outer circumferential surface 4d (a straight line in the axial sectional view of the sliding contact member 4) of the sliding contact member 4 is brought into contact with the inner circumferential surface 3c of the outer ring 3 to prevent the sliding contact member 4 from being circumferentially dislocated, namely, to hold the sliding contact member 4 at the inner circumferential side of the outer ring 3. The one end surface 4b of the sliding contact member 4 is formed as a plain surface which contacts the end surface side inner surface 3b of the outer ring 3 to hold the sliding contact member 4 inside<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> the outer ring 3 without axially dislocating the sliding contact member 4.

Even in this case, by forming the butting portion 4f on the sliding contact member 4, it is possible to escape a thermal expansion thereof to the butting portion 4f when temperature is high. Therefore it is possible to prevent the sliding contact member 4 from being broken by a stress concentration. In combining the sliding contact member 4 with the inner ring 2 by the elastic deformation of the sliding contact member 4, the butting portion 4f expands.

The outer ring 3 has a flange 3e on its outer circumference. The flange 3e serves as a member for axially positioning the outer ring 3 inside a device such as a fixing device. By disposing the flange 3e at the side of the open portion 3d with respect to the center of the outer ring 3 in its axial direction, it is possible to enhance the mechanical strength of the end portion of the outer ring 3, namely, the open portion side thereof in its axial direction.

For example, it is possible to form a complementary fit-on construction on a portion of the sliding contact member 4 and a portion of the outer ring 3 to fixedly fit the sliding contact member 4 on the inner circumferential side of the outer ring 3.<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --></p><p id="p0057" num="0057">It is preferable that the outer ring 3 has a portion for stopping the rotation of the sliding contact member 4. The rotation-stopping portion holds the sliding contact member 4 unrotatably relative to the outer ring 3.

As the rotation-stopping portion, as described above, it is possible to form a fit-on construction complementary with the sliding contact member 4 on the pawl portions of the outer ring 3 and other portions thereof so that fit-on construction prevents the sliding contact member 4 from rotating. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>, it is possible to form a projection (rotation-stopping portion 3g) which can be fitted on the butting portion 4f of the sliding contact member 4 on a portion of the inner circumferential surface 3c of the outer ring 3. It is preferable to form the rotation-stopping portion 3g at a side opposite to a load-applied side. In <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref> showing the outer ring 3, four pawl portions 3a are formed.

As the synthetic resin to be used as the base resin of the resin composition forming the outer ring 3, it is possible to use synthetic resins similar to those for the sliding contact member. Of those, it is preferable to use at least one synthetic resin selected from among the PPS resin, the PEEK resin, the PAI resin, and the PI resin because these synthetic resins are excellent in the heat resistance thereof and can be used at temperatures up to about 200°C.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The resin composition forming the outer ring 3 is capable of containing a fibrous reinforcing material such as carbon fibers, aramid fibers, and glass fibers.

The resin composition forming the outer ring 3 is capable of containing an extender such as carbon black, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, talc, titanium oxide, silica, silicate, barium sulfate, and mica and other additives as necessary.

In this case, the curved surface 2a which slidingly contacts the sliding contact surface of the sliding contact member 4 is the rolling contact surface of the inner ring of the rolling bearing.

By making the inner ring 2 of the sintered metal, it is possible to obtain a high effect in retaining a lubricant applied to the sliding contact surface of the inner ring and that of the sliding contact member.

The curved surface 4a of the sliding contact member 4 and the outer circumferential surface 2a of the inner ring 2 are the sliding contact surfaces of the sliding bearing<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> 1. The rotation-stopping portion is formed on the outer ring 3 to hold the sliding contact member 4 unrotatably relative to the outer ring 3. Thereby the sliding contact member 4 rotates together with the outer ring 3 relative to the inner ring 2. Because the gap 3f is formed between the inner ring 2 and the outer ring 3, both members do not contact each other. Thus a direct frictional loss is not generated therebetween.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the curved outer circumferential surface 2a of the inner ring 2 is concave in its axial section, whereas the curved surface 4a of the sliding contact member 4 is convex in its axial section in correspondence to the curved outer circumferential surface 2a of the inner ring 2. By forming the inner ring 2 and the sliding contact member 4 in a complementary configuration, it is possible to prevent the outer ring 3 as well as the sliding contact member 4 from being axially dislocated from the inner ring 2. By forming the curved surface 4a of the sliding contact member 4 as the convex curved surface, it is possible to utilize an existing inner ring for use in the ball bearing as the inner ring 2, as described above.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">In the example of the sliding bearing of the present invention shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, in the sliding contact member 4, a non-curved surface portion 4e is formed along the entire circumference of a central portion of the curved surface 4a (convex curved surface) in the axial direction thereof. The<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> non-curved surface portion 4e has a flat configuration and is thus linear in the axial section of the sliding contact member 4. By forming the non-curved surface portion 4e, a space is secured between the non-curved surface portion 4e and the curved outer circumferential surface 2a of the inner ring 2. The space is formed as a lubricant-holding pocket 6 capable of holding the lubricant.

The sliding bearing 14 is a radial bearing. The sliding contact member 14 is an annular body, formed by molding a resin composition, which has one butting portion 14a. The outer ring 3 holds the sliding contact member 14 on its inner circumferential side with the outer ring 3 covering the sliding contact member 14. A projection 13a formed on the inner circumferential surface of the outer ring 13 is fitted on the butting portion 14a of the sliding contact member 14. Owing to the fitting of the projection 13a of the outer ring 13 on the butting portion 14a of the sliding contact member 14, the outer ring 13 holds the sliding contact member 14<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> circumferentially unrotatably relative thereto, and in addition, the sliding contact member 14 does not hold the inner ring 12 with the sliding contact surface of the former in close contact with that of the latter.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10</figref>, the inner ring 2 has a curved surface 12a formed along its outer circumference and a shaft-receiving hole 15 on which a supporting shaft fits on along its inner circumference. The sliding contact member 14 has on the inner circumference thereof a curved surface 14b which slidingly contacts the curved outer circumferential surface 12a of the inner ring 12 with the curved surface 14b being opposed to the curved surface 12a of the inner ring 12. The outer ring 13 is constructed of a bearing end surface 13b, a cylindrical portion 13c, and a flange 13d. A plurality of pawl portions 13f formed at the edge of an open portion 13e formed on a one end surface of the outer ring 13 is caught by a concave portion 14c formed on an end surface of the sliding contact member 14.

The sliding contact member 14 has on the inner circumference thereof the curved surface 14b which slidingly contacts the curved outer circumferential surface 12a of the<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> inner ring 12 with the curved surface 14b being opposed to the curved surface 12a of the inner ring 12. The sliding contact member 14 is made of resin. Thus in the case where the inner ring 12 is made of a metal, the linear coefficient of expansion of the sliding contact member 14 is different from that of the inner ring 12. Even in this case, because the sliding contact member 14 has the butting portion 14a formed thereon, it is possible to escape thermal expansion thereof to the butting portion 14a when the temperature is high. Therefore it is possible to prevent the sliding contact member 14 from being broken by stress concentration. In incorporating the sliding contact member 14 with the inner ring 2 by elastic deformation of the sliding contact member 14, the butting portion 14a is extended. Thus the sliding bearing is excellent in combining the inner ring 12 and the sliding contact member 14 with each other.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 12</figref>, at one side of the annular body of in its axial direction, the butting portion 14a has an abutting surface 14f disposed on a sectional surface of one end portion 14d thereof and an abutting surface 14g disposed on a sectional surface of the other end portion 14e thereof.

The stepped portions 14h and 14i fit on the projection of the outer ring 13. The projection formed on the inner circumferential surface of the outer ring 13 fits on a fit-on (hollow) portion 14j consisting of the stepped portions 14h and 14i. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 12</figref>, although the abutting surfaces 14f and 14g and the stepped portions 14h and 14i are so formed as to divide the sectional surface of each of the end portions 14d and 14e into two approximately equal portions in the axial direction of the annular body, it is possible to increase the axial length of one of the end portions 14d and 14e as necessary. Provided that the fit-on portion 14j is so configured that the projection of the outer ring can be fitted thereon, it is possible to arbitrarily set the circumferential length of each of the stepped portions 14h and 14i or the annular body may have a form in which the stepped portion is formed at only one of the end portions 14d and 14e of the annular body.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">It is preferable to form a hollow 14k at the center of a developed length of the inner circumference of the sliding contact member 14.

Because the dimension of the radius of the sliding contact member 14 is restrained by the outer ring and the housing, the developed length of the sliding<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> contact member 14 increases owing to the expansion thereof caused by the heating. The length of the gap of the butting portion is set small so that the gap (gap of butting portion) between the abutting surfaces 14f and 14g is closed when the developed length of the sliding contact member 14 is extended owing to the expansion thereof caused by the heating. Thereby when the gap of the butting portion is closed by heating the sliding contact member 14, the sliding contact member 14 generates a compressive stress in its circumferential direction and thus creeps. Therefore the dimension of the inner diameter of the sliding contact member 14 does not change when it is cooled. Thus the sliding contact member 14 does not hold the inner ring 12 with the sliding contact surface of the former in close contact with that of the latter. Consequently the rotation torque to be applied to the sliding bearing does not fluctuate.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">The sliding contact member 14 may be formed as an annular body having the butting portion 14a, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0016">Fig. 16</figref>. In the case where the sliding contact member 14 having this configuration is used (a form in which a projection or the like is not fitted on the butting portion 14a), the sliding contact member 14 has the following problem: Normally, because the gap of the butting portion 14a is widely set, the gap of the butting portion 14a does not close, even though the developed length of the sliding contact member is extended owing to the expansion of the sliding contact member 14 caused by the heating.<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> Therefore the sliding contact member 14 does not generate the compressive stress in its circumferential direction and thus does not creep. Because the sliding contact member 14 is heated by the heat of the heat roller, a molding stress is relaxed and thus the sliding contact member 14 deforms in a direction in which the gap of the butting portion 14a becomes short. Therefore when the sliding contact member 14 is cooled, the dimension of the inner diameter thereof changes to a low extent and thus the outer ring 14 holds the inner ring with the sliding contact surface of the former in close contact with that of the latter. As a result, a high rotation torque is applied to the sliding bearing.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">By using test sliding bearings shown in <figref idrefs="f0016">Fig. 16</figref>, the following test was conducted to examine the difference between the degree of close contact made between the sliding contact surface of the inner ring of one test sliding bearing and that of the sliding contact member thereof and the degree of close contact made between the sliding contact surface of the inner ring of the other test sliding bearing and that of the sliding contact member thereof. Two test sliding bearings A and B were produced by using a molded body (PPS resin 60 + glass fiber 30 (wt%)) consisting of a PPS resin composition as the outer ring, a molded body (PPS resin 60 + PTFE resin 35 + graphite 5 (wt%)) consisting of the PPS resin composition as the sliding contact member, and an inner ring (material: SUJ2) for use in a thin<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> deep groove ball bearing #6805 as the inner ring.

Thus by narrowly setting the gap of the butting portion, it is possible to prevent the sliding contact member from holding the inner ring with the sliding contact surface of the former in close contact with that of the latter. Because the gap of the butting portion is not a portion on which other member fits, it is easy to control the dimension of the gap of the butting portion and narrowly set the gap thereof. Because the gap between the abutting surfaces 14f and 14g of the butting portion closes earlier than the gap between the fit-on portion 14j and the projection 13a, the sliding contact member is prevented from holding the inner ring with the sliding contact surface of the former in close contact with that of the latter.

As described above, by setting the circumferential length W<sub>2</sub> of the fit-on portion 14j longer than the circumferential length W<sub>3</sub> of the projection 13a, it is possible to secure the performance of combining the sliding contact member with the outer ring and prevent the rotation torque from fluctuating without severely controlling the length of the gap.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">It is preferable to set the length W<sub>1</sub> of the gap between the abutting surfaces 14f and 14g before the sliding contact member is combined with the outer ring equally to the length<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> W<sub>1</sub> of the gap between the abutting surfaces 14f and 14g after the sliding contact member is combined with the outer ring. Thereby it is possible to allow the gap between the sliding contact member 14 and the inner ring 12 to be uniform when both members have been combined with each other and prevent the rotation torque from becoming high and fluctuating.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">Based on <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10</figref>, the sliding contact surface of the inner ring 12 and that of the sliding contact member 14 are described in detail below. In the sliding bearing 11, the curved surface 14a of the sliding contact member 14 and the curved outer circumferential surface 12a of the inner ring 12 are the sliding contact surfaces. Because the sliding contact member 14 is unrotatably held by the outer ring 13, the sliding contact member 14 rotates together with the outer ring 3 relative to the inner ring 2. The inner ring 2 and the sliding contact member 14 contact each other. Because the gap 13g is formed between the inner ring 12 and the outer ring 13, both members 12 and 13 do not contact each other.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10</figref>, the curved outer circumferential surface 12a of the inner ring 12 is concave in its axial section, whereas the curved surface 14b of the sliding contact member 14 is convex in its axial section in correspondence to the curved outer circumferential surface 12a of the inner ring 12. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10</figref>, in the sliding contact member 14, a non-curved surface portion 14m is<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --> formed along the entire circumference of the central portion of the curved surface 14b (convex curved surface) in its axial direction. The non-curved surface portion 14m has a flat configuration and is thus linear in the axial section of the sliding contact member 14. A space formed between the non-curved surface portion 14m and the curved outer circumferential surface 12a of the inner ring 12 serves as a lubricant-holding pocket 16 capable of holding the lubricant. The details of the concave and convex configurations are similar to those shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">In the above-described sliding bearings having different forms, it is preferable to apply a lubricant such as lubricating oil or grease to the sliding contact surface of the inner ring and that of the sliding contact member. Because the sliding bearing of the present invention has the construction in which the sliding contact member made of resin is interposed between the inner ring and the outer ring, the sliding bearing has a low frictional property. It is possible to decrease the frictional torque to a further extent by applying the lubricant to the sliding contact surfaces. Consequently it is possible to prevent seizing of the sliding contact member and thus significantly lengthen the life of the sliding bearing. In the case where the lubricant is applied to the sliding contact surfaces, it is preferable to form the above-described lubricant-holding pocket thereon. By forming the<!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --> lubricant-holding pocket, the lubricant is held therein and thus can be stably supplied to the sliding contact surfaces for a long term.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">It is preferable to dispose the lubricant-holding pockets 6 and 16 on the sliding contact surface of the sliding contact members 4 and that of the sliding contact member 14 respectively, namely, on a portion of each of the curved surfaces 4a and 14b to which a load is applied. In the present invention, "the portion to which the load is applied" means the portion to which the load is applied to the highest degree. By disposing the lubricant-holding pocket to this portion which affects the lubricating property, the lubricant is effectively utilized. In the forms shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0010">10</figref>, the neighborhood of the apex of the circular arc of each of the curved surfaces 4a and 14b is the portion to which the load is applied. The lubricant-holding pockets 6 and 16 are positioned at the portion to which the load is applied.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">The configuration of the lubricant-holding pocket to be formed on the sliding contact surface of the sliding contact member may be dimple (hole) -shaped or groove-shaped in addition to the non-curved surface portion, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0010">10</figref>. The lubricant-holding pocket may be formed in combination of the non-curved surface portion, the dimple, and the groove. It is possible to form a desired number of the dimples and the grooves. The groove may be formed axially or circumferentially.<!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --> It is preferable to set the width of the groove to 0.1 to 5% of the inner circumference of the sliding contact member 14. In the case where the axial section of the curved surface of the sliding contact member is circular arc-shaped, it is preferable to set the depth of the groove to 5 to 100% of the radius of the circular arc of the curved surface. It is preferable to set the diameter of the dimple to 1 to 80% of the axial length of the curved surface of the sliding contact member. In the case where the axial section of the curved surface of the sliding contact member is circular arc-shaped, it is preferable to set the depth of the dimple to 5 to 100% of the radius of the circular arc. In the case of the sliding bearing having the form shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, a groove 4g is axially formed at a portion opposed to the position of the butting portion 4f of the sliding contact member 4. In this case, the lubricant-holding pocket includes the groove 4g.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093"><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> is a partly enlarged view of the inner circumferential surface of the sliding contact member where a groove-shaped lubricant-holding pocket having a form different from the above-described one is formed. The lubricant-holding pocket shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> is constructed of a plurality of two-row rectangular grooves 6a formed on the entire circumference of the curved surface 4a of the inner circumference of the sliding contact member 4. Two grooves 6a arranged side by side has the shape of a katakana character "<img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="6" he="3" img-content="character" img-format="tif" inline="yes"/>".

When the sliding contact member 4 rotates, the lubricant enclosed between the sliding contact member 4 and the inner ring moves with the lubricant being gathered toward the upper side of the katakana character "<img id="ib0003" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="6" he="3" img-content="character" img-format="tif" inline="yes"/>" from the lower side thereof. Because the upper side of the katakana character "<img id="ib0004" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="6" he="3" img-content="character" img-format="tif" inline="yes"/>" is positioned at a central portion of the curved surface 4a of the sliding contact member 4 in the width direction thereof, the lubricant moves to the central portion of the curved surface 4a of the sliding contact member in its width direction when the sliding contact member 4 rotates. That "when the sliding contact member 4 rotates" means the time when the sliding contact member 4 rotates relative to the inner ring 2 and includes the time when the sliding contact member 4 is fixed and the inner ring 2 rotates.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">It is preferable to form each groove 6a as an inclined groove in which the groove 6a becomes deeper from a rectangular side 6b of the groove 6a at the rotational direction side of the sliding contact member 4 toward a side 6c thereof opposed to the rectangular side 6b thereof. By forming the groove 6a deeper from the rotational direction side of the sliding contact member 4 toward the opposite side thereof, the lubricant can be collected easily as compared with a case in which the groove 6a is not inclined, when the sliding contact member 4 rotates.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">By forming the lubricant-holding pocket having the<!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --> above-described form on the sliding contact surface of the sliding contact member, a film consisting of the lubricant is easily and continuously formed at the widthwise central portion of the sliding bearing where a load is applied to the sliding bearing to the highest extent. Thereby it is possible to obtain a rotation which is smooth with a low frictional torque being applied to the sliding bearing. By appropriately selecting the dimple and the groove in consideration of a situation in which the load is applied to the sliding bearing and the lubrication properties based on the number of rotations of the sliding bearing when the sliding bearing is operated and determining the size of the dimple and the groove, the position where they are disposed, and the number thereof, it is possible to hold the lubricant in the lubricant-holding pocket sufficiently and without waste. Although there is a case in which abrasion powder is generated because the sliding contact member is made of resin and the sliding contact member and the inner ring slidingly contact each other, the lubricant-holding pocket is capable of accommodating the generated abrasion powder. Therefore it is possible to allow the sliding bearing to rotate at a low frictional torque.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">In the sliding bearing of the present invention, as grease which is a lubricant to be applied to the sliding contact surface of the inner ring and that of the sliding contact member, it is possible to use grease to be normally used for the sliding<!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --> bearing without limitation. For example, it is possible to list mineral oil such as paraffin-based mineral oil and naphthene-based mineral oil; hydrocarbon-based synthetic oil such as polybutene oil, poly-a olefin oil, alkylbenzene oil, alkylnaphthalene oil, alicyclic compounds; and non-hydrocarbon-based synthetic oil such as natural fat and oil, polyol ester oil, phosphate ester, diester oil, polyglycol oil, silicone oil, polyphenyl ether oil, alkyldiphenyl ether oil, and fluorinated oil. These base oils may be used singly or in combination of not less than two kinds thereof.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">As a thickener for the grease, it is possible to list metal soap-based thickener such as aluminum soap, lithium soap, sodium soap, lithium complex soap, calcium complex soap, and aluminum complex soap; urea compounds such as a diurea compound and a polyurea compound; and fluororesin powder such as PTFE resin. These thickeners may be used singly or in combination of not less than two kinds thereof.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">Because the sliding bearing of the present invention is used to support the fixing roller and the like mounted on an image-forming apparatus and operated at high temperatures, the grease is also required to have heat resistance. Thus of the above-described greases, it is preferable to use fluorine grease composed of fluorinated oil serving as its base oil and fluororesin powder serving as its thickener or urea grease containing a urea compound serving as its thickener. It is<!-- EPO <DP n="55"> --> possible to use grease consisting of a mixture of the fluorine grease and the urea grease.
