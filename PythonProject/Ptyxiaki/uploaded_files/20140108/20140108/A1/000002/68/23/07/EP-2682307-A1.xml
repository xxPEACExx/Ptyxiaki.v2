The barrier net anchoring bracket is disposed at a position that overlaps with the inflator as viewed in the vehicle width direction and is fixed to the roof side rail. The upper anchor portion provided at the barrier net is anchored at this barrier net anchoring portion. Thus, the vehicle cabin is divided between front and rear by the barrier net.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the present invention, as described above, the barrier net anchoring bracket is disposed at a position that overlaps with the inflator as viewed in the vehicle width direction. Therefore, space for arrangement of the inflator and the barrier net anchoring bracket at the roof side rail between the center pillar and the rear seat assist grip may be easily assured.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A component arrangement structure at a roof side rail relating to a second aspect of the invention is the component arrangement structure at a roof side rail according to the first aspect, in which the barrier net anchoring bracket includes a body fixing portion that is fixed to the roof side rail, and a barrier net anchoring portion that is disposed at the vehicle width direction inner side relative to the body fixing portion and at which the upper anchor portion is to be anchored, and the inflator is disposed between the body fixing portion and the barrier net anchoring portion.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the roof side rail component arrangement structure of the second aspect, the inflator is disposed between the body fixing portion and barrier net anchoring portion that are provided at the barrier net anchoring bracket. Thus, because the inflator is disposed within the cross section of the barrier net anchoring bracket, space for arrangement of the inflator and the barrier net anchoring bracket may be reduced.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A component arrangement structure at a roof side rail relating to a third aspect of the invention is the component arrangement structure at a roof side rail according to the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> second aspect, in which the barrier net anchoring bracket forms an open cross-section shape that opens to the lower side.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the roof side rail component arrangement structure of the third aspect, the inflator may be easily inserted between the body fixing portion and the barrier net anchoring portion from the lower side, using the opening in the barrier net anchoring bracket. Therefore, the work characteristics of assembly of the inflator to the roof side rail may be assured while the space for arrangement of the inflator and the barrier net anchoring bracket may be reduced.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A component arrangement structure at a roof side rail relating to a fourth aspect of the invention is the component arrangement structure at a roof side rail according to the second aspect or the third aspect, in which an inclined portion that extends diagonally to the lower side and to the vehicle width direction outer side, so as to follow along an inner panel of the roof side rail, is provided at a vehicle width direction outer side end portion of a ceiling member of the vehicle cabin, and the barrier net anchoring bracket is disposed between the inclined portion and the inner panel, the body fixing portion is inclined along the inner panel, and the barrier net anchoring portion is inclined along the inclined portion.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the roof side rail component arrangement structure of the fourth aspect, the body fixing portion of the barrier net anchoring bracket is inclined along the inner panel of the roof side rail. Therefore, a contact area between the inner panel and the body fixing portion may be assuredly large, and a strength of fixing of the barrier net anchoring bracket to the roof side rail may be improved. In addition, in this aspect, the barrier net anchoring portion of the barrier net anchoring bracket is inclined along the inclined portion provided at the ceiling member (roof head lining). Therefore, a contact area between the inclined portion of the ceiling member and the barrier net anchoring portion may be assuredly large, and unwanted flexing of the ceiling member ("sagging") may be suppressed.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A component arrangement structure at a roof side rail relating to a fifth aspect of the invention is the component arrangement structure at a roof side rail according to any one of the second to fourth aspects, in which the body fixing portion is disposed at a position at which a portion thereof that is attached and fixed to the roof side rail does not overlap with the barrier net anchoring portion or the inflator as viewed in an attachment direction.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the roof side rail component arrangement structure of the fifth aspect, when the body fixing portion of the barrier net anchoring bracket is attached and fixed to the roof side rail by the structure described above, interference between the barrier net anchoring portion and the inflator may be avoided. Therefore, the work characteristics of assembly of the barrier net anchoring bracket to the roof side rail may be excellent.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A component arrangement structure at a roof side rail relating to a sixth aspect of the invention is the component arrangement structure at a roof side rail according to any one of the second to fifth aspects, in which an anchoring hole at which the upper anchor portion is to be fitted and anchored is formed in the barrier net anchoring portion, a resin cover is mounted at the barrier net anchoring portion, and the ceiling member of the vehicle cabin is sandwiched between the resin cover and the barrier net anchoring portion, the resin cover being provided with a door that is closable and openable between a closed position that covers the anchoring hole from the vehicle cabin inner side and an open position at which the anchoring hole is exposed to the vehicle cabin inner side.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the roof side rail component arrangement structure of the sixth aspect, the anchoring hole in which the upper anchor portion of the barrier net is fitted and anchored is formed in the barrier net anchoring portion of the barrier net anchoring bracket, and the resin cover is mounted at the barrier net anchoring portion. The door that is capable of closing and opening, between the closed position that covers the anchoring hole from the vehicle<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> cabin inner side thereof and the open position at which the anchoring hole is exposed to the vehicle cabin inner side, is provided at the resin cover. Therefore, by the door being disposed at the closed position when the barrier net is not in use, the anchoring hole may be prevented from being seen from the vehicle cabin inner side. In addition, the ceiling member (roof head lining) of the vehicle cabin is sandwiched between the resin cover and the barrier net anchoring portion. Therefore, unwanted flexing of the ceiling member ("sagging") may be suppressed.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A component arrangement structure at a roof side rail relating to a seventh aspect of the invention is the component arrangement structure at a roof side rail according to any one of the second to sixth aspects, further including a protector that is disposed between the barrier net anchoring portion and the inflator, that is mounted to the barrier net anchoring portion, and that prevents the upper anchor portion from abutting against the inflator.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the roof side rail component arrangement structure of the seventh aspect, when the upper anchor portion provided at the barrier net is being fitted and anchored at the anchoring hole formed in the barrier net anchoring portion of the barrier net anchoring bracket, abutting of the upper anchor portion against the inflator is prevented by the protector. Therefore, damage to the inflator by the upper anchor portion may be prevented.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A component arrangement structure at a roof side rail relating to an eighth aspect of the invention is the component arrangement structure at a roof side rail according to any one of the first to seventh aspects, in which the inflator is disposed in a state in which a length direction thereof is along the vehicle front-rear direction, and the inflator is fixed to the roof side rail via mounting brackets at both a vehicle forward side and a vehicle rearward side of the barrier net anchoring bracket.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the roof side rail component arrangement structure of the eighth aspect, the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> inflator that is disposed with the length direction thereof along the vehicle front-rear direction is fixed to the roof side rail via the mounting brackets that are at both the vehicle forward side and the vehicle rearward side of the barrier net anchoring bracket.

The airbag ECU is electronically connected to a side impact sensor and a rollover sensor installed in the vehicle. When the sensors detect a side impact condition or a rollover condition of the vehicle, a detection signal is outputted to the airbag ECU. The airbag ECU determines whether or not to operate the curtain airbag device 40. If the result of this determination is positive, a predetermined current is supplied to the inflator 46 and the inflator 46 operates. Hence, gas is ejected through a gas ejection portion 46A (see <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>) that is provided at the front end portion of the inflator 46, and the gas is introduced through the gas introduction portion 42B into the airbag main body 42A.
