In this vehicle front portion structure, a catalytic converter, for purifying the exhaust gas of an engine that structures the power unit, is disposed within a floor tunnel.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Further, there is known a cooling system that circulates coolant between an exhaust heat recovery device and a heater core while bypassing the engine (e.g., Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2008208716A"><text>2008-208716</text></patcit>, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2010007570A"><text>2010-007570</text></patcit>).</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0004">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">By the way, in order to cause the catalyst within the catalytic converter to exhibit the ability to purify the exhaust gas, the catalyst must be heated to a predetermined temperature (hereinafter called the "activation temperature") or higher. However, in the aforementioned vehicle front portion structures, the catalytic converter is apart from the engine. Therefore, immediately after start-up of the engine at which the temperature of the exhaust gas is low, or the like, there is the possibility that it may take time until the catalyst is heated to the activation temperature or higher by the heat of the exhaust gas.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">On the other hand, if the temperature of the catalyst rises too much, the catalyst thermally deteriorates, and there is the possibility that the purifying ability will deteriorate.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In consideration of the above-described circumstances, an object of the present invention is to obtain a vehicle front portion structure that, while suppressing thermal deterioration of a catalyst, can heat the catalyst to the activation temperature or higher at an early stage.</p><heading id="h0005">Solution to Problem</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><p id="p0007" num="0007">A vehicle front portion structure relating to a first aspect of the present invention comprises: a power unit that is disposed in a power unit compartment provided at a vehicle front portion, and that includes an internal combustion engine that generates driving force that causes a vehicle to travel; a cooling unit that is disposed at a rear side in a vehicle longitudinal direction with respect to the power unit, and that is cooled by heat exchange with air; a fan that is disposed at a rear in the vehicle longitudinal direction of the cooling unit, and that, by being operated, generates cooling wind that passes through the cooling unit and is discharged to a vehicle exterior; an exhaust purifying device that is disposed at a rear side in the vehicle longitudinal direction with respect to the power unit, and that has a catalyst that purifies exhaust gas discharged from the internal combustion engine; a heat retaining member that surrounds a periphery of the exhaust purifying device, and in which is formed an air intake port that takes-in, into an interior, air that cools the exhaust purifying device; and a communication portion that communicates the interior of the heat retaining member and a space between the cooling unit and the fan.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In accordance with the above-described aspect, due to the periphery of the exhaust purifying device being surrounded by the heat retaining member, the catalyst of the exhaust purifying device can be heated at an early stage to the activation temperature or higher by the heat of the exhaust gas discharged from the internal combustion engine, as compared with a case in which the periphery of the exhaust purifying device is not surrounded by the heat retaining member. Accordingly, for example, immediately after start-up of the internal combustion engine at which the temperature of the exhaust gas is low, or the like, the catalyst can be made to exhibit an exhaust gas purifying ability at an early stage.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">On the other hand, the air intake port is formed in the heat retaining member. Further, the interior of the heat retaining member, and the space between the cooling unit and the fan, are communicated by the communication portion. Therefore, when the fan is operated, cooling wind, that passes through the cooling unit and is discharged to the exterior of the vehicle, is generated, and negative pressure is generated at the communication portion. Due to this negative pressure, air at the interior of the heat retaining member is discharged to the exterior of the vehicle via the communication portion, and air is taken-into the interior of the heat retaining member from the air intake port. Namely, when the fan is operated, the interior of the heat retaining member is ventilated, and the exhaust purifying device that is disposed at the interior of the heat retaining member is cooled. Accordingly, by causing the fan to operate, thermal deterioration of the catalyst can be suppressed.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In this way, in accordance with the present aspect, the catalyst of the exhaust purifying device can be heated to the activation temperature or higher at an early stage, while thermal deterioration of the catalyst is suppressed.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In a vehicle front portion structure relating to a second aspect of the present invention, in the vehicle front portion structure relating to the above-described first aspect, the exhaust purifying device is disposed at a front side in the vehicle longitudinal direction with respect to a dash panel that divides the power unit compartment and a vehicle cabin.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In accordance with the above-described aspect, by disposing the exhaust purifying device at the front side in the vehicle longitudinal direction with respect to the dash panel, the distance between the internal combustion engine and the exhaust purifying device is short and heat loss of the exhaust gas is reduced, as compared with a case in which the exhaust purifying device is disposed at the rear side in the vehicle longitudinal direction with respect to the dash panel. Accordingly, the catalyst of the exhaust purifying device can be heated to the activation temperature or higher at an early stage.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In a vehicle front portion structure relating to a third aspect of the present invention, in the vehicle front portion structure relating to the above-described second aspect, the exhaust purifying device is disposed with a longitudinal direction thereof being a vehicle transverse direction.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In accordance with the above-described aspect, by disposing the exhaust purifying device with the longitudinal direction thereof being the vehicle transverse direction, the exhaust purifying device can be set near to the internal combustion engine, that is a heat source, along the entire length in the longitudinal direction of the exhaust purifying device, as compared with a case in which the exhaust purifying device is disposed with the longitudinal direction thereof being the vehicle longitudinal direction. Accordingly, the catalyst of the exhaust purifying device can be heated to the activation temperature or higher at an even earlier stage.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In a vehicle front portion structure relating to a fourth aspect of the present invention, the vehicle front portion structure relating to the above-described second aspect or the above-described third aspect comprises: a temperature detecting portion that detects a temperature of the catalyst; and a control section that causes the fan to operate when the temperature of the catalyst detected by the temperature detecting portion is greater than or equal to a predetermined value.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In accordance with the above-described aspect, the control section causes the fan to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> operate when the temperature of the catalyst detected by the temperature detecting portion is greater than or equal to a predetermined value. When the fan is operated, as described above, negative pressure is generated at the communication portion, and air at the interior of the heat retaining member is discharged to the exterior of the vehicle via the communication portion, and air is taken-into the interior of the heat retaining member from the air intake port. Namely, when the fan is operated, the interior of the heat retaining member is ventilated, and the exhaust purifying device that is disposed at the interior of the heat retaining member is cooled. Accordingly, thermal deterioration of the catalyst is suppressed.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In a vehicle front portion structure relating to a fifth aspect of the present invention, the vehicle front portion structure relating to any one of the above-described second aspect through fourth aspect comprises: a shroud that covers the space between the cooling unit and the fan, and in which a connection port, into which the communication portion is inserted, is formed, wherein the communication portion is provided at the heat retaining member, and the heat retaining member is supported at the exhaust purifying device or a pipe that is connected to the exhaust purifying device, so as to be able to be displaced relative to the shroud.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In accordance with the above-described aspect, the heat retaining member is supported at the exhaust purifying device so as to be able to be displaced relative to the shroud. Accordingly, even if the heat retaining member vibrates integrally with the exhaust purifying device due to, for example, vibrations that propagate from the internal combustion engine or vibrations that accompany traveling of the vehicle, damage to the connection port of the shroud and the communication portion is suppressed.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In a vehicle front portion structure relating to a sixth aspect of the present invention, the vehicle front portion structure relating to any one of the above-described second aspect through fourth aspect comprises: a shroud that covers the space between the cooling unit and the fan, and in which a connection port, into which the communication portion is inserted, is formed, wherein the communication portion is provided at the heat retaining member, and the heat retaining member is supported at the shroud, so as to be able to be displaced relative to the exhaust purifying device.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In accordance with the above-described aspect, the heat retaining member is supported at the shroud so as to be able to be displaced relative to the exhaust purifying device. Accordingly, even if the heat retaining member vibrates integrally with the exhaust purifying device due to, for example, vibrations that propagate from the internal combustion engine or vibrations that accompany traveling of the vehicle, damage to the connection port of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the shroud and the communication portion is suppressed.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In a vehicle front portion structure relating to a seventh aspect of the present invention, in the vehicle front portion structure relating to any one of the above-described second aspect through sixth aspect, the cooling unit is structured to include a radiator core that exchanges heat between air and coolant, that circulates between the radiator core and the internal combustion engine, and cools the coolant.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In accordance with the above-described aspect, the cooling unit is structured to include the radiator core. By ventilating the air at the interior of the heat retaining member by using the fan that cools this radiator core, thermal deterioration of the catalyst of the exhaust purifying device can be suppressed while the number of parts is reduced.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Further, by disposing the radiator core at the rear side in the vehicle longitudinal direction with respect to the power unit, the power unit can be moved toward the front side in the vehicle longitudinal direction, as compared with a case in which the radiator core is disposed at the front side in the vehicle longitudinal direction with respect to the power unit. Due thereto, it is easy to ensure space for setting the exhaust purifying device at the front side in the vehicle longitudinal direction with respect to the dash panel.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In a vehicle front portion structure relating to an eighth aspect of the present invention, the vehicle front portion structure relating to the above-described seventh aspect comprises: a heater core that exchanges heat between the coolant and air for air conditioning, and heats the air for air conditioning; and an exhaust heat recovery device that exchanges heat between the coolant, that bypasses the internal combustion engine and the radiator core and circulates between the exhaust heat recovery device and the heater core, and exhaust gas, that is discharged from the exhaust purifying device, and heats the coolant.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In accordance with the above-described aspect, the coolant is heated by heat being exchanged, by the exhaust heat recovery device, between the coolant and the exhaust gas that is discharged from the exhaust purifying device. Air for air conditioning is heated by this coolant, that has been heated, exchanging heat with the air for air conditioning at the heater core.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Accordingly, for example, immediately after start-up of the internal combustion engine at which the temperature of the coolant is low, or the like, the temperature of the coolant can be raised at an early stage by causing the coolant to bypass the internal combustion engine and the radiator core and circulate between the exhaust recovery device and the heater core. As a result, the temperature of the air for air conditioning can be raised<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> at an early stage.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Further, as described above, the exhaust purifying device is surrounded by the heat retaining member.
