For a solid solution temperature, the lower limit or the upper limit thereof is determined by a combination of materials or a composition of solvents.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">By removing a metal while maintaining the heating of a solid solution, carbon that is not able to remain dissolved any more in the solid solution precipitates keeping its high mobility to grow graphene on a substrate. On this occasion, high mobility carbon moves to graphene first nucleated by removal of a metal, and becomes incorporated to increase the crystal grain size of the graphene, while suppressing new nucleation of the graphene.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As a metal to be used as a solvent for a solid solution according to the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> present invention, it is possible that a pure metal composed of a single metal element, an alloy composed of a plurality of metal elements, and also an alloy composed of a metal element and a nonmetallic element be applied. Namely, it is possible that a solvent, which dissolves carbon as a solute for a solid solution and contains a metal as its main component, be applied as a solvent for a solid solution.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Further, it is possible that a production method according to the present invention be so constituted that, in the forming step, a reducing agent that is able to reduce an oxide of the metal is supplied, and in the removing step, the metal contained in the solid solution layer is removed by supplying an etching gas. If etching is carried out long enough to remove all of metals contained in a solid solution layer according to the production method, graphene comes to touch directly a substrate without intercalating a metal. Due to various causes it is possible that a metal oxide be generated in a solid solution layer, but according to the present production method, a supplied reducing agent prevents the metal oxide from remaining on a substrate, and good quality graphene is able to be obtained.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Further, it is possible that a production method according to the present invention be so constituted, that, in the forming step, an initial layer comprising carbon is formed on the substrate, a metallic layer comprising the metal is formed on the formed initial layer, and the formed initial layer and the formed metallic layer are heated to the solid solution temperature to form the solid solution layer. Namely, in this production method, an initial layer is composed of carbon alone, or a material containing carbon (for example, mixture of carbon and a metal), and a metallic layer is composed of a metal alone, or a material containing a metal (for example, an alloy of metals, or an alloy of a metal and a nonmetal). First the initial layer is formed, and then the metallic layer is formed.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Further, it is possible that a production method according to the present invention be so constituted, that, in the forming step a metallic layer comprising the metal<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> is formed on the substrate, an initial layer comprising carbon is formed on the formed metallic layer, and the formed initial layer and the formed metallic layer are heated to the solid solution temperature to form the solid solution layer. Namely, in this production method, as in the above mode, an initial layer is composed of carbon alone, or a material containing carbon (for example, mixture of carbon and a metal), and a metallic layer is composed of a metal alone, or a material containing a metal (for example, an alloy of metals, or an alloy of a metal and a nonmetal). However, in the current production method, a metallic layer is first formed and then the initial layer is formed.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Further, it is possible that a production method according to the present invention be so constituted, that, in the forming step an initial layer comprising a mixture of the metal and carbon is formed on the substrate, and the formed initial layer is heated to the solid solution temperature to form the solid solution layer. Namely, in this production method, different from the above modes, a mixture of carbon and a metal is used as an initial layer. Namely, a mixture of carbon and a metal is heated to form a solid solution layer, in which carbon is dissolved in a metal. In the current production method formation of an independent metallic layer is not necessary.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Further, it is possible that a production method according to the present invention be so constituted, that, in the forming step the initial layer is formed into a predetermined pattern, so as to form the graphene in the predetermined pattern.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Further, it is possible that a production method according to the present invention be so constituted, that, in the forming step the initial layer is formed to cover all or a part of a surface of the substrate, so as to form the graphene into a uniform continuous film covering all or a part of the surface of the substrate.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Further, it is possible that a production method according to the present invention be so constituted, that a concentration distribution in a direction parallel to a surface of the substrate among concentration distributions of the carbon in the solid solution layer is made inhomogeneous, so as to grow the graphene in the direction<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> parallel to the surface of the substrate. In this regard, it is possible that the concentration distribution in a direction not parallel to the surface of the substrate be uniform or inhomogeneous.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Further, it is possible that a production method according to the present invention be so constituted, that the thickness of at least one of the formed initial layer and the formed metallic layer is made inhomogeneous, so as to make a concentration distribution in a direction parallel to a surface of the substrate among concentration distributions of the carbon in the solid solution layer inhomogeneous, and to grow the graphene in the direction parallel to the surface of the substrate. According to the present invention, a solid solution layer is formed from an initial layer and a metallic layer, because carbon in the initial layer is dissolved by heating in a metal in the metallic layer. In this case, it is desirable to adjust a heating condition, so that, in forming a solid solution layer, carbon is able to move over a submicrometer distance to mix with a substrate in a vertical direction, but is not able to move a few µm or more to mix in a direction parallel to a substrate. With such an adjustment, and, for example, in the event that the thickness of an initial layer is made uniform and the thickness of a metallic layer is made nonunifrom, the carbon concentration of a solid solution layer at an area, where the metallic layer has been thick, becomes low, and at an area, where the metallic layer has been thin, the carbon concentration of a solid solution layer becomes high. Furthermore, in the event that the thickness of an initial layer is made nonunifrom and the thickness of a metallic layer is made uniform, the carbon concentration of a solid solution layer at an area, where the metallic layer has been thick, becomes high, and at an area, where the metallic layer has been thin, the carbon concentration of a solid solution layer becomes low. When a metal is removed, graphene grows from a zone where the carbon concentration is high toward a zone where the carbon concentration is low. In this regard, it is possible that the concentration distribution in a direction not parallel to a surface of the substrate be either uniform or inhomogeneous.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Further, it is possible that a production method according to the present invention be so constituted, that the thickness of the formed metallic layer is provided with a gradient, so as to grow the graphene in the direction of a component parallel to the surface of the substrate among directions of the gradient. The current invention is a favorable embodiment of the above inventions for attaining reduction of the production cost or the like, by means of a construction technique by which a gradient is provided in the thickness of the metallic layer.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Further, it is possible that a production method according to the present invention be so constituted, that the metallic layer comprises a first region extending parallel over a surface of the substrate and a second region extending parallel over a surface of the substrate, the two regions being connected by a constriction, the first region having smaller thickness of the metallic layer than the second region, and the second region being provided with a gradient in the thickness of the metallic layer, which increases with the distance from the constriction.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Further, it is possible that a production method according to the present invention be so constituted, that a concentration distribution of the supplied etching gas in a direction parallel to a surface of the substrate is made inhomogeneous, so as to grow the graphene in the direction parallel to the surface of the substrate.

In this regard, an "element" means herein a component that preforms a function, and a "device" means a component constituted with one or plural elements, respectively.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The graphene 102 of the first example forms a single crystal in a range surrounded by crystal grain boundaries 104 (in the current figure, depicted as thick dotted lines). The regions surrounded by crystal grain boundaries 104 have different shapes each other, this is because the graphene 102 has grown randomly on a surface of the substrate 103.

Further, the area of a single crystal of the graphene 102 is able to be made by far larger than that in the past.

Further, by a conventional technique, in which graphene is once transcribed to a broad region of a substrate and then etched for patterning, the substrate is damaged in etching the graphene, which is especially problematic for application to a multilayer substrate. Meanwhile, by a production method according to the present application as described below, a simplified production process without etching of graphene is adopted, and therefore there occurs no such a<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> problem.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Therefore the pattern is able to substitute for not only fine wiring by copper or aluminum but also a transparent electrode by indium tin oxide (ITO).</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">For example, in the case of a liquid crystal display, an application, in which glass is used as a substrate 103 and a transparent electrode composed of graphene 102 is formed directly on a surface of the glass in a pattern shape, is possible.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Further, the substrate 103 is not limited to a monolayer, and a multilayer structure provided with wiring or an object of conduction in each layer is possible.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Namely, it is possible that a substrate 103 be formed as a multilayer structure composed of semiconductors, wiring, insulation films in a semiconductor integrated circuit, and it is possible that graphene 102 be utilized as fine wiring connecting the respective elements in the multilayer structure.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">Additionally, if wiring or an object of conduction is placed on the back side of a substrate 103, wiring penetrating the substrate 103 is to be provided and the wiring is able to be connected by graphene 102.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Further, graphene 102 is able to be utilized as a transfer path for an electron or a positive hole, such as channel between a source and a drain of a field effect transistor.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram depicting a cross-section of a field effect transistor utilizing graphene on a substrate according to the present embodiment.

The variations thereof will be described in more detail in the<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> following Examples.</p><p id="p0124" num="0124">First of all, formation of a second mask 503 is not prerequisite. For example, after forming the carbon layer 502 and without removing the first mask 501, it is possible that the metallic layer 504 be formed. Alternatively, after removing the first mask 501, it is possible that the metallic layer 504 be immediately formed covering the surfaces of the substrate 103 and the carbon layer 502.</p><p id="p0125" num="0125">If graphene 102 is to be formed on the entire surface of the substrate 103, the first mask 501 or the second mask 503 is not required to be formed. After the carbon layer 502 is formed over the entire surface of the substrate 103, the metallic layer 504 should be formed thereon.</p><p id="p0126" num="0126">Although in the above mode the carbon layer 502 and the metallic layer 504 are formed in separate stages, it is possible that a mixture of a carbon and a metal be supplied after the first mask 501 is formed. In this case, by removing the first mask 501 a mixture layer having the same shape with the desired pattern is obtained as an initial layer.</p><p id="p0127" num="0127">For forming such a mixture layer a co-deposition technique of a metal and carbon is able to be adopted. For example, sputtering is performed using simultaneously 2 targets, the one composed of a metal and the other composed of carbon. Alternatively, when sputtering is performed using a single target, it is possible that a target of a mixture of carbon and iron be used, or it is possible that sputtering be performed using a target composed of iron attached with a carbon chip, or it is possible that sputtering be performed using a target composed of carbon attached with an iron chip. In the mode using an attached chip, by adjusting the number of attached chips, the carbon concentration in a mixture layer as an initial layer is able to be easily adjusted.</p><p id="p0128" num="0128">It is possible that the order of formation of a carbon layer 502 and a metallic layer 504 be exchanged. Namely, a technique that the metallic layer 504 is formed on the substrate 103 and then the carbon layer 502 is formed on the metallic layer 504, is<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> possible. In this case the carbon layer 502 corresponds to an initial layer.</p><p id="p0129" num="0129">Moreover there is a technique as below, by which the pattern shape of an initial layer is formed without utilizing the first mask 501 or the second mask 503. Namely, according to the technique,
<ol><li>(a) the carbon layer 502 and the metallic layer 504 are formed, or</li><li>(b) a mixture layer of carbon and a metal is formed,</li></ol>
covering the surface of the substrate 103,<br/>
and thereafter the metal and carbon are etched to form the pattern shape of an initial layer.</p><p id="p0130" num="0130">According to the technique, after the formation by (a) or (b), a third mask is formed. With respect to the third mask, the opening thereof corresponds to the masking part of the first mask 501, and the masking part corresponds to the opening of the first mask 501, and therefore the first mask 501 and the third mask constitute, a sort of, negative-positive relationship.</p><p id="p0131" num="0131">Then, etching is performed through the third mask for removing a metal and carbon in the openings of the third mask to form the pattern shape of an initial layer. Finally, the third mask is removed by etching. Thus, a metal and carbon are able to be formed to a desired pattern shape.</p><p id="p0132" num="0132">For forming a desired shape of an initial layer, there are various applicable pattern forming techniques in addition to the above. Consequently, carbon or a mixture of carbon and a metal, or the like is able to be used as a material for an initial layer. Further, as a developing solution for lithography, a material or a dissolving liquid for a resist, an etching agent, or the like, various materials are able to be used.</p><p id="p0133" num="0133">Further, if randomly generated crystals of graphene 102 are acceptable, it is not necessary to change the thickness of a metallic layer 504, and it is possible to be designed uniform.</p><p id="p0134" num="0134">Alternatively, if a crystal of graphene 102 is to be enlarged for forming a uniform continuous film, it should be so arranged that the concentration gradient of<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> carbon is oriented to the same direction to the extent possible at any positions. A technique for obtaining a larger single crystal of graphene 102 will be described in the following Example.</p><p id="p0135" num="0135">According to the above mode the thickness of the carbon layer 502 is made uniform, on the other hand the supplied quantity of a metal is made inhomogeneous in terms of a position so as to change the thickness of the metallic layer 504 and to generate a gradient of the carbon concentration in the solid solution layer 505. However, for example, by making the supply quantity of carbon inhomogeneous in terms of the positions, or by changing the supply quantities of a metal and carbon in terms of the positions, it is possible that a gradient of the carbon concentration be generated to determine a growing direction of graphene 102.</p><p id="p0136" num="0136">Further, according to the above mode, by making the concentration distribution of an etching gas uniform, removal of a metal is carried out at a constant rate at any positions of the solid solution layer 505. However, by making the concentration distribution of an etching gas inhomogeneous, the speed of metal removal is able to be changed depending on the positions. Consequently, it is possible to design for causing precipitation of graphene 102 from a place with a higher concentration of an etching gas to a place with a lower concentration.</p><heading id="h0015">Example 3</heading><p id="p0137" num="0137">According to the present embodiment, by applying the above embodiments in multi-stages, the size of a single crystal of the graphene 102 is adjusted, and the positions of crystal grain boundaries are defined, which is suitable, for example, for producing a graphene device 101 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0138" num="0138">By a production method according to the present embodiment, line-shaped graphene is grown in the first direction on the substrate 103 using the production method for graphene of Example 2.</p><p id="p0139" num="0139"><figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 6A</figref> is a plan view illustrating line-shaped graphene and the growing<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> direction thereof.
