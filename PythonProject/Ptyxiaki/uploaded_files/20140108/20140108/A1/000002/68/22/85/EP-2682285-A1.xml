However, the weight of a stud for tires is regulated to be a specified weight or below (e. g., max. 1.1 grams). Therefore, there is a limit on enlarging the diameter of the pin if the weight regulation is to be satisfied.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The above-mentioned projected edge component of the pin can be made larger when the pin is shaped as a circular cylinder. It is therefore preferable that the pin is shaped as a circular cylinder to allow the enlargement of the projected edge component while limiting the weight of the pin.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, small penetration force of the pin against the surface of ice can be a problem that arises when the pin is shaped as a circular cylinder, because of the circular boundary line between the circular end face and the peripheral surface of the pin without any corners (vertexes formed by three or more<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> surfaces).</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">On the other hand, a problem that arises when the pin is shaped as a rectangular cylinder with a triangular, rectangular, or other cross section is the inability to enlarge the projected edge component while limiting the weight of the pin in contrast to when the pin is shaped as a circular cylinder.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention provides a stud for tires that features not only an enhanced clawing force against the surface of ice because of a larger projected edge component and a larger penetration force of the pin against ice, but also a possibility of weight reduction. That is, the invention provides a stud for tires that can realize enhanced clawing force (improved ice traction performance) and weight reduction.</p><heading id="h0007">Means for Solving the Problem</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">In one aspect, the present invention provides a stud for tires which includes a columnar body to be secured to the tread surface of a tire with its one end side in the direction along its central axis fitted into a bottomed hole formed in the tread surface of the tire and a pin protruding from the other end face of the columnar body in the direction along its central axis . And the pin is shaped as an odd-shaped columnar body protruding from the other end face of the columnar body and having recessed portions formed by removing portions straddling the other end face and the peripheral surface of a cylindrical body to extend in the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> direction along the central axis of the columnar body. Therefore, the stud can realize enhanced clawing force (traction over ice) and weight reduction.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In another aspect, the present invention provides a stud for tires having the boundary line between the other end face and the recessed portion of the pin formed in a curved line and the surface of the recessed portion formed in a curved surface. Therefore, the corner formed by the boundaries between the other end face of the pin, the curved surface which is the peripheral surface of the pin, and the curved surface which is the recessed surface of the recessed portion can be sharp, thereby raising local edge pressure and consequently the penetration force against the surface of ice.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a stud for tires of which the pin is provided with a plurality of recessed portions and shaped as an odd-shaped cylindrical body having a lesser recessed portion formed by removing a portion straddling the other end face and the peripheral surface of the cylindrical body between the recessed portions circumferentially adjacent to each other. And the lesser recessed portions are of smaller recess than the recessed portions. Thus, provision of lesser recessed portions allows further weight reduction of the pin. Also, the possibility of increasing the number of corners to be formed by the boundaries between the other end face of the pin and the two curved surfaces further contributes to an increase in penetration force against the surface of ice and weight reduction.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In a further aspect, the present invention provides a stud for tires having columnar body recessed portions on the columnar body, which straddle the other end face and the peripheral surface of the columnar body. And the recessed portions and the columnar body recessed portions are so arranged that each boundary line between the other end face and the columnar body recessed portion of the columnar body and each corresponding boundary line between the other end face and the recessed portion of the pin intersect a straight line passing through the central axis of the columnar body. Thus the arrangement enables weight reduction of the columnar body. At the same time, the penetration force against the surface of ice will be enhanced by the synergistic effect of the corners of the columnar body formed by the columnar body recessed portions and the corners of the pin.</p><heading id="h0008">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective illustration showing a stud for tires (first embodiment).</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a top view of a stud for tires (first embodiment).</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a cross-sectional relationship between a tire and a stud for tires. <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3B</figref> shows a cross section of a stud for tires fitted in a studded tire (first embodiment).</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4A</figref> is a perspective illustration showing a stud for tires (second embodiment). <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4B</figref> is a top view of a stud for tires (second embodiment).<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5A</figref> is a perspective illustration showing a stud for tires (third embodiment). <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5B</figref> is a top view of a stud for tires (third embodiment).</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6A</figref> is a perspective illustration showing a stud for tires (fourth embodiment). <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6B</figref> is a top view of a stud for tires (fourth embodiment).</li></ul></p><heading id="h0009">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0010">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, a description will be given of a structure of a stud for tires according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the stud 1 for tires, which is, for instance, formed of metal, is used to form a studded tire with its one end face 4 side in the direction along the central axis X thereof fitted into a bottomed hole 7 formed in the tread surface 6 of the tire 5. And the stud 1 for tires includes a columnar body 2 and a pin 3.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The stud 1 for tires may be formed by combining the columnar body 2 and pin 3 which are each fabricated separately or may be formed with the columnar body 2 and pin 3 integrally structured together.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The columnar body 2, which is, for instance, called a shank or a body, is secured with its one end face 4 side in the direction<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> along the central axis X fitted into the bottomed hole 7. The columnar body 2 is fitted into the bottomed hole 7 at least by the one end face 4 side thereof. That is, the columnar body 2 is secured with the one end face 4 side or the whole thereof fitted into the bottomed hole 7.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The columnar body 2 includes a columnar part 10 and a flange 11 provided at one end of the columnar part 10. The other end part of the columnar part 10 is formed by a larger-diameter cylindrical part 12, and the one end part thereof is formed by a smaller-diameter cylindrical part 13 which is of a diameter smaller than that of the larger-diameter cylindrical part 12. That is, the columnar part 10 is comprised of a columnar body with two diameters, with the one end edge of the circumferential surface of the larger-diameter cylindrical part 12 linked by a conical surface 14 to the other end edge of the circumferential surface of the smaller-diameter cylindrical part 13. The flange 11, which is shaped as a circular disk having a diameter larger than the larger-diameter cylindrical part 12, functions as the retainer of the stud 1 by engaging with an engagement cavity 15 formed at the bottom of the bottomed hole 7.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The bottomed holes 7 are each formed with a diameter smaller than that of the larger-diameter cylindrical part 12. And as the columnar bodies 2 are press-fitted into the bottomed holes 7 by a not-shown machine, a studded tire 8 is formed with the studs 1 fitted in the bottomed holes 7.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The pin 3, which is formed with a diameter smaller than that of the columnar body 2, is so disposed as to protrude from the other end face 20 of the columnar body 2 in a direction extending along the central axis X of the columnar body 2. The central axes of the pin 3, the larger-diameter cylindrical part 12, the smaller-diameter cylindrical part 13, and the flange 11 are all the same central axis.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The pin 3 is formed from a cylindrical body 21 which protrudes from the other end face 20 of the columnar body 2 extending in the direction along the central axis X of the columnar body 2 (shown by an imaginary line (two-dot chain line) in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>).</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In other words, the pin 3 is shaped as an odd-shaped columnar body having recessed portions 22 formed by removing portions straddling the other end face, which is the protruding end side of the cylindrical body 21, and the peripheral surface of the cylindrical body 21. That is to say, the recessed portions 22 are each a hollowed portion formed closer to the central axis X from the peripheral surface of the cylindrical body 21 as if the portion straddling the other end face of the cylindrical body 21 and the peripheral surface thereof is gouged.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Thus the boundary line 25 between the other end face 23 and the recessed surface 24 of the recessed portion 22 of the odd-shaped columnar body, which constitutes the pin 3, is formed in an arc-like curve bent closer to the central axis X from the peripheral surface of the cylindrical body 21, and the recessed<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> surface 24 of the recessed portion 22 is formed in a curved surface.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The recessed portions 22 are formed as hollows (depressions) continuous from the other end face 23 of the odd-shaped columnar body forming the pin 3 to the other end face 20 of the columnar body 2. And the cross-sectional shape of the hollows (cross-sectional shape perpendicular to the central axis X of the pin 3) is the same at any point between the the other end face 23 of the pin 3 and the other end face 20 of the columnar body 2.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The pin 3 is provided, for instance, with four recessed portions 22, which are disposed on the peripheral surface of the cylindrical body 21 at equal angular intervals, that is, 90 degrees apart from each other, along the circumference of the cylindrical body 21 with the central axis X thereof as the center. In other words, the pin 3 is shaped such that each time the stud 1 is turned 90 degrees, starting from the initial position, with the central axis X of the pin 3 as the center, the other end face 23 of the pin 3 assumes the same cruciform shape.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Also, the pin 3 is so shaped that the boundary line 25 between the other end face 23 of the pin 3 and the recessed portion 22 is formed in a curved line approaching the central axis X from the peripheral surface of the cylindrical body 21 and that the recessed surface 24 of the recessed portion 22 is formed in a curved<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> surface approaching the central axis X from the peripheral surface of the cylindrical body 21.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Accordingly, the pin 3 is shaped with corners 30, which are each formed by the boundaries between the flat surface of the other end face 23 of the pin 3, the curved surface of the peripheral surface 26 of the pin 3 (remaining peripheral surface of the cylindrical body 21), and the curved surface of the recessed surface 24 of the recessed portion 22. The corners 30 are sharper than those of a rectangular cylinder which are formed by the boundaries between three flat surfaces, and consequently the corners 30 raise local edge pressures, thereby enhancing the penetration force of the stud 1 against the surface of ice.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The stud 1 for tires according to the first embodiment includes a pin 3 formed from a cylindrical body 21 into an odd-shaped columnar body having recessed portions 22 formed by removing the portions of the cylindrical body 21 straddling the other end face, which is the projecting end side thereof, and the peripheral surface thereof. Compared with the studs having a pin of a circular or rectangular cylinder, the stud 1 for tires according to the first embodiment can not only realize weight reduction but also make the projected edge component H (equivalent to the diameter of the cylindrical body 21 of the pin (see <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>)) larger. Moreover, having the corners 30, the stud 1 increases the penetration force against the surface of ice. Hence, the stud 1 for tires provides possibilities of not only reducing weight<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> but also enhancing the clawing force (ice traction performance).</p><heading id="h0011">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p0029" num="0029">A stud 1 for tires may be one provided with a columnar body 2A as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">That is, the stud 1 for tires may include, in addition to the general structure of the first embodiment, a columnar body 2A having columnar body recessed portions 41, each formed by removing a portion straddling the circular other end face of the larger-diameter cylindrical part 12, which is equal to the other end face 20 of the columnar body 2 of the first embodiment, and the cylindrical peripheral surface of the larger-diameter cylindrical part 12, which forms the peripheral surface 2a of the columnar body 2.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Each of the columnar body recessed portions 41 may be formed, for instance, by removing a portion near the circular circumferential edge of the other end face 20 of the columnar body 2 of the first embodiment which straddles the other end face 20 of the columnar body 2 and the peripheral surface 2a of the columnar body 2 such that the boundary line 42 between the other end face 20 and the columnar body recessed portion 41 delineates a curved line each end of which reaches the circular circumferential edge of the other end face 20 of the columnar body 2.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The recessed surface 43 of a columnar body recessed portion 41 is formed, for instance, in a curved surface.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Accordingly, the columnar body 2A is shaped with corners<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> 50, which are each formed by the boundaries between the flat surface of the other end face 20 of the columnar body 2A, the curved surface of the peripheral surface 2a of the columnar body 2A, and the curved surface of the recessed surface 43 of the columnar body recessed portion 41.
