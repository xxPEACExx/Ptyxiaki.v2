A regasification plant with an open-rack-type vaporizer (ORV) system is often used as the regasification plants (e.g., see PTL 1 below). In the ORV system, seawater, which is used as a heat source, is sprayed on the outer surfaces of a plurality of heat transfer tubes arranged in a panel-like manner in the atmosphere, and LNG inside the heat transfer tubes is thereby gasified. However, the ORV system disadvantageously requires much seawater, and needs to ensure a heat transfer area where seawater flows, thereby making it difficult to reduce the size of the regasification plant. Thus, it is difficult to install the ORV system in an offshore floating body such as an FSRU (floating storage and regasification unit) and an FPSO<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> (floating production, storage and offloading), or a marine vessel such as an LNG carrier.</p><heading id="h0003">{Citation List}</heading><heading id="h0004">{Patent Literature}</heading><heading id="h0005">{PTL 1}</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPHEI914586B"><text>Hei9-14586</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0006">{Summary of Invention}</heading><heading id="h0007">{Technical Problem}</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">Meanwhile, in some cases, a regasification plant with an STV (shell-and-tube-type vaporizer) system in which a shell-and-tube-type heat exchanger 100 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is used is installed in a floating body or a marine vessel as a regasification plant having a smaller size than that with the ORV system.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As a typical structure, the shell-and-tube-type heat exchanger 100 includes an upstream header 103 into which LNG flows, a plurality of heat transfer tubes 107 connected to the upstream header 103 in parallel with each other, and a downstream header 105 into which the LNG passing through the heat transfer tubes 107 flows as shown in the drawing. Each of the heat transfer tubes 107 penetrates through a water chamber 109 defined by a cylindrical body (shell). As a main<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> feature of the heat exchanger, the water chamber 109 is divided into an upstream-side water chamber 109a and a downstream-side water chamber 109b at a substantially longitudinal center portion. Seawater (S.W.) is guided into the upstream-side water chamber 109a from the most upstream side (the left side in the drawing) of an LNG flow. The seawater is discharged from the downstream side of the upstream-side water chamber 109a (see a dashed line in the drawing). That is, in the upstream-side water chamber 109a, the seawater forms a parallel flow with respect to the LNG flow. Meanwhile, seawater is guided into the downstream-side water chamber 109b from the most downstream side (the right side in the drawing) of the LNG flow. The seawater is discharged from the upstream side of the downstream-side water chamber 109b (see a dashed line in the drawing). That is, in the downstream-side water chamber 109b, the seawater forms a counter flow with respect to the LNG flow. As described above, the seawater having a high temperature is used in a parallel flow on the most upstream side where the temperature of the LNG is lowest, thereby avoiding freezing on the outer surfaces of the heat transfer tubes. The seawater is used in a counter flow on the most downstream side of the LNG flow, thereby ensuring an LNG removal temperature.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, the shell-and-tube-type heat exchanger 100 in the above form has a more complicated structure than a shell-and-tube-type<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> heat exchanger 100' in which only one water chamber is provided as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>. Thus, the shell-and-tube-type heat exchanger 100 is disadvantageously high in cost and difficult to design.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As a configuration for employing the shell-and-tube-type heat exchanger 100' in which only one water chamber is provided as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>, a method of preheating LNG in advance by another means may be used. For example, an IFV (intermediate-fluid-type vaporizer) system has been proposed. The method called IFV system includes a preheating step of indirectly preheating LNG using a primary heating source such as seawater via a non-freezing heat medium such as propane, in the upstream side of the shell-and-tube-type heat exchanger. In the preheating step, the temperature of the LNG at an inlet of the shell-and-tube-type heat exchanger can be increased to a temperature at which the LNG hardly freezes. The inexpensive shell-and-tube-type heat exchanger in which only one water chamber is provided can be thereby employed. However, there are disadvantages that the cost of the preheating step is high, handling and maintenance are troublesome because the non-freezing liquid such as propane is used, and an apparatus configuration also becomes complicated.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention has been made in view of such<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide a liquefied gas regasification plant which can regasify liquefied gas by a heat exchanger with a simple configuration by preheating the liquefied gas with a simple configuration, and a regasification method.</p><heading id="h0008">{Solution to Problem}</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">To achieve the above object, a liquefied gas regasification plant, and a regasification method according to the present invention employ the following solutions.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">That is, a liquefied gas regasification plant according to a first aspect of the present invention includes a preheating heat exchanger that preheats liquefied gas flowing through a preheated flow by a preheating fluid flowing through a preheating flow, and a first heat exchanger that regasifies the liquefied gas preheated in the preheating heat exchanger by seawater or fresh water, the gas regasified in the first heat exchanger being guided to the preheating flow, the liquefied gas regasification plant further including a second heat exchanger that regasifies the liquefied gas condensed through the preheating flow by seawater or fresh water.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the preheating heat exchanger, the gas regasified in the first heat exchanger is guided to the preheating flow so as to preheat the liquefied gas. As described above, the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> liquefied gas is preheated by using the own heat of the regasified gas, and the preheating is performed using the single fluid flowing through the continuous path. Thus, it is not necessary to use another heat medium such as propane in a preheating step. The preheating step can be achieved with a simple configuration.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The liquefied gas preheated in the preheating heat exchanger is also guided to the first heat exchanger. The temperature of the liquefied gas flowing into the first heat exchanger is thereby increased. Thus, there is less possibility that a heat medium such as seawater or fresh water freezes around a heat transfer tube, or heat exchange performance is deteriorated due to ice generated on a heat exchange surface. Accordingly, when a shell-and-tube-type heat exchanger is used as the first heat exchanger, a shell-and-tube-type heat exchanger having a simple structure in which only one water chamber is provided can be employed.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The liquefied gas condensed through the preheating flow of the preheating heat exchanger is also guided to the second heat exchanger. The temperature of the liquefied gas passing through the preheating flow is reduced by giving heat to the liquefied gas flowing through the preheated flow while flowing through the preheating flow. However, since the gasification gas having a higher temperature than the liquefied gas flowing through the preheated flow is guided to the preheating flow,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the liquefied gas cooled and condensed through the preheating flow can be prevented from being cooled to a temperature equal to that of the liquefied gas flowing into the preheating heat exchanger. The temperature of the liquefied gas flowing into the second heat exchanger can be thereby increased higher than the temperature of the liquefied gas. Thus, there is less possibility that a heat medium such as seawater or fresh water freezes around a heat transfer tube, or heat exchange performance is deteriorated due to ice generated on a heat exchange surface in a similar manner to the first heat exchanger described above. Accordingly, when a shell-and-tube-type heat exchanger is used as the first heat exchanger, a shell-and-tube-type heat exchanger, for example, having a simple structure in which only one water chamber is provided can be employed.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">While the fluid flowing out of the preheated flow and the preheating flow of the preheating heat exchanger is referred to as "liquefied gas", the liquefied gas means not only a fluid in liquid phase, but also a fluid already gasified on an outlet side of the heat exchanger or a two-phase fluid having a predetermined wetness fraction.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Also, the shell-and-tube-type heat exchanger is preferably used as the first heat exchanger and/or the second heat exchanger. However, the present invention is not particularly limited thereto, and, for example, a heat<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> exchanger with an ORV system described above may be employed.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Also, when the liquefied gas is heated using a secondary closed loop of fresh water or the like as the heating medium in the first heat exchanger and the second heat exchanger, a non-freezing liquid may be added so as to further prevent the heat medium water from freezing.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Moreover, in the liquefied gas regasification plant according to the first aspect, a cooling flow that precools or condenses boil-off gas may be provided in the preheating heat exchanger.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A facility for reliquefying boil-off gas generated from a tank that stores liquefied gas or the like may be provided in some cases.
