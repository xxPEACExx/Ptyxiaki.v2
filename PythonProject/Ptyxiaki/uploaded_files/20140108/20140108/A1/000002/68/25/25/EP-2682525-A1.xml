In case of collision between the sensitive edge and an obstacle which is accidentally situated on the path, the system immediately stops all potentially dangerous movements due to the extremely limited intervention times.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Normally, the sensitive edges are connected to the control unit of the equipment by means of spiral cables, festoon cables, cable-carrier chains, systems via radio and/or optical systems, typically infrared, with the consequent aid of batteries, which in the short and long term lead to considerable problems of reliability, maintenance and quick wear.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The task of the present finding is to obtain a safety device, particularly for equipment in movement such as automatic gates and the like, which is improved with respect to the systems of the prior art.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the scope of this task, one object of the finding is to obtain a safety device capable of making the connection between sensitive safety edges, installed on moving wings of slidable gates, and the relative fixed control panels easier, quicker and more reliable.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Another object is to obtain a device that, for its particular characteristics, is capable of ensuring the greatest possible reliability and safety in use.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A further object of the present finding is to provide a device which is easily obtainable by using elements and materials that can be commonly found on the market and which is also competitive from an economical standpoint.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">This task, and others which will clearer hereinbelow, are attained by an improved safety device, particularly for equipment in movement such as automatic gates and the like, comprising a mobile element provided with at least one sensitive edge electrically connected to a control panel by means of an electric circuit; said device being <b>characterized in that</b> said electric circuit comprises said mobile element with conductor function.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Further characteristics and advantages will be clearer from the description of the structure according to the finding illustrated as a non-limiting example in the set of drawings, in which:
