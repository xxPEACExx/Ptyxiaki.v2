These devices can be equipped with processors, memory, and the capability to communicate through local and wide area networks, including the Internet. These devices can be equipped with operating systems which permit the devices to execute a wide range of computer programs, typically called "apps." The user of a handheld device can download computer programs and other content by direct communication with a server through a mobile telephone network or wireless local area network. Alternatively, a user can attempt to download content to a personal computer such as a desktop or a laptop computer. Often, it is more convenient for a user to browse, select and purchase an application through a system such as the personal computer. Once the application is downloaded to the personal computer, it may be further transmitted to the handheld device through a process such as synchronization, which can involve tethering the device to the personal computer.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The disclosure relates to installing applications remotely.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">One aspect of the disclosed embodiments is a method that includes accessing, at one or more server computers, configuration information for a mobile device.

In response to user selection of an application to be installed using the interface, installation of the application is caused by transmission of a push notification from one or more servers to the mobile device, where the push notification identifies the software application to be installed. When the mobile device receives and processes the push notification, the push notification causes the mobile device to retrieve and install the software application. This can allow the user to install applications at the mobile device without interacting with the mobile device, and the mobile device need not be accessible to the user in order to perform installation of applications. The systems and methods described herein can also allow the user to install applications for multiple mobile devices simultaneously using a single computer.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a system 110 in accordance with one implementation. The system 110 can include one or more server computers such as a web server 112 and a content server 114, which are in communication with a remote computer 116 and a mobile device 118. The remote computer 116, the web server 112, the content server 114 and the mobile device 118 can be in communication with one another by network connections 120a-120c.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The web server 112 is operable to transmit information, such as a web page (<i>i.e.,</i> HTML code and/or other information defining a web page), to the remote computer 116, that, when rendered, causes the remote computer 116 to display a configuration interface 122. The configuration interface 122 can be based at least in part on configuration information 124 regarding the mobile device 118.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The web server 112 can store, access, and/or retrieve the configuration information 124. The configuration information 124 includes data regarding the mobile device 118, and can include data regarding other mobile devices as well. In some implementations, the configuration information 124 can include data regarding multiple mobile devices that are associated with a single user.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The configuration information 124 can include information identifying the mobile device 118 and configuration information pertaining to the mobile device 118. For example, the information identifying the handheld device can include an IP address or telephone number assigned to the device. In some examples, the configuration information 124 can include the hardware description, operating system, or carrier information of mobile device 118. In other examples, the configuration information 124 can include at least one of information concerning the presence,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> absence and/or configuration of the following features: a touchscreen, hardware acceleration, telephony, WIFI capability, 3G compatibility, storage, memory, battery or processor on the mobile device 118. Personally identifiable information of the user of the mobile device 118 need not be provided in the configuration information 124.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The configuration information 124 can also include information representing the software applications that are installed at the device, including information identifying the software applications, such as a name or other text-based identifier and version information for the software applications. The configuration information 124 can be gathered using a check-in routine, where the mobile device 118 transmits the configuration information 124 to the web server 112. In addition or as an alternative, the web server 112 can maintain the configuration information 124 by storing information regarding configuration transactions that are executed using the configuration interface 122.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one implementation, the configuration information 124 can be used to generate the information defining the configuration interface 122 in the form of an interface for installing and/or uninstalling applications at the mobile device 118. As one example, the configuration interface 122 can show a listing of applications that are currently installed on the mobile device 118 based on the configuration information. The configuration interface 122 can also show a listing of applications that can be installed on the mobile device 118. This listing can, in some implementations, be based in part on the configuration information 124, for example, by excluding applications on the basis of system requirements that are not met by the mobile device 118. In some implementations, the configuration interface can allow for installation or uninstallation of software applications at one or more mobile devices that are selected from a list of mobile devices. The list of mobile devices can include devices that are associated with a user account.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The information defining the configuration interface 122 can be transmitted from the web server 112 to the remote computer 116 in response to a request for the configuration interface 122 from the remote computer 116. The request from the remote computer 116 can include an identification of the mobile device 118. In one example, the information identifying the mobile device 118 can be a user name that is associated with the mobile device 118 and, optionally, with other mobile devices as well. The web server 112 can perform an authorization routine using the user name as well as a password or other criteria showing that the user of the remote computer 116 is authorized to perform configuration tasks for the mobile device 118. In other implementations, the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> information identifying the mobile device 118 can be in any suitable form, such as a unique hardware identifier or an IP address.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of an example of a hardware configuration for the web server 112. The content server 114, the remote computer 116, and the mobile device 118 can be implemented using a similar hardware configuration.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The CPU 220 of the web server 112 can be a conventional central processing unit. Alternatively, the CPU 220 can be any other type of device, or multiple devices, capable of manipulating or processing information now-existing or hereafter developed. Although the disclosed examples can be practiced with a single processor as shown, e.g. CPU 220, advantages in speed and efficiency can be achieved using more than one processor.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The web server 112 can include memory 222, such as a random access memory device (RAM). Any other suitable type of storage device can be used as the memory 222. The memory 222 can include code and data 224 that can be accessed by the CPU 220 using a bus 226. The memory 222 can further include an operating system 228 and one or more application programs 230. The application programs 230 can include programs that permit the CPU 220 to perform the methods described here.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A storage device 232 can be optionally provided in the form of any suitable computer readable medium, such as a hard disc drive, a memory device, a flash drive or an optical drive. One or more input devices 234, such as a keyboard, a mouse, or a gesture sensitive input device, receive user inputs and can output signals or data indicative of the user inputs to the CPU 220. One or more output devices can be provided, such as a display device 236. The display device 236, such as liquid crystal display (LCD) or a cathode-ray tube (CRT), allows output to be presented to a user, for example, in response to receiving a video signal.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Although <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> depicts the CPU 220 and the memory 222 of the server 114 as being integrated into a single unit, other configurations can be utilized. The operations of the CPU 220 can be distributed across multiple machines (each machine having one or more of processors) which can be coupled directly or across a local area or other network. The memory 222 can be distributed across multiple machines such as network-based memory or memory in multiple machines performing the operations of the web server 112. Although depicted here as a single bus, the bus 226 of the web server 112 can be composed of multiple buses. Further, the storage device 232 can be directly coupled to the other components of the web server 112 or can be accessed via a network and<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> can comprise a single integrated unit such as a memory card or multiple units such as multiple memory cards. The web server 112 can thus be implemented in a wide variety of configurations.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Returning to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the content server 114 can facilitate installation of applications, such as a software application 126, at the mobile device 118. In one implementation, a request for installation of the software application is generated at the remote computer 116 in response to user interaction with the configuration interface 122 and is transmitted to the web server 112 via the network connection 120a before being relayed to the content server 114 via the network connection 120b. Upon receiving the identification of the software application 126 from the remote computer 116 at the content server 114, the content server 114 sends a push notification to the mobile device 118. As used herein, push notification means a message, signal, or data that is transmitted in the context of a communications transaction that originates from a server computer, such as the web server 112 or the content server 114. The push notification that is sent to the mobile device 118 from the content server 114 includes information that identifies the software application 126. The push notification includes information sufficient to cause the mobile device 118 to retrieve and install the software application 126 when the push notification is received and processed by the mobile device 118. The information identifying the software application 126 can be in any suitable form, such as a name of the software application 126, a serial number of the software application 126, and/or a uniform resource locator (URL) from which the software application 126 can be downloaded by the mobile device 118.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In implementations where the information identifying the software application is or includes a URL, the URL can be a custom URL that is generated by the content server 114 in response to identification of the software application 126 by the user of the remote computer 116. The custom URL can be associated with the mobile device 118. For example, the custom URL can be associated with the mobile device 118 by updating the configuration information 124 to include a reference to the custom URL. In such an implementation, the content server 114 can be configured to detect a request for the custom URL, and, upon completion of the download of the software application 126 to the mobile device 118, can cause the configuration information 124 for the mobile device 118 to be updated to reflect the fact that the software application 126 was downloaded to the mobile device 118. In addition, in implementations where a custom URL is generated by the content server 114, the content server 114 can be configured to remove the custom URL after a predetermined time period has passed, such that the custom URL only remains valid for the predetermined time period.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Other types of content items could also be stored and transmitted by the content server 114, such as media files and documents.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The remote computer 116 can be any computing device that is separate from the mobile device 118. As examples, the remote computer can be a personal desktop computer, a laptop, notepad, personal digital assistant, tablet computer, cloud computer, smart phone, plug computer, home video game console or any other device. The remote computer 116 can receive information from the web server 112 via the network connection 120a, such as the information defining the configuration interface 122. The remote computer 116 can render and display the configuration interface 122, and transmit to the web server 112 signals or data indicative of user input.

The operations described in connection with the process 400 can be embodied as a non-transitory computer readable medium including program instructions executable by one or more processors that, when executed, cause the one or more processors to perform the operations. For example, the operations described in connection with the process 400 could be stored at the memory 222 of the web server 112 and be executable by the CPU 220 of the web server 112.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Operations 402, 404, 406, and 408 are identical to operations 302, 304, 306, and 308, respectively, of the process 300.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Operation 410 includes generating a custom URL for download of the software application. Generating a custom URL can be performed in any suitable manner, such as by random generation of an identifier that is incorporated in the custom URL, or by using a template. The custom URL for downloading the software application can be generated in response to receiving the identification of the software application at operation 408 and the custom URL can be associated with the mobile device. In one example, the custom URL is generated by the content server 114.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Operation 412 includes sending a push notification identifying the software application to be installed, where the identification of the software application to be installed includes the custom URL that was generated at operation 410. Sending can occur in any suitable manner, such as by transmission over a local area network, a wide area network, a wired network, or a wireless network, and can be a result of direct communication or indirect communication via one or more intervening computers or systems. In some implementations, operation 412 includes sending the push notification in part via a wireless connection to the mobile device. In one example, the push notification including the custom URL is sent from the content server 114 to the mobile device 118 and includes the custom URL for download of the software application 126.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Operation 414 includes determining whether a request for transmission of the software application has been received. In one example, it is determined that a request for transmission of software is received when a request, such as an HTTP GET request is received at the content server 114 from the mobile device 118, where the HTTP GET request specifies the custom URL. If, at operation 414, it is determined that a request for transmission of the software application is received, the process proceeds to operation 416. If it is determined that a request for transmission of the software application is not received, the process proceeds to operation 422.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Operation 416 includes transmitting the software application to the mobile device. Transmitting can occur in any suitable manner, such as by transmission over a local area network, a wide area network, a wired network, or a wireless network, and can be a result of direct communication or indirect communication via one or more intervening computers or systems. In one implementation, operation 416 includes transmitting the software application 126 from the content server 114 to the mobile device 118 in the context of a client pull network communication that is initiated by the mobile device 118 at operation 414.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Operation 418 includes updating device configuration information in response to transmission of the software application to the mobile device at operation 416. In one example, this includes transmission of a signal from the content server 114 to the web server 112 that causes the web server 112 to update the configuration information 124 to reflect the fact that the software application 126 was transmitted to the mobile device 118.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Operation 420 includes removing the custom URL. This can be performed, for example, by the content server 114. After completion of operation 420, the process ends.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Operation 422, which is performed after it is determined that a request for transmission of the software application has not been received at operation 414, includes determining whether the custom URL has expired. In one example, the content server 114 determines whether the customer URL should no longer be valid based on the passage of a predetermined time period. If it is determined that the custom URL has expired, the process proceeds to operation 420, where the custom URL is removed, as previously explained. If it is determined that the custom URL has not expired, the process returns to operation 414.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The web server 112 and the content server 114 (and the algorithms, methods, instructions etc. stored thereon and/or executed thereby) can be realized in hardware including, for example, intellectual property (IP) cores, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), programmable logic arrays, optical processors, programmable logic controllers, microcode,<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> firmware, microcontrollers, servers, microprocessors, digital signal processors or any other suitable circuit.
