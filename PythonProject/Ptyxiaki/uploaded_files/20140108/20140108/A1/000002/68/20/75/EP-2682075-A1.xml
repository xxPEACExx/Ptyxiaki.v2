In the operating mechanism, a gear rack is meshed with a gear of a rotatable wheel, and the outer tube is connected to an end portion of the gear rack. With the wheel rotated in a predetermined direction, the gear rack is advanced and retracted in the axial direction so as to move the outer tube relative to the inner tube, whereby the stent is released to the exterior of the outer tube.</p><heading id="h0003">Summary of Invention</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the stent delivery system having the operating mechanism as above-mentioned, however, the gear rack and the outer tube connected to the gear rack can be moved in<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the axial direction attendantly on the rotation of the wheel. Therefore, in the case where the outer tube is caught in the lesion part in a lumen of a living body or the like so that movement of the outer tube in the axial direction is made difficult, for example, if an operator continues to forcibly rotate the wheel, the gear rack and the outer tube are forcibly pulled in the axial direction. This is attended by exertion of an excessive load on the stent delivery system (especially, on the outer tube). As a result, the stent delivery system would be broken, so that a broken component part of the stent delivery system may be left in the lumen of the living body.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is a general object of the present invention to provide a stent delivery system by which breakage due to exertion of an excessive load when movement of the outer tube becomes difficult can be prevented from occurring.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the present invention, there is provided a stent delivery system including: an inner tube; a stent which is compressed toward a center axis and disposed on a distal-side outer surface of the inner tube at the time of insertion into a lumen of a living body and which can be restored into its pre-compression<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> shape by expanding outward when put indwelling in the lumen of the living body; an outer tube which is disposed on an outer surface side of the inner tube, can contain the stent in its lumen, and can release the stent to the exterior by moving proximally relative to the inner tube; and an operating unit for moving the outer tube in an axial direction relative to the inner tube. The operating unit includes: a housing; a rotary body which is so supported as to be rotatable relative to the housing and which has a first tooth portion; a rack body which has a second tooth portion meshed with the first tooth portion, is so disposed as to be movable in the axial direction relative to the housing, and is connected to the outer tube; and a releasing mechanism by which meshing between the rotary body and the rack body is released when a load of not less than a predetermined value is exerted on either one of the rotary body and the rack body.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the present invention, in the stent delivery system for putting a stent indwelling in a lesion part in a lumen of a living body, the operating unit by which the outer tube disposed on the outer surface side of the inner tube is moved in the axial direction includes: the housing; the rotary body<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> supported so as to be rotatable relative to the housing and having the first tooth portion; and the rack body having the second tooth portion meshed with the first tooth portion, being movable in the axial direction relative to the housing, and being connected to the outer tube. The operating unit is provided with the releasing mechanism by which meshing between the rotary body and the rack body can be released when a load of not less than a predetermined value is exerted on either one of the rotary body and the rack body.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Therefore, even in the case where axial movement of the rack body and the outer tube connected to the rack body becomes difficult for some reason and the operator forcibly rotates the rotary body, the releasing mechanism ensures that when a load of not less than a predetermined value is exerted on the rotary body or the rack body, the meshed state of the first tooth portion of the rotary body and the second tooth portion of the rack body is released. In such a case, therefore, transmission of the rotating force of the rotary body to the rack body is prevented from occurring. Accordingly, a situation in which the rack body and the outer tube would be forcibly pulled in the axial direction is obviated. As a result,<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> each component constituting the stent delivery system can be securely prevented from being broken due to exertion of an excessive load, so that a situation in which, for example, a broken part would be left in a living body lumen can be avoided.</p><heading id="h0004">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>]

Incidentally, the same components as those of the stent delivery system 10 according to the first embodiment described above will be denoted by the same reference symbols as used above, and detailed descriptions thereof will be omitted.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071"><!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> The stent delivery system 150 of the second embodiment differs from the stent delivery system 10 of the first embodiment in that a rack member 154 constituting an operating unit 152 is formed to be hollow and that a first block 156 meshed with the first gear 58 is freely bendable.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, the rack member 154 has a structure in which first and second blocks 156 and 158 are formed therein with an inner cavity 160, and the inner cavity 160 extends in the axial direction of the rack member 154 while having a substantially constant height. The first block 156 is freely bendable in a direction in which the first tooth portion 90 is spaced away from the first gear 58 of the rotary roller 60. More specifically, the first block 156 is so formed that its bottom surface having the first tooth portion 90 is freely bendable upward (in the direction of arrow D1) through the inner cavity 160.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">In the stent delivery system 150 having the rack member 154 as above-mentioned, in the case where movement of the outer tube body 14 and the rack member 154 in the axial direction (in the directions of arrows A and B)<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> becomes difficult for some reason and the operator continues to forcibly rotate the rotary roller 60, a load G of not less than a predetermined value is exerted on the rotary roller 60 radially outward (in the direction of arrow C1) and upward (in the direction of arrow D1) due to the rotation of the rotary roller 60, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10B</figref>.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">Incidentally, in the second embodiment, also, the load G is set on the basis of a lowest-yield-point component of such components as the outer tube body 14, the inner tube body 12, the operating unit 152, etc. constituting the stent delivery system 150. Then, the second tooth portion 96 of the first gear 58 runs onto the first tooth portion 90 of the rack member 154 of which movement is restricted, and the first block 156 of the rack member 154 is deformed so as to be bent toward the second block 158 (in the direction of arrow D1).</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">More specifically, the first block 156 is elastically deformed upward so as to become arcuate in sectional shape, with its part meshed with the first gear 58 as a center, and comes into the inner cavity 160. This deformation of the first block 156 results in a non-meshed<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> state in which meshing between the first gear 58 and the rack member 154 has been released, so that transmission of the rotating force of the rotary roller 60 to the rack member 154 is obviated.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">As a result, even if the rotary roller 60 is rotated, for example, the rack member 154 in the non-meshed state would not be moved proximally (in the direction of arrow A). Therefore, the outer tube body 14 and the rack member 154, movement of which in the axial direction has become difficult for some reason, can be securely prevented from being forcibly pulled in the axial direction. Accordingly, damages to the stent delivery system 150 which might be caused by forcible movement of the outer tube body 14 and the rack member 154 can be avoided assuredly.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Incidentally, the first block 156 constituting the rack member 154 may be so configured that it is plastically deformed when the second tooth portion 96 of the first gear 58 runs onto the first tooth portion 90 and when it is bent upward (in the direction of arrow D1). In this case, the first block 156 is retained in the state of being bent upward, so that its first tooth<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> portion 90 is perfectly prevented from being meshed with the first gear 58. Consequently, the meshed state is prevented from being established again.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Thus, in the second embodiment, the rack member 154 having therein with the inner cavity 160 functions as a releasing mechanism 162 by which the meshed state of the rotary roller 60 and the rack member 154 constituting the operating unit 152 can be released.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">As above-mentioned, in the second embodiment, the rack member 154 constituting the releasing mechanism 162 is formed to be freely deformable in the direction for spacing away from the first gear 58 of the rotary roller 60 when a load G of not less than a predetermined value is exerted on the rotary roller 60 radially outward (in the direction of arrow C1) and upward (in the direction of arrow D1). It is ensured that, when such a load G is exerted, the first block 156 is bent in the direction for spacing away from the first gear 58 (in the direction of arrow D1), and the meshing between the rotary roller 60 and the rack member 154 is released.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">As a result, even in the case where the operator<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> continues to forcibly rotate the rotary roller 60, the rack member 154 is prevented from being forcibly pulled due to the rotation of the rotary roller 60. Therefore, breakage of the lowest-yield-point component in the stent delivery system 150 can be securely prevented.

Then, the second tooth portion 96 of the first gear 58 runs onto the first tooth portion 90 of the rack member 56, of which movement is restricted, and the rack member 56 is pressed upward (in the direction of arrow D1) so as to rise against the resilient force of the elastic member 204. The rising of the rack member 56 results in a non-meshed state in which meshing between the first gear 58 and the rack member 56 has been released, so that transmission of the rotating force of the rotary roller 60 to the rack member 56 is avoided.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">Thus, the rack member 56 is provided in the housing 54 in the state of being movable upward (in the direction of arrow D1) through the elastic member 204, and the elastic member 204 and the rack member 56 function as a releasing mechanism 206 by which the meshed state of the rotary roller 60 and the rack member 56 constituting the operating unit 202 can be released.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">As above-mentioned, in the third embodiment, the<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> rack member 56 is so provided as to be freely movable in the direction for spacing away from the first gear 58 of the rotary roller 60 (in the direction of arrow D1) relative to the housing 54.
