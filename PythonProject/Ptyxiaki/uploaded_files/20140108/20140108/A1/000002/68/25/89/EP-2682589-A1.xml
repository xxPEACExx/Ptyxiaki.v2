As is well known, the three-way catalyst has an "oxygen storage function." That is, when a gas flowing into the three-way catalyst (catalyst inflow gas) contains excessive oxygen, the three-way catalyst stores the oxygen and purifies the NOx. When the catalyst inflow gas contains excessive unburnt substance, the three-way catalyst releases the oxygen which has been stored to purify the unburnt substance. Hereinafter, the three-way catalyst may also simply be referred to as a "catalyst."</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A conventional air-fuel ratio control apparatus (conventional apparatus) comprises an upstream air-fuel ratio sensor and a downstream air-fuel ratio sensor that are disposed upstream and downstream of the catalyst in the exhaust passage, respectively. The conventional apparatus<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> controls an "air-fuel ratio of a mixture supplied to the engine (air-fuel ratio of the engine)" so as to have an air-fuel ratio (detected upstream-side air-fuel ratio) represented by an output value of the upstream air-fuel ratio sensor become equal to a target air-fuel ratio (target upstream-side air-fuel ratio, target air-fuel ratio of the catalyst inflow gas). This control is also referred to as a "main feedback control."</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Further, the conventional apparatus calculates a sub feedback amount so as to have an output value of the downstream air-fuel ratio sensor become equal to a "target value corresponding to a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio", and substantially changes the target upstream-side air-fuel ratio with the sub feedback amount to control the air-fuel ratio of the engine (refer to, for example, PTL 1). The air-fuel ratio control using the sub feedback amount is also referred to as a "sub feedback control."</p><heading id="h0003">[Citation List]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Patent Literature]</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">[PTL 1] Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2009162139A"><text>2009-162139</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Meanwhile, the applicant has been studying an air-fuel ratio control apparatus which can maintain the emission at a favorable level, even if an "oxygen storage capacity of the catalyst is low (a maximum oxygen storage amount is small, such as when the catalyst has deteriorated, and a capacity of the catalyst is small)." For example, one of such air-fuel ratio control apparatuses under study determines a state of the catalyst (oxygen storing state) without delay based on the output value of the downstream air-fuel<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> ratio sensor, and controls, based on the result of that determination, the air-fuel ratio of the engine so as to have the air-fuel ratio of the catalyst inflow gas become equal to an air-fuel ratio other than the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">More specifically, such a control apparatus sets the target air-fuel ratio to a "target rich air-fuel ratio smaller than the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio", when it determines, based on the output value Voxs of the downstream air-fuel ratio sensor, that the state of the catalyst has become/entered an oxygen excessive state (lean state). Further, the control apparatus sets the target air-fuel ratio to a "target lean air-fuel ratio larger than the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio", when it determines, based on the output value Voxs of the downstream air-fuel ratio sensor, that the state of the catalyst has become/entered an oxygen shortage state (rich state).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Meanwhile, the engine may include the evaporated fuel purge section. The evaporated fuel purge section makes a canister adsorb the evaporated fuel (gas) generated in the fuel tank, and introduces the evaporated fuel adsorbed in the canister into the intake passage of the engine when a predetermined purge execution request condition is satisfied. This allows the evaporated fuel to be burned in combustion chambers of the engine, and then to be discharged into the air. Introducing the evaporated fuel into the intake passage of the engine is referred to as an evaporated fuel purge.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The evaporated fuel purge is one of factors that disturb the air-fuel ratio of the engine. Generally, immediately after the evaporated fuel purge is started, the fuel by the evaporated fuel purge in addition to the fuel from the fuel injection valve is supplied to the engine, and therefore, the air-fuel<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> ratio of the engine temporarily becomes small. Thus, if the evaporated fuel purge is started when the capacity of the catalyst for purifying the unburnt substance is not high, the unburnt substance whose amount is equal to or larger than an amount of unburnt substance which the catalyst can purify flows into the catalyst. In such a case, a discharge amount of the unburnt substance increases so that the emission becomes degraded.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention is made to solve the problem described above. That is, one of objects of the present invention is to provide a control apparatus for an internal combustion engine, which can reduce/depress a degree of degrading the emission caused by the start of the evaporated fuel purge by a control (evaporated fuel purge start control) for allowing and prohibiting the start of the evaporated fuel purge in accordance with the target air-fuel ratio.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The control apparatus (present invention apparatus) for an internal combustion engine of the present invention comprises:
<ul><li>a catalyst disposed in an exhaust passage of the engine;</li><li>a downstream air-fuel ratio sensor disposed in the exhaust passage and at a position downstream of the catalyst;</li><li>a target air-fuel ratio determining section configured to determine, based on an "output value of the downstream air-fuel ratio sensor", which a "target air-fuel ratio being a target value of an air-fuel ratio of a gas flowing into the catalyst" should be set to, a "target rich air-fuel ratio smaller than a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio" or a "target lean air-fuel ratio larger than the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio";</li><li>a fuel injection valve configured to inject a fuel to the engine;</li><li>a fuel injection control section configured to determine a "fuel injection amount being an amount of the fuel injected from the fuel injection<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> valve" according to the target air-fuel ratio, and to have the fuel having the determined fuel injection amount be injected from the fuel injection valve; and</li><li>an evaporated fuel purge section configured to perform an evaporated fuel purge when a predetermined purge execution request condition is satisfied, the evaporated fuel purge being for introducing an evaporated fuel generated in a "fuel tank storing the fuel supplied to the fuel injection valve" into an intake passage of the engine.</li></ul></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Further, the evaporated fuel purge section is configured;<br/>
so as to start the evaporated fuel purge when the target air-fuel ratio is set at the target rich air-fuel ratio at a point in time (hereinafter, referred to as a "purge execution request condition satisfied time point") which is a point in time at which a state changes from a state in which the purge execution request condition is unsatisfied to a state in which the purge execution request condition is satisfied; and<br/>
so as not to start the evaporated fuel purge when the target air-fuel ratio is set at the target lean air-fuel ratio at the purge execution request condition satisfied time point, and so as to thereafter start the evaporated fuel purge when the target air-fuel ratio is set at the target rich air-fuel ratio after the target air-fuel ratio is changed to the target rich air-fuel ratio.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">As described above, when the evaporated fuel purge is started, the air-fuel ratio of the engine temporarily becomes excessively small (or temporarily becomes an excessively rich air-fuel ratio) due to the evaporated fuel purge. Accordingly, a large amount of unburnt substance flows into the catalyst. At this stage, if the state of the catalyst is the oxygen shortage state (rich state), and thus, the capacity for purifying unburnt substance of the catalyst is low, the unburnt substance is<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> discharged to the downstream of the catalyst without being purified by the catalyst.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In contrast, according to the present invention apparatus, the target air-fuel ratio when the evaporated fuel purge is started is the target rich air-fuel ratio, and is not the target lean air-fuel ratio. Therefore, the state of the catalyst when the evaporated fuel purge is started is the "oxygen excessive state (lean state)." In other words, the evaporated fuel purge is started when the catalyst is in a state in which the catalyst can purify a large amount of unburnt oxygen. Accordingly, even if a large amount of unburnt substance flows into the catalyst due to the evaporated fuel purge, the catalyst can purge a large part of such unburnt substance. Consequently, the degree of degrading the emission can be reduced at the start of the evaporated fuel purge.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In this case, it is preferable that the evaporated fuel purge section be configured to change a point in time at which the evaporated fuel purge is started based on whether an operating state of the engine is a first operating state or a second operating state.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">For example, the first operating state is a state in which the emission is prioritized, and the second operating state is a state in which the drivability is prioritized. More specifically, the first operating state may be a low load operating state, and the second operating state may be a high load operating state. Further, for example, the first operating state may be a low engine rotational speed operating state, and the second operating state may be a high engine rotational speed operating state. Furthermore, for example, the first operating state is a state in which an engine operating state represented by "the load of the engine and the engine rotational<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> speed" is in an operating region of "a low load and a low engine rotational speed side", and the second operating state is a state in which the engine operating state represented by "the load of the engine and the engine rotational speed" is in an operating region of "a high load and a high engine rotational speed side."</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">More specifically, it is preferable that the evaporated fuel purge section be configured as follows.
<ol><li>(1) In a case in which the operating state of the engine at the purge execution request condition satisfied time point is the first operating state:
<ul><li>(1A) the evaporated fuel purge section starts the evaporated fuel purge when the target air-fuel ratio is set at the target rich air-fuel ratio; and</li><li>(1 B) the evaporated fuel purge section does not start the evaporated fuel purge when the target air-fuel ratio is set at the target lean air-fuel ratio, and starts the evaporated fuel purge when the target air-fuel ratio is set at the target rich air-fuel ratio after the target air-fuel ratio is set/changed to the target rich air-fuel ratio.</li></ul></li></ol></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the above configuration, the evaporated fuel purge is started when the state of the catalyst is in the "oxygen excessive state (lean state)", as described above. Therefore, even if a large amount of the unburnt substance flows into the catalyst when the evaporated fuel purge is started, the catalyst can purify the large part of the unburnt substance. Consequently, when the operating state of the engine is in the first operating state, the degree of degrading the emission at the start of the evaporated fuel purge can be reduced.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Meanwhile, as described above, the air-fuel ratio of the engine temporarily becomes small immediately after the start of the evaporated fuel<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> purge. Thus, if the evaporated fuel purge is started when the target air-fuel ratio is the target rich air-fuel ratio, the air-fuel ratio of the engine becomes extremely small.

Therefore, the possibility that the emission becomes extremely degraded is low due to the start of the evaporated fuel purge. In addition, many of the engines comprise a downstream-side catalyst at a position downstream of that catalyst. When the operating state is the second operating state, a temperature of the downstream-side catalyst reaches a certain high temperature.

The fuel injection valve 33 is disposed at the intake port.

At time t2, the CPU applies "the intake air amount Ga and the engine rotational speed NE" at time t2 to the table MapTLean(Ga, NE) so as to estimate the duration time TLean of the target lean air-fuel ratio.</p><p id="p0167" num="0167">Further, it is assumed that the process of step 1020 shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG.<!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --> 10</figref> is executed, at time t3. At this point in time, the CPU estimates (obtains) the above second time period T2 (time period until the target air-fuel ratio abyfr is switched over to the target rich air-fuel ratio afRich) by subtracting the target lean air-fuel ratio elapsed time period TLpass from the duration time TLean of the target lean air-fuel ratio.</p><p id="p0168" num="0168">As described above, the third control apparatus comprises the evaporated fuel purge section, similarly to the second control apparatus.</p><p id="p0169" num="0169">Note that, the evaporated fuel purge section of the third control apparatus is configured in such a manner that:
<ul><li>it estimates, in a case in which the operating state of the engine 10 at the purge execution request condition satisfied time point is the first operating state (refer to the "Yes" determinations at both step 620 and step 810), the first time period T1 which is a time period until the target air-fuel ratio abyfr is switched over to the target lean air-fuel ratio afLean when the target air-fuel ratio abyfr is the target rich air-fuel ratio afRich (refer to the "Yes" determination at step 670 shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>); and does not start the evaporated fuel purge if the estimated first time period T1 is shorter than the predetermined first threshold time period T1 th (refer to the "Yes" determination at step 1010, and step 690, shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>).</li></ul></p><p id="p0170" num="0170">According to the configuration described above, even when the operating state of the engine 10 at the purge execution request condition satisfied time point is the first operating state, and the target air-fuel ratio abyfr is set at the target rich air-fuel ratio afRich, the evaporated fuel purge is not started if the estimated first time period T1 is shorter than the first threshold time period T1th. Consequently, it can be avoided that the state of the catalyst 43 is the oxygen shortage state at a point in time at which,<!-- EPO <DP n="55"> --> after the fuel introduced into the intake passage by the evaporated fuel purge was combusted to be the exhaust gas, the exhaust gas has reached the catalyst 43. Accordingly, the degrading of the emission can be avoided.</p><p id="p0171" num="0171">In addition, the evaporated fuel purge section of the third control apparatus is configured in such a manner that:

Consequently, it can be avoided that the target air-fuel ratio abyfr has already been changed to the target rich air-fuel ratio afRich before the point in time at which the fuel introduced into the intake passage by the evaporated fuel purge reaches the combustion chamber 21. Accordingly, the "degrading of the drivability due<!-- EPO <DP n="56"> --> to the unstable combustion state caused by the excessively small air-fuel ratio of the engine 10" can be avoided.</p><p id="p0173" num="0173">As described above, each control apparatus according to each embodiment of the present invention can perform the evaporated fuel purge without degrading the emission, and further, without sacrificing the drivability.</p><p id="p0174" num="0174">It should be noted that the present invention should not be limited to the embodiments described above, but various modifications may be adopted without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the instructed fuel injection amount Fi may be obtained by correcting the base fuel injection amount Fbase according to a formula (2) described below, based on not only the main feedback amount KFmain but also a main feedback learning value KG as well as a purge correction coefficient FPG. <maths id="math0002" num="(2)"><math display="block"><mi>Fi</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>FPG</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi>KG</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi>FAF</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi>Fbase</mi></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="82" he="11" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0175" num="0175">In this case, a "condition that learning the main feedback learning value KG is completed" can be included as one of conditions which constitute the purge execution request condition.
