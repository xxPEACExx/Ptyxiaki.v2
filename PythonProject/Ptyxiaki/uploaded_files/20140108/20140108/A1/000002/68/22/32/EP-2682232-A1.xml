These composites comprise three structural elements or phases: abrasive grain, bond and porosity.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Bonded abrasive tools have been manufactured in a variety of 'grades' and 'structures' that have been defined according to practice in the art by the relative hardness and density of the abrasive composite (grade) and by the volume percentage of abrasive grain, bond and porosity within the composite (structure).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For nearly 70 years, tool grade and structure have been considered to be the most reliable predictors of bonded abrasive tool hardness, tool wear rate, grinding power demands, and manufacturing consistency. Grade and structure were first established as reliable manufacturing guidelines in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US1983082A"><text>U.S. Pat. No.-A-1.983,082, to Howe, et al</text></patcit>. Howe describes a volumetric manufacturing method useful for overcoming the then persistent difficulties with inconsistent abrasive composite quality and inconsistent grinding performance. In this method, one selects the relative volumetric percentages of the three structural constituents to yield a tool with a targeted grade of hardness and other desired physical characteristics. Knowing the desired volume of the finished tool, the batch weights of abrasive grain and bond components needed to make the tool are calculated from the tool volume, the relative volumetric percentages and the material densities of the abrasive grain and bond components. In this manner it was possible to create a standard structure chart for a defined bond composition and, in subsequent manufacturing runs, to read relative volumetric percentages from the standard structure chart in order to manufacture bonded abrasive tools having a consistent hardness grade for a given volume<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> percentage of abrasive grain, bond and porosity. It was observed that the grinding performance was consistent from one manufacturing batch to another when the grade and structure had been held constant.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">For many grinding operations, controlling the amount and type of porosity in the composite, particularly porosity of a permeable, or an interconnected nature, has been shown to improve grinding efficiency and to protect the quality of the work-piece being ground from thermal or mechanical damage.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Any three-dimensional abrasive composite consists of the sum of the relative volume percentages of its three constituents: abrasive grain, bond and porosity. The sum of the volume percentages of these constituents must equal 100 volume percent; therefore, tools having a high percentage of porosity must have proportionally lower percentages of bond and/or abrasive grain. In manufacturing bonded abrasive tools, one can more easily achieve relatively high volume percentages of porosity (e.g., 40-70 volume %) in precision grinding tools, made with rigid, inorganic bond materials (e.g., vitrified or ceramic bonds) and relatively small grain sizes (e.g., Norton grit sizes 46-220 grit), than in rough grinding tools made with organic bond materials and relatively large grain sizes (e.g., Norton grit sizes 12-120 grit). Very porous abrasive composites made with larger grain sizes, higher volume percentages of grain and softer, organic bond materials have a tendency to slump or stratify during the intermediate molding and curing stages of manufacturing the grinding tool. For these reasons, commercially available bonded abrasive tools made with organic bond materials often are molded to contain no porosity, and typically contain no more than 30 volume % porosity. They seldom exceed 50 volume % porosity.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Natural porosity arising from packing of the abrasive grains and bond particles during pressure molding usually is insufficient to achieve high porosity in bonded abrasive tools. Porosity inducers, such as bubble alumina and naphthalene, may be added to abrasive and bond composite mixtures to enable pressure molding and handling of a porous uncured abrasive article and to yield an adequate volume percent porosity in the final tool. Some pore inducers (e.g., bubble alumina and glass spheres) will create closed cell porosity within the tool. Closed cell pore inducers added to achieve high porosity percentages prevent the formation of open channels or interconnected porosity, thus<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> preventing or reducing fluid flow through the body of the tool, thereby tending to increase grinding forces and risk of thermal damage. Open cell pore inducers must be burnt out of the abrasive matrix (e.g., walnut shells and naphthalene), giving rise to various manufacturing difficulties.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further, the densities of pore inducers, bond materials and abrasive grains vary significantly, making it difficult to control stratification of the abrasive mix during handling and molding, often resulting in a loss of homogeneity in the three-dimensional structure of the finished abrasive article. A uniform, homogeneous distribution of the three constituents of the abrasive composite have been considered a key aspect of consistent tool quality and, for grinding wheels, important in the safe operation of wheels at the high rotational speeds needed for grinding (e.g., over 4000 surface feet per minute (sfpm)).</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The volume percent of interconnected porosity, or fluid permeability, has been found to be a more significant determinant of grinding performance of abrasive articles than mere volume percent porosity (see <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5738696A"><text>U.S. Pat. No.-A-5,738,696 to Wu</text></patcit>). The interconnected porosity allows removal of grinding waste (swarf) and passage of cooling fluid within the wheel during grinding. The existence of interconnected porosity may be confirmed by measuring the permeability of the wheel to the flow of air under controlled conditions. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5738697A"><text>U.S. Pat. No.-A-5,738,697 to Wu</text></patcit> discloses high permeability grinding wheels having a significant amount of interconnected porosity (40-80%, by volume). These wheels are made from a matrix of fibrous particles having an aspect ratio of at least 5:1. The fibrous particles may be filamentary abrasive grain or ordinary, non-fibrous abrasive grains blended with various fibrous filler materials such as ceramic fiber, polyester fiber and glass fiber and mats and agglomerates constructed with the fiber particles.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It has now been discovered that bonded abrasive tools can be made with a relatively high percentage of porosity and a relatively low percentage of abrasive grain without sacrificing mechanical strength or resistance to tool wear, even though the hardness grade of the tool would predict relatively poor mechanical strength. For organic bonded abrasive tools it is now possible to manufacture tools at relative percentages of abrasive grain, bond and porosity that form structures unknown among commercial bonded abrasives tools. These novel structures include organic bonded abrasive tools wherein the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> continuous phase of the abrasive composite consists of the porosity constituent. In a preferred method for creating these novel structures, a majority of the abrasive grain has been agglomerated with a binding material prior to mixing, molding and thermally processing the bonded abrasive tool.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Agglomerated abrasive grains have been reported to improve grinding efficiency by mechanisms unrelated to the amount or character of the porosity of the bonded abrasive tool. Abrasive grain has been agglomerated for various purposes, principal among them to allow use of a smaller abrasive grain particle ('grit') size to achieve the same grinding efficiency as a larger abrasive grit size, or to yield a smoother surface finish on the workpiece being ground. In many instances abrasive grain has been agglomerated to achieve a less porous structure and a denser grinding tool, having more strongly bonded abrasive grains.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Very low porosity (e.g., less than about 5 volume % porosity) gear honing wheels have been made from reclaimed crushed vitrified bonded abrasive composites by bonding the composites in an epoxy resin. These 'Compound' gear honing wheels have been commercially available for a number of years (from Saint-Gobain Abrasives, GmbH, formerly Efesis Schleiftechnik GmbH, Gerolzhofen, Germany).</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US2216728A"><text>U.S. Pat.

The reason for using the aggregates is to achieve very dense wheel structures for retaining diamond or CBN grain during grinding operations. If the aggregates are made with a porous structure, then it is for the purpose of allowing the inter-aggregate bond materials to flow into the pores of the aggregates and fully densify the structure during firing. The aggregates allow the use of abrasive grain fines otherwise lost in production.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US3982359A"><text>U.S. Pat.

No one has utilized agglomerated grain to make volume percent structure tools that were difficult or impossible to manufacture with ordinary abrasive grain in organic bonds. In particular, without sacrificing mechanical strength, tool life or tool performance, it has been found that relatively high volume percentages of porosity (e.g., above 30 volume %) may be achieved in bonded abrasive tools made with organic bonds.

As used herein, the term "wheel structure" refers to the volume percentage of abrasive grain, bond and porosity contained in the grinding wheel. Wheel hardness "grade" refers to the letter designation given to the wheel's behavior in a grinding operation. For a given bond type, grade is a function of the wheel porosity, grain content and certain physical properties, such as cured density, elastic modulus and sand blast penetration (the latter is more typical of vitrified bonded wheels). The "grade" of the wheel predicts how resistant to wear the wheel will be during grinding and how hard the wheel will grind, i.e., how much power will be needed to use the wheel in a given grinding operation. The letter designation for wheel grade is assigned according to a Norton Company grade scale known in the art, wherein the softest grades are designated<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> A and the hardest grades are designated Z. See, e.g., <patcit id="pcit0038" dnum="US1983082A"><text>U.S. Pat. No.-A-1,983,082, Howe, et al</text></patcit>. By matching wheel grades, one skilled in the art usually can substitute a new wheel specification for a known wheel and predict that the new wheel will perform in a manner similar to the known wheel.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In a significant and unexpected departure from these practices, the tools of the invention are characterized by alterations in their three-dimensional, monolithic composite structures, in particular, in the amount and the character of the porosity constituent, such that tool grade and structure no longer predict grinding performance.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">When made with an organic bond, the tools of the invention can be formulated to yield volume percent structures (e.g., porosity above 30 volume %) that were difficult or impossible to manufacture by prior art methods. These novel structures can be made without sacrificing mechanical strength, tool life or tool performance. In a preferred method, these structures are manufactured with an abrasive grain mixture wherein a majority of the abrasive grain is in the form of agglomerates of abrasive grain with an organic binding material, an inorganic binding material, or a mixture of the two.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">When made with an inorganic bond, the tools of the invention can be formulated to yield identical volume percent structures (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>) to conventional tools, but at a significantly lower, i.e., at least 10% lower elastic modulus value and often as much as 50% lower elastic modulus value, without any effective loss in mechanical strength. Notwithstanding this drop in stiffness, the tools of the invention exhibit commercially acceptable burst speed values and significantly better material removal rates in certain grinding operations. In a preferred method, these structures are manufactured with an abrasive grain mixture wherein a majority of the abrasive grain is in the form of agglomerates of abrasive grain with an inorganic binding material.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039"><figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">Figures 1-5</figref> illustrate the novel structures of the tools of the invention. <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a ternary diagram marked with two zones defining two sets of wheels (prior art wheels and experimental wheels of the invention) made with organic bond material. The prior art wheels and the inventive wheels are equally suitable for commercial use in high contact, precision, surface or line grinding operations, such as disc or roll grinding. The conventional wheels have volume % structures within a zone bounded by 38 to 52 vol %<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> grain, 12 to 38 vol % bond and 15 to 37 vol % porosity. In contrast, the wheels of the invention have structures within a zone bounded by 24 to 48 vol % grain, 10 to 38 vol % bond and 38 to 54 vol % porosity. One can see the inventive wheels are made with significantly less abrasive grain than the conventional wheels and contain relatively small amounts of bond and relatively large amounts of porosity. What cannot be seen from the diagram is that the inventive wheels lie in a region on the ternary diagram where prior art manufacturing methods could not be used to make grinding wheels. The prior art techniques failed as the three-dimensional composite structure slumped during thermal processing, collapsing the areas of porosity, or as the prior art wheels lacked sufficient mechanical strength for safe use in grinding operations.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is a ternary diagram illustrating two sets of wheels (prior art wheels and experimental wheels of the invention) designed for commercial use in continuous line contact area grinding operations, such as roll grinding.

The wheels of the invention are vastly superior to the conventional wheels in all operational parameters of roll grinding operations. The conventional wheels again have structures within a zone bounded by 38 to 53 vol % grain, 12 to 38 vol % bond and 15 to 37 vol % porosity. In contrast, the wheels of the invention have structures within a zone bounded by 28 to 48 vol % grain, 10 to 33 vol % bond (the sum of organic bond in the wheel and inorganic binding material in the agglomerates) and 38 to 53 vol % porosity. One can see the inventive wheels can be made with significantly less abrasive grain and significantly more porosity than the conventional wheels. What cannot be seen from the diagram is that the inventive wheels are characterized by much softer grades than the conventional wheels and lower elastic modulus values than conventional wheels (when compared at equivalent volume percent bond material), but they exhibit significantly better grinding efficiency in terms of wheel life, material removal rate and vibration or wheel chatter resistance.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> is a ternary diagram illustrating two sets of wheels (prior art wheels and experimental wheels of the invention) made with inorganic bond material, both appropriate for commercial use in high contact area surface grinding operations, such as creep feed grinding.

It can be seen from <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 4</figref> (prior art) and 5 (inventive) that the porosity (darker areas) in the abrasive composite of the inventive wheel is a continuous phase of interconnected channels. The abrasive grain and bond appear as a reticulated network in which abrasive grain is anchored in the organic bond materials. In contrast, the conventional wheels have a substantially uniform structure wherein porosity is hardly visible and clearly present as a discontinuous phase.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In a similar fashion, it has been observed for inorganic bonded tools of the invention that the porosity in the abrasive composite comprises interconnected porosity. The abrasive grains of the inventive wheels are clustered and spaced in an irregular fashion, in contrast to the regular and uniform grain spacing in comparable prior art wheels made with the same type of inorganic bond and grain materials. All constituents of the prior art wheels appear to be spaced in a uniform and homogenous manner across the surface of the wheel, whereas all constituents of the inventive wheel are irregularly spaced and the structure is not homogenous. As would be expected from an inorganic bond (e.g., vitrified bond) tool and the relatively small abrasive grit sizes typically used in such a tool, compared with the organic bond and larger grit sizes illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figures 5</figref>, porosity channels and the network of abrasive grain and bond are visually less distinct in the inorganic bond tools than the organic bond tools.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Various material properties of the bonded abrasive tools have been identified as being related to the novel composite structures disclosed herein, including mechanical strength, elastic modulus and density.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Mechanical strength properties determine whether a composite can be used as a bonded abrasive tool in a commercial grinding operation.

The organic bonded tools of the invention, as one might expect from the volume percent compositions of their novel structures, are less dense than comparable conventional tools typically used in any given grinding operation. The organic bonded tools are characterized by density of less than 2.2 g/cc, more preferably less than 2.0 g/cc, and most preferably less than 1.8 g/cc. As such, for a given grinding application (e.g., disc grinding steel cylinders) they are about 20 to 35 % less dense, and on average about 30 % less dense, than comparable conventional tools used in the same application.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The inorganic bonded tools of the invention are characterized by comparable or slightly lower densities relative to the densities of comparable conventional tools. For example, inner diameter grinding wheels of a conventional type generally have a density of about 1.97 to 2.22 g/cc, while comparable tools of the invention range from about 1.8 to 2.2 g/cc. The densities of creep feed grinding wheels of the invention and comparable conventional wheels both range from about 1.63 to 1.99 g/cc.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">However, for the inorganic bonded tools of the invention, the elastic modulus values are significantly lower, at least 10%, preferably at least 25% and most preferably 50% lower than values for comparable conventional tools. For inner diameter grinding wheels, the elastic modulus of the tools of the invention ranges from 25 to 50 GPa (values were determined with a Grindosonic™ machine, by the method described in <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="b"><text>J. Peters, "Sonic Testing of Grinding Wheels" Advances in Machine Tool Design and Research, Pergamon Press, 1968</text></nplcit>) in contrast to comparative tool elastic modulus values that typically range from 28 to 55 GPa. Likewise for creep feed wheels, the elastic modulus values for the tools of the invention ranges from 12 to 36 GPa, in contrast to comparative tool elastic modulus values that typically range from 16 to 38 GPa. Likewise for tool room wheels (surface grinding of hardened metal tools) the elastic modulus of the tools of the invention ranges from 12 to 30 GPa, in contrast to comparative tool elastic modulus values that typically range from 16 to 35 GPa. In general, for a selected grinding application, the higher the grade of comparable conventional tool needed for that application, the greater the downward shift in elastic modulus value of the inorganic<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> bonded tool of invention that delivers equal or better performance in that application. It follows that for a selected grinding application, the higher the volume % abrasive grain in a comparable conventional tool needed for that application, the greater the downward shift in elastic modulus value of the inorganic bonded tool of invention that delivers equal or better performance in that application.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The bonded abrasive tools of the invention have an unusually porous structure of interconnected porosity, making the tool permeable to fluid flow and the porosity, in effect, becoming a continuous phase within the abrasive composite.

The term Q/P represents the pressure differential measured between the abrasive tool structure and the atmosphere at a given flow rate of a fluid (e.g., air). This relative permeability Q/P is proportional to the product of the pore volume and the square of the pore size. Larger pore sizes are preferred. Pore geometry and abrasive grain size are other factors affecting Q/P, with larger grit size yielding higher relative permeability.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The abrasive tools useful in the invention are characterized by higher fluid permeability values than comparable prior art tools.

The composite abrasive tool 600 includes a portion 601 and a<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> portion 603, each of which incorporate different abrasive articles. Generally, the composite abrasive tool 600 includes portions 601 and 603 using different bonded abrasive articles, such that the portions 601 and 603 can have different characteristics, structures, grades, and/or compositions.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">According to one embodiment, the abrasive tool is a composite bonded abrasive tool wherein the portion 601 incorporates the presently disclosed abrasive tool as disclosed in the foregoing text, and the portion 603 includes a bonded abrasive article having a different abrasive structure. As described herein, "structure'' refers to the volume percentage of abrasive grain, bond material, and porosity contained in the abrasive tool. More particularly, the structure of a bonded abrasive article can be defined by abrasive structure types denoted by numerical values ranging from 4 through 15, with lower values generally indicating a bonded abrasive tool having a greater abrasive grain content. In one embodiment, portions 601 and 603 have different abrasive structure types such that the abrasive structure type of portion 601 is at least one numerical value different than the abrasive structure type of portion 603. In a more particular embodiment, the structure of portions 601 and 603 differs such that the abrasive structure type of portion 603 is at least one abrasive structure type less than the abrasive structure type of portion 603. That is, the bonded abrasive of portion 603 is can have a greater abrasive grain content than the bonded abrasive of portion 601. Other embodiments can utilize a greater difference such that the abrasive structure type of portions 603 and 601 differ by not less than two abrasive structure types, or not less than three abrasive structure types.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">The portions 601 and 603 containing the different bonded abrasives within the composite abrasive tool 600 can have different amounts of abrasive grains incorporated within their respective three-dimensional structures. In one embodiment, the difference in the abrasive grain content between portions 601 and 603 is at least about 4 vol%, such that for example, the abrasive grain content within portion 603 is greater than the abrasive grain content within portion 601 by at least about 4 vol% greater. In another embodiment, the portion 603 has an even greater abrasive grain content, such that it is at least about 6 vol% greater, or at least about 8 vol% greater, or even at least about 10 vol% greater. Still, the difference in the abrasive grain content of the bonded abrasive articles within the portions 601 and 603 is generally not greater than about 40 vol%.<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --></p><p id="p0113" num="0113">In reference to the overall density of bonded abrasive articles within the portions 601 and 603, in one embodiment, the density between the portions 601 and 603 can be different. In one particular embodiment, the bonded abrasive article of portion 601 can have a density that is less than the density of the bonded abrasive article of portion 603. In another, more particular embodiment, the density of the bonded abrasive article of portion 601 is at least about 20% less dense than the bonded abrasive article of portion 603. In another embodiment, the density of the bonded abrasive of portion 601 has a density that is at least about 40% less dense than the bonded abrasive of portion 603.</p><p id="p0114" num="0114">According to another embodiment, the bonded abrasive articles of portions 601 and 603 can include different types of abrasive grains, generally including materials such as oxides, borides, carbides, and nitrides. Some suitable abrasive grains can include abrasive materials including for example, alumina, silica, or silicon carbide, or superabrasive materials including for example, cubic boron nitride or diamond, or any combination thereof. For example, the bonded abrasive article of portion 601 can generally include alumina and the bonded abrasive article of portion 603 can include another abrasive or superabrasive grain. The size and shape of the abrasive grains between the portions 601 and 603 can be different. Additionally, the size and shape of the abrasive grains within each portion can vary. For example, one portion (601 or 603) can include a mix of abrasive grains having different shapes, such as rounded, elliptical, or needle-shaped. One portions (601 or 603) may also include different abrasive grain sizes, including for example a generally bimodal size distribution of abrasive grains, or a trimodal distribution, or an even greater distribution.</p><p id="p0115" num="0115">Moreover, the abrasive grains within the bonded abrasive article of portion 601 can be substantially agglomerated. According to one embodiment, the portion 601 can include abrasive grain agglomerates in an amount of between about 5 to about 70 vol%, while the bonded abrasive article of portion 603 can generally include a lesser amount of abrasive grain agglomerates. In one particular embodiment, the bonded abrasive article of portion 603 includes less than about 50 vol% of agglomerated abrasive grains, such that the majority of abrasive grains are unagglomerated and uniformly dispersed within the bond material. In another embodiment, the bonded abrasive article of portion 603 includes less agglomerates, such that less than about 25 vol%, or less than about 15 vol% of the abrasive grains are agglomerated. In one particular embodiment, the abrasive<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> grains of the bonded abrasive article of portion 603 are essentially unagglomerated and uniformly dispersed throughout the bond material.</p><p id="p0116" num="0116">In addition to differences in abrasive grain content, the bonded abrasive articles incorporated into the composite abrasive within portions 601 and 603 can have a difference in porosity. For example, the composite abrasive article 600 can include a combination of the abrasive article illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> bonded together with the abrasive article illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>. According to one embodiment, the difference in the porosity between the portions 601 and 603 can be at least about 4 vol%. Other embodiments can have a greater difference in the porosity between the two portions 601 and 603, such as at least about 6 vol% difference, or at least about 8 vol% difference, or even at least about 10 vol% difference. Generally, the difference is not greater than about 40 vol%.</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">Notably, some distinctions in porosity do exist based upon the particular bond material. Generally, the porosity for the presently disclosed bonded abrasive article of portion 601, using an organic bond material, is within a range between about 38 vol% to about 54 vol% porosity. For other bonded abrasive articles having an organic bond material, the porosity of the bonded abrasive article of portion 603 is generally not greater than about 37 vol%. In another embodiment, the porosity of the bonded abrasive article within portion 603 is not greater than about 30 vol%, such as not greater than about 25 vol%, or not greater than about 20 vol%. Generally, the amount of porosity of the bonded abrasive article within portion 603 is within a range between about 15 vol% and about 37 vol%.</p><p id="p0118" num="0118">The porosity for the presently disclosed bonded abrasive article of portion 601, using an inorganic bond material, is within a range between about 35 vol% to about 77 vol% porosity. For other bonded abrasive articles having an inorganic bond material, the porosity of the bonded abrasive article of portion 603 is generally less than the porosity of the bonded abrasive article of portion 601. Generally, the porosity is less than about 77 vol%. Still, more typically, the porosity of a bonded abrasive article within portion 603 is not greater than about 70 vol%, such as not greater than about 60 vol%, or not greater than about 50 vol%, or even not greater than about 40 vol%.</p><p id="p0119" num="0119">Notably, while the porosity of such structures utilizing an inorganic bond material<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> may be similar, the type of porosity, particularly the availability of open porosity in the presently disclosed bonded abrasive article of portion 601 is significantly less in other bonded abrasive articles of portion 603. The presently disclosed bonded abrasive articles generally have a porosity that is a continuous phase of interconnected channels. According to one embodiment, the porosity of the abrasive article within the portion 603 can have generally closed porosity, such that the majority of the porosity is a discontinuous phase. Still, in other embodiments, the bonded abrasive article within the portion 603 may have substantially closed porosity such that there is essentially no open porosity.</p><p id="p0120" num="0120">In addition to the distinctions above, the bonded abrasive articles of portions 601 and 603 may differ based upon their respective abrasive grades. As provided above, the "abrasive grade" generally refers to the hardness of the bonded abrasive article and is designated by letters ranging from A through Z, with A indicating a softer abrasive article and Z indicating a harder abrasive article. According to one embodiment, the bonded abrasive articles of portions 601 and 603 differ in their respective abrasive grades by at least one abrasive grade. For example, if the bonded abrasive of portion 601 has an abrasive grade of F, the bonded abrasive of portion 603 can have an abrasive grade of at least E or G. In one particular embodiment, the bonded abrasive of portion 601 is at least one abrasive grade softer than the bonded abrasive of portion 603. In a more particular embodiment, the bonded abrasive of portion 601 can have an abrasive grade between A and H on the Norton Company grade scale and the bonded abrasive of portion 603 can have an abrasive grade between B through I on the Norton Company grade scale, wherein the bonded abrasive of portion 601 is at least one grade softer than the bonded abrasive of portion 603. In another particular embodiment, the bonded abrasive of the portion 601 can have an abrasive grade between A and M on the Norton Company grade scale, and the bonded abrasive of portion 603 can have an abrasive grade between B and N on the Norton Company grade scale, wherein the bonded abrasive of portion 601 is at least one grade softer than the bonded abrasive of portion 603. Other embodiments can have a greater difference in grades between the portions 601 and 603, such as not less than about two grades of difference, or even not less than about three grades of difference.</p><p id="p0121" num="0121">As indicated above, the bonded abrasive articles of the portions 601 and 603 can have different types of bond materials, that is, an organic bond material or an inorganic<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> bond material. Typically, a bonded abrasive article having an inorganic bond type is bonded to another bonded abrasive article having the same bond type. That is, the composite abrasive article includes a bonded abrasive of portion 601 having an inorganic bond material joined together with a bonded abrasive of portion 603 which also has an inorganic bond material. However, in some embodiments, a bonded abrasive article having an inorganic bond material may be bonded to a bonded abrasive article having an organic bond material.</p><p id="p0122" num="0122">As provided above, with the use of different bond materials (i.e., organic or inorganic) bonded abrasive articles can have different abrasive grain content, porosity content, and bond content. In one particular embodiment, where the portions 601 and 603 incorporate abrasive articles having an organic bond material, the first portion 601 can include an abrasive article including a first phase having 24-48 vol % abrasive grains bonded with 10-38 vol % organic bond material and less than about 10 vol % porosity, and a second phase consisting of 38-54 vol % porosity. Accordingly, the bonded abrasive article of the portion 603 can include a bonded abrasive composite having 38-52 vol % abrasive grains, 12-38 vol % organic bond material, and a porosity of less than about 37 vol %. In another particular embodiment, the bonded abrasive of portion 601 includes 26-40 vol % abrasive grains bonded with 10-22 vol % organic bond material and less than about 10 vol % porosity, and a second phase consisting of 38-50 vol % porosity. This portion can be bonded together with the portion 603 including a bonded abrasive having 45-52 vol % abrasive grains, 10-38 vol % organic bond material, and a porosity within a range between about 15-37 vol %. Notably, in these embodiments, the portion 601 has a greater degree of porosity and incorporates abrasive grain agglomerates.</p><p id="p0123" num="0123">Additionally, in another embodiment, the portions 601 and 603 can include bonded abrasive articles having an inorganic bond material. According to one particular embodiment, the bonded abrasive article of portion 601 includes a bonded abrasive article having about 22-46 vol % abrasive grains bonded with about 4-20 vol % inorganic bond material, and about 40-68 vol% interconnected porosity. As such, the bonded abrasive article of portion 603 is bonded together with the first portion 601 and includes an abrasive article having about 22-46 vol % abrasive grains bonded with about 4-20 vol % inorganic bond material, and a porosity within a range of between about 35-77 vol%.<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --></p><p id="p0124" num="0124">Moreover, each of the portions 601 and 603 can include abrasive composites having different mechanical characteristics. For example, the elastic modulus between the portion 601 and the portion 603 can be different. In one embodiment, the bonded abrasive of portion 601 can have an elastic modulus that is at least about 10% lower than the elastic modulus of the bonded abrasive of portion 603. In another embodiment the difference in the elastic modulus between the portions 601 and 603 is greater, such that for example, the portion 601 has an elastic modulus that is at least about 25% lower, or at least about 40% lower, and even as much as about 50% lower than the elastic modulus of the bonded abrasive of portion 603.</p><p id="p0125" num="0125">The bonded abrasive articles of portions 601 and 603 can have different fluid permeabilities. As described herein, in one embodiment, the portion 601 includes a bonded abrasive article having a high degree of open porosity, and the portion 603 can include a bonded abrasive article having less open porosity. In such embodiments, the fluid permeability of the bonded abrasive of portion 601 is generally greater than the fluid permeability of the bonded abrasive of portion 603. According to one embodiment, the abrasive article of the portion 601 has a fluid permeability of at least about 10% greater than the abrasive article of the portion 603. In other embodiments, the difference is greater, such that the abrasive article of the first portion has a fluid permeability of at least about 25% greater, or even at least about 30% greater than the fluid permeability of the abrasive article of the portion 603. According to one particular embodiment, the difference in fluid permeability between the portion 601 and the portion 603 is such that it is within a range between about 25% to about 100%.</p><p id="p0126" num="0126">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref>, the dimensions of each of the portions 601 and 603 are substantially the same, such that the portion 601 has a volume which is substantially the same as the volume of the portion 603. Referring to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 7</figref>, a cross-sectional view of a portion of a composite abrasive article 700 is illustrated which includes a bonded abrasive article of portion 701 bonded together with a bonded abrasive article of portion 703. Notably, the portion 701 has a volume that is different than the volume of the portion 703. Such an arrangement may facilitate certain grinding applications where more or less of a particular type of a select abrasive article is desirable.</p><p id="p0127" num="0127">Moreover, it will be appreciated that while the included figures relating to<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> composite abrasive tools are illustrating only rectangular portions, such composite abrasive tools can have generally polygonal shapes, such as for example circular, conical, cylindrical, or even in some embodiments an irregular shape. It will also be appreciated that while the description makes particular reference to two portions, more portions may be added such that the composite abrasive tool has three or more portions.</p><p id="p0128" num="0128">The composite abrasive tools described herein can be formed by bonding the portions together. In one embodiment, bonding is carried out by heating the abrasive article portions and pressing them together. In particular, the portions can be bonded together using heat, pressure, or a combination thereof. For example, with respect to abrasive tools incorporating an inorganic bond material, bonding of such portions may utilize part of the process to form the bonded abrasive articles, namely a heating and pressing operation. The portions can be joined during a final sintering of the bonded abrasive article, wherein the bonded abrasive portions are co-sintered together thereby bonding the portions.</p><p id="p0129" num="0129">Alternatively, such portions may be bonded together using an adhesive material. Suitable adhesive materials can include organic or inorganic compounds, or any combination thereof. Adhesive materials are particularly suitable for joining abrasive articles having an organic bond material, as such abrasive tools typically are not sintered. Still, heat and pressure may be used to combine such bonded abrasive portions, and such heat and/or pressure can be applied in addition to the adhesive material.</p><heading id="h0010">Grinding Applications</heading><p id="p0130" num="0130">The abrasive tools of the invention are particularly effective in grinding applications having large surface area contact or prolonged continuous contact between the abrasive tool and the workpiece during grinding. Such grinding operations include, but are not limited to, roll and disc grinding, creep feed grinding, inner diameter grinding, tool room grinding and other precision grinding operations.</p><p id="p0131" num="0131">Fine grinding or polishing operations using micron or submicron sized abrasive grain will benefit from use of tools made with the agglomerates of the invention. Relative to conventional superfinishing or polishing tools and systems, the tools of the invention made with such fine grit abrasive agglomerates will erode at lower grinding forces with<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> little or no surface damage to the workpiece during precision finishing operations (e.g., to yield mirror finishes on glass and ceramic components). Tool life remains satisfactory due to the agglomerated structures within the three-dimensional matrix of the tool body.</p><p id="p0132" num="0132">Due to the interconnected porosity of the tools, in roll and disc grinding, coolant supply and debris removal are enhanced, resulting in cooler grinding operations, less frequent tool truing, less thermal damage to the workpiece and less grinding machine wear. Because smaller grit size abrasive grains in agglomerated form give the grinding efficiency of a larger grit size grain, but leave a smoother surface finish, the ground work part quality often improves significantly.</p><p id="p0133" num="0133">In a preferred method for disc grinding, the organic bonded abrasive tools comprising agglomerates of grain bonded with organic binding materials are mounted on a surface grinding machine, rotated at, e.g., 4000 to 6500 sfpm (20.32 to 33.02 m/s), and brought into contact with a workpiece for a sufficient period of time to grind the workpiece. With this method the wheel removes workpiece material at an effective material removal rate, the grinding surface of the wheel remains substantially free of grinding debris and, after grinding has been completed, the workpiece is substantially free of thermal damage.</p><p id="p0134" num="0134">In a preferred method for creep feed grinding, vitrified bonded abrasive wheels comprising agglomerates of grain bonded with inorganic binding materials, having an elastic modulus value that is at least 10 % lower than the elastic modulus value of an otherwise identical conventional tool having regularly spaced abrasive grains within a three-dimensional composite, and having a minimum burst speed of 4000 sfpm (20.32 m/s) is mounted on a creep feed grinding machine. The vitrified wheel is wheel is rotated at a speed of 5500 to 8500 sfpm (27.94 to 43.18 m/s) and brought into contact with a workpiece for a sufficient period of time to grind the work piece. By this method the wheel removes workpiece material at an effective material removal rate and, after grinding, the workpiece is substantially free of thermal damage.</p><p id="p0135" num="0135">In reference to another particular grinding operation, <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8</figref> is a perspective view of angled grinding operation using a composite abrasive tool 803. <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8</figref> includes a work sample 801 and a composite abrasive tool 803, such as a composite bonded abrasive<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> wheel, having a first portion 805 and a second portion 807. Each of the portions 801 and 803 can incorporate different abrasive articles, for instance a bonded abrasive article having different characteristics, structures, grades, and compositions, as described above in accordance with previous embodiments.</p><p id="p0136" num="0136">Notably, with respect to angled grinding operations, use of the composite bonded abrasive tool having portions 805 and 807 can facilitate combining enhanced material removal rates with enhanced fluid permeability and swarf removal, for efficient grinding. In one embodiment, the first portion 805 includes the presently disclosed bonded abrasive tool, that is generally an abrasive article having a high content of abrasive grain agglomerates and a high degree of open porosity. The first potion 805 corresponds to first portion 601 described above with respect to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref>. For example, in one particular embodiment, the first portion 805 includes a bonded abrasive article having abrasive grain agglomerates in the amount of between about 20-52 vol % and porosity within a range between about 38-54 vol%. The second portion 807 can include a more conventional abrasive tool, particularly an abrasive tool that is more dense, harder, and having less open porosity. The second portion 807 corresponds to second portion 603 disclosed above with respect to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref>. For example, in one embodiment, the abrasive article of portion 807 has not greater than about 20 vol% abrasive grain agglomerates and a porosity of less than about 37 vol%. Accordingly, the second portion 807 is capable of grinding under a greater applied force than the first portion 805, which is suitable for high material removal rates, while the first portion 805 having the agglomerated abrasive grains and high porosity provides improved swarf removal compared to the less porous second portion 807.</p><p id="p0137" num="0137">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 8</figref>, the material removed from area 811 can have two surfaces 811 and 813 which may have different characteristics corresponding to the different abrasive articles of first segment 805 and the second segment 807 respectively. For example, the surface 811 can have a generally smoother finish than the surface 813, as the surface 811 is formed using the presently disclosed bonded abrasive article, that is a generally softer, more porous abrasive article with abrasive grain agglomerates. While the surface 813 is formed using a conventional bonded abrasive article, having a generally harder, less porous structure including uniformly distributed abrasive grains through the bond material. According to one embodiment, after removing material initially, rougher<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> surfaces (i.e., surface 813) can be finished using the abrasive article of an adjacent portion which provides a smoother finish, which according to the above embodiment, can include the first portion 805. Such a grinding operation includes adjusting the orientation of the composite abrasive tool 803 relative to the work sample 801. Accordingly, use of such segmented abrasive tools provides enhanced efficiency and flexibility during grinding.</p><p id="p0138" num="0138">The following Examples are provided by way of illustration of the invention, and not by way of limitation.</p><heading id="h0011"><b>Example 1</b></heading><p id="p0139" num="0139">A series of agglomerated abrasive grain samples containing inorganic binding materials were prepared in a rotary calcination apparatus (electric fired model # HOU-5D34-RT-28, 1,200° C maximum temperature, 30 KW input, equipped with a 72" (183 cm) long, 5.5" (14 cm) inner diameter refractory metal tube, manufactured by Harper International, Buffalo, New York). The refractory metal tube was replaced with a silicon carbide tube of the same dimensions, and the apparatus was modified to operate at a maximum temperature of 1,550° C. The process of agglomeration was carried out under atmospheric conditions, at a hot zone temperature control set point of 1,180° C, with an apparatus tube rotation rate of 9 rpm, a tube incline angle of 2.5 to 3 degrees, and a material feedrate of 6-10 kg/hour.

The<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> compaction tests were performed using one inch (2.54 cm) in diameter lubricated steel die on an Instron® universal testing machine (model MTS 1125, 20,000 lbs (9072 Kg)) with a 5 gram sample of agglomerate. The agglomerate sample was poured into the die and slightly leveled by tapping the outside of the die. A top punch was inserted and a crosshead lowered until a force ("initial position") was observed on the recorder. Pressure at a constant rate of increase (2 mm/min) was applied to the sample up to a maximum of 180 MPa of pressure. The volume of the agglomerate sample (the compacted LPD of the sample), observed as a displacement of the crosshead (the strain), was recorded as the relative density as a function of the log of the applied pressure. The residual material was then screened to determine the percent crush fraction. Different pressures were measured to establish a graph of the relationship between the log of the applied pressure and the percent crush fraction. Results are reported in Table 1-1 as the log of the pressure at the point where the crush fraction equates to 50 weight percent of the agglomerate sample. The crush fraction is the ratio of the weight of crushed particles passing through the smaller screen to the weight of the initial weight of the sample.</p><p id="p0146" num="0146">These agglomerates had LPD, size distribution, and molding strength and granule size retention characteristics suitable for use in the commercial manufacture of abrasive grinding wheels.

Relatively large differences between 2 and 6 weight % binding material, compared with relatively small differences between 6 and 10 weight % binding material indicate a weight % binding material of less than 2 weight % may be inadequate for formation of agglomerates.

values. The comparative, commercial wheels made with phenolic resin bonds (38A80-G8 B24, -K8 B24 and -08 B24) had low wheel wear rates, but had unacceptably high vibration amplitude values. These wheels would be predicted to create vibration chatter in an actual roll grinding operation. The comparative wheels made with shellac resin bonds (53A80J7 Shellac Blend and 53A80L7 Shellac<!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --> Blend), had high wheel wear rates but acceptably low vibration amplitude values. The experimental wheels were superior to all comparative wheels over a range of power levels (nearly constant vibration amplitude at 10-23 hp and consistently lower WWR) and the experimental wheels displayed superior G-ratios (material removal rate /wheel wear rate), evidencing excellent efficiency and wheel life.</p><p id="p0160" num="0160">It is believed that the relatively low elastic modulus and relatively high porosity of the experimental wheels creates a chatter resistant wheel without sacrifice of wheel life and grinding efficiency. Quite unexpectedly, the experimental wheels were observed to grind more efficiently than wheels containing higher volume percentages of grain and having a harder wheel grade. Although the experimental wheels were constructed to yield a relatively soft grade of hardness (i.e., grade A-E on the Norton Company grinding wheel hardness scale), they ground more aggressively, with less wheel wear, yielding a higher G-ratio than the comparative wheels having a significantly harder grade value (i.e., grades G-O on the Norton Company grinding wheel hardness scale). These results were significant and unexpected.</p><heading id="h0016"><b>Example 4</b></heading><p id="p0161" num="0161">Experimental wheels containing agglomerated grain were prepared in a commercial manufacturing operation and tested in a commercial roll grinding operation where shellac bonded wheels have been used in the past.</p><heading id="h0017">Abrasive Grain/Inorganic Binding Material Agglomerates</heading><p id="p0162" num="0162">Vitrified binding materials (A Binding Material from Table 1-2) were used to make agglomerated abrasive grain sample AV4.

The weight percent quantities of abrasive agglomerate and resin bond used in these wheels are listed in Table 4-1, below. The materials were blended for a sufficient period of time to get a uniform blend. The uniform agglomerate and bond mixture was placed into molds and pressure was applied to form green stage (uncured) wheels. These green wheels were removed from the molds, wrapped in coated paper and cured by heating to a maximum temperature of 160° C, graded, finished, and inspected according to commercial grinding wheel manufacturing techniques known in the art. Finished wheel elastic modulus and fired density were measured and results are shown in Table 4-1, below.

conditions A, the experimental grinding wheels displayed excellent grinding performance, achieving significantly higher G-ratios than observed in past commercial operations under these grinding conditions with shellac bonded wheels. Based on past experience in roll grinding under grinding conditions A, experimental wheels 2-1, 2-2 and 2-3 would have been considered too soft (at Norton Company hardness grade values of B-D) to yield commercially acceptable grinding efficiency, thus these results showing excellent G-ratios were highly unusual. Moreover, roll surface finish was free of chatter marks and within the specifications for surface roughness (18-30 Ra) and number of surface peaks (approx. 160). The experimental wheels delivered a surface finish quality previously observed only with shellac bonded wheels.</p><p id="p0169" num="0169">A second grinding test of experimental wheel 3-3, under grinding conditions B, confirmed the surprising benefits of using the wheels of the invention in a commercial finishing roll cold grinding operation over an extended test period.

The wheel rotational speed and rate of material removal exceeded that of comparative commercial wheels used in this roll grinding operation, thus further demonstrating the unexpected grinding efficiency possible with the grinding method of the invention. Roll surface finish achieved by the experimental wheel was acceptable under commercial production standards.

Notably, the elastic modulus value of a comparative wheel (TG2-80 E13 VCF5) made to the desired relatively high volume % porosity and relatively low density by means of added elongated particles (abrasive grain) rather than with sacrificial pore inducers, did not display a drop in elastic modulus value. In fact, the elastic modulus value was higher than the nearest equivalent comparative wheel and much higher than the experimental wheels having equivalent volume % compositions.</p><p id="p0192" num="0192">In spite of the lowered elastic modulus properties, the speed test values for the experimental wheels were fully acceptable. At identical volume % compositions of grain, bond and porosity, experimental wheel 1 exhibited only slightly lower modulus of rupture<!-- EPO <DP n="67"> --> and burst speed values. The densities of the experimental wheels were slightly lower than those of comparative wheels that had been formulated at an identical volume % composition. Thus, a small drop in modulus of rupture was expected. The drop in density also suggests the experimental wheels had resisted shrinkage during thermal processing relative to the comparative wheels having an identical volume % composition, and this represents significant potential savings in manufacturing costs, both in material costs and in finishing operations.</p><p id="p0193" num="0193">The wheels were tested in a creep feed grinding operation using the wedge test grinding conditions described in Example 5. The wheels were tested against comparative commercial wheels recommended for use in creep feed grinding operations. The comparative wheels had the same size dimensions, identical or similar volume % compositions, equivalent hardness grades (grade was determined on the basis of volume % contents of grain, bond and porosity) and functionally equivalent bond chemistries, and they were otherwise suitable comparative wheels for a creep feed grinding study. But, the comparative wheels were made without agglomerated grain and sacrificial pore inducers were used to achieve the intended volume % porosity and wheel density. The commercial wheel designations and the compositions of the comparative wheels are described in Table 6-2 (commercial wheels 38A60-I96 LCNN, 38A60-K75 LCNN and 38A60-J64 LCNN).

These grinding operation efficiencies were achieved without any significant loss of surface quality of the workpiece being ground.

The experimental wheel (W4) having a higher volume percent abrasive grain (34%) unexpectedly exhibited a higher rate of wheel wear than the<!-- EPO <DP n="77"> --> other experimental wheels containing less abrasive grain (30%). At 0.0267 infeed, all experimental wheels exhibited lower specific energy at a given MRR than the comparative wheels. Since lower specific grinding energy correlates with lower burn potential, the wheels in the invention are anticipated to exhibit less workpiece burn than the comparative wheels. Moreover, relative to the comparative wheels, the experimental wheels delivered significantly better grinding efficiency on an abrasive grain volume fraction basis (i.e., less grain is needed to deliver the same level of grinding efficiency). This result defies the conventional wisdom in bonded abrasives technology that a higher grade wheel containing more grain will resist wear and deliver better wheel life and grinding efficiency than a lower (softer) grade wheel. Thus, the superior performance of the inventive wheels was significant and unexpected.</p><heading id="h0032"><b>Example 8</b></heading><heading id="h0033"><u>Abrasive Wheels</u></heading><p id="p0210" num="0210">Agglomerate samples A4 and A5 were used to make Type 6 cup grinding wheels (finished size 5.0 X 2.0 X 0.625 - 1.5 inch rim (12.7 X 5.08 x 1.59 - 3.81 cm rim). The experimental abrasive wheels were made according to the method described in Example 7, above.</p><p id="p0211" num="0211">It was observed during the molding and pressing of green wheels using the agglomerates that some compression of the mix was necessary to arrive at a cured wheel having sufficient mechanical strength for use in surface grinding. If the mold was filled with the mix of bond and agglomerates, and essentially no compression occurred during molding such that the agglomerates retained their original LPD, then the resultant cured experimental wheels showed no benefit in grinding versus comparative wheels. However, if sufficient pressure was applied to the molded mix of agglomerates and bond to compress the mix volume by at least 8 volume %, then the wheels exhibited improved grinding performance in surface grinding tests. It was observed that compression volume values in the range of 8-35 volume % (based on the original LPD of the agglomerate and the volume of mix placed in the mold) produced operative wheels exhibiting the benefits of the invention. It was observed further that crushing from 8 to 15 volume % of the agglomerates did not change the grinding performance of the wheel made with such agglomerates.<!-- EPO <DP n="78"> --></p><p id="p0212" num="0212">The finished wheels were safety tested according to a commercially practiced speed test to insure the wheels had sufficient mechanical strength for rotational movement when mounted on a grinding machine and sufficient mechanical strength for the grinding operation.

These observations suggest the bond was being wicked into the void areas of the agglomerates during the thermal curing operation. This bond migration during the curing step is believed to have effectively decreased the intra-agglomerate porosity and effectively increased the inter-agglomerate porosity, relative to a theoretical distribution of porosity within and between agglomerates.

As in the previous Example 7, these agglomerates were prepared from a mixture of abrasive grain, binding material containing phenolic resin (Durez Varcum® resin 29-717, specific gravity 1.28 g/cc, obtained from Durez Corporation, Dallas TX), together with the filler listed in Table 11-1. The grain and binding materials were used in the quantities described in Table 11-1. All samples were prepared with fused, silane- treated, alumina 38A abrasive grain, 80 grit size, obtained from Saint-Gobain Ceramics &amp; Plastics, Inc., Worcester, MA, USA.</p><p id="p0236" num="0236">The grain and the resin binding material were placed into the bowl of a high shear Eirich Mixer (model number RV-02 manufactured by the Eirich Company, Gurnee, IL). Mixing was initiated at a bowl speed set at 64 rpm and a paddle speed set at 720 rpm. While mixing, sufficient solvent (furfural) was sprayed as a mist, at a controlled rate, onto the mixture of grain and the binding material in order to cause grains and binding material to agglomerate together. Solvent spraying onto the mixture was continued only until grains and binding material had formed agglomerates (i.e., spraying at a rate of 15-20 g/min for 7 minutes on a batch including 2.25 kg grain together with the quantity of binding material indicated in Table 11-1). Spraying was carried out with a Tool Mist Coolant Generator, obtained from Wesco Company, Chatsworth, CA. The process of agglomeration was carried out under atmospheric conditions at room temperature.</p><p id="p0237" num="0237">After agglomeration in the mixer, the wet agglomerated abrasive grain samples were screened through a 3.5 U.S. standard sieve and dried overnight under ambient conditions. The samples were then re-screened to yield a -20/+45 granule distribution and spread in a single layer on a fluoropolymer lined baking tray (about 45 x 30 cm).<!-- EPO <DP n="90"> --> Agglomerates were then placed in an oven under atmospheric conditions, the temperature was increased to a maximum temperature of 160°C, and the agglomerates were held at maximum temperature for 30 minutes to cure the resin binding material.

The results are shown in Table 7-1.</p><p id="p0240" num="0240">These agglomerates had LPD, relative density and size distribution characteristics suitable for use in the commercial manufacture of abrasive grinding wheels. The finished, cured agglomerates had three-dimensional shapes varying among triangular, spherical, cubic, rectangular, cylindrical and other geometric shapes. Agglomerates consisted of a plurality of individual abrasive grits (e.g., 2 to 40 grits) bonded together by resin binding material at grit to grit contact points. The structures of the agglomerates were sufficiently resistant to compaction to retain a three dimensional character after being subjected to abrasive wheel mixing and molding operations (i.e., an insignificant portion (e.g., &lt; 20 wt %) of the agglomerates was reduced to individual abrasive grit structures during wheel processing). It was observed that the agglomerates made with a combination of resin and filler materials were less tacky and easier to separate than the agglomerates made with resin and no filler. Furthermore, slightly smaller amounts of solvent were needed when filler was added to the resin.</p><p id="p0241" num="0241">Thus, with minor modifications, the same methods used to make agglomerates with phenolic resin binding materials also could be used to make abrasive grain agglomerates with organic bond materials when inorganic filler materials (desired for incorporation into the grinding wheel) had been added to the organic bond materials.<!-- EPO <DP n="91"> -->

Samples C2P and W5D, tested in a separate grinding test, show better performance than the remaining wheels, but differences between the experimental and comparative wheels are consistent with the general trend.

Mixing was initiated at a bowl speed set at 460 rpm (clockwise) and a paddle speed set at 890 rpm (counterclockwise). While<!-- EPO <DP n="97"> --> mixing, sufficient solvent (furfural) was sprayed as a mist, at a controlled rate, onto the mixture of grain and the binding material in order to cause grains and binding material to agglomerate together. Solvent spraying onto the mixture was continued only until grains and binding material had formed agglomerates (i.e., spraying at a rate of 380-390 cc/min. for a total of 2.5 min on a batch including 49.5 kg grain together with the quantity of binding material indicated in Table 12-1). Spraying was carried out on a Spraying Systems apparatus (model AutoJet 38660 obtained from Spraying Systems, Wheaton IL).

The experimental abrasive wheels were made according to the method described in Example 7. The finished wheels were safety tested according to a commercially practiced speed test to insure the wheels had sufficient mechanical strength for rotational movement when mounted on a grinding machine and sufficient mechanical strength for the grinding operation. All experimental wheels survived a 6308 rpm speed test and, thus, had sufficient mechanical strength for surface grinding operations. The composition of the wheels (including type and ratio of agglomerates, volume % abrasive, bond and porosity in the cured wheels) are described in Table 12-2.

The G-ratio/Abrasive volume % fraction is a measure of the grinding performance the grain in the wheel. The calculation normalizes the grinding performance to account for the significant differences in volume % abrasive grain among the experimental and comparative wheels. It can be readily seen that the abrasive grain in the experimental wheels delivers significantly better grinding efficiency on a volume fraction basis (i.e., less grain is needed to deliver the same level of grinding efficiency).</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p0258" num="0258">The test results demonstrate the experimental wheels having a D or G grade on the Norton Hardness Grade scale perform in an equivalent manner to the comparative wheels having a harder grade of P to T grade. The performance of the experimental wheels was particularly surprising because these wheels contained only 30 volume % abrasive grain, whereas the comparative wheels contained 46 volume % abrasive grain. Thus, the wheels of the invention maximize the grinding performance of the individual grains, boosting the grain performance by a significant amount.<!-- EPO <DP n="103"> --></p><p id="p0259" num="0259">According to a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to the following issues:
