This cutting insert is provided with an insert main body formed in the shape of a tetragonal plate, and the insert main body is provided with a pair of tetragonal faces kept apart in an insert thickness direction and four side faces connecting sides of the tetragonal faces in the insert thickness direction. A major cutting edge extending along the insert thickness direction and a pair of minor cutting edges extending along the sides of the tetragonal faces from both ends of the major cutting edge are formed at each of four ridge lines between the adjacent side faces of the insert main body, thereby constituting each of four cutting edges. Further, on the side faces, four tetragonal rake faces are formed, and the three sides of each of the four tetragonal rake faces are formed by the major cutting edge and the pair of minor cutting edges.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">When used in turning, this type of cutting insert is fixed with a screw or by using a clamp mechanism so as to be attached in a detachable manner at a tip of a shaft-like tool main body and used for groove processing in a state such that one of four cutting<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> edges is disposed so as to oppose an outer face of a workpiece which is, for example, formed in a cylindrical shape and rotates axially. Further, when used in milling, a plurality of cutting inserts are fixed so as to be attached in a detachable manner at an outer circumference of a tip of a tool main body which is formed in a cylindrical shape and rotates axially around a tool, with intervals kept in a circumferential direction, thereby giving groove processing to a wall surface of a workpiece in a state such that one of four cutting edges of each cutting insert is projected from an outer circumference face of the tool main body.</p><heading id="h0003">Prior Art Document</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Document</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO8703831A"><text>WO87/03831</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, the above-described conventional cutting insert has the following problems.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">That is, when a cutting edge of the cutting insert is used to perform groove processing to an outer face of a workpiece, etc., to attain a predetermined groove depth or more, in the case of turning, other cutting edges positioned further forward in a rotating direction of the workpiece than the cutting edge in process of groove processing will enter into a groove which has been machined. In the case of milling, other cutting edges positioned further backward in a rotating direction of a tool than the cutting edge in groove processing will enter into a groove which has been machined. Thereby, the other cutting edges which are not in use may make contact with a groove wall to damage a machined surface. In view of the above-described situation, the conventional cutting<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> insert has been used only for shallow groove processing so that a groove shape that can be machined will not exceed a predetermined groove depth.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">There is also a case where a new cutting edge may be damaged by being brought into contact with a groove wall and wasted, although other cutting edges are not in use.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">An object of the present invention provides a cutting insert which is capable of preventing other cutting edges different from a cutting edge used for cutting from making contact with a groove wall of a groove which has been machined even on deep groove processing, thereby sufficiently securing accuracy of machining the groove and also preventing damage of a cutting edge which is not yet used.</p><heading id="h0007">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">In order to attain the above object, the present invention has proposed the following means.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">One aspect of the cutting insert of the present invention is provided with an insert main body formed in the shape of a tetragonal plate, the insert main body having a pair of tetragonal faces kept apart in a direction of a thickness of the insert main body and having four side faces connecting sides of the tetragonal faces in the direction of the thickness of the insert main body.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Four cutting edges are formed at ridge lines between the adjacent side faces of the insert main body, each of the four cutting edges being provided with a major cutting edge extending along the direction of the thickness of the insert main body and a pair of minor cutting edges extending along the sides of the tetragonal faces from both ends of the major cutting edge.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Four tetragonal rake faces are formed on a pair of side faces of the four side faces, the pair of side faces facing opposite each other, the three sides of each of the four tetragonal rake faces being formed by the major cutting edge and the pair of minor cutting edges.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As seeing in the front a first rake face of the four rake faces, the major cutting edge continuing to the first rake face and the major cutting edge continuing to a second rake face, which faces opposite the first rake face, extend in a different direction to each other so as to intersect in an X-letter shape.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">When the cutting insert is used to perform groove processing, a major cutting edge of a cutting edge used for cutting is disposed so as to be in parallel with, for example, an outer face of a workpiece. With the cutting insert kept in the above-described manner, the cutting edge comes close to the workpiece to perform groove machining to the outer face thereof. Next, when there is obtained a predetermined groove depth or more, the cutting edge of the second rake face which faces opposite the rake face (the first rake face) on which the cutting edge is disposed is housed inside a groove which has been machined.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">That is, as seeing in the front the first rake face, the major cutting edge of the first rake face and the major cutting edge of the second rake face extend in a different direction to each other so as to intersect in an X-letter shape. In other words, the major cutting edge of the first rake face and the major cutting edge of the second rake face are in a twisted positional relationship. Since the major cutting edge of the first rake face is disposed in parallel in a groove width direction, the major cutting edge of the second rake face is disposed so as to incline in the groove width direction. Thereby, a length of the major cutting edge of the second rake face along the groove width direction is shorter than a groove width of the groove which has been machined by the major cutting edge of the first rake face. As a result, the cutting edge of the second rake face does not make contact with a groove wall of the groove which has been machined by the cutting edge of the first rake face, and the cutting edge of the second rake face is housed inside the groove.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> As described above, according to the cutting insert of the present invention, even when deep groove processing is performed, the cutting edge of the second rake face is prevented from making contact with the groove wall, thereby sufficiently securing accuracy of machining the groove. Therefore, the groove can be machined in various shapes (in particular, groove depth). Further, where a cutting edge of the second rake face is not in use, the cutting edge not in use is prevented from being damaged due to contact with a groove wall, and thus, the cutting edge is not wasted.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Still further, in the cutting insert of the present invention, it is acceptable that, as seeing in the front the first rake face, the major cutting edge continuing to the first rake face extends so as to incline gradually to the outside of the other tetragonal face while being close to the other tetragonal face from one tetragonal face of the pair of tetragonal faces. It is also acceptable that the major cutting edge continuing to the second rake face extends so as to incline gradually to the inside of the other tetragonal face while being close to the other tetragonal face from one tetragonal face.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In this case, when the cutting edge of the first rake face is used to perform cutting and the cutting edge thereof is then exchanged to the cutting edge of the second rake face to perform cutting, the cutting insert is detached from a tool main body, the cutting insert is reversed in an insert thickness direction so as to change the positions of the rake faces with each other, and the cutting insert is again attached to the tool main body. Thereby, the major cutting edge ofthe second rake face is disposed simply and accurately at the same position where the major cutting edge of the first rake face was located. Thus, the cutting edge can be positioned easily on exchange to result in saving of time and labor.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the cutting insert of the present invention, as seeing in the front the first rake face, it is acceptable that an intersection angle formed by the major cutting edge<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> continuing to the first rake face and the major cutting edge continuing to the second rake face is from 17° to 20°.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In this case, when the cutting edge of the first rake face is used to perform groove processing, the cutting edge of the second rake face is reliably prevented from making contact with a groove wall, thereby securing rigidity of the insert main body.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">That is, where the intersection angle is less than 17°, the major cutting edge of the second rake face is not allowed to sufficiently incline in a groove width direction, and there is a fear that the cutting edge of the second rake face may make contact with a groove wall. Further, where the intersection angle is in excess of 20°, the major cutting edge inclines to a greater extent. It is, therefore, necessary that the minor cutting edges are formed so as to incline at a large angle with decreasing the thickness of the insert main body while being spaced away from the major cutting edge so that the minor cutting edges of the cutting edge used for cutting are not in contact with the groove wall.

With the cutting insert 1 attached in the above-described manner, the workpiece W is rotated around its axis and the cutting edge 7 comes close to the workpiece W to perform groove processing to the outer face E. Next, when a groove is machined in a predetermined depth or more, the cutting edge 7 of the second rake face 8b which faces opposite the rake face 8a (the first rake face) on which the cutting edge 7 is disposed is housed inside the groove which has been machined.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">That is, as seeing in the front the first rake face 8a, the major cutting edge 5a of the first rake face 8a and the major cutting edge 5b of the second rake face 8b extend in a different direction to each other so as to intersect in an X-letter shape. In other words, the major cutting edge 5a of the first rake face 8a and the major cutting edge 5b of the second rake face 8b are in a twisted positional relationship. The major cutting edge 5a of the first rake face 8a is disposed in parallel in the groove width direction (the lateral direction in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 9</figref>). Therefore, the major cutting edge 5b of the second rake face 8b is disposed so as to incline in the groove width direction. Thereby, a length of the major cutting edge 5b of the second rake face 8b along the groove width direction is shorter than a groove width L of the groove which has been machined by the major cutting edge 5a of the first rake face 8a. As a result, the cutting edge 7 of the second rake face 8b is housed in the groove without making contact with a groove wall S of the groove which<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> has been machined by the cutting edge 7 of the first rake face 8a.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">As described so far, according to the cutting insert 1 of the present embodiment, even on deep groove processing, the cutting edge 7 of the second rake face 8b is prevented from making contact with the groove wall S to sufficiently secure accuracy of machining a groove. Therefore, the groove is machined in a wide variety of shapes (in particular, groove depth). Further, when the cutting edge 7 of the second rake face 8b is not used, the cutting edge 7 which is not used is prevented from being damaged due to contact with the groove wall S, and therefore, the cutting edge 7 is not wasted.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Further, in the cutting insert 1, as seeing in the front the first rake face 8a, while being close to the other tetragonal face 2b from one tetragonal face 2a, the major cutting edge 5a continuing to the first rake face 8a inclines gradually to the outside of the other tetragonal face 2b. Still further, while being close to the other tetragonal face 2b from one tetragonal face 2a, the major cutting edge 5b continuing to the second rake face 8b inclines gradually to the inside of the other tetragonal face 2b. In addition, the cutting edge 7 having the major cutting edge 5a and the cutting edge 7 having the major cutting edge 5b are disposed so as to assume a 180° symmetry (dyad symmetry) with each other with respect to the virtual axis passing through the centers of the side faces 3b, 3b. Therefore, for example, when the cutting edge 7 of the first rake face 8a is used to perform cutting and the cutting edge is then exchanged to the cutting edge 7 of the second rake face 8b to perform cutting, the cutting insert 1 is detached from a tool main body 21, the cutting insert 1 is reversed (turned at 180° around the virtual axis) in the insert thickness direction T so as to change the positions of the rake faces 8a, 8b with each other, and the cutting insert 1 is again attached to the tool main body 21 by allowing the tetragonal face 2b to make contact with the attachment seat surface 24. Thereby, the major cutting edge 5b of the second rake face 8b is disposed simply and accurately at the same position at which the major cutting edge 5a of the first rake face 8a was located<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> before. Thus, the cutting edge 7 can be positioned easily on exchange to result in saving of time and labor.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Further, as seeing in the front the first rake face 8a, an intersection angle θ formed by the major cutting edge 5a continuing to the first rake face 8a and the major cutting edge 5b continuing to the second rake face 8b is from 17° to 20°. Therefore, on groove processing by using the cutting edge 7 of the first rake face 8a, it is possible to reliably prevent the cutting edge 7 of the second rake face 8b from making contact with the groove wall S and secure rigidity of the insert main body 4.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">That is, when the intersection angle θ is less than 17°, the major cutting edge 5b of the second rake face 8b will not incline sufficiently in the groove width direction and there is a possibility of that the cutting edge 7 of the rake face 8b may make contact with the groove wall S. Further, when the intersection angle θ is in excess of 20°, the major cutting edge 5 inclines greatly. Therefore, the minor cutting edges 6 are required to be formed so as to incline at a large angle with decreasing the thickness of the insert main body while being spaced away from the major cutting edge 5 so that the minor cutting edges 6 of the cutting edge 7 used for cutting are not in contact with the groove wall S. There is a possibility of that the insert main body 4 may be decreased in thickness, thereby failing in securing rigidity of the insert main body 4.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Further, as seeing in the front the first major flank face 9a, the major cutting edge 5a continuing to the first major flank face 9a and the major cutting edge 5c continuing to the second major flank face 9c which faces opposite the first major flank face 9a extend in a different direction to each other so as to intersect in an X-letter shape. In other words, the major cutting edge 5a and the major cutting edge 5c are in a twisted positional relationship, thereby providing the following effects. That is, the major cutting edge 5a of the first major flank face 9a used for cutting can be disposed so as to incline gradually either forward or backward in an extending direction of a groove to be<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> machined, while being close to the other end of the groove from one end thereof in the groove width direction. Thereby, the cutting edge can be increased in sharpness and chips can be removed more efficiently.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Further, the cutting insert 1 is a square-type insert in which the cutting edge 7 is formed at each of four corners of the insert main body 4 formed in the shape of a tetragonal plate. Accordingly, the insert main body 4 is high in rigidity and the cutting edges 7 usable for one unit of the cutting insert 1 are provided in a sufficient number. Thereby, a tool is expected to have a longer service life. That is, a conventional insert having a rod-shape with a dog-bone-shape is such that a cutting edge is formed only at both ends of two corners and fewer in the number of cutting edges. Further, the insert main body is not sufficient in rigidity, thus resulting in a shorter tool life.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">The present invention shall not be limited to the above-described embodiment but may be modified in various ways within a scope not departing from the gist of the present invention, for example, as described below.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">In the above-described embodiment, the cutting insert 1 and the edge-exchange type grooving tool 20 are provided to perform outer-diameter groove processing to an outer face E of a workpiece W formed in the shape of a cylinder.
