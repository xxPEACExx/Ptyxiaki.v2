A traditional example thereof is a fan-jet engine used in a large airliner. In the fan-jet engine, about 85% of combusted gas energy is not used as a rotational force but is used as kinetic energy (thrust force) of an exhaust gas.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">On the other hand, a turbine used as an engine for power generation or a tank does not require the thrust force generated due to a spurting gas, and energy of an exhaust gas discharged from the engine is not used to generate a rotational force of the shaft but the greater part of energy goes to waste. For example, in a turbine for power generation, the thrust force caused by the exhaust gas is not required, and only the rotational force of the shaft is used. Also, when a turbine is used as an engine, such as a tank, the velocity of the tank is very lower than the velocity of the exhaust gas such that the thrust force of the tank is not generated due to the exhaust gas, and the greater part of energy of the exhaust gas wastes. Thus, when the turbine is used for power generation or as an engine, the amount of energy of the exhaust gas discharged may be reduced if possible, and rotational energy of the shaft may be increased.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, in current gas turbines, it is impossible to convert the greater part of a high-temperature high-pressure gas spurting from a combustion chamber into a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> rotational force. Thus, a considerable amount of combustion gas is discharged in a high-temperature high-pressure gas state, and much energy wastes. Also, in such a gas turbine, the turbine must be manufactured using a high-quality and high ablative material that withstands a high-temperature gas generated in the combustion chamber. Thus, the gas turbine is a very expensive device. For your reference, a rear turbine 1200°C or more when the turbine operates.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, in gas turbines according to the related art, blades of a turbine are surrounded by a housing of the turbine and thus a predetermined distance between ends of the blades and an inner circumferential surface of the housing of the turbine must be made in consideration of thermal expansion of the blades. Thus, as a pressure loss of the gas increases, the generation efficiency of the rotational force of the turbine is lowered.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In addition, in gas turbines according to the related art, generation of a force used to rotate the blades from an incident gas depends on the momentum transferred to the blades from the gas, and the momentum is determined by several factors, such as the number of the blades, an angle or an area of the incident gas. However, since the velocity and direction of a gas that collides with turbine blades are changed, in this consideration, it is very difficult to properly design the shape or angle of the turbine blades in a next row and to arrange several thousands of blades in such a way that the occurrence of turbulence is minimum. Thus, there is a limitation in manufacturing a turbine having high efficiency.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In addition, in gas turbines according to the related art, the rear turbine is configured in multiple stages, the temperature of the combustion gas is excessively high, the velocity of the discharged combustion gas increases excessively and the discharged combustion gas expands excessively, and the greater part of energy of the exhaust gas is generated as the thrust force in addition to the rotational force. Thus, energy of the exhaust gas wastes in other places than a place where the thrust force is used to propel the airplane, like in a jet airliner, and only a part of energy of the exhaust gas is converted into the rotational force. As a result, in the field where rotational force is required, like in a gas turbine for power generation, the thrust force is a waste of energy that is not conducive to generation of the rotational force.</p><heading id="h0003">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><heading id="h0004">TECHNICAL PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention provides a gas turbine that is capable of improving thermal efficiency of a turbine for power generation by converting energy of an exhaust gas into rotational energy at a high rate if possible.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention also provides a gas turbine that is capable of easily manufacturing a turbine having high efficiency by simplifying factors for determining the momentum caused by a gas.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention also provides an innovative gas turbine that is capable of forming a turbine in multiple stages and reducing the temperature of a combustion gas so as to convert energy of an exhaust gas into a rotational force and that is capable of improving thermal efficiency of the gas turbine even though the temperature of the exhaust gas is remarkably reduced.</p><heading id="h0005">TECHNICAL SOLUTION</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a gas turbine including: a gas expansion part that expands gas; a power generation part that generates a rotational force due to the gas expanded by the gas expansion part and has a turbine shaft so as to transfer the rotational force; an air compression part that is combined with the turbine shaft of the power generation and rotates and compresses air so as to supply compressed air to the gas expansion part, wherein the power generation part generates the rotational force when a nozzle assembly having at least one injection hole so as to inject the gas in a circumferential direction is combined with the turbine shaft and the gas is injected in the circumferential direction via the at least one injection hole.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a gas turbine including: a casing in which an injection chamber having an inlet and an outlet is provided; a turbine shaft that penetrates the injection chamber of the casing and is rotatably combined with the casing; at least two nozzle assemblies that are combined with each other by a predetermined distance along an axial direction of the turbine shaft, are opened in a direction of an inlet of the casing and are closed in a direction of an outlet of the casing so as to have a housing, which is combined with the turbine shaft and in which at least one injection hole is formed through an outer circumferential surface of the housing and a gas injection pipe, which is combined with the at least one injection<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> hole of the housing so as to communicate with each other and in which an open end is formed in a circumferential direction of the gas injection pipe; a gas expansion part that is installed within the casing and generates a combustion gas so as to supply the combustion gas to the at least two nozzle assemblies; and a guide that is combined with the casing so as to block a space between the at least two nozzle assemblies and guides the combustion gas injected from the gas injection pipe of a front nozzle assembly to the housing of a rear nozzle assembly.</p><heading id="h0006">EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">In a gas turbine according to the present invention, a gas is injected in a circumferential direction so as to rotate a turbine shaft using a repulsive force so that the efficiency of conversion of rotational energy of the turbine can be improved and manufacturing costs can be reduced.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In addition, a flow resistance to the gas can be reduced, a pressure loss can be prevented, and energy loss can be reduced so as to manufacture an inexpensive turbine having high efficiency.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In addition, when turbines having capacities different from each other are manufactured, parts can be easily shared with each other, and the eccentric rotation of the turbine shaft can prevented to significantly improve durability.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Furthermore, an air compression part, a gas expansion part, and a power generation part can be modularized, and fuel and water can be supplied together.

The impeller type turbine according to the related art requires many top-level human resources and a high degree of precision when designing, manufacturing or assembling several hundreds or thousands of impellers, whereas the degree of precision of the gas turbine required for parts design or manufacturing and assembling is much lower than that of the impeller type turbine according to the related art, and the number of parts of the gas turbine is remarkably reduced so that a turbine having high efficiency, in which a rotational force of the turbine is drastically increased, can be manufactured with a considerably low price compared to the current impeller type turbine.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In the gas turbine, the momentum of the gas is transferred to an injection hole (i.e., the relative velocity of the gas with respect to the turbine is zero). Thus, the momentum of the gas is zero and theoretical energy transfer efficiency is 100%, which cannot be theoretically achieved in the impeller type turbine according to the related art.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In the impeller type turbine according to the related art, although a path of the gas incident from a boiler is uniform, once the gas collides with one impeller, the velocity and direction of the gas are changed, and a part of the gas is reflected in a backward direction of the impeller in a front line due to a reaction caused by collision with the impeller, and the turbine may be decelerated due to a difference between the rotation velocity and direction of the impeller and the direction and velocity of the reflected gas. These problems can be reduced through design but cannot be completely solved. Thus, actual energy conversion efficiency cannot be prevented from being slightly lowered. Contrary to this, in the gas turbine, nozzle assemblies are sequentially disposed, and a gas injection pipe is provided instead of an impeller so that lowered energy conversion efficiency can be remarkably improved.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In the gas turbine, as the gas is injected from the gas injection pipe of the nozzle assembly in the same circumferential direction, the turbine shaft rotates at a high speed due to a repulsive force of the injected gas. However, the temperature of the gas expansion part 2 is excessively increased to 1200°C or more so that air in the gas expansion part 2 is excessively expanded and the injection velocity of the gas is drastically increased. This is because, except for a small gas turbine, the nozzle assembly may be damaged without withstanding a centrifugal force generated by high speed rotation. In this consideration, if the supply amount of fuel or the supply amount of air is arbitrarily reduced not to rotate the nozzle assembly at a high speed, the efficiency of the turbine may be remarkably lowered.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Thus, in the present embodiment, the water injection pipe 23 in addition to the fuel<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> injection pipe 22 communicates with the combustion tub 21 so that water is injected into the combustion tub 21 immediately after a combustion process, so that the temperature of the gas expansion part 2 can be reduced to about 200°C to 300°C so as to adjust the injection velocity of the gas to approximately a tangential velocity and simultaneously the volume of a gas caused by evaporation and expansion of water is increased so as to mix a high-pressure vapor in the gas, thereby obtaining a high rotational force. Thus, energy conversion efficiency of the turbine can be improved, and an alloy of metal that is usually used can be used instead of a high-temperature ablative material so that manufacturing costs of the turbine can be reduced and a material used in manufacturing the turbine can be easily selected.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In the above-described embodiment, the gas expanded by the gas expansion part 2 flows in the rear nozzle assembly 32 via a space between the outer circumferential surface of the turbine shaft 31 and the inner circumferential surface of the housing 325.

For example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 9</figref>, the turbine shaft 31 is formed in the form of a hollow 311, and a through hole 312 is formed in an outer circumferential surface of the turbine shaft 31 so that the hollow 311 and each of the injection chambers 431, 432, and 433 communicate with each other through the through hole 312. A plurality of turbine shafts 31 may be combined with each other so as to be connected to each other, and a space between the turbine shafts 31 may be combined with each other so that the hollow 311 and the nozzle assembly 32 communicate with each other. Thus, a process in which the gas discharged from the gas expansion part 2 flows in the hollow 311 of the turbine shaft 31 via the through hole 312 and the gas is injected into each injection chamber via the rear nozzle assembly 32, is sequentially performed so that a rotational force can be generated.
