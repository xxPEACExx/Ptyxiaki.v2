It is desirable that the medical device be able to be re-used for other patients. Therefore, the medical device must be decontaminated and/or disinfected after each use to reduce the risk of spreading infection or disease between patients, and between the patients and the attendants. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Disinfectants and other cleaners can be used to de-contaminate a medical device after its use. However, certain medical devices include electronic or other sensitive components, push buttons, irregular or non-smooth surface features, and other features that make decontamination and disinfection difficult. In addition, disinfectants and other cleaners can degrade the components of the medical device, increasing the frequency in which repairs or replacements are needed, reducing product life, and increasing warranty costs to the manufacturer. Designing the electronic components and housing of the medical devices to withstand disinfection can increase the cost of the device. In addition, as new disinfectant products and cleaning protocols are identified, product maintenance costs are increased since the medical device must continually be tested and validated to determine and verify claims regarding the medical device's ability to be disinfected. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The use of disinfectants to decontaminate medical devices between uses can raise other problems. For example, disinfectants can be costly, require special training in their use, and special handling for storage and disposal. The use of disinfectants can also be time consuming 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 and require a special location in which the decontamination is to be completed. The reliability of the disinfectant process can also vary based on the ability of the operator performing the decontamination and the process that is used. In addition, the owner of the meter must monitor the impact of repeated disinfection on the performance of the medical device, and deal with the manufacturer to obtain a repair or replacement medical device if performance has been unsuitably degraded. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Therefore, it is desirable to avoid or minimize the use of disinfectants in removing contamination from medical devices while preventing contamination during use of the medical device so it can be re-used at a later time. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">SUMMARY </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> Protective barriers are provided for medical devices. The protective barrier includes a casing that houses at least a portion of the medical device to prevent or reduce the possibility of contamination of the medical device by the user and/or patient during use. As used herein, the "user" can be a physician, nurse, attendant, caregiver, or person being treated with the medical device. The casing includes an outer surface, an inner surface, and at least one opening through which the medical device may be positioned. The casing may be designed to entirely enclose the medical device, or to partially enclose the medical device. When partially enclosed, it is contemplated that the casing provides a barrier on those portions of the medical device that are handled by the user or that are most likely to be exposed to the patient. In either situation, the casing is effective to prevent contamination of the medical device from bodily fluids, bacteria, viruses and other substances. Although not necessarily limited to such, the casings are useful for handheld medical devices having electronic components or other features that are degraded by the use of disinfectants and other cleaners applied directly to the medical device for disinfection and/or sterilization. The casing allows the use of disinfectant, cleaners and/or sterilizers to be avoided which may increase the useful life of the medical device, reduce product development and testing costs, and provide a more reliable decontamination regimen. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 It is contemplated that the medical device is positioned in the casing before its use. For purposes of this disclosure, a "use" may include multiple uses of the device by a single test subject, or each singular use of the device among different individual test subjects. After each use, the casing is readily disposed of so that it cannot be re-used. According to one aspect, the casing must be destroyed in order to remove the medical device, preventing re-use of the casing in subsequent uses of the medical device. In one refinement of this aspect, the casing includes perforations between the opening and an end of the casing opposite the opening. The casing is severed or separated along the perforations, such as by manually tearing or cutting, to remove the medical device. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to another aspect, the casing includes a flap adjacent one side of the opening that is folded or pulled over the opening and secured to the outer surface of the casing with an adhesive. The outer surface includes a plurality of demarcations indicating locations at which the flap may be secured to provide a custom-fit casing for a particularly sized medical device, allowing the same casing configuration to be used with different sizes of medical devices. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to another aspect, an adhesive is provided generally about the circumference of the opening for securing the opening directly to the medical device, such that the medical device is only partially enveloped by the casing about those portions of the medical device which are desirably kept protected by the casing. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to another aspect, the casing includes an end opposite the opening that is tapered along opposite sides of the casing so the medical device is properly located and registered in the casing. This can be useful when the casing includes a passage or other feature that is to be aligned with a portion of the medical device to facilitate use of the medical device during the procedure. In one refinement of this aspect, the tapered sides of the medical device extend to opposite corners that are crimped to provide handling features which may be handled by the user to facilitate destructive removal of the medical device from the casing. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the invention, an apparatus is contemplated comprising: 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 a casing for a hand-held medical device having an inner surface, an outer surface, and a sealable opening providing access to the inner surface so that the medical device is positionable into the casing through the opening; and </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">the casing including a plurality of perforations extending at least into the outer surface at a location spaced from the opening; </p><p id="p0015" num="0015">wherein the casing is destructively separable along the perforations to remove the medical device from the casing after the medical device is used. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In a specific embodiment, the casing includes an end opposite the opening. Preferably, the perforations are located between the opening and the end of the casing. The end opposite the opening may be substantially closed to prevent the medical device from passing through the end opposite the opening. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Additionally or alternatively, opposite lateral sides of the casing may be tapered to an end opposite the opening to align the medical device with a passage extending through the end, the passage for receiving a test element which is insertable into the medical device. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Specifically, the casing may be tapered along opposite lateral sides of the casing to form opposite corners at an end of the casing opposite the opening, the corners extending from respective ones of the tapered lateral sides, wherein the corners of the casing are formed having a generally flattened profile along the respective tapered lateral sides to provide a handling feature for applying a force to separate the casing along the perforations. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Advantageously, the sealable opening comprises a flap adjacent at least one side of the sealable opening and positionable over the opening and securable to the outer surface so that the medical device is substantially enclosed in the casing. The casing may include an adhesive on at least one of the flap and the outer surface to secure the flap to the outer surface. Preferably, the casing includes a plurality of target markings visible from the outer surface, the target markings providing selected locations along the casing in which to secure the flap to the outer surface to vary a length of the casing based on a length of the medical device positioned in the casing. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
 In a further embodiment, the casing is at least partially translucent so that at least a portion of the medical device is visible through the casing. </p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In a further embodiment, the casing at least partially encloses the medical device, and the casing has a passage extending through the inner and outer surfaces of the casing, the passage for receiving a test element which is insertable into the medical device. </p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Alternatively, the casing may completely enclose the medical device. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In a specific embodiment, the perforations extend partially into the casing. More specifically, the perforations may extend through the inner and outer surfaces of the casing. </p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Advantageously, the perforations may extend completely across the casing to opposite lateral sides of the casing. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024">These and other aspects, refinements, features, advantages, objects, and purposes of the protective barriers are discussed further below with reference to the drawings included herewith. </p><p id="p0025" num="0025">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </p><p id="p0026" num="0026"> Fig. 1 is a proximal plan view of a first exemplary protective barrier for protecting a medical device from contamination during use. </p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Fig. 2 is a section view through line 2-2 of Fig. 1. </p><p id="p0028" num="0028"> Figs. 3 A and 3B are sectional views through alternate embodiment perforations of the protective barrier of Fig. 1. </p><p id="p0029" num="0029"> Fig. 4 is a bottom end elevation view of the protective barrier of Fig. 1. </p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Fig. 5 is a side elevation view of the protective barrier of Fig. 1. </p><p id="p0031" num="0031"> Fig. 6A is a perspective view showing the protective barrier of Fig. 1 and a medical device positioned in the protective barrier.

It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Any such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated devices, and such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated herein are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates. </p><p id="p0038" num="0038">A number of exemplary embodiments of the protective barrier comprise a casing configured to receive a medical device to prevent contamination of the medical device when the medical device is used for treatment. The protective barriers can be provided for protection with a variety of medical devices such as, for example, medical measurement devices such as blood- glucose meters, electronic blood pressure meters, electronic blood gas meters, electronic pulse/heart rate monitor, or multiple function meters which provide combinations of these and other functions. The protective barriers can also be provided for protection of medical devices with electrical components and movable parts, such as push buttons, key pads, scroll bars, knobs, and other features. Protection of the medical devices eliminates or reduces the need to apply disinfectants or other cleaners to the medical device after each use to eliminate biological and 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
 other contaminants that may have come in contact with the medical device during use. The protective barriers can be disposable to prevent their re-use in a subsequent procedure with the medical device. However, to ensure re-use is prevented, the protective barriers typically comprise one or more features that require destruction of the barrier as a result of removing the medical device from the barrier. </p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Exemplary protective barriers employ casings that are at least translucent if not transparent, at least in particular locations, so the user can visualize input components, display components, or other features of the medical device through the casing to enable complete use of the device. The casings may also be any one or combination of flexible, elastic, collapsible, foldable, and pliable so that the shape of the casing readily receives, conforms to or adapts to the outer shape or profile of the medical device positioned in the casing. Suitable materials for the protective barriers include plastics and polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester; elastomers; impermeable fabrics; foils; and/or latex-free materials. However, the protective barriers described herein are not limited to such materials. </p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Figs. 1-5 illustrate an exemplary protective barrier in the form of casing 100 for a hand-held medical device. Casing 100 includes outer surface 102, an inner surface 104 which defines an inner boundary of the casing 100 around space 120, and at least one opening 106 to provide access to space 120. Opening 106 is located at a first end 108 of casing 100. Casing 100 includes a second end 1 10 opposite first end 108, opposite lateral sides 112, 114 that extend between second end 110 and first end 108, and opposite proximal and distal sides 1 16, 1 18 that are defined between first and second ends 108, 1 10 and lateral sides 112, 1 14. Opening 106 is sized to allow a medical device to be positioned therethrough, and inner surface 104 is configured to receive at least a portion of a hand-held medical device through opening 106. Other embodiments contemplate that the opening 106 could be provided through second end 1 10, or through one of lateral sides 1 12, 114, or through one of the proximal or distal sides 1 16,

 In the embodiment of Fig. 1, casing 100 also includes perforations 122 at least across proximal side 1 16, although embodiments where perforations also or alternatively extend across distal side 118 and lateral sides 1 12, 1 14 are also contemplated. As shown in Fig. 3A, perforations 122 may not extend completely through outer and inner surfaces 102, 104 to maintain a complete protective barrier around the medical device while allowing separation of casing 100 along perforation 122, as discussed further below. Alternatively, as shown in Fig. 3B, at least some or all of perforations 122' may extend completely though outer and inner surfaces 102, 104 to facilitate separation of casing 100 along perforations 122', as discussed further below. In general, perforations are one possible feature of the casing that may be provided to facilitate destructively opening the casing for removal of a medical device provided therein, as discussed further below. </p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In one embodiment, the space 120 at second end 1 10 is generally tapered, for purposes set forth below. As further shown in Figs. 4 and 5, second end 110 includes opposite corners 124, 126 formed by the taper of opposite lateral sides 112, 114 adjacent to second end 1 10. Corners 124, 126 can be formed by, for example, crimping, adhering, fusing, melting, or securing a portion of the inner surface 104 of the proximal and distal sides 1 16, 1 18 together at least along taper lines 125, 127 to form a flattened profile. Corners 124, 126 may be formed in other embodiments by securing inner surfaces 104 of proximal and distal sides 1 16, 118 only along their respective taper lines 125, 127, or by securing the inner surfaces 104 of proximal and distal sides 1 16, 118 along most or all of the inner surface area of the respective corners defined respectively by lines 125, 127, end 110 and edges 1 12, 114. In either arrangement, corners 124, 126 provide a handling feature in which the user may grasp casing 100 and destructively separate it along perforations 122, 122'. Referring to Fig. 7, this separation allows removal of the medical device from casing 100 while also destroying casing 100 so that is no longer suitable for use as a barrier. It is contemplated that removal of the medical device is facilitated when the secondary opening 107 created generally at the perforation is sufficiently large to allow the medical device to pass through the secondary opening 107. As used herein, the casing is destroyed when at least one of the ends or the sides is of the casing is no longer able to provide an appropriate protective 
<!-- EPO <DP n="11"/>-->
 barrier when the medical device is positioned therein. The user therefore is required to select another casing 100 to use the medical device in a subsequent procedure. </p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The tapered portions of lateral sides 1 12, 114 extending from second end 110 also guide insertion of the medical device to the proper location in casing 100. For example, the medical device may include a port or other receiving feature that requires insertion of an element into the medical device. The medical device may alternatively or additionally require projection of an element therefrom through casing 100. Thus, in certain embodiments, casing 100 includes a passage 132 opening through outer and inner surfaces 102, 104 at second end 110 that can be aligned with the respective receiving or projecting portion of the medical device. A passage 132 can be formed, for example, by punch cutting, die cutting, laser cutting, or any other appropriate technique for removing a portion of the distal and proximal sides 116, 118 at second end 1 10 to define the passage in the desired location for alignment with a medical device intended for use with the casing. </p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The tapered portions of lateral sides 112, 114 can be configured so that the medical device and its respective receiving or projecting portion are aligned with passage 132 when the medical device is properly positioned in casing 100. Taper lines 125, 127 may thus be selectively located in order to accommodate a variety of differently sized medical devices. Casing 100 may include an additional cover or flap (not shown) that is removably secured to casing 100 to allow the user to selectively open passage 132. Passage 132 may also be closed by such a cover or flap when access to the medical device is not needed or when access has been completed. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044">First end 108 of casing 100 may also include a flap 128 that can be folded, pulled or flexed over opening 106 at first end 108 to secure the medical device in space 120, such that the medical device is held in place adjacent to second end 1 10, for example abutting against the tapered portions of the lateral sides 112, 1 14 for proper location of the medical device within the space 120. At least one of flap 128 and the outer surface 102 includes an adhesive 134 that secures flap 128 to outer surface 102. In one embodiment, an adhesive backing strip (not shown) may be provided in connection with the adhesive 134 to prevent adhesion until desired by a user who 
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->
 removes the backing strip just prior to pulling the flap 128 over the opening 106. In the illustrated embodiment, adhesive 134 is shown on flap 128, although placement of adhesive on outer surface 102 in addition to or instead of on flap 128 is also contemplated. The adhesive 134 can be of sufficient strength so that flap 128 cannot be opened without destroying casing 100 to prevent its re-use. Alternatively, adhesive 134 can allow removal and reattachment of flap 128 to outer surface 102 to allow the user to remove or re-position the medical device in casing 100. </p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Outer surface 102 may also include a plurality of demarcations 130a, 130b, 130c that provide locations for the user to secure flap 128 to outer surface 102 and form a casing 100 of desired length. For example, demarcations 130a, 130b, 130c can correspond to lengths of various makes and/or models of medical device, allowing the user to easily secure flap 128 in a location along outer surface 102 that forms a casing 100 of optimal length from first end 108 to second end 1 10 for the particular make and/or model of the medical device positioned in casing 100. </p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Fig. 6 A shows a medical device 10 positioned in casing 100. In the illustrated embodiment, medical device 10 is a blood glucose meter that receives a test element 12 containing a blood sample. Medical device 10 includes a housing 16 that is entirely received in casing 100. However, as discussed further below, housing 16 and casing 100 may be configured so that only a portion of housing 16 is positioned in casing 100. Medical device 10 includes a test element receiving port 14 that is aligned with passage 132 of casing 100, allowing insertion of test element 12 through casing 100 and into receiving port 14. Medical device 10 also includes a display 18 and input means 20 that are visible through casing 100. The flexibility of casing 100 also allows the user to manipulate input means 20 through casing 100 so that the user can operate medical device 10 while it is in casing 100. Furthermore, display 18 is visible through casing 100 so that the user can visualize the output produced by medical device 10 during use. </p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Furthermore, although flap 128 is shown secured to proximal side 116 in Fig. 6A, Fig. 6B shows a modified casing 100' that is substantially identical to casing 100 but includes a flap 128' extending from proximal side 1 16' so that flap 128' can be secured to distal side 1 18' of casing 100'. In addition, casing 100' includes demarcations 130a', 130b', 130c' across distal side 1 18' 
<!-- EPO <DP n="13"/>-->
 to indicate locations where flap 128' should be secured to casing 100' for various makes and/or models of medical device 10. In the modified form of Fig. 6B, casing 100' is arranged so that flap 128' and demarcations 130a'-130c' will not extend across display 18 and potentially obscure a portion of portions of display 18 from the user. </p><p id="p0048" num="0048">When use of the medical device 10 is complete, the user can grasp one or both of corners 124, 126 and separate casing 100 along perforations 122, 122' to create second opening 107 large enough to remove medical device 10 from casing 100, such as shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, opening 107 is created by completely detaching first casing portion 100a from second casing portion 100b. It is also contemplated that opening 107 can be created by only partially detaching casing portion 100a from casing portion 100b sufficiently to create opening 107 large enough to remove medical device 10. Alternatively or additionally, adhesive 134 may be configured to allow flap 128 to be opened to remove medical device 10 without destroying the casing 100. </p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In the illustrated embodiment, perforations 122, 122' are shown located closer to second end 110 than first end 108 to facilitate removal of medical device 10 from casing 100 when casing 100 is separated along perforations 122, 122'. By providing perforations 122, 122' closer to second end 110, the second end of medical device 10 can be pushed through the opening 107 that is created so that medical device 10 can be removed from casing 100. Other embodiments contemplate perforations 122, 122' can be provided at the middle of or closer to first end 108. In still other embodiments, perforations 122, 122' are provided at multiple locations across and/or along casing 100. </p><p id="p0050" num="0050">As shown in Fig. 8, another embodiment casing 100' is shown that is similar to casing 100, but casing 100' lacks perforations, although providing perforations is not precluded. Flap 128' is shown detached from outer surface 102' to create an opening 107' for removal of the medical device. Casing 100' is destructively opened since the adhesive on flap 128' remains attached to a portion 116a' of proximal side 116' of casing 100' after flap 128' is opened to create opening 107'. Casing 100' is thus torn or severed when flap 128' is opened, preventing re-use of casing 100'.
