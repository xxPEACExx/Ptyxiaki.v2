Furthermore, the working electrode has a transparent substrate, a transparent conductive film provided thereon, and an oxide semiconductor layer which is a power generating layer provided on the transparent conductive film.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In recent years, dye-sensitized solar cells have been used not only as solar cells for outdoor use, but also as power supplies for various electronic equipment for indoor use.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, generally, it is known that in an environment at<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> low illumination (10,000 Lux or less) such as indoors, the generated current and the generated voltage of dye-sensitized solar cells are lowered. This is because since the amount of incident light decreases, the short circuit current decreases, and the open circuit voltage decreases because of the leakage current occurring between the oxide semiconductor layer as a current generating layer and the transparent conductive layer on the transparent substrate, and the electrolyte. Since the photoelectric conversion efficiency is directly proportional to the short circuit current and the open circuit voltage, when the short circuit current or the open circuit voltage decreases, the photoelectric conversion efficiency also decreases. Therefore, there is a demand for a dye-sensitized solar cell which is capable of increasing the short circuit current or the open circuit voltage even in an environment of low illumination such as indoors.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For example, in Patent Document 1 described below, it has been suggested to increase the short circuit current by reducing the absorption of incident light by the electrolyte by lowering the concentration of I<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in the electrolyte, and thereby increasing the light transmissibility.</p><heading id="h0003">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT DOCUMENT</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2005251736A"><text>JP 2005-251736 A</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><heading id="h0006">PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, the dye-sensitized solar cell described in the Patent Document 1 cannot be said to have sufficient photoelectric conversion characteristics in an environment of low illumination.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention was achieved in view of such circumstances, and it is an object of the invention to provide a dye-sensitized solar cell for low illumination having excellent photoelectric conversion characteristics in an environment of low illumination at 10,000 Lux or less.</p><heading id="h0007">MEANS FOR SOLVING PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The inventors of the present invention conducted a thorough study in order to solve the problems described above, and as a result, the inventors contemplated that it would not be able to enhance the photoelectric conversion characteristics sufficiently in an environment of low illumination only by decreasing the concentration of I<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in the electrolyte. Further, the inventors of the present invention thought that in order to enhance the photoelectric conversion characteristics in an environment of low illumination, it is effective to increase the open circuit voltage, and in order to do so, it is necessary to decrease the leakage current. Also, the inventors of the present invention paid attention to the photosensitizing dyes that are adsorbed to the oxide semiconductor layer and conducted research. As a result, the inventors assumed that if a region in which nothing is adsorbed between the photosensitizing dyes that are<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> adsorbed to the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer is increased, transfer of electrons from the oxide semiconductor layer to the electrolyte or the like is likely to occur in that region, and as a result, the leakage current would increase. Here, the inventors of the present invention considered adsorbing a co-adsorbent together with a photosensitizing dye called N719 or N3 onto the oxide semiconductor layer. However, there was an occasion in which when the photoelectric conversion efficiency was measured at an irradiance of 1 sun, which indicates the intensity of sunlight, a fairly low value was obtained. From this, it was anticipated that even lower photoelectric conversion efficiency would be obtained in an environment of low illumination. However, the inventors adsorbed a co-adsorbent having a particular structure, together with a photosensitizing dye such as N719 or N3, to an oxide semiconductor layer, and surprisingly, it was found that in an environment of low illumination, a dye-sensitized solar cell exhibits a photoelectric conversion efficiency that is fairly higher than the photoelectric conversion efficiency measured outdoors. Thus, the inventors of the present invention conducted research more assiduously, and as a result, they found that the problems described above can be solved by a combination of a photosensitizing dye having a particular structure and a particular co-adsorbent that adsorbs to an oxide semiconductor layer together with the photosensitizing dye, thus completing the present invention.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">That is, the present invention is a dye-sensitized solar<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> cell for low illumination, which includes a first electrode having a transparent substrate and a transparent conductive film provided on the transparent substrate; a second electrode that faces the first electrode; an oxide semiconductor layer provided on the first electrode or the second electrode; an electrolyte that is provided between the first electrode and the second electrode; a photosensitizing dye that is adsorbed to the oxide semiconductor layer; and a co-adsorbent that is adsorbed to the oxide semiconductor layer together with the photosensitizing dye, the photosensitizing dye being a metal complex compound represented by the following formula (1), and the co-adsorbent including at least one organic compound selected from the group consisting of an organic compound represented by the following formula (2), an organic compound represented by the following formula (3), and an organic compound represented by the following formula (4):

wherein in formula (4), Y<sup>5</sup>, Y<sup>5</sup>, and Y<sup>7</sup> each independently represent a hydroxyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon group having 3 to 20 carbon atoms; and one or two of Y<sup>5</sup>, Y<sup>6</sup>, and Y<sup>7</sup> each represent a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon group having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, while the others represent hydroxyl groups.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to the dye-sensitized solar cell of the present invention, a photosensitizing dye represented by the formula (1) is used as the photosensitizing dye. This photosensitizing dye has high absorption efficiency at short wavelengths. On the other hand, the light of indoor lightings such as fluorescent lamps includes a large amount of light of short wavelengths, and does not much<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> include light of long wavelengths. Therefore, the photosensitizing dye represented by formula (1) is especially suitable as a photosensitizing dye for dye-sensitized solar cells for indoor use, and can realize superior photoelectric conversion characteristics as compared with black dye or Z907 having long side chains. Furthermore, the co-adsorbent includes at least one organic compound selected from the group consisting of an organic compound represented by the formula (2) described above, an organic compound represented by the formula (3) described below, and an organic compound represented by the formula (4) described below. Here, the organic compound represented by formula (2) has a monovalent group having a π-conjugated structure, or a monovalent group having a steroid skeleton. Here, the monovalent group having a π-conjugated structure and the monovalent group having a steroid skeleton both have a planar shape, and it is difficult for the groups to undergo deformation freely. Furthermore, in the organic compound represented by formula (3), one of Y<sup>1</sup>, Y<sup>2</sup>, Y<sup>3</sup> and Y<sup>4</sup> represents a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon group having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, while at least two of the remaining groups each represent a carboxyl group or an alkoxy group. In this case, since at least two carboxyl groups or alkoxy groups adsorb to the oxide semiconductor layer, it is difficult for the organic compound represented by formula (3) to undergo deformation freely. Furthermore, the organic compound represented by formula (4) has a PO group. Here, P has an electronegativity that is lower than that of C (carbon atom) that is contained in the carboxyl group or<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> alkoxy group. For this reason, it is difficult for a PO group to be ionized, and is not easily detached from the oxide semiconductor layer. Therefore, a PO group is securely adsorbed to the oxide semiconductor layer. Accordingly, similarly to the organic compound represented by formula (3), even if the organic compound does not have at least two carboxyl groups or the like, it is difficult for the organic compound to undergo deformation easily. As such, the co-adsorbent includes an organic compound that is not easily deformed freely when adsorbed to the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer. Accordingly, it is not necessary to provide a wasteful space for the co-adsorbent at the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer. Therefore, the photosensitizing dye can be sufficiently adsorbed to the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer. Furthermore, at the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer, the co-adsorbent can be adsorbed in the regions where the photosensitizing dye is not adsorbed. In the regions where the photosensitizing dye is not adsorbed at the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer, transfer of electrons between the oxide semiconductor layer and the electrolyte (reverse electron transfer) may occur, but, in the present invention, the reverse electron transfer can be sufficiently suppressed as the co-adsorbent adsorbs in those regions.

This photosensitizing dye has high absorption efficiency at short wavelengths. On the other hand, indoor light such as fluorescent lamp light include a large amount of light of short wavelengths, and does not much include light of long wavelengths. Therefore, the photosensitizing dye represented by formula (1) is especially suitable as a photosensitizing dye for dye-sensitized solar cells for indoor use, and can realize superior photoelectric conversion characteristics as compared with black dye or Z907 having long side chains. Furthermore, the co-adsorbent includes at least one kind selected from the group consisting of an organic compound represented by the formula (2) described above, an organic compound represented by the formula (3) described below, and an organic compound represented by the formula (4) described below. Here, the organic compound represented by formula (2) has a monovalent group having a π-conjugated structure, or a monovalent group having a steroid skeleton. Here, the monovalent group having a π-conjugated structure and the monovalent group having a steroid skeleton both have a planar shape, and it is difficult for the groups to undergo deformation freely. Furthermore, in the organic compound represented by formula (3), one of Y<sup>1</sup>, Y<sup>2</sup>, Y<sup>3</sup> and Y<sup>4</sup> represents a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon group having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, while at least two of the remaining groups<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> each represent a carboxyl group or an alkoxy group. In this case, since at least two carboxyl groups or alkoxy groups adsorb to the oxide semiconductor layer 13, it is difficult for the organic compound represented by formula (3) to undergo deformation freely. Furthermore, the organic compound represented by formula (4) has a PO group. Here, P has an electronegativity that is lower than that of C (carbon atom) that is contained in the carboxyl group or alkoxy group. For this reason, it is difficult for a PO group to be ionized, and is not easily detached from the oxide semiconductor layer 13. Therefore, a PO group is securely adsorbed to the oxide semiconductor layer 13. Accordingly, similarly to the organic compound represented by formula (3), even if the organic compound does not have at least two carboxyl groups or the like, it is difficult for the organic compound to undergo deformation easily. As such, the co-adsorbent includes an organic compound that is not easily deformed freely when adsorbed to the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer 13. Accordingly, it is not necessary to provide a space for the co-adsorbent wastefully at the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer 13. Therefore, the photosensitizing dye can be sufficiently adsorbed to the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer 13. Furthermore, at the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer 13, the co-adsorbent can be adsorbed in the regions where the photosensitizing dye is not adsorbed. In the regions where the photosensitizing dye is not adsorbed at the surface of the oxide semiconductor layer 13, transfer of electrons between the oxide semiconductor layer 13 and the electrolyte 40<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> (reverse electron transfer) may occur, and thus, in the dye-sensitized solar cell 100, the reverse electron transfer can be sufficiently suppressed as the co-adsorbent adsorbs in those regions. As a result, leakage current can be reduced, and therefore, the open circuit voltage can be increased in an environment of low illumination.

The transparent conductive film 12 may be constituted of a single layer, or may be constituted of a laminate of plural layers formed from different electroconductive metal oxides.

The second sealing section was obtained by preparing one sheet of a resin film for sealing formed of a maleic anhydride-modified polyethylene (trade name: BYNEL, manufactured by DuPont Company) and having a size of 13 cm × 6 cm × 50 µm, and forming four rectangular-shaped openings in the resin film for sealing. At this time, the second sealing section was produced such that each of the openings would have a size of 2.8 cm × 4.8 cm × 50 µm, the width of the outer peripheral section would be 1.5 mm, and the width of the partition section that partitioned the openings on the inner side of the outer peripheral section would be 1 mm. The second sealing section was bonded to the counter electrode such that the second sealing section, together with the first sealing section, sandwiched the edges of the counter electrode. At this time, the second sealing section was bonded to the counter electrode and the first sealing section by heating and melting the first sealing section and the second sealing section while pressing the second sealing section<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --> against the counter electrode.</p><p id="p0145" num="0145">Finally, a low temperature-curable type silver paste (manufactured by Fujikura Kasei Co., Ltd., D-500) was prepared and applied over a region extending from the counter electrode to the extension sections of the corresponding transparent conductive film of an adjoining DSC, and the silver paste was cured for 12 hours at 30°C. In this manner, an electroconductive material that was formed of silver and connected the counter electrode with the extension sections of the corresponding transparent conductive film of an adjoining DSC, was formed. The dimension of the electroconductive material was 7 mm × 10 mm × 10 µm. In this manner, a DSC module was obtained.</p><heading id="h0019">(Examples 2 to 22 and Comparative Examples 1 to 6)</heading><p id="p0146" num="0146">DSC modules were produced in the same manner as in Example 1, except that the concentrations (unit: µM) of the photosensitizing dye, co-adsorbent 1, co-adsorbent 2 and I<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were changed as indicated in Table 1 and Table 2.</p><heading id="h0020">(Examples 23 and 24)</heading><p id="p0147" num="0147">DSC modules were produced in the same manner as in Example 1, except that the concentrations (unit: µM) of the photosensitizing dye, co-adsorbent 1, co-adsorbent 2 and I<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were changed as indicated in Table 2. At this time, the molar ratio of the co-adsorbent 2 with respect to the co-adsorbent 1 was adjusted to 3.</p><p id="p0148" num="0148">As shown in Table 1 and Table 2, the open circuit voltage Voc at 100 Lux and the photoelectric conversion efficiency η were measured for the DSC modules obtained in Examples 1 to 24 and<!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --> Comparative Examples 1 to 6.

On the contrary, in the DSC modules obtained in Comparative Examples 1 to 6, there were occasions in which the photoelectric conversion efficiency values at illumination intensities of 10,000 Lux or less were almost the same as the photoelectric conversion efficiency values at illumination intensities that did not fall in the range of illumination intensity described above.</p><p id="p0151" num="0151">From the above results, it was confirmed that the DSC for low illumination of the present invention has excellent photoelectric conversion characteristics in an environment at low<!-- EPO <DP n="51"> --> illumination.<!-- EPO <DP n="52"> -->
