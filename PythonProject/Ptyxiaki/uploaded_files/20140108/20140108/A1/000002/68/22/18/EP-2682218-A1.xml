In practice, this requires, for example, in the manufacture of heat exchangers, that specialised staff perform the same manual operations for many hours in order to form leak-proof connections. Subsequently, in the case of the manufacture of heat exchangers, any excess material of the tubes which projects from the plate as a result of the expansion operation, has to be ground off or cut off, de-burred and removed, which are even more time and attention consuming operations.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method, wherein the number of operations to be performed by specialised staff for securing, in particular, large numbers of tubes to plates in a leak-proof manner are continuously reduced, without, in the case of the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> manufacture of heat exchangers, welding operations and grinding off of excess tube material being required.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">To achieve this, the method according to the invention has the characteristics of claim 1.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">An advantage of the method according to the invention resides in that by applying electromagnetic pulses in the way described hereinabove for securing a tube end portion in a through opening in a plate, such as a pipe plate or tube plate, it is no longer necessary to subsequently perform operations in order to finish the connection formed. De-burring or grinding can be dispensed with because the plate or tube is free of projecting excess material or parts of the tube. The connecting method itself can be carried out in less time and by less-skilled personnel, without the quality, predictability, uniformity and eventually the required long-lasting leak-proofness of the connection between the various tube end portions and the plate being adversely affected. In this manner, a mechanically stable, leak-proof fusion weld is formed between tube and tube plate. In addition, the method according to the invention does not require a mould because the plate acts as a mould.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Moreover, it has been found that previous thorough cleaning and degreasing of the periphery of the tube end portions and of the inner periphery of the various through openings in the plate is no longer necessary. The EMP energy exerted in the tube end portion by the EMP probe generates such an expansive force therein that the locally briefly generated high temperature causes any contamination to simply fuse with the connection between the material of the tube periphery and the internal opening.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">An embodiment of the method according to the invention is <b>characterized in that</b> after a plurality of respective end portions of the tubes have been inserted into respective openings, one or more EMP probes are inserted through said openings into the end portions of the tubes situated in the plate, and electromagnetic pulses are applied to the EMP probes.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">This has the advantage that, if necessary, large numbers of connections between tube end portions and through openings in the plate can be provided. This results in a gain of time which can be increased even further by energizing a plurality of EMP probes simultaneously or at brief intervals from one or more EMP supply sources.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Further, detailed, possible embodiments set forth in the remaining claims are mentioned together with the associated advantages in the following description.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Next, in particular the method according to the invention and the heat exchanger according to the invention obtained by means of said method will be explained in greater detail with reference to the accompanying figures, in which corresponding parts are indicated by means of the same reference numerals. In the figures:
<ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows a plate with an opening in which a tube will be secured by means of the method according to the invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> shows the tube secured in the opening of the plate of <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> by means of the method according to the invention; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> shows an example of a tube plate of a heat exchanger according to the invention.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows part of a plate 1 provided with through openings 2 in which end portions 3 of tubes have to be secured. The end portions 3 of the plate 4 are inserted, as is shown, from one side 5 of the plate into the opening 2. The figure shows that the end portion 3 projects from the opposite side 6 of the plate 4. When a plurality of end portions of a plurality of tubes are passed through a plurality of openings, personnel advantageously can see instantly that all end portions project from the opposite side 6.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">At least the tubes 4 are made of a material in which eddy currents can be induced. An EMP coil or probe 7 is inserted, in this case, from the side 6 into the end portion 3 of the tube 4 situated in the plate 1. Subsequently, an electromagnetic pulse, simply referred to as EMP, is supplied from a diagrammatically shown EMP source 8 to the EMP probe 7. As a result, the end portion 3 of the tube situated in the plate and made of the material in which eddy currents are then induced is caused to expand and plastically deform by said EMP.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">By virtue thereof, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 2</figref>, the end portion 3 is permanently secured in the opening 2. In the case where said end portion 3 partly projects on the side 6, which is also shown, the part 9 consisting of excess material of the end portion 3 of the tube is advantageously simultaneously cut off by the EMP and can be removed. This cutting off does not involve an additional operation.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In practice, at least the tubes, pipes or conduits 4 are made of coatings or materials, for example metal, such as steel, aluminium or metal alloys, which can be fused by means of electromagnetic energy. Particularly in the case of heat exchangers, said metal of the tubes and/or of the tube plates or pipe plates 1 customarily used in said heat exchangers will contain copper or may even be made entirely<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> of copper, because this additionally is a thermo-conductive metal which is very suitable and generally accepted for this purpose.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The method described hereinabove can be successively applied to further tubes and further openings of, if necessary, the same plate 1. The method also advantageously enables rows or even entire matrices of rows and columns of a plurality of tube end portions to be secured in a corresponding number of openings of, in particular, tube plates as frequently used in heat exchangers. By applying one or, if necessary, more than one EMP probes 7 and energizing them successively or simultaneously from one or more high-power pulse generators 8, which form the EMP supply sources, the method can be applied much more rapidly and the eventual connection becomes more uniform as compared to the prior art.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In practice, the probe 7 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> can be passed through the end portion 3 from the left-hand side 6 of the plate but of course also from the right-hand side 5 of the plate.</p></description><claims
