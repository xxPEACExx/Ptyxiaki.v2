Many specific details of certain embodiments of the invention are set forth in the following description and in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0015">Figures 1-15</figref> to provide a thorough understanding of such embodiments. One skilled in the art, however, will understand that the present invention may have additional embodiments, or that the present invention may be practiced without several of the details described in the following description.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref> are schematic, views of a control system 400 in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the control system 400 includes a motion capture processing computer 402 operatively coupled to a motion capture system 420 and also to an application computer (or analysis and display component) 450 via a datalink 452 (<i>e.g</i>. an Ethernet connection.). Running on the application computer 450 is closed-loop feedback control software 413 that has been tuned fox the purpose of providing vehicle stabilization and recovery from external disturbances. Some embodiments of the motion capture system 420 may contain a camera signal collection and processing unit 404, which collects real-time image information from all instances of the motion capture cameras 424, processes the data, and sends the information along a dedicated connection to the motion capture processing computer 402. The motion capture processing computer 402 and the application computer 450 can be combined in an alternate embodiment of this invention. A controllable device, such as a remotely-controlled vehicle 410, is positioned within a control (or capture) volume 422 monitored by the motion capture system 420. The controllable device 410 may be a vehicle, such as a manned or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a ground vehicle, a water-based vehicle, or any other suitable type of vehicle, a manufacturing robot, or any other type of continuously controllable device. Furthermore, the controllable device 410 may be powered by any suitable energy source, including battery, solar, gas, and fuel-cell powered devices.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The motion capture system 420 includes a plurality of motion capture devices 424 (<i>e.g</i>. cameras) operatively distributed about the control volume 422 and configured to monitor the positions and movements of a plurality of retro-reflective markers 426 disposed on the vehicle 410. The retro-reflective markers 426, which reflect light back to the source (in this<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> case, the motion capture camera units 424 which can carry their own light source), can be comprised of various shapes, including tape, spheres, semi or half spheres, or any other suitable shapes. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the motion capture devices 424 operate in the visible portion of the spectrum, however, in alternate embodiments, devices that operate in other portions of the spectrum (<i>e.g</i>. near infrared, infrared, etc.) may be used. The motion capture devices 424 are configured to monitor the retro-reflective markers 426 and to export the positions of the retro-reflective markers 426 to the signal processing unit 404 and to the motion capture processing computer 402 in real-time. Alternately, using a priori knowledge of the positions of the retro-reflective markers 426 on the vehicle 410, the motion capture devices 424 or the motion capture processing computer 402 may internally process the measured marker position data to derive position and orientation data of the vehicle 410, and may output the position and orientation data of the vehicle 410 to the application computer 450.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In one particular embodiment, a total of six motion capture devices 424 are distributed about an approximately room-sized control volume 422 (e.g. 25' x 25' x 8') and are configured to provide sub-millimeter position accuracy of the positions of the retro-reflective markers 426 at refresh rates of up to 500 Hz. In another embodiment, the motion capture devices 424 include correlated motion measurement systems having sub-centimeter positional accuracies, update frequencies of at least 20 Hz, and latency periods of 1/20th second or less.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Thus, the motion capture system 420 may provide six degree-of-freedom motion tracking of the vehicle 410 in approximately real-time to enable closed-loop feedback control of the position, movement, and stabilization characteristics of the vehicle 410. In alternate embodiments, any suitable number of motion capture devices 424 (<i>e.g</i>. two or more) may be used, and the control volume 422 may be scaled up or down to any desired size. Similarly, in alternate embodiments, the motion capture devices 424 may be configured to provide any suitable or desired resolution and operational frequency. In one particular embodiment, an update rate of 50 Hz and accuracy of 1 mm was found to provide an electrical RC helicopter system (<figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>) with a mass of 240g, stable control and sufficiently fast recovery from external disturbances. The same vehicle was also shown to have stable performance at 20 Hz update rates, but with slower recovery from disturbances. Suitable motion capture devices 424 that may be used in the motion capture system 420 include those devices commercially available from Vicon Limited of Oxford, UK, as well as motion capture systems commercially available from Motion Analysis Corp. of Santa Rosa, California.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As further shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the application computer 450 operatively communicates with the controllable device 410 via a communication link 405, which may be a wireless link, wire-based link, fiber-optic link, or any other suitable type of communication link. The communication link 405 carries signals and data between the application computer 450 and the controllable device 410. In an alternate embodiment, the application computer 450 is configured to receive video, sensor signals, and other telemetry from the controllable device 410, and to transmit appropriate command signals 405 to the controllable device 410. A command and control software program 413 may be implemented on the application computer 450 to perform a variety of functions associated with monitoring and controlling the controllable device 410 and the various components of the control system 400. Alternately, the application computer 450 may include one or more programmable hardware components configured to perform one or more of these functions. The control software program 413 and the application computer 450 (or alternatively, on-board processor 414) could be combined by programming the control application algorithm into firmware.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In operation, the application computer 450 causes appropriate command signals 405 to be transmitted to one or more controllable devices 410, directing the one or more controllable devices 410 to perform desired activities or functions. For example, if the controllable device 410 is a flight vehicle, the command signals 405 may direct the flight vehicle to fly in a desired flight path and to collect desired information using on-board sensors. Similarly, a ground or water-based vehicle may be directed to traverse a desired path, collect information, or perform other desired activities. For those embodiments having a plurality of controllable devices 410, the controllable devices 410 may be commanded to move independently of one another, or alternately, two or more of the controllable devices 410 may be commanded to move in a coordinated manner, such as in flocking or swarming movements, as described more fully, for example, in <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Beyond Swarm Intelligence: The Ultraswarm, presented at the IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium by Holland et al., June 8, 2005</text></nplcit>.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Using the real-time data export capability of the motion capture devices 424, position and orientation information is sent to the command and control software program 413 or other suitable control application or component.

Position, orientation, linear and angular velocity data is then converted into vehicle coordinates (by using 4x4<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> homogeneous transformation matrix multiplication) and used to calculate error signals, which are then multiplied by feedback gain values, and then used to generate the actuator control values for the vehicle servo actuators.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Next, the actuator control values determined by the control application (<i>e.g</i>. the command and control software 413 on the application computer 450) are converted into a format needed by a communication link 405 between the control application and the vehicle 410.

The various controllable devices and other objects in the environment are identified by the motion capture system 420 based on the unique pattern of retro-reflective marker placements on each object. The control software 413 running on the application computer 450 compares the position and orientation feedback information with the desired positions of the controllable device 410, determines the desired actuator inputs for controlling the movement of the vehicle 410 and causes appropriate command signals 408 to be transmitted to the controllable device 410 via the communication link 405 to controllably adjust (or maintain) the positions and velocities of the controllable device 410 in its desired positions or along its desired headings at the desired rates of movement.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Thus, the motion capture system 420 provides the control system 400 with the position and orientation information needed for a closed-loop feedback control capability for adjusting the positions and movements of the controllable device 410. More specifically, the motion capture system 420 may advantageously provide position and orientation feedback information that enables the application computer 450 to determine and control not only<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> Cartesian positions (x, y, z), but also orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) control commands for proper control and stabilization of the controllable device 410.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> is a flowchart of a control method 300 for controlling one or more vehicles 410 using the control system 400 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>. In this embodiment, the method includes providing a high-level command request at a block 302, which may come from a human operator, an autonomous agent, or another higher-level source. The high-level command request is converted to a properly formatted vehicle command (<i>e.g</i>. state vector x<sub>set</sub> of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>) at a block 304. A closed-loop feedback control loop begins at a block 306, at which the vehicle-formatted command request is received. Next, at a block 308, one or more positions and orientations of the one or more vehicles 410 are acquired. Initially, the one or more positions and orientations may be known, such as from inputs or initial conditions during start up of the method 300, or may be determined by the position reference system 420 (<i>e.g</i>. at a block 320) and input to block 308. The control loop in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> is the implementation of the basic feedback control method described in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, and is responsible for maintaining the desired trajectory and recovering from unexpected disturbances.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">At a block 310, the method 300 determines the velocities by differentiating and filtering the positions and orientations.

Appropriate actuator control signals are determined at a block 312 based on the comparisons at block 310 using one of many possible feedback control techniques. In one embodiment, a proportional, derivative, integral (PID) control method is used. This method applies a set of feedback control gains (<i>K</i> in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>) to the state vector errors (X<sub>err</sub> of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>) to determine the control signals sent to the controlled device (or <i>Plant</i>) 410.

In addition, data multiple types of position, velocity, or acceleration measurement systems could be combined with the motion capture data to give a more accurate estimate of the state (<i>e.g</i>., Kalman filter). At a block 314, the determined actuator control signals are converted to RC (remote control) signals, and the RC signals are transmitted to the vehicle 410 at a block 316.
