Particularly in recent years, many lighting devices have incorporated a clear lens in view of the established technology for achieving light distribution with a shaped reflector rather than a cut lens. Since such a clear lens, which is included in the lighting device, tends to make the light source easily seen, there are demands for a structure that conceals the light source.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2009051404A"><text>2009-051404</text></patcit> discloses a position lamp including a position bulb disposed in a base member and a lens disposed in front of the position bulb. The lens has an upper portion (overlapped portion) covered with a main pipe side cover (cover member). When the position lamp is viewed from the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> front, the cover member conceals the position bulb for improving the appearance of the position lamp. Light that is emitted from the position bulb is partially blocked by the cover member, which covers the overlapped portion of the lens. However, light is radiated outwardly through the visible portion of the lens, which is exposed below the cover member.</p><heading id="h0003">Summary of Invention</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">In contrast to position lamps, certain lighting devices, such as headlights, have a large light-emitting area. Lighting devices such as headlights are viewed externally not only from a frontal direction, but may be viewed from various angles. For example, such lighting devices may be viewed by pedestrians who bend over and look up obliquely from a lower position. In particular, since two-wheeled motor vehicles have the headlights thereof mounted higher than in four-wheeled motor vehicles, the cover member, which conceals the light source incorporated in the two-wheeled motor vehicle, may possibly allow an observer to see light emitted from the light source and which travels around the reflector, i.e., direct light, when the observer views the lighting device obliquely from a lower position.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">If a light-emitting diode is used as a light source for a lighting device, then when the angle of orientation of the light-emitting diode and an angle of visual observation of an observer coincide with each other, the observer sees highly bright light as direct light from the light-emitting diode, which may possibly make the observer<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> feel uncomfortable.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">One solution would be to extend the cover member to a lower position on the lens in order to prevent the observer from seeing direct light from the light source. However, inasmuch as the cover member, if extended in this manner, would reduce the light-emitting area of the lighting device, it would be difficult for headlights in particular to achieve a desired light distribution in compliance with regulations. Another member may be attached to the cover member in order to block direct light. However, such an additional member leads to an increase in the number of parts, and makes the lighting device complex and poor in appearance.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention has been made in view of the aforementioned problems. It is an object of the present invention to provide a lighting device for vehicles, as well as a mounting structure for the lighting device, which are simple in structure and are capable of preventing an observer from viewing a light-emitting diode directly, and from observing direct light that is emitted from the light-emitting diode over a wide range.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to an invention recited in claim 1, there is provided a lighting device for a vehicle, comprising a base surrounded along an outer periphery thereof by a cover member of a vehicle body, a lens mounted on a front portion of the base and which is exposed through an opening defined in the cover member, and a light-emitting diode and a reflector which are housed in a space defined by the base and the lens, wherein the light-emitting diode is disposed in a predetermined position on a support assembly, which is<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> supported on the base and extends into the space, and the support assembly includes a wall positioned forwardly of and in proximity to the predetermined position in which the light-emitting diode is disposed, the wall being disposed higher than the light-emitting diode, for limiting light that is emitted directly from the light-emitting diode.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to an invention recited in claim 2, in the lighting device according to claim 1, the support assembly includes a cavity that houses the light-emitting diode therein, and the wall comprises a portion of an inner wall, which surrounds a peripheral side portion of the light-emitting diode in the cavity.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to an invention recited in claim 3, in the lighting device according to claim 1, the base supports the light-emitting diode together with the support assembly in a downward facing manner, the reflector being disposed in a position confronting the light-emitting diode, and the wall being disposed at a height, such that a hypothetical straight line, which interconnects a center of the light-emitting diode and a tip end of the wall, passes through a front lower portion of the lens.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to an invention recited in claim 4, in the lighting device according to claim 3, the reflector is curved from an upper end toward a lower end thereof, the lower end crossing the hypothetical straight line.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to an invention recited in claim 5, in the lighting device according to claim 1, the support assembly comprises a board on which the light-emitting diode is mounted and a board support that supports the board, and the board support is made of a thermally conductive<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> material, and is mounted on the base such that the board support supports the board on one surface thereof, and has another surface, which is opposite to the one surface, exposed through a mounting opening defined in the base.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to an invention recited in claim 6, in a mounting structure for the lighting device according to claim 1, the cover member covers a portion of the lens, so as to conceal the light-emitting diode and the support assembly when the lighting device is viewed from the front.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to an invention recited in claim 7, in the mounting structure for the lighting device according to claim 6, the base is disposed within the cover member, such that a surface of the support assembly on which the light-emitting diode is disposed faces obliquely rearward.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to an invention recited in claim 8, in the mounting structure for the lighting device according to claim 6, the opening is shaped so as to be inclined obliquely upward in an outer transverse direction of the vehicle body, and the base supports the reflector and the support assembly, so as to be inclined obliquely upward in the outer transverse direction of the vehicle body, and at an angle of inclination of an upper end of the opening.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to an invention recited in claim 9, in a mounting structure for the lighting device according to claim 5, heat-radiating fins, which are exposed out of the space, are disposed on the other surface of the board support, and the cover member includes a duct defined therein for guiding ram air that flows toward the heat radiating fins.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to the invention recited in claim 1, since<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the support assembly has a wall positioned forwardly of and in proximity to the light-emitting diode, and is positioned higher than the light-emitting diode, the wall limits direct light from the light-emitting diode at a position closer to the light-emitting diode than the cover member. Thus, regardless of the shape of the cover member, the wall makes it possible to greatly increase a visual perception prevention range, in which direct light is prevented from being visually perceived (i.e., seen), while the wall also provides a sufficient light-emission area. Since the support assembly, which supports the light-emitting diode, includes the wall, it is easy to add the wall to the support assembly without requiring an increase in the number of parts.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the invention recited in claim 2, the light-emitting diode is housed in the cavity, which is defined in the support assembly. Thus, the light-emitting diode as well as direct light from the light-emitting diode is prevented from being seen over a wide range along lateral as well as frontal and oblique vertical directions.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to the invention recited in claim 3, the hypothetical straight line, which interconnects the center of the light-emitting diode and the tip end of the wall, has a height that passes through a front lower portion of the lens. Consequently, above the hypothetical straight line, it is possible to radiate light reflected by the reflector and to block direct light emitted from the light-emitting diode. Consequently, the headlight is able to maintain a desired amount of radiated light, while at the same time reliably preventing direct light from being<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> visually perceived.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to the invention recited in claim 4, the lower end of the reflector crosses the hypothetical straight line. If the lighting device is seen from an angle that resides at least within a vertical angular range, the wall and the reflector are capable of blocking direct light emitted from the light-emitting diode, thereby making it possible to reliably prevent direct light from being seen.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to the invention recited in claim 5, since the other surface of the board support, which is made of a thermally conductive material, is exposed through the mounting opening defined in the base, heat generated when the light-emitting diode emits light is radiated through the mounting opening. Consequently, thermally induced variations in operational characteristics of the light-emitting diode are reduced.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to the invention recited in claim 6, the cover member covers a portion of the lens in order to conceal the light-emitting diode and the support assembly. Thus, the appearance of the lighting device as viewed from the front is improved.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to the invention recited in claim 7, a surface of the support assembly on which the light-emitting diode is disposed faces obliquely rearward so as to increase the visual perception prevention range, and thereby more easily prevent direct light from the light-emitting diode from being seen.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to the invention recited in claim 8, the reflector and the support assembly are supported so as to be inclined obliquely upward in an outer transverse<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> direction of the vehicle body, and at an angle of inclination of an upper end of the opening. Accordingly, the reflector can be positioned efficiently with respect to the shape of the opening, while at the same time the light-emitting diode and the support assembly are concealed above the opening by the cover member. Therefore, the reflector can be reduced in size.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to the invention recited in claim 9, ram air is guided in order to flow from the duct toward the heat radiating fins.

The headlight 10 according to the first embodiment includes a base 82 and a lens 84. The headlight 10 with the base 82 and the lens 84 assembled together is disposed in the cover member 68. The headlight 10 includes a light-emitting diode (hereinafter referred to as an "LED") 86 as a light source.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The base 82 is made of a synthetic resin, which is capable withstanding a rise in temperature caused by light emitted from the LED 86. The synthetic resin preferably is a BMC (Bulk Molding Compound) or the like, for example.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The base 82 is in the form of a box having a concave cross-sectional shape with an open front end. The base 82 has a rear side wall 82a that faces toward the open front end. A support assembly 88 (second board support member 106) is fastened by screws to an inner surface of the rear side wall 82a. The base 82 further includes a side wall 82b surrounding the rear side wall 82a, and a drive unit (drive circuit) 90, which controls energization of the headlight 10, is mounted on an outer surface of the side wall 82b. The open front end of the base 82 has a flange 92, which<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> projects outwardly from the box of the base 82. The flange 92 has a mounting groove 94 defined in a front face thereof, and which receives and accommodates therein an open rear end of the lens 84.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The lens 84 is made of a highly transparent synthetic resin and has a concave cross-sectional shape oriented opposite to the base 82. The lens 84 is assembled on the base 82 by hot melt, welding, or the like, with the open rear end fitted in the mounting groove 94. When the lens 84 and the base 82 are assembled together, the headlight 10 has an outer profile, which serves as a casing, with the lens 84 projecting a certain distance in front of the base 82. The lens 84 has a space 98 defined therein in which the support assembly 88, the LED 86, and a reflector 96 are accommodated.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The headlight 10 is constructed such that the lens 84 has an outer surface, which is greater than the opening 69 in the cover member 68. When the headlight 10 is disposed in the cover member 68 and hence is covered by the cover member 68, an upper portion of the lens 84 is covered by the cover member 68, which extends above the opening 69.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Light radiating components, i.e., the LED 86, the reflector 96, etc., which are housed in the headlight 10, are attached to the base 82 by the support assembly 88. The LED 86 comprises an LED capable of emitting an amount of light at a color temperature suitable for use as the light source of the headlight 10. In <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, for purposes of illustration, only one LED 86 is shown as the light source of the headlight 10. Typically, however, the headlight 10 includes an array of LEDs 86 for emitting a<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> desired amount of light at a desired color temperature.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The support assembly 88 includes a board 100 on which the LEDs 86 are mounted, a board support 102 made up of a first board support member 104 and a second board support member 106, which are mounted on the base 82 for supporting the board 100.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Insofar as the LEDs 86 are mounted on the board 100, the board 100 also supports thereon an electric circuit, which connects the LEDs 86 electrically to each other. The board 100 preferably is made of a highly thermally conductive material for transferring heat that is generated when the LEDs 86 emit light from the board 100 to the board support 102. The electric circuit on the board 100 includes input and output terminals, which are connected electrically to the drive unit 90 by a cable 108. When the driver turns on the headlight 10, the drive unit 90 supplies electric power to the LEDs 86 so as to enable the LEDs 86 to emit a desired amount of light.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In the same manner as the board 100, the board support 102 is made of a highly thermally conductive material. In addition to being highly thermally conductive, since the board support 102 is perceived visually from the exterior, the board support 102 may be made of a material such as aluminum, for example, having a color that is close to the color of the surface of the reflector 96.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The first board support member 104 is coupled to the second board support member 106, and extends in a substantially horizontal direction on an upper portion of the space 98 inside the headlight 10. The first board support member 104 has a cavity 110 defined in a lower<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> surface thereof. The board 100 with the LEDs 86 mounted thereon is installed on a bottom portion 110a of the cavity 110. The LEDs 86 are disposed in the cavity 110 and face downwardly.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The cavity 110 has a depth from the flat surface of the first board support member 104, such that the LEDs 86 on the board 100 mounted in the cavity 110 are accommodated in the cavity 110 as viewed in side elevation. More specifically, the height H of a side 110b of the cavity 110, which surrounds the LEDs 86, is greater than the height of the LEDs 86 that project from the board 100. From among all of the sides of the cavity 110, the side 110b, which is positioned in front of the LEDs 86, functions as a wall 112 for limiting direct light emitted from the LEDs 86. Operations and advantages of the wall 112 will be described later.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The second board support member 106 is fastened by screws to the rear side wall 82a of the base 82. The first board support member 104 is coupled to a front surface (one surface) of the second board support member 106. The second board support member 106 includes heat radiating fins 114 on a surface thereof (other surface), which is opposite to the surface to which the first board support member 104 is coupled. When the second board support member 106 is installed on the base 82, the heat radiating fins 114 are inserted into a mounting opening 116, which is defined in the rear side wall 82a of the base 82, such that the heat radiating fins 114 project beyond an outer surface of the base 82. Thus, the second board support member 106 can be positioned easily on the base 82, so that the headlight 10<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> can be assembled in an efficient manner.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The reflector 96 has an upper end fastened by screws to a proximal end of the first board support member 104, and a lower end that extends into the space 98. The reflector 96 has a curved surface near a lower end thereof, which is disposed in a position facing toward the LEDs 86. The LEDs 86 are supported, in a downwardly facing orientation, on the first board support member 104. The reflector 96 is shaped as a curved surface, e.g., a quadric surface, which extends from the upper end toward the lower end of the reflector 96, for reflecting forwardly light emitted from the LEDs 86, which are disposed in the upper portion of the space 98. The surface of the reflector 96 may be coated with a thin film of aluminum by way of evaporation.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The headlight 10 is assembled into a unit by installing the LEDs 86, the support assembly 88 (the board 100 and the board support 102), and the reflector 96 on the base 82, and then attaching the lens 84 onto the front surface of the assembly. A mounting structure for the headlight 10, which is assembled as a unit together with the cover member 68, will be described below.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The headlight 10 is fixedly disposed in a certain position within the cover member 68, with the base 82 being mounted on the vehicle frame assembly 18 or the cover member 68. Since the light radiating components, i.e., the LEDs 86, the reflector 96, etc., are mounted on the base 82 by the support assembly 88, the optical axis of the headlight 10 can be set stably in position by securing the base 82 at a given angle.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0057" num="0057">With the headlight 10 disposed in the cover member 68, the lens 84 of the headlight 10 has a portion that is concealed by the cover member 68, and a remaining portion that is exposed outwardly. More specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIGS. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">3</figref>, the lens 84 has a lower end, which engages with an edge of the cover member 68 defining the lower end of the opening 69. The portion (appearance portion 84a) of the lens 84, which extends from the lower end up to a region of the lens 84 that is aligned with an edge of the cover member 68 defining the upper end of the opening 69, is exposed outwardly. The other portion (overlapped portion 84b) of the lens 84, which extends upwardly from the upper end of the opening 69, is overlapped and hence is covered by the cover member 68. Therefore, with the headlight 10 being disposed in the cover member 68, only the appearance portion 84a of the lens 84 is perceived visually.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The headlight 10 and the mounting structure for the headlight 10 according to the first embodiment are constructed basically as described above. Operations and advantages of the headlight 10 will be described below.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The headlight 10 includes the LEDs 86 and the board 100, which is supported by the first board support member 104 in an upper portion of the space 98, i.e., in a region aligned with the overlapped portion 84b of the lens 84 as viewed in front elevation. When the headlight 10 is viewed from the front while the headlight 10 is not energized, only the appearance portion 84a of the lens 84 is perceived visually through the opening 69 of the cover member 68. At this time, the LEDs 86, the board 100, and the first board support member 104 of the headlight 10 are concealed by the<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> cover member 68 above the opening 69, and the second board support member 106 is concealed by the reflector 96, so that an observer can visually perceive only the reflector 96, which extends downwardly from the first board support member 104. Accordingly, when the observer views the headlight 10 from the front, the observer does not see the LEDs 86 and the board 100, and thus the headlight 10 has an improved appearance.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">When the headlight 10 is energized, almost all of the rays of light emitted from the LEDs 86 travel straight to the reflector 96, which reflects the light forwardly of the motor vehicle. A portion of the forward-travelling rays of light emitted from the LEDs 86 are blocked by the wall 112, which is disposed in front of the LEDs 86. Therefore, when the observer views the headlight 10 from the front, the observer can visually perceive only rays of emitted light that are reflected by the reflector 96. Therefore, while the headlight 10 radiates light reflected by the reflector 96, the headlight 10 also blocks light emitted directly from the LEDs 86. Therefore, the headlight 10 is capable of maintaining a desired amount of radiated light, while at the same time preventing direct light from being perceived visually.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">If the observer observes the headlight 10 from an obliquely lower position, then the observer is prevented from seeing the LEDs 86 by the wall 112. The range in which the observer is prevented from seeing the LEDs 86 is determined depending on the positional relationship between the LEDs 86 and the wall 112. More specifically, if the observer sees the headlight 10 in a range above a<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> hypothetical straight line L, which interconnects the center of the LEDs 86 and the tip end of the wall 112, then since the LEDs 86 are concealed by the wall 112, the observer is prevented from seeing the LEDs 86.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">If the observer sees the headlight 10 in a range below the hypothetical straight line L, then the observer sees the LEDs 86. However, the range in which the observer sees the LEDs 86 is sufficiently smaller than if the LEDs 86 were concealed by only the cover member 68. Since the front wheel 14 also exists in the range in which the observer can see the LEDs 86, the observer actually has a much smaller chance of seeing the LEDs 86. Consequently, the appearance of the headlight 10 is improved.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">When the headlight 10 is energized, only rays of light that are emitted from the LEDs 86 and directed toward the range in which the observer can observe the LEDs 86 are emitted directly outward from the lens 84. In other words, rays of light that are directed toward the range (visual perception prevention range) above the hypothetical straight line L are blocked by the wall 112, whereas rays of light directed toward the range (visual perception range) below the hypothetical straight line L are allowed to leak outside of the lens 84. Consequently, the wall 112 is effective to significantly reduce the chances that the observer to will observe light emitted directly from the LEDs 86.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The headlight 10 according to the first embodiment includes the heat radiating fins 114, which are disposed on the rear surface of the second board support member 106. The heat radiating fins 114 radiate heat that is generated<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> by the LEDs 86 when the LEDs 86 emit light. Such heat is transferred from the LEDs 86 through the board 100 and the first board support member 104 to the second board support member 106. The heat radiating fins 114 are disposed in proximity to the position where the first board support member 104 is coupled to the second board support member 106. Consequently, heat is smoothly transferred from the first board support member 104 through the second board support member 106 to the heat radiating fins 114. Since the heat radiating fins 114 project outwardly from the base 82, the heat radiating fins 114 radiate heat outside of the headlight 10.

With such a shape, when an observer sees the headlight 210A from a vertical direction, the observer is prevented from seeing the low-beam LEDs 298a by the intermediate wall 336 and the low-beam reflector 300a, while direct light from the low-beam LEDs 298a also is blocked by the intermediate wall 336 and the low-beam reflector 300a.</p><p id="p0154" num="0154">Since the high-beam LEDs 298b are housed in the second cavity 334b, the high-beam LEDs 298b are prevented from being seen by an observer when the observer sees the headlight 210A from the front. An angle of a hypothetical straight line L2, which defines the visual perception prevention range for the high-beam LEDs 298b, is determined by a front wall (distal-end wall 338) of the second cavity 334b in which the high-beam LEDs 298b are disposed.</p><p id="p0155" num="0155">The high-beam LEDs 298b, which serve as the light source, are oriented in a downward direction where the front wheel 214 (see <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>) is disposed. Therefore, the distal-end wall 338 may be set at an appropriate height, which makes the high-beam LEDs 298b less likely to be seen.
