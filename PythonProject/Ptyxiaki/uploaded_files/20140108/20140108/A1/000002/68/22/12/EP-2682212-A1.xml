The guide pad disclosed in Patent Literature 1 is mounted at an outer circumference of a leading end of a drill head mainly used for deep hole cutting, and abuts on a machining hole machined by the drill, thereby supporting the drill itself. The aforementioned guide pad is removably attached to the drill. The guide pad has a plate-like shape of a substantially rectangular external shape and has a mounting hole formed at the center in a longitudinal direction, and two curved surfaces that are formed on both sides of the mounting hole in a longitudinal direction, and abut on the machining hole as guide surfaces, each having a substantially arc-shaped cross-section. The guide pad includes a guide surface part formed of a cemented carbide, and a steel material part to which<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the guide surface is brazed and which has a mounting hole to the tool body. That is, the guide pad includes the steel and the brazing materials. The guide pad is formed to have an attachment base portion of the steel material with a substantially L-like cross-section for suppressing generation of crack in the cemented carbide owing to difference in thermal stress upon brazing of the cemented carbide and the steel material.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Further, as a conventional guide pad, there is one disclosed in Patent Literature 2. The guide pad disclosed in Patent Literature 2 is formed into a plate-like shape with a substantially rectangular external shape, and has wing-shaped protrusions extending from two long sides thereof, respectively. As the guide pad is entirely formed of the cemented carbide material, the wing-shaped protrusions are provided to prevent reduction in a thickness of the wall from the mounting hole to the outer circumferential side surface for securing the strength of the area around the mounting hole.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004"><ul><li>PTL 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2003211311A"><text>2003-211311</text></patcit></li><li>PTL 2: Pamphlet of International Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP8008332A"><text>96/008332</text></patcit></li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">For example, in a cutting tool with a single cutting edge for drilling a hole, generally, it is preferable to provide a guide pad at two positions: a 180° position around an axis of rotation with respect to the cutting edge; and a 90° position backward in a relative rotating direction of the tool with respect to the cutting edge, when seen from the leading end side of the tool. In other words, it is preferable to provide it at the farthest position from the cutting edge, and at the position that receives a principal component as the largest among three components of cutting force. However, when the tool diameter that defines the machining hole diameter is relatively small, it is sometimes difficult to provide the guide pad at such preferable positions.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A main reason thereof is interference of a cutting insert or a fastening mechanical part for the cutting insert with the guide pad. Therefore, it is preferable to use the guide pad having no interference, specifically having interference as small as possible, with the other components. However, the wall around the mounting hole is required to have sufficient strength for fastening of the guide pad with a clamp screw and the like. As the cross section of the mounting base portion of the guide pad disclosed in Patent Literature 1 is formed in substantially L-shape, the guide pad is formed larger in width by the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> substantially L-shaped wall. In other words, as the guide surface is formed of the separate member from the mounting base portion, the guide pad disclosed in Patent Literature 1 is not suitable for reducing the size and width. The guide pad disclosed in Patent Literature 2 is entirely formed of a cemented carbide, which is suitable for reducing the size and the width. However, the wing-shape protrusions left-right symmetrically protruding from two long sides of the guide pad are likely to be interfered with the other parts.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention provides a guide pad that improves freedom degree of arrangement, a cutting tool body to which the guide pad is attached, and a cutting tool having the guide pad attached thereto.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The guide pad in a plate-like shape according to the present invention includes an upper surface (2) and a lower surface (3) which face each other, and a side surface (6) extending between the upper surface (2) and the lower surface (3), and is removably attached to a tool body (10) of a cutting tool.

The plurality of side surfaces 6a, 6b and 6c will be collectively referred to as a side surface 6. Each external shape of the upper surface 2 and<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the lower surface 3 is substantially parallelogrammatic. The external shapes of the upper surface 2 and the lower surface 3 have truncated acute-angled corners, which may be seen as a substantially hexagonal shape. Among the plurality of side surfaces 6a, 6b and 6c, the two opposing side surfaces 6a, 6a extending along a longitudinal direction A are substantially formed of planar surfaces and are arranged substantially in parallel with each other. The two side surfaces 6b, 6b are also substantially formed of planar surfaces and are arranged substantially in parallel with each other. The two side surfaces 6c, 6c are also substantially formed of planar surfaces and are arranged substantially in parallel with each other. The lower surface 3 is substantially formed of the planar surface. The structure of the upper surface 2 will be described later.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The guide pad 1 is removably attached to a tool body 10 of a rotary cutting tool as an indexable drill as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figs. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">6</figref>, for example. A guide surface 2a is formed on the upper surface 2. The guide surface 2a is formed as a curved surface with a curvature radius R having a substantially arc-like cross-section, and extends in the longitudinal direction A. The guide surface 2a is partially in contact with an inner wall surface of a machining hole to be machined by the drill, and operates so as to support the drill. This operation guides the drill to the machining hole and improves straightness of the drill. A portion of the guide surface 2a around one end 2b located on the leading end side of the drill as one of both ends<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 2b of the guide surface 2a is positioned so as to be in contact with the inner wall surface of the machining hole. That is, the guide pad 1 is placed while being slightly tilted so that the portion of the guide surface 2a other than the area around the end 2b on one side is free from contact. The removable attachment of the guide pad 1 to the cutting tool indicates easy replacement in such a case as fixing of the guide pad 1 with a clamp screw 11 and the like, for example. The method of attaching the guide pad 1 is not limited to the use of the clamp screw 11, but various known attaching methods may be employed.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The specific shape of the guide surface 2a is defined by its curvature radius R that is smaller than half of a diameter φD of a guide hole. The guide hole herein denotes the hole through which the guide pad is guided, like the aforementioned machining hole. For example, when the guide pad 1 is used in the indexable drill with the guide hole diameter substantially equal to the machining hole diameter, and is guided to the machining hole to be machined by the drill, preferably, the curvature radius of a substantially arc-like shape that constitutes the guide surface 2a with the arc-like cross-section is set to the value smaller than the half (radius) of the diameter φD of the machining hole to be machined by the guide pad 1. <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> schematically represents the relationship between the curvature radius R of the guide surface 2a and the diameter φD of the machining hole. That is, the relationship<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> between the curvature radius R and the diameter φD is expressed as R&lt;(φD/2).</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">If the curvature radius R is larger than the half of the diameter φD of the machining hole, the guide surface 2a is not brought into contact with the machining hole to be formed as the guide hole. It fails to provide the guide function, and an edge is brought into contact with the machining hole. Contact of the edge of the guide surface 2a with the inner wall surface of the machining hole may damage the inner wall surface of the machining hole.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The guide surface 2a according to the embodiment has the constant curvature radius R. For example, if the guide pad 1 is attached to the indexable drill with the machining diameter φD set to approximately 32 mm, the curvature radius R of the guide surface 2a may be set to approximately 15.0 mm. In the embodiment, as the curvature radius R of the guide surface 2a is kept constant, the center of the curvature of the guide surface 2a is located on an axis line C1 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>. The axis line C1 is a straight line that extends in a vertical direction with respect to the drawing of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> and is parallel to the lower surface 3. Note that, the embodiment will be explained with respect to the case where the curvature radius R is kept constant, but, the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned case. For example, the present invention may be applied to a case that the curvature radius R of the guide<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> surface 2a changes in the longitudinal direction A, and also to a case that the curvature of an arc changes in accordance with the position on the arc.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the guide pad 1 has a single mounting hole 8 formed that penetrates the upper surface 2 and the lower surface 3. The guide pad 1 is formed 180° rotationally symmetrical with respect to a central axis line C2 of the mounting hole 8. The central axis line C2 intersects the axis line C1. Assuming that the plane which contains the axis line C1 and passes the center between the two side surfaces 6a, 6a is set as a reference plane S, the reference plane S substantially bisects the guide pad 1. As is known from <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the external shapes of the upper surface 2 and the lower surface 3 of the guide pad 1 are formed to be asymmetrical with respect to the reference plane S. In other words, the upper surface 2 and the lower surface 3 have left-right asymmetrical external shapes without axis of symmetry in any direction. Each width L1 of the guide pad 1 at both ends in the longitudinal direction A is smaller than the width at the position of the central axis line C2, that is, the width L2 between the two side surfaces 6a, 6a. The guide pad 1 has the maximum width L2 at the area around which the mounting hole 8 is formed, and the width L2 gradually decreases toward both ends in the longitudinal direction A. Then each width at both ends in the longitudinal direction A becomes the minimum width L1. Respective ends in the longitudinal direction A are offset<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> toward the respective side surfaces 6a from the reference plane S.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the embodiment, the width L1 of the respective ends of the guide pad 1 is set to approximately 2.00 mm, and the width L2 is set to approximately 6.35 mm. The width L2 may be set to the smaller value such as approximately 5.56 mm. The width is not specifically limited so long as it allows removable attachment to the tool body 10 of the cutting tool. In the embodiment, the angle of the acute-angled corner of the substantially parallelogram external shape of the guide pad 1 is set to approximately 35.0°, which is not limited thereto. The angle of the acute-angled corner of the guide pad 1 may be arbitrarily adjusted so long as it is not interfered with the other components of the cutting tool to which the guide pad is attached, and the overall dimension is reduced while keeping the strength. For example, the angle of the acute-angled corner may be set to approximately 55.0°.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the embodiment, a clamp screw 13 for a cutting insert 12 is employed as the fastening member for attachment of the cutting insert 12 to the tool body 10. The guide pad 1 is designed to be shaped in consideration of the interference with the clamp screw 13 for the cutting insert 12, and a prepared hole of the female screw. The fastening member for the cutting insert 12 is not limited to the clamp screw 13, but various types of related art may be applied. Arbitrary fastening method may<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> be employed so long as the guide pad 1 is arranged so as to avoid the interference with all the parts.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The width of the guide pad 1 is appropriately adjusted so that the head of the clamp screw 11 does not protrude from the guide surface 2a, and the strength of the guide pad 1 for clamping is intensified. The largest width of the guide pad 1 according to the embodiment is set to approximately 3 mm. Chamfers 2c are formed at both ends of the upper surface 2 of the guide pad 1 in the longitudinal direction A. The chamfer 2c prevents the guide pad 1 from damaging the inner wall surface of the machining hole, and from causing an abnormal damage such as chipping. The guide surface 2a is arranged so as to secure a clearance between the inner wall surface of the machining hole and the guide surface 2a toward the mounting hole 8 from the area around the chamfer 2c, and to allow the ends 2b around the chamfers 2c to perform the guide function.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As known from <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>, the guide pad 1 according to the embodiment has the two guide surfaces 2a separately formed on both sides of the reference plane S.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">If there are two guide surfaces 2a as described above, for example, when one of the two guide surfaces 2a is damaged in use, the other guide surface 2a that is not damaged may be used. In other words, even if one of the guide surfaces 2a is<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> damaged, it is possible to prevent the other guide surface 2a from being simultaneously damaged.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">When the guide pad 1 according to the embodiment is removably attached as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>, at least the central axis line C2 of the mounting hole 8 is offset with respect to the axis of rotation C3 so as not to intersect the axis of rotation C3 of the cutting tool. That is, the guide pad 1 is arranged tilted so that the central axis line C2 does not intersect the central axis line of the machining hole. The aforementioned arrangement brings one of the two guide surfaces 2a into reliable contact with the inner wall surface of the machining hole, and secures the sufficient clearance between the other guide surface 2a and the inner wall surface of the machining hole. This makes it possible to more reliably prevent the damage of the other guide surface 2a.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The side surfaces 6a and 6b, and the lower surface 3 of the guide pad 1 partially function as seating surfaces upon attachment to the tool body 10. A recess groove 2d is formed between the two guide surfaces 2a as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>. The groove 2d of the embodiment has a relatively simple shape, which is not limited thereto. Any groove with arbitrary shape may be employed so long as the two guide surfaces 2a are sufficiently separated. In the embodiment, each of the two guide surfaces 2a has a curved surface with the common curvature center, which is not limited thereto. The two guide surfaces 2a each may have<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> the different curvature center, or different curvature radius so long as the curvature radius R of the guide surface 2a is smaller than the half of the diameter φD of the machining hole as described above. Such guide surfaces may be arbitrarily formed with different or variable shapes.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The guide pad 1 according to the present invention may be entirely formed of the material of, for example, cemented carbide, cermet, or ceramic. Alternatively, a hard coating may be coated on the surface of the aforementioned hard material. In other words, the steel material and brazing material do not have to be used as the material for forming the guide pad 1 according to the present invention. This makes it possible to reduce the dimension of the guide pad 1, thus improving the freedom degree of arrangement on the tool body 10.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">As described above, in the embodiment, the curvature radius R of the guide surface 2a is kept constant, which is not limited thereto. The clearance between the guide pad 1 and the inner wall surface of the machining hole may be appropriately adjusted by positively changing the curvature radius R to reduce the curvature radius R as coming closer to the mounting hole 8. Joint portions of the plurality of side surfaces 6a, 6b and 6c are rounded for preventing the guide pad 1 from causing the abnormal damage such as chipping. In the embodiment, each curvature radius of all the rounded corners at 6 points may be set to approximately R0.4 mm.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In the embodiment, as described above, the guide pad 1 is formed 180° rotationally symmetrical with respect to the central axis line C2 of the mounting hole 8. Due to this, after using one of the two guide surfaces 2a, the guide pad 1 is rotated at 180° around the central axis line C2 so as to allow the use of the other guide surface 2a. The part that does not influence the attachment to the tool body 10 and the guide function of the guide surface 2a does not have to have the shape symmetrical with respect to the central axis line C2 of the mounting hole 8. The design may be appropriately changed within a range not to influence the support (guide) function.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In the drill of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, the guide pads 1 are arranged at the positions shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>. A cutting insert 12A for a peripheral cutting edge, and a cutting insert 12B for a center cutting edge are attached to the drill, respectively. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>, the guide pads 1 are attached to two positions, that is, an approximately 145° position forward in the relative rotating direction R of the tool from the cutting edge of the cutting insert 12A and an approximately 79° position backward in the relative rotating direction R of the tool from the cutting edge of the cutting insert 12A. As described above, for the single cutting-edge drill, the optimal positions of the guide pads are set to two points, that is, a 180° position in the relative rotating direction of the tool from the peripheral cutting edge, and a 90° position backward in the relative<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> rotating direction of the tool from the peripheral cutting edge. In the embodiment, deviation amounts from the optimal positions may be set to approximately 35° and 1°, respectively. If the conventional guide pads are arranged with the tool of the same type, the respective deviation amounts of approximately 48° and 20° are limit values. The use of the guide pads 1 according to the present invention improves the deviation amounts by approximately 13° and 9°, respectively, compared to the related art. The experimental results of drilling the steel material S45C show the aforementioned effect of accuracy improvement in the machining hole diameter by approximately 30%.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Specifically, the drill with the diameter of 50.0 mm and whole length of 370 mm was attached to a vertical machining center, and a carbon steel S45C (220HB) was used as the work material. The cutting speed Vc = 150 m/min, feed f = 0.10 mm/rev, and the depth of the machining hole of 150 mm were set as the conditions for cutting, and the fuel was supplied through the inside of the drill. The drill having the guide pad 1 according to the embodiment attached thereto, the drill having the conventional guide pad attached thereto, and the drill without the guide pad were used to machine the work materials to drill 12 holes, respectively. Each dispersion in the diameter of the machined holes in the respective cases was evaluated. The dispersion in the machining hole diameters by the drill having the guide pad 1 according to the embodiment attached thereto resulted in approximately 0.12 mm as the difference in the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> diameter of the hole between the area around the inlet part and the area at the deep part. Meanwhile, the difference generated when using the drill without the guide pad resulted in approximately 0.24 mm, and the difference generated when using the drill having the conventional guide pad attached thereto resulted in approximately 0.17 mm, respectively. The use of the drill having the guide pad according to the embodiment attached thereto improved the accuracy of the machining hole by approximately 30% at a maximum compared to the accuracy derived from the use of the drill with the conventional guide pad.</p><heading id="h0012">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p0032" num="0032">Next, a guide pad 1A according to a second embodiment is shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref>. The guide pad 1A of the embodiment has a single guide surface 2a formed in the upper surface 2. As described above, in spite of the single guide surface 2a, both ends 2b, 2b of the guide surface 2a in the longitudinal direction A are allowed to perform the guide function. Therefore, the two ends 2b, 2b of the guide surface 2a may be separately used by rotating the guide pad 1A at 180° with respect to the mounting hole 8. Preferably, the guide pad 1A according to the second embodiment is configured to have the central axis line C2 of the mounting hole 8 arranged offset with respect to the axis of rotation C3 of the cutting tool upon use of the guide pad 1A according to the second embodiment. When using one of the ends 2b of the guide surface 2a, the aforementioned arrangement secures<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> sufficient clearance between the other end 2b and the inner wall surface of the machining hole. This may prevent damage of the other end 2b.</p><heading id="h0013">Third Embodiment</heading><p id="p0033" num="0033">A guide pad 1B according to a third embodiment is shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">Figs. 10</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0011">11</figref>. Each external shape of the upper surface 2 and the lower surface 3 of the guide pad 1B is not substantially parallelogrammatic. The guide pad 1B is formed to have a width of the guide surface 2a at the end 2b on the side of the chamfer 2c smaller than that of the area around the mounting hole 8, and is formed asymmetrical with respect to the reference plane S. In the embodiment, the width of the guide pad 1 is adjusted to be arbitrarily changed between the maximum width L2 of the area around which the mounting hole 8 is formed, and the minimum width L1 at the both ends 2b. Although not shown, it may be designed to have the width increased to the one larger than the width L2, and then decreased to the width L2 again. It may be freely adjusted within the range so as not to be interfered with the other components of the cutting tool.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">According to the embodiment, because the number of allowed usage is set to two, the number of the guide surfaces 2a is set to two, but, which is not limited to such value. For example, if the number of the allowed usage is set to three or more, three or more guide surfaces 2a may be provided accordingly.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> In the embodiment, the two opposing side surfaces 6b, 6b are parallel with each other, which is not limited thereto. Two side surfaces may be arranged in non-parallel, or have curved surfaces each with the different shape. That is, in the embodiment, although each of the plurality of side surfaces is a planar surface, it is not limited thereto. They may have further complicated curved surfaces in order to prevent the interference with the other components of the cutting tool. For example, the side surface may be configured to have a single annular curved surface formed by smoothly connecting a plurality of curved surfaces. In the embodiment, the guide pad 1 has the width that becomes relatively wide at the area around which the mounting hole 8 is formed, and becomes relatively narrow at both ends, which is not limited thereto. The width of the guide pad 1 at the area around the guide surface may be narrower than that of the area around the mounting hole, and the change in the width in the longitudinal direction may be arbitrarily set.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The conventional guide pad manufacturing method may be directly used for the method of manufacturing the guide pad according to the present invention. For example, manufacturing is conducted through the conventional manufacturing steps using the powder-pressurizing molding and sintering. The grinding work of the guide surface 2a, the chamfer 2c or the like may be added if needed. Furthermore, it may be subjected to the surface treatment such as coating<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> of the hard coated layer through CVD or PVD if necessary. Various types of conventional technique may be applied to all the manufacturing steps.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The indexable drill is the typical example as the cutting tool that allows removable attachment of the guide pad according to the present invention. Alternatively, attachment to the cutting tool for drilling, especially for deep hole drilling, such as the gun drill and reamer is effective. However, it is not limited to those tools as described above. It is applicable to all kinds of cutting tools which use the guide pad.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">As described above, if the rotary cutting tool is employed as the cutting tool to which the guide pad 1 according to the present invention is removably attached, preferably, the guide pad is arranged so as to prevent the central axis line C2 of the mounting hole 8 from intersecting the axis of rotation C3 of the cutting tool. The position at which the guide pad is attached to the tool body 10 is set to establish the aforementioned arrangement. This allows each of the two or more ends 2b of the guide surface 2a to operate reliably, thus preventing damage of the other ends.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The cutting tool to which the guide pad according to the present invention is removably attached is removably attached to the machine tool such as the machining center and lathe, receives the relative rotating motion around the rotary axis<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> of the tool, and the relative motion with respect to the work material so that the work material such as the steel material is subjected to the cutting process. If the cutting tool is the drill, the guide pad is brought into contact with the inner surface of the hole drilled by the cutting tool itself and supported (guided) thereby to improve working precision of the hole to be machined. The guide pad and the cutting tool according to the present invention may be used in the machine tool such as the drill press. The guide pad according to the present invention is especially effective when it is attached to the rotary cutting tool with a single cutting edge. Meanwhile, the cutting tool for drilling with two-cutting-edge or four-cutting-edge has another cutting edge at the approximately 180° position in the relative rotating direction of the tool from one cutting edge. In such a case, the preferable position at which the guide pad is provided becomes different. In case of the two-cutting-edge type, for example, it is preferable to arrange the guide pads at the approximately 90° positions from the respective cutting edges. In case of the four-cutting-edge type, it is preferable to arrange the guide pads at the approximately 45° positions from the respective cutting edges. If it is difficult to arrange the four cutting edges (cutting inserts) and the four guide pads 1, a rough blade with a roughing cutting edge than the other cutting edge is provided among the four cutting edges. Then the guide pads are arranged at two positions, respectively, that is, the 180° positions in the relative rotating direction of<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> the tool with reference to the roughing cutting edge, and the 90° positions backward in the relative rotating direction of the tool from the roughing cutting edge, respectively.
