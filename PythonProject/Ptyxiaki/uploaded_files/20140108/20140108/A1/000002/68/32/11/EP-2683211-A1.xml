This bearer is established when a device exits idle state using control plane signaling documented in RANAP (3GPP TS 25.413) and GTP-C V1 (3GPP TS 29.060) for GPRS/UMTS, or S1 AP (3GPP TS 36.413) and GTP-C v2 (3GPP TS 29.274) for EPS, as recalled for example for EPS in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 2</figref> (UE triggered Service Request procedure) taken from 3GPP TS 23.401. Also, security material valid for a single UE needs to be provided to the RAN (Radio Access Network) for secure communications to be established at every transition from idle state to active state.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">For applications that send small amount of data or data in a bursty mode and then are inactive for longer than the inactivity timer applied in the network to release radio resources, there is in aggregate a lot of idle to active transitions to send potentially a small amount of data, e.g. MTC device sending infrequent short packets, smartphones generating frequent small data such as keep alives.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Each idle to active transition implies a series of control plane transactions to reestablish the user plane connection through to the SGW. In many cases more radio interface and networking traffic is wasted in these control plane messages than the actual user plane message. I.e. the control plane is burdened even though the user plane is lightly loaded.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A potential solution to such problem could be to increase the idle timer so that devices stay active for longer (but this may drain battery life and still the issue may remain for deployments of very large number of devices, albeit mitigated). But also, this does not substantially help in reducing the aggregate amount of signaling produced by potentially high number of devices used in future Machine to Machine applications when these transmit small amount of data while retaining a long term connection active. Also the sheer number of devices calls for ways to reduce the amount of state kept in nodes.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Therefore, there is a need to improve the efficiency of device re-activation, i.e., to reduce the network resources needed to support device re-initiation of data transmission after a quiescent period.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In an embodiment, in order to allow a reduction of signaling needed to reestablish bearers at idle to active transitions, it is proposed to define some predefined tunnels over which to send data in connectionless mode, shared by all devices and not just dedicated to one device. This eliminates the need to maintain these tunnels per device and reduces state in nodes. This requires to keep information as to which tunnel to use to forward packets in both directions. This information can be installed using today's control plane procedures properly modified.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In an embodiment, a connectionless data transmission mode is introduced that greatly reduces signalling for re-initiating uplink and downlink data transmission for a UE in idle mode.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In an embodiment, in order to allow a reduction of signalling needed to establish bearers at idle to active transitions, it is proposed to send data in connectionless mode between the UE and the SGW along the following principles:
<ol><li>1. Data are sent in connectionless mode over the radio interface, and over S1-U/Iu/S12 tunnels that are predefined at PDN connection set up time. The S1-U/Iu/S12 tunnels can either be shared by all UEs using a PDN (in the cased of Shared Tunnels) or be unique per UE and PDN connection for a given SGW. This eliminates the need to establish these tunnels per UE at each idle to active transition and reduces state in nodes.</li><li>2. To send uplink data a UE needs to pass to the RAN a Connection ID the SGW has passed to the UE at PDN connection set up time, so that the RAN node can select the appropriate TEID (i.e. Tunnel Endpoint IDentifier) for uplink traffic and the appropriate SGW IP address. The Connection ID enables the RAN to derive the SGW address and, if shared tunnels are used over S1-U/Iu/S12, the uplink TEID. If a TEID per UE/PDN connection is used then the connection ID needs to pass information that uniquely identifies the UL TEID. When the Packet is sent in the UL over S1/Iu/S12 it includes information for the SGW to be able to derive the DL TEID to be used. The UL TEID identifies in the SGW the UE and the S5/S8 TEID to be used to forward traffic to the PGW.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></li><li>3. Connectionless mode procedures are defined over the radio interface for allocation of radio resources to the UE and user data transmission, without the need to send a Service Request message to the MME/SGSN.</li><li>4. Security state per UE is replaced by security state per PDN connection valid for a specific tracking/routing area or set of tracking/routing areas. The UE is provided with security material at PDN connectivity set up and it is maintained during mobility management procedures. The security data is provisioned in the RAN node. This means the MME/SGSN does not need to install security material in the RAN node before sending data.</li><li>5. Multiple PDN connections can be supported concurrently. PDN connections with connectionless and connection-oriented (i.e. existing radio &amp; S1/Iu procedures) modes may be supported concurrently.</li><li>6. Connectionless mode is applicable to UTRAN and E-UTRAN in the EPC, and can be applicable to GPRS Core.</li><li>7. An Handover procedure is not necessary in connectionless mode. When engaged in active connectionless data transmission, the UE notifies the network about cell change to enable the SGW to send downlink traffic to the RAN node serving the UE (similar to a GPRS MS in Ready State in Gb mode).</li><li>8. In a possible alternative, the RAN may retrieve from the MME/SGSN per UE security credentials or/and other parameters (e.g. UE radio capabilities) at the start of a connectionless data transmission with the UE, if not already available in the RAN, using a single request/response exchange over S1-MME/Iu.</li></ol></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In an embodiment:
<ul><li>To send uplink data a UE needs to include a PDN connection ID the SGW has passed to the UE at PDN connection set up time, so that the RAN node can select the appropriate TEID for uplink traffic and the appropriate SGW IP address. This PDN connection ID may change upon mobility management procedures when e.g. a different SGW is selected (in which case the new PN connection ID is relayed to the UE by the new SGW via the MME or SGSN).

<ul><li>For uplink traffic in connectionless mode, the UE passes to the RAN the Connection ID it received during the PDN connection setup (or during the last tracking/routing area update procedure).

While the timer is running, the UE signals cell updates to the RAN and, for cell change to a new RAN node, the new RAN node propagates the information (e.g. under the form of a dummy uplink GTP-U packet) including the information necessary in the SGW to locate the UE (e.g. RAN Node IP address). Usage of the timer in the SGW will be described in "DL traffic handling".</li></ul></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In an embodiment:
<ul><li>For the handling of Uplink traffic in connectionless mode, we need the UE to pass to the RAN a reference to the PDN and SW the packet sent by the UE needs to be sent to, which we name Connection ID. The connectionless mode may e.g. use a single per UE UL radio channel shared by all PDN connections operating in connectionless mode, or separate UL logical radio channels each for each PDN. This Connection ID implicitly identifies in this channel link layer the SGW and the TEID to be used to send UL traffic for the PDN at the ENB/RNC.</li><li>The connection ID is provided securely to the UE via NAS signaling at the connection set up and every time a SGW selection or relocation is performed, so the right SGW is selected. In a similar fashion, the state in the SGW associates the TEID used in a UL packet to an UL TEID (for instance, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 3</figref>, TEID 1 if we assume the same TEID is used network wide for a single PDN, in this case PDN 1) and the address of the PGW handling the UE PDN connection. Basically once the eNB select the SGW and TEID via the Connection ID, it selects a unique distribution tree that routes packets to the right PGW and PDN. UL packet for a connectionless PDN resets a connectionless idle timer held at the UE, eNB and SGW so the it is assumed the eNB information is not tentative and the paging procedure is not invoked. Also, if a UE has entered a new cell and the idle timer has not expired, and the UE has no UL data to send, it will send a dummy UL radio frame the ENB then translates in a dummy UL GTP PDU including the information necessary to locate the UE in the SGW (e.g. IP address or UE ID).</li><li>When the RAN sends UL traffic it may add to the GTP header an extension header indicating the Cell ID serving the UE so that the SGW can get this information for location information retrieval purposes in the core. This is always included in the first UL PDU sent by a RAN node to the SGW for a UE when the idle timer for the UE is started in the RAN node.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref> is intended to illustrate, in a simplified way, an example of Uplink packet forwarding in connectionless transmission mode in an EPS network, according to such embodiment.</p><heading id="h0005"><u>Downlink traffic handing</u></heading><p id="p0036" num="0036">In an embodiment:

<ul><li>When a PDN connection is created in connectionless mode, the SGW just needs to pass to the PGW selected for the PDN connection its own address in GTP-C . Say that the connectionless PDN connection is for APN 1, as illustrated for example in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 3</figref>. The PGW knows that to serve PDN1 associated to APN1 it will have to send packet to this SGW on TEID 1 for a specific UE, until a modify bearer request will change this to another SGW or a delete PDN connection request will tear down the PDN connectivity. Basically host routes for the UE pointing to the right SGW are always available as long as the connectionless PDN connection is active, indicating as a next hop for DL traffic SGW IP address and TEID1</li><li>Similarly, the RNC and eNB need just to notify their own address for the SGW to be able to send downlink data to them for e.g. PDN1 associated to APN1, as TEID 1 would be used for PDN 1, as illustrated for example in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 3</figref>. When, due to mobility the eNB or RNC change in active state, the SGW will just need to know the IP address of the new RNC and eNB where the UE is and this is to be done using today's procedures for relocation (triggered by TAU/RAU) or the information sent in the UL packets described above. However, the issue exists to enable the learning of the right RNC or eNB when the UE exits from IDLE state (i.e. not during an HO or relocation procedure). If this happens due to UL traffic, the SGW needs to record in its routing table a change in the host route to the UE when the UE sends UL traffic from a RNC or eNB different from the one in the current<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> table. Basically the routing tables in the SGW are updated by learning the source address of the GTP-U packet from the RNC or eNB. If the UE exits idle state due to paging, please refer to the section related to paging</li><li>In the event a UE is considered idle by the SGW, normal paging could be used and then the UE in connectionless mode would respond successfully to the paging request causing the MME/SGSN to install the next hop information in the SGW and packets to be delivered to the UE. In the paging message, if the DL packet was for a connectionless PDN, the MME/SGSN shall include the Connection ID related to the paging so that the eNB/RNC can cache the appropriate mapping when the first UL packet is received, and the UE knows for which connectionless PDN the paging is for. A Connectionless PDN paging will not cause the activation of all bearers in the UE, just the connectionless bearer.</li><li>As another option, an optimization based on subscription or learning of UE behaviour, could be applied for often stationary UE's: when the UE enters Idle state, the SGW marks the DL forwarding information as "tentative". When a DL packet is received, the packet is forwarded regardless to the eNB/RNC and the Connection ID and UE identity is added as an extension header to the GTP-U packet. In the event the eNB/RNC cannot deliver the packet to the UE, it shall request the SGW to page the UE via the MME/SGSN on a broader area and piggyback to this request the packet to be forwarded to the UE when it is updated with the correct eNB/RNC address to be used as part of the normal paging procedure. At this stage normal paging is used.</li></ul></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">All packets received after the first DL packet at the eNB or RNC may be discarded if the optimized procedure is followed, until the first packet is successfully delivered. When optimized procedure is supported, the DL forwarding information is marked as "valid" only after the first UL packet is received from the eNB/RNC or the MME/SGSN performs a successful normal paging (if the RNC/eNB requested this if optimized paging fails). At the same time a idle timer is started which, when it elapses, causes the SGW information to be marked as tentative again.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref> is intended to illustrate, in a simplified way, an example of Downlink packet forwarding in connectionless transmission mode in an EPS network, according to such embodiment.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 6</figref> is intended to illustrate, in a simplified way, an example of non-optimized paging procedure in connectionless transmission mode in an EPS network, according to such embodiment.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041"><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 7</figref> is intended to illustrate, in a simplified way, an example of optimized paging procedure in connectionless transmission mode in an EPS network, according to such embodiment.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042"><figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 8</figref> is intended to illustrate, in a simplified way, an example of procedure in case of failure of optimized paging in connectionless transmission mode in an EPS network, according to such embodiment.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In one aspect, there is provided a method for the support of data transmission in a packet mobile network, for PDN connectivity over said packet mobile network between an User Equipment UE and an external Packet Data Network PDN.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In an embodiment, said packet mobile network comprising a Core Network CN accessed by a Radio Access Network RAN, and said data transmission using a tunnel over an interface between a serving RAN node and a serving user plane CN node, said method includes support of said data transmission in a mode referred to as connectionless transmission mode, wherein said tunnel over said interface is predefined and identified using information referred to as Connection ID information, providing a reference to said PDN and to said serving user plane CN node.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In an embodiment:
