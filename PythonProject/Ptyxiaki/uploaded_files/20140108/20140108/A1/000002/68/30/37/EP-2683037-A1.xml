The plate 4 is punched into a fork terminal 5. The thus fabricated fork terminal 5 includes a pair of contacts 6a and 6b each having contact surfaces 7a and 7b through which the fork terminal 5 makes electric contact with terminals<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> of another electric part (for instance, a male connector terminal).

A male connector terminal is inserted into and sandwiched between the contacts 8a and 8b.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">If a connector included rough surfaces (namely, just bladed surfaces without being treated) with which a male connector terminal makes contact, the male connector terminal were damaged when the male connector terminal slides with the rough surface, and further, tiny shaved portions of the male connector terminal accumulated on the rough surface with the result that contact reliability between the connector and the male connector terminal is deteriorated, and that a frictional force between the connector and the male connector terminal is increased, and accordingly, the male connector terminal cannot be smoothly inserted into and pulled out of the connector. The connector terminals disclosed in the above-mentioned Publications are designed to include plated contact surfaces through which the connector terminals make contact with a male connector terminal, by bending contact portions such that surfaces having been just bladed or punched do not make contact surfaces through which the connector terminals make contact with a male connector terminal, for the purpose of preventing corrosion of the contact surfaces and accordingly enhancing contact reliability. Thus, the connector terminals disclosed in the above-mentioned Publications are able to solve the above-mentioned problem.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, if contact portions of a pair of the terminal contacts were formed by bending a metal plate along a fold line extending in a direction in which a male connector terminal is inserted into and pulled out of the terminal<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> contacts, similarly to the above-mentioned conventional connector terminals, a space between the terminal contacts could not avoid from being long. If the terminal contacts were spaced away from each other by a long space, the terminal contacts could not sandwich a male connector terminal therebetween, resulting in deterioration in reliability. Furthermore, a connector terminal cannot be down-sized because of a long space between a pair of the terminal contacts.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">In view of the above-mentioned problems in the conventional connector terminals, it is an object of the present invention to provide a connector terminal which is down-sized and provides high reliability by avoiding a space between the terminal contacts from being long, and designing a contact surface at which the connector terminal makes contact with a male connector terminal to be comprised of a plated surface of a terminal contact.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a connector terminal including a pair of terminal contacts sandwiching a male connector therebetween to make electric contact with said male connector; and<br/>
a terminal body supporting said pair of terminal contacts,<br/>
said terminal contacts being formed by bending a metal plate having been punched into a designed shape,<br/>
said terminal contacts each including a contact surface formed by bending a contact part not facing the other contact part and extending towards a central axis of said terminal body, thereby cause said contact surfaces of said pair of terminal contacts to face each other at a determined position after bending.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In accordance with the present invention, the terminal contacts are formed by bending a contact part not facing the other contact part and extending towards a central axis of the terminal body, and accordingly, it is possible to make the plated contact parts without interfering with each other in fabrication of the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> contact parts out of a metal plate, and further, without much spacing the contact surfaces, which face each other, away from each other.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">It is preferable that the contact part extends beyond the central axis of the terminal body before bending. By designing the contact part to extend beyond the central axis of the terminal body, the contact surface can be designed to have a large area without increasing a space between the contact surfaces facing each other.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">It is preferable that one of said pair of terminal contacts is formed by bending a first portion including a first part extending towards a first direction in which said male connector is pulled out of said connector terminal, said first portion further including said contact part extending from said first part,<br/>
the other of said pair of terminal contacts is formed by bending a second portion including a second part turning back towards a second direction in which said male connector is inserted into said connector terminal, said second portion further including said contact part extending from said second part,<br/>
one of said contact parts is bent in a direction intersecting with said first direction to thereby cause a contact surface of said contact part to face said central axis, and said first part is folded,<br/>
the other of said contact parts is bent in a direction intersecting with said second direction to thereby cause a contact surface of said contact part to face said central axis, and said second part is folded. By so designing the pair of terminal contacts, it is possible to shorten a space between the contact surfaces.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is preferable that one of said pair of terminal contacts is formed by bending a first portion including a first part extending towards a first direction in which said male connector is pulled out of said connector terminal, said first portion further including said contact part extending from said first part,<br/>
the other of said pair of terminal contacts is formed by bending a second portion including a second part extending towards said first direction, said second portion further including said contact part extending from said second<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> part,<br/>
the position of said one contact part is different from the position of said other contact part along said first direction,<br/>
one of said contact parts is bent in a direction intersecting with said first direction to thereby cause a contact surface of said contact part to face said central axis, and said first part is folded,<br/>
the other of said contact parts is bent in a direction intersecting with said second direction to thereby cause a contact surface of said contact part to face said central axis, and said second part is folded. By so designing the pair of terminal contacts, it is possible to shorten a space between the contact surfaces.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">It is preferable that the terminal body includes a pair of compressing portions extending towards the central axis, and the contact part is bent ahead of the compressing portion. It is possible to locate the contact part ahead of the compressing portion, and direct the contact surface to a male connector terminal.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">It is preferable that each of the compressing portions has an arcuate distal end, and the contact part has an arcuate surface extending along the arcuate distal end of each of the compressing portions. By designing the contact part to be arcuate, it is possible to reduce friction between the contact part and a male connector terminal, ensuring that a male connector terminal can be smoothly inserted into and pulled out of the connector terminal. Furthermore, since the contact part has an arcuate surface extending along the arcuate distal end of the compressing portion, a compression force acting on the compression portion can be surely transferred to a rear surface of the contact part, ensuring that a male connector terminal can be surely sandwiched between the contact parts.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">It is preferable that the first portion and the second portion are thinner than the terminal body. By designing the first portion to be thin, the folded first portion is not thick, and hence, the folded first portion can have almost the same thickness as that of the terminal body, ensuring that the folded first portion can<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> be smoothly inserted into a housing.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">It is preferable that the terminal body has a step at each of boundaries with the first portion and the second portion, and each of the first part and the second part is bent inwardly of the step. Since the first portion is bent inwardly of the step in a thickness-wise direction, the first portion is prevented from being deformed by virtue of the step. Thus, it is possible to prevent the first portion from being outwardly deformed in a thickness-wise direction, by virtue of a reaction force generated when a male connector terminal is sandwiched between the contact surfaces.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of fabricating a terminal connector including a pair of terminal contacts sandwiching a male connector therebetween to make electric contact with the male connector, and a terminal body supporting the pair of terminal contacts, the method including (a) forming a pair of contact parts which do not face each other, (b) bending the contact parts to thereby form the pair of terminal contacts at a determined position.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">It is preferable that a contact part corresponding to one of the terminal contacts, which does not face a contact part corresponding to the other of the terminal contacts, and extending towards a central axis of the terminal body is bent to thereby form a contact surface of each of the terminal contacts in the step (b).</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">It is preferable that one of said pair of terminal contacts is formed by bending a first portion including a first part extending towards a first direction in which said male connector is pulled out of said connector terminal, said first portion further including said contact part extending from said first part,<br/>

Accordingly, it is possible to avoid the connector terminals 101 from being damaged and peeled. Furthermore, since the contact parts 322A and 322B have plated contact surfaces, it is possible to reduce friction between the contact parts 322A and 322B and the connector terminals 101, ensuring that the connector terminals 101 of the fuse 100 can be smoothly inserted into and pulled<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> out of the connector terminal 30. Furthermore, since the contact parts 322A and 322B are arcuate in a direction in which the connector terminals 101 are inserted into the connector terminal 30, it is possible to surely sandwich the connector terminals 101 between the contact parts 322A and 322B with less friction between the contact parts 322A and 322B and the connector terminals 101.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Since each of the contact parts 322A and 322B is stroked and bent to have an arcuate surface along an arcuate surface of the compressing portion 33c, it is possible to increase a strength of the contact parts 322A and 322B, and to avoid the contact parts 322A and 322B from being deformed, by causing the contact parts 322A and 322B to make contact with and thus be integral with the compressing portion 33c. Furthermore, since the contact parts 322A and 322B are able to transfer a compression force acting on the compression portion 33c to a rear surface of the contact parts 322A and 322B, it is possible to surely sandwich a male connector terminal between the contact parts 322A and 322B.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">Since the convex step 33d formed when the first portion 320A is thinned makes engagement with the cut-out 321a when the first part 321A is folded, the first portion 320A can be prevented from being outwardly deformed. Similarly, the step 33d formed when the first portion 320B is thinned prevents the first part 321B from being outwardly deformed. Since the first portions 320A and 320B are folded inwardly of the compressing portions 33c in a thickness-wise direction in the above-mentioned way, it is possible to prevent the first parts 321A and 321B from being deformed outwardly in a thickness-wise direction, by virtue of a reaction force generated when the connector terminals 101 are sandwiched between the contact parts 322A and 322B.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">As mentioned above, in the connector terminal 30 in accordance with the preferred embodiment, even if the contact parts 322A and 322B extend beyond the central axis L, the contact parts 322A and 322B are designed to extend towards each other from heads of the first part 321A and the second part 321B extending in the opposite directions, and hence, the contact parts 322A and<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> 322B do not face each other. Accordingly, when the contact parts 322A and 322B are formed of a metal plate, it is possible to form contact parts 322A and 322B without interfering with each other. Thus, a distance between the contact surfaces of the contact parts 322A and 322B facing each other can be shortened, and the contact surfaces can be widened, ensuring that the connector terminals 101 can be sandwiched with the plated contact surfaces.
