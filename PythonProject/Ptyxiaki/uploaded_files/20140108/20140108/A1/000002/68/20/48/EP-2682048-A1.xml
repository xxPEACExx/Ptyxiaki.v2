Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) photography is a fundus photography technique utilizing the natural fluorescence of the fundus.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In age-related macular degeneration, for example, lipofuscin accumulates in the macular area of the fundus retina. The accumulated lipofuscin is a type of fluorescent substance, and emits natural fluorescence when irradiated with light of a specific wavelength. Not only for lipofuscin in age-related macular degeneration, but also for fluorescent substances unique to other lesions and conditions, it is possible to perform fundus autofluorescence (FAF) photography using a similar photography method by appropriately selecting the properties of an exciter filter and a barrier filter that are inserted<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> in the observation/photography optical system.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">FAF emits extremely faint levels of fluorescence, and photographed images thereof contain high levels of noise, necessitating high levels of light radiation during photography or a high-sensitivity imaging device. Regarding image noise in particular, in order to achieve noise reduction effects, a configuration is proposed (for example, Patent Document 1) in which proper exposure is set while avoiding pupillary contraction when synthesizing multiple photographed fundus images.</p><heading id="h0003">Prior Art Documents</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent Document 1: Japanese Laid-open Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2010259531A"><text>2010-259531</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Problems to be Solved</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">FAF photography is a method of photographing the autofluorescence of the fundus using a visible light (green light) exciter filter and a near-infrared light (red light) fluorescence filter. Typically, the following two photographic methods are used.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The first method employs a non-mydriatic fundus camera arrangement in which infrared light is used for observation with a light-receiving element such as a CCD camera and display means such as an LCD monitor, and photographs are taken via an exciter filter. The other<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> method employs a mydriatic fundus camera arrangement in which visible light is used to perform direct observation via a finder, and a fluorescence filter (barrier filter) is inserted when photographs are taken.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">FAF photography itself is a noninvasive method of fluorescence photography allowing images to be taken without the use of drugs (for example, without the need for intravenous injection of any fluorescent agent). However, the mydriatic photography method described above uses mydriatic agents, placing a great burden upon the subject. In non-mydriatic photography, meanwhile, a problem arises in that the FAF image is darkened due to the lack of visual pigment bleaching.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">By the way, visual pigment bleaching is said to enhance fundus autofluorescence (FAF). It is therefore advantageous to irradiate the fundus with visible light prior to photography, thereby inducing visual pigment bleaching, in which state fundus photography can be performed to obtain a bright FAF image having enhanced autofluorescence. However, when photographing a subject eye using a non-mydriatic photography method, irradiation of the subject eye with visible light prior to photography typically induces pupillary contraction in the subject eye, impeding non-mydriatic photography. There is therefore a need to perform visible light irradiation at a weak, non-pupillary contraction-inducing level, promoting visual<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> pigment bleaching without inducing pupillary contraction.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">An object of the present invention is that, especially in a non-mydriatic photography method, a weak level of visible light is projected to promote visual pigment bleaching in order to obtain a brighter fundus image in natural fluorescence photography such as fundus autofluorescence (FAF) photography without the need for complicated image processing involving photographing and synthesizing a plurality of fundus images.</p><heading id="h0007">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">In order to achieve the object described above, the present invention provides an ophthalmologic photography apparatus that comprises an illumination optical system for illuminating the fundus of a subject eye using illumination light from an illumination light source; a photography optical system for taking a fundus image of the fundus irradiated with the illumination light by the illumination optical system; a first electronic infrared imaging means for taking a video for observing the fundus of the subject eye during a subject eye observation period prior to taking a still image of the subject eye; and a second electronic imaging means for taking a still image of the subject eye. In the apparatus, the subject eye observation period in which the fundus of the subject eye is observed using the first electronic imaging means is followed by taking a still image of the subject eye using the second imaging means in<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> response to a shutter operation and recording the obtained still image as still image information. The ophthalmologic photography apparatus is provided with an exciter filter removably provided in an optical path of the illumination optical system for photographing natural fluorescence emitted by the fundus of the subject eye; a barrier filter removably provided in an optical path of the photography optical system for photographing natural fluorescence emitted by the fundus of the subject eye; and an adjustment means for varying the ratio of the visible light component to the infrared light component of the illumination light.</p><heading id="h0008">Effect of the Invention</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">In accordance with the configuration described above, in natural fluorescence photography such as fundus autofluorescence (FAF) photography in which the exciter filter and barrier filter are inserted into their respective optical paths, it is possible to vary the ratio of the visible light component to the infrared light component of the illumination light source using the adjustment means during the subject eye observation period in which the fundus of the subject eye is observed using the first electronic infrared imaging means and irradiate the fundus of the subject eye with a weak level of visible light promoting bleaching of the visual pigment of the fundus without inducing subject eye pupillary contraction that would impede subsequent natural fluorescence photography.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> Particularly in the non-mydriatic photography method, a weak level of visible light can promote bleaching of the visual pigment of the fundus and provide a brighter fundus image in natural fluorescence photography such as fundus autofluorescence (FAF) photography.</p><heading id="h0009">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustrative view showing the configuration of a mydriatic/non-mydriatic integrated ophthalmologic photography apparatus employing the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is an illustrative view showing the transmission properties of an exciter filter and a barrier filter used in fundus autofluorescence (FAF) photography;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is an illustrative view showing the configuration of a non-mydriatic ophthalmologic photography apparatus employing the present invention;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> is an illustrative view showing the detailed configuration of an illumination system of infrared light LED and visible light LED in the ophthalmologic photography apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> is an illustrative view showing a configuration including switching between exciter filters having different transmittance for visible light and infrared light; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart showing a fundus autofluorescence (FAF) photography procedure using the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> ophthalmologic photography apparatus employing the present invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">Mode of Carrying Out the Invention</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention will be described in detail hereafter with reference to the embodiments shown in the drawings.</p><heading id="h0011">Embodiments</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> shows a fundus camera as an embodiment of the ophthalmologic photography apparatus employing the present invention capable of photographing the fundus in a non-mydriatic photography mode and a mydriatic photography mode.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The fundus camera shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> performs fluorescein angiography in mydriatic photography mode, as well as fundus autofluorescence (FAF) photography (natural fluorescence photography), infrared observation/photography, and indocyanine green angiography (ICG) in non-mydriatic photography mode.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The lower part of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the configuration of an illumination optical system for projecting illumination light from an illumination light source (lamps LA, LA' ) onto the fundus of a subject eye.

This promotes the bleaching of the visual pigment of the fundus of the subject eye, enhancing fundus autofluorescence and allowing a bright FAF image to be taken.</p><heading id="h0012">Key to the Symbols</heading><p id="p0092" num="0092"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>LA, LA'</dt><dd>Lamp</dd><dt>L1, L1'</dt><dd>Condenser lens</dd><dt>M2</dt><dd>Reflection mirror</dd><dt>L3, L4</dt><dd>Relay lens</dd><dt>M4, M5,</dt><dd>M6 Return mirror</dd><dt>L5</dt><dd>Objective</dd><dt>L6</dt><dd>Focus lens</dd><dt>L7</dt><dd>Imaging lens</dd><dt>L8</dt><dd>Eyepiece</dd><dt>L9, L11</dt><dd>Lens</dd><dt>L20</dt><dd>Lens<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --></dd><dt>117</dt><dd>Working dot light source</dd><dt>121</dt><dd>Switching operation means</dd><dt>122</dt><dd>Switching unit</dd><dt>123</dt><dd>Display unit</dd><dt>124</dt><dd>Recording device</dd><dt>125</dt><dd>LAN</dd><dt>126</dt><dd>Personal computer (PC)</dd><dt>130</dt><dd>Timer</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>Subject eye</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>Barrier filter BF</dd><dt>10</dt><dd>Main unit</dd><dt>13</dt><dd>Exciter filter</dd><dt>14</dt><dd>Strobe light</dd><dt>15</dt><dd>Diffuser plate</dd><dt>16</dt><dd>Ring slit</dd><dt>17</dt><dd>Lens</dd><dt>18</dt><dd>Black-spot plate</dd><dt>19</dt><dd>Half mirror</dd><dt>20</dt><dd>Relay lens</dd><dt>21</dt><dd>Perforated reflection mirror</dd><dt>22</dt><dd>Objective</dd><dt>30</dt><dd>Focus dot light source</dd><dt>31</dt><dd>Photography aperture</dd><dt>32</dt><dd>Focus lens</dd><dt>33</dt><dd>Imaging lens</dd><dt>34</dt><dd>Half mirror<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --></dd><dt>35</dt><dd>Field stop</dd><dt>36</dt><dd>Mirror</dd><dt>37</dt><dd>Imaging lens</dd><dt>40</dt><dd>CCD</dd><dt>41</dt><dd>Monitor</dd><dt>42</dt><dd>Anterior ocular segment lens</dd><dt>43</dt><dd>Internal fixation lamp</dd><dt>46</dt><dd>Shutter</dd><dt>47a</dt><dd>Magnification lens</dd><dt>50</dt><dd>Attachment unit</dd><dt>51</dt><dd>Mount</dd><dt>52</dt><dd>Connector</dd><dt>53</dt><dd>Imaging device</dd><dt>54</dt><dd>Memory</dd><dt>60</dt><dd>Control unit</dd><dt>71, 72</dt><dd>LED</dd><dt>100</dt><dd>Light source unit</dd><dt>101</dt><dd>Board</dd><dt>102, 103</dt><dd>LED</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982769" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An ophthalmologic photography apparatus comprising:
