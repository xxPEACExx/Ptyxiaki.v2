Each of the open X-ray sources described in Patent Literatures 1 to 3 comprises an electron source for emitting an electron beam, a target for generating an X-ray in response to the electron beam incident thereon, an electron path, extending from the electron source to the target, for transmitting the electron beam therethrough, and an electromagnetic coil arranged so as to surround the electron path. These open X-ray sources can open and close the electron path with respect to external atmospheres and vacuum the electron path when closed.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The open X-ray sources described in Patent Literatures 1 to 3 use cooling structures for cooling their targets and electromagnetic coils with water. This inhibits the X-ray from shifting its focal point due to thermal expansions of members constituting the open X-ray sources at the time when they operate and thereby deteriorating characteristics.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Citation List</b></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><heading id="h0004"><b>Patent Literature</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004"><ul><li>Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP6018119A"><text>6-18119</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP7082824A"><text>7-82824</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Literature 3: Japanese Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP3950389B"><text>3950389</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005"><b>Summary of Invention</b></heading><heading id="h0006"><b>Technical Problem</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the open X-ray sources described in Patent Literatures 1 to 3, however, the X-ray focal spot drift caused by thermal expansions of their constituent members may not be suppressed sufficiently in particular in X-ray tubes which are required to be used under microfocus conditions. The reason is as follows.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For achieving a microfocus, not only converging the electron beam but removing its scattered components is very important. Therefore, an aperture unit formed with an aperture is arranged on the electron path so as to remove the scattered components of the electron beam. In this case, the aperture unit may remove as much as 80% to 90% of the electron beam emitted from the electron source, for example. This generates a very large amount of heat in the aperture unit. Hence, cooling the target and electromagnetic coil alone may fail to fully suppress the X-ray focal spot drift caused by thermal expansions of constituent members.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a cooling structure used for the open X-ray source which can effectively remove the heat generated from the aperture unit and securely suppress the X-ray focal spot drift caused by thermal expansions of constituent members due to the heating of the aperture unit in an open X-ray source,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> and an open X-ray source equipped with such a cooling structure.</p><heading id="h0007"><b>Solution to Problem</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">For achieving the above-mentioned object, the cooling structure used for the open X-ray source in accordance with one aspect of the present invention is a cooling structure used for an open X-ray source comprising an electron source for emitting an electron beam, a target for generating an X-ray in response to the electron beam incident thereon, and an electron path, extending from the electron source to the target, for passing the electron beam therethrough, the open X-ray source being adapted to open and close the electron path with respect to an external atmosphere and vacuum the electron path when closed; the cooling structure comprising an aperture unit arranged on the electron path and formed with an aperture for restricting the electron beam from passing therethrough, a holder holding the aperture unit, and a heat dissipator connected to the holder; wherein the heat dissipator has a first heat dissipation member including a first coolant flow path constituent part and a second heat dissipation member including a second coolant flow path constituent part; and wherein the first coolant flow path constituent part and the second coolant flow path constituent part are combined with each other so as to construct a coolant flow path.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In this cooling structure used for the open X-ray source, the coolant flow path is formed in the heat dissipator, whereby the heat generated in the aperture unit propagates to the coolant in the coolant flow path through the holder and heat dissipator. Therefore, the cooling structure used for the open X-ray source can effectively remove the heat generated in the aperture unit and securely suppress the X-ray<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> focal spot drift caused by thermal expansions of constituent members due to the heating of the aperture unit in the open X-ray source.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Here, the aperture unit may be made of a material having a melting point higher than that of the holder, while the holder may be made of a material having a coefficient of thermal conductivity higher than that of the aperture unit. This structure can stably restrict the electron beam from passing through the aperture unit. This also allows the heat generated in the aperture unit to propagate efficiently from the aperture unit to the holder, thereby more securely suppressing the X-ray focal spot drift caused by thermal expansions of constituent members due to the heating of the aperture unit.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The holder may have a flange surrounding the electron path and be in surface contact with the heat dissipator through the flange. This structure can increase the contact area between the holder and heat dissipator, so as to allow the heat generated in the aperture unit to propagate efficiently from the holder to the heat dissipator, thereby more securely suppressing the X-ray focal spot drift caused by thermal expansions of constituent members due to the heating of the aperture unit.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The first heat dissipation member and the second heat dissipation member may be made of the same material. This structure can inhibit the first and second coolant flow path constituent parts from generating a gap therebetween due to the difference between their coefficients of thermal conductivity, so as to securely prevent the coolant from leaking out of the coolant flow path, thereby stably removing the heat generated in the aperture unit.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The first heat dissipation member and the second heat dissipation member may be combined by mating one to the other, while a seal member may be arranged between the first heat dissipation member and the second heat dissipation member in a mating surface thereof.

The electron gun 2 is contained in a cylindrical lower barrel 5 made of stainless steel. The target 3 is formed in a target unit T. The target unit T is detachably attached to an upper end part of a double cylindrical upper barrel 6. The electronic path 4 is provided within the barrels 5, 6 so as to extend from the electron gun 2 to the target 3.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The upper barrel 6 is vertically disposed on the lower barrel 5 through a hinge 7. In this state, an upper end opening 5a of the lower barrel 5 is closed with a lower wall 8 of the upper barrel 6. In the X-ray generator 1, the upper barrel 6 may be tilted with respect to the lower barrel 5 through the hinge 7 (see the dash-double-dot line in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>), so as to open the upper opening 5a of the lower barrel 5, thereby allowing a filament unit F arranged within a grid unit 9 of the electron gun 2 to be replaced.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A vacuum pump 11 for producing a high vacuum state in the electron path 4 is connected to the side wall 5b of the lower barrel 5. As a consequence, the electron path 4 can be vacuumed in a state closed to external atmospheres after replacing the target unit T and filament unit F, though it is opened to the external atmospheres when replacing the target unit T and filament unit F.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A mold power supply unit 12 integrated with the electron gun 2 is airtightly secured to a lower opening 5c of the lower barrel 5. The mold power supply unit 12 is one in which a high voltage generator<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> and the like are molded with an electrically insulating resin and has a rectangular parallelepiped main unit 12a located under the lower barrel 5 and a cylindrical neck 12b projecting from the main unit 12a into the lower barrel 5.

For example, water is caused to circulate through the coolant flow path 22 as a liquid coolant at the time when the X-ray generator 1 operates. As a consequence, even if the electromagnetic coil 21 generates heat upon energization at the time when the X-ray generator 1 operates, the heat generated in the electromagnetic coil 21 will propagate to water in the coolant flow path 22 through the bobbin 19.

This condition is satisfied when the aperture unit 31 is made of molybdenum and holder 34 is made of copper or a copper alloy, for example. The heat dissipation member 37 and heat dissipation member 38 are made of the same material, an example of which is brass.

The emitted electron beam E is converged by the electromagnetic coil 21 and narrowed by the aperture 33 during when passing through the electron path 4, so as to be made incident on the target 3 of the target unit T.

The reason is as follows.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">For achieving a microfocus, not only converging the electron beam E but removing its scattered components is very important. Therefore, the aperture unit 31 arranged on the electron path 4 may remove as much as 80% to 90% of the electron beam E emitted from the electron gun 2, for example. That is, the amount of heat generated in the aperture unit becomes very large in order to achieve the microfocus.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In the X-ray generator 1, not only the heat generated in the electromagnetic coil 21 and target unit T is removed by the coolant flow paths 22, 29, but the heat generated in the aperture unit 31 is effectively<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> cooled by the aperture cooling structure 10. Hence, the X-ray generator 1 can securely inhibit the X-ray from shifting the focal point due to thermal expansions of constituent members at the time when it operates and thereby deteriorating characteristics. Even when required to emit the X-ray at a microfocus, the X-ray generator 1 can securely suppress the X-ray focal spot drift and thus can favorably be used in X-ray CT systems. The coolant flow path 43 is directly formed in the heat dissipator 36 and thus exhibits a high heat dissipation effect. The coolant flow path 43, which forms a tubular structure by combining the coolant flow path constituent part 41 of the heat dissipation member 37 and the coolant flow path constituent part 42 of the heat dissipation member 38 with each other, has a high degree of freedom in designing concerning size, number, form, and the like and can be manufactured easily.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The aperture unit 31 is made of a material having a melting point higher than that of the holder 34, while the holder 34 is made of a material having a coefficient of thermal conductivity higher than that of the aperture unit 31.
