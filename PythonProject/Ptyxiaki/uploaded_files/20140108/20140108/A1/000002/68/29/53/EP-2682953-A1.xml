Therefore, with the simple structure shown in the right diagram of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3(a)</figref> described above, the transmission quality is degraded since the transmission loss is large, crosstalk between signal lines is large, and the influence of internal and external noise is easily received.

Here, also in the structure shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4(a)</figref>, as described above, in the transmission cable according to the embodiment of the present invention, the first conductor 611 and the second conductors (units) 710, 720, and 730 that are ultrafine electric wires are disposed so as to be adjacent to each other with the dielectric 613 interposed therebetween. Accordingly, since the distance between the first conductor 611 equivalent to the central conductor and each of the second conductors (units) 710, 720, and 730 equivalent to the outer conductor is significantly reduced, the strength of the electric field is greatly increased and electrical<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> coupling becomes strong. As a result, since losses due to radiation other than the radiation between conductors and the like are reduced, the degradation of transmission quality is suppressed. In addition, since the first coated conductor unit shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4(a)</figref> and other first coated conductor units (not shown) are disposed so as to be separated from each other by the second conductors (units) 710, 720, and 730, the distance between the first conductors is increased by setting the diameters of the second conductors (units) 710, 720, and 730 to approximately the same diameter of the first coated conductor unit.

In the configuration of the present invention, each condition (type or outer diameter of the dielectric, outer diameter of the outer conductor, and the like) is set such that the characteristic impedance determined in this signal line is obtained. The characteristic impedance of the signal line<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> of the present invention corresponds to the characteristic impedance of the conventional coaxial cable (However, in the differential configuration according to the third embodiment of the present invention to be described later, a signal line is formed by first coated conductor units as a pair, and each condition (outer diameter of the dielectric and the like)is set such that the characteristic impedance determined in the signal line is obtained).</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In addition, for example, in the structure shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4(a)</figref>, in order to further reduce the losses due to external radiations other than the radiation between conductors and the like, it is effective to coat the outer periphery of the cable with the shielding material 300 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4(b)</figref>. According to this configuration, since the radiation to the outside is suppressed by the shielding material 300, it is possible to prevent the degradation of transmission quality effectively. As such a shielding material, a metal deposited tape or a conductive tape obtained by depositing metal foil or metal on the tape can be considered.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In addition, as a third feature of the transmission cable according to the embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4(c)</figref>, the interference between a plurality of first conductors equivalent to the central<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> conductor is very low even though a plurality of first conductors equivalent to the central conductor in each coaxial cable and a plurality of second conductors (unit) equivalent to the outer conductor in each coaxial cable are disposed adjacent to each other in a non-coaxial manner in one cable. The reason is as follows. As shown by the arrow R in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4(c)</figref>, the distance between the first conductors (between the center and the central conductor) increases more as they are spaced apart from each other according to an increase in the thickness of both dielectrics than the distance between the first conductor and the second conductor (between the center and the outer conductor) increases. Accordingly, since the strengths of the electric fields are different, the interference is reduced. In addition, in the present invention, the second conductor (unit) has approximately the same diameter as the first coated conductor unit. Accordingly, since conductor resistance is small compared with a case where the diameter of the second conductor (unit) is smaller than the diameter of the first coated conductor unit, it is possible to further increase the potential difference.

More specifically, the inner portion 51 is divided into a central portion 51A and a peripheral portion 51B. In the central portion 51A, units A to D formed by four power lines [AWG 44] and four coaxial cables [AWG 46] 1 to 4 on both the sides are disposed.

In addition, an ALPET tape T1 is wound around the peripheral portion 51B, and the outer portion 53 is formed around the ALPET tape T1. In addition, an ALPET tape T2 is also wound around the outer portion 53, a braided shield layer SL is coated on the outer peripheral surface side of the ALPET tape T2, and a PFA sheath PS is further coated on the outer peripheral surface side of the braided shield layer SL. As a result, the entire multi-core transmission cable 700 is formed in the outer diameter φ of 1.9 mm. Therefore, since it is possible to configure an ultrafine transmission cable while including these signal lines and the like, it can pass through the space with the outer diameter φ of 1.95 mm.
