Especially where the sports event is transmitted on television the resulting advertising effect is recognisable, as a potentially large number of people is exposed to the advertisement.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">When transmitting team sports, e.g. football, American football, handball, basketball, ice hockey from a sports arena a number of television cameras are usually positioned around the playing field. The game can be transmitted to viewers of each team in a way such that cameras on one side of the field are transmitting to supporters of one team whereas the cameras on the other side of the field are transmitting to supporters of the other team.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Advertising panels on each side of the field may therefore be directed towards supporters of each team. For example during international events the advertising panels on one side of the field is therefore showing advertisements relevant for and perhaps even in the language of supporters of one team and advertising panels on the other side of the field is showing advertisements relevant for and perhaps even in the language of supporters of the other team.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">From the viewpoint of a camera on one side of the field an advertisement facing the playing field on advertising panels on the opposite side of the field is visible to the camera,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> while an advertisement facing the playing field on advertising panels on the same side of the field is hidden to the camera.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, advertising panels at either end of the field is visible from the cameras on both sides of the field. Therefore the advertisement will be transmitted to the supporters of both teams.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20030173772A"><text>US 2003/0173772</text></patcit> describes an advertisement print that is optimised for at least two viewpoints. The advertisement is printed on a substantially plane print carrier. The print is a transformation of a three-dimensional element having a number of visible sides defined by a first and second viewpoint. The print comprises a first part being a perspective projection of one side of the three-dimensional element to the print carrier based on the line of sight from the first viewpoint. A second part is a perspective projection of a second side of the three-dimensional element to the print carrier based on the line of sight from the second viewpoint. The print can be viewed from both viewpoints. A perspective transformation will take place and the viewer will interpret the print as three-dimensional. Text, logos and other images can be printed on the carrier, such that they will appear to be positioned on the sides of the three-dimensional element.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is a drawback of the advertisement print in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20030173772A"><text>US 2003/0173772</text></patcit> that, although a striking effect is achieved from both viewpoints, the advertisement would have to be relevant to the television viewers on both sides of the field. In sport events, e.g. international sport events the advertisers may have different text, figures or other information targeted towards local television viewers. This cannot be achieved on the advertisement print according to <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US20030173772A"><text>US 2003/0173772</text></patcit> without being visible to all viewers.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Another drawback of the advertisement print in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US20030173772A"><text>US 2003/0173772</text></patcit> is that the advertisement space at either end of the playing field would have to be shared between advertisers relevant to the viewers on both sides.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Object of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to provide a means of advertising that solves the above mentioned problems.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0004"><b>Description of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the present invention, this is achieved by an advertisement element having an underside adapted for positioning on a surface and an upper side comprising an advertisement surface with advertisement information. The advertisement surface comprises a plurality of protrusions. Each protrusion comprises a first display surface with graphics applied to the surface, said surface and graphics being visible from, i.e. oriented towards, a first predefined viewpoint and a second display surface with graphics applied to the surface, said surface and said graphics being visible from, i.e. oriented towards, a second predefined viewpoint. The advertisement information comprises a first image composed of graphics on the first display surfaces and a second image composed of graphics on the second display surfaces.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The term "oriented towards" refer to the image being optimised for viewing from a predefined viewpoint. The image may be visible from other positions, but the intended experience is available at the predefined viewpoint. This may be done by transforming the image, such that the experience of a viewer located in the predefined viewpoint will be optimised or with a perpendicular arrangement between a surface and a viewing angle, such as a viewing angle to or from a predefined viewpoint.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Moreover this is achieved by a method of capturing advertisement images. The method includes positioning a first image capturing device in a first predefined viewpoint and a second image capturing device in a second predefined viewpoint, positioning an advertisement element in the line-of-sight of the first and second image capturing device, such that the first image is visible from the first predefined viewpoint and such that the second image is visible from the second predefined viewpoint, and capturing the first and/or second image by means of the first and/or second image capturing device respectively. Herein, the term "visible from" a particular viewpoint may encompass the requirement that the image is optimised for being viewed from that viewpoint or from a viewing angle corresponding to that viewpoint.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Furthermore this is achieved by a method of creating an advertisement element. The method includes establishing the relative positions of the advertising element and a first and second predefined viewpoint, preparing the advertising element based on said relative positions to form the first image and the second image, such that each image appear coherent when viewed from the first predefined viewpoint or the second predefined viewpoint, respectively.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the present application the term "coherent" is used to describe an image that although it is composed of a plurality of smaller fragments, i.e. tiles with graphics applied to them and applied to the protrusions, appear as a single unbroken image without gaps, when viewed from a respective predefined viewpoint.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">It is herewith achieved that two images can be displayed on the same advertisement element, in such a way that when viewed from one of the two predefined viewpoints the advertisement element appear to display only one coherent image.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In this context, a "predefined viewpoint" may signify a viewpoint from which a relevant image appears optimised, coherent and/or fully resolved. It will be appreciated that when one image is viewed along an angle for which it appears optimised, then the other image or images on the advertising element will not be visible.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the present application the term "image" means the graphic information as it appears to a viewer or image capturing device located at the respective predefined viewpoints. The graphic information may comprise photos, graphics, text etc. An image may comprise a plurality of smaller images each providing its own separate advertisement information.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Moreover it is achieved that the same advertisement element can display the first image directed towards the first predefined viewpoint and the second image directed towards the second predefined viewpoint on what would appear to be the same region of the advertisement element when viewed from either predefined viewpoint.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">It is therefore possible to fill the entire surface area next to or on a playing field with advertisements directed towards the first and second predefined viewpoint at the same time.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">When viewing the advertisements according to the invention next to or on the playing field, they visually appear as all being directed towards the predefined viewpoint. Advertisers relevant to the predefined viewpoint on only one side of the playing field can share the same advertisement space at either end of or on the playing field as other advertisers relevant to the predefined viewpoint on the other side of the playing field.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A person can be present as a viewer in the predefined viewpoint.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The invention is especially relevant when an image capturing device is located in each predefined viewpoint.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Examples of image capturing devices are television cameras, video cameras and photographic cameras.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In an embodiment of the advertisement element the advertisement element is a substantially plane element with a flat underside that is adapted for positioning on a substantially flat surface for example a playing field.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In an embodiment of the advertisement element the advertisement element is an advertisement carpet that can be rolled out with the underside supported on the surface.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">When the advertisement carpet is not in use the carpet may be rolled back into a roll and removed from the flat surface for storage elsewhere. The surface may be flat, for example a concrete surface, substantially flat, for example grass, or having a plurality of areas that may be angled in relation to each other. Moreover the surface may be curved, which is advantageous for example in relation to motor sports and track cycling.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">During the design of the advertisement element, the shape and properties of the surface that the advertisement element is positioned on may be taken into account, such that the appearance of the advertisement information is not distorted.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The advertisement element has an upper side comprising an advertisement surface where the advertisement information is displayed. The advertisement information may for example be company logos, images, statements etc.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A plurality of protrusions is formed on the advertisement surface. Each protrusion has a first display surface. Graphics are applied to each first display surface. The protrusions are configured such that the graphics that are applied to the first display surface is visible from the first predefined viewpoint. The graphics on the first display surfaces when combined will form the first image. The first image is coherent when viewed from the first predefined viewpoint.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In order to create the first image it first has to be pre-processed based on the configuration of the protrusions. Pre-processing includes dividing the first image into tiles. Each tile is adapted for being applied to a specific protrusion. The adaptation of each tile is based on the shape of the protrusion and its position on the advertisement element, such that when all tiles are applied to the display surfaces of the first protrusions, the graphics of each tile will combine to display a first image. In other words each tile will connect to the next tile on an adjacent protrusion. The first image will appear as a coherent image, when viewed from the first predefined viewpoint.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Each protrusion has a second display surface. Graphics are applied to each second display surface as described for the first display surface above, such that the second image will appear as a coherent image, when viewed from the second predefined viewpoint.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In an embodiment of the advertisement element according to the invention the protrusions has a uniform cross-sectional profile and extend across the advertisement element.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The protrusions form ridges and valleys on the advertisement element.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In an embodiment of the advertisement element according to the invention the graphics are applied by printing directly onto the first and/or second display surface. This will provide a static first and second image.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In an embodiment of the advertisement element according to the invention the graphics are applied by printing on a print carrier and applying the print carrier to the first and/or second display surface. This will provide a static first and second image.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The print carrier may have a size corresponding to a tile, such that a number of print carriers are applied to form the complete advertisement element.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The print carrier may have a size corresponding to the combined surface area of the first and second display surfaces, such that the print carrier can be applied to the advertisement element as a single piece. The print carrier is folded to follow the surface contour of the advertisement element defined by the protrusions.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In an embodiment of the advertisement element according to the invention the graphics are applied to the first surface and/or second display surface by means of a non-permanent display means. Examples of such non-permanent display means are LCD-displays and LED/OLED-displays.
