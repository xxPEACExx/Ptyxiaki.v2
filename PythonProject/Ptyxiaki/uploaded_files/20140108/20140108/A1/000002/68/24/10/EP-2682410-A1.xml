More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of producing a laminate film which can yield a laminate film having excellent adhesion with a laminate base material and reduce the amount of an anchor coating agent or an adhesive for dry lamination to be used.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Further, the present invention also relates to a method of producing a resin composition for a coated member which comprises a polymer obtained by polymerization of a monomer having an ethylenically unsaturated bond and a thermoplastic elastomer. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of producing a resin composition for a coated member, by which a resin composition for a coated member, which shows excellent adhesion with a coating film after a plasma treatment and can have suppressed yellowing, can be produced.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">As the use of a laminate film, packaging materials utilizing a film made of a thermoplastic resin have been conventionally proposed, and there are known laminate films in which an olefin resin film is laminated on a laminate base material of polyester, polyamide, metallic foil or the like by press-adhesion with heating (heat sealing) or application of an adhesive. Among olefin resins, in particular, polyethylene is widely used in the food packaging material applications since it is inexpensive and easily processable and exhibits excellent blocking of water vapor.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, an olefin resin itself is inert and has poor adhesive force; therefore, for example, in Patent Document 1, a method of producing a laminate film by subjecting the surface of a laminate base material to an anchor coating treatment with an anchoring agent such as a polyurethane or an isocyanate compound and then<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> laminating an ozone-treated olefin resin thereon is proposed.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">There have been also proposed several methods of producing a laminate film without using an anchor coating agent and, for example, in Patent Document 2, a method of improving the adhesion of a film by subjecting the film to an ozone treatment under a specific condition is disclosed.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">By the way, olefin resins have poor stability against heat and light and are thus easily oxidized/degraded when exposed to a high-temperature environment or a strong light, so that the service life required as a plastic product cannot be attained. In order to prevent such oxidation/degradation, a stabilizer such as a phenolic antioxidant, a phosphorus-based antioxidant, a sulfur-based antioxidant, a hydroxylamine compound, a hindered amine compound, an ultraviolet absorber or an acid scavenger is commonly added. In particular, a phenolic antioxidant is widely utilized because of its high thermostability effect in high-temperature processing.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Examples of a method of adding a stabilizer to an olefin resin include a method in which an olefin resin obtained by polymerization of an olefin monomer and is mixed with a stabilizer and the resulting mixture is melt-kneaded using a processing equipment such as an extruder to disperse the stabilizer in the olefin resin; and a method in which a stabilizer is added before or during polymerization of an olefin monomer. Such a method of blending an olefin resin and a stabilizer by melt-kneading has a problem in that the stabilizer must be added in an amount more than necessary in order to mitigate the defective dispersion of the stabilizer in the olefin resin.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">As a method of adding a stabilizer before or during polymerization of an olefin monomer, for example, Patent Document 3 discloses a production method in which an α-olefin is polymerized in the presence of a phosphorus-based antioxidant. It is shown that a polymer obtained by polymerizing an α-olefin in the presence of a phosphorus-based antioxidant can attain superior stabilization effect as compared to<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> a case where a phosphorus-based antioxidant is not used at the time of performing polymerization but is added to a polymer obtained by polymerization of an α-olefin.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further, in Patent Document 4, it is shown that, by using a specific phosphorus-based antioxidant at the time of polymerizing an olefin, the polymerization is not inhibited and a polymer in which coloration caused by contact with water is suppressed can be obtained.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Meanwhile, in cases where a phenolic antioxidant-containing stabilizer is added before the polymerization of an olefin monomer, since phenol reduces the catalytic activity of an olefin polymerization catalyst, there are problems that the resulting olefin resin is colored and a desired polymerization cannot be achieved.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Further, while a phenolic antioxidant can provide high thermostability in high-temperature processing of an olefin resin, when a molded article of an olefin resin is immersed in water or a solvent such as alcohol, there are cases where the blended phenolic antioxidant elutes out of the molded article.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As a polymerization method in which a phenolic antioxidant is prevented from reducing the catalytic activity of a polymerization catalyst, for example, in Patent Documents 5 and 6, it is shown that inhibition of a polymerization catalyst can be suppressed by adding a phenolic antioxidant masked with an organoaluminum compound before or during polymerization of a monomer having an ethylenically unsaturated bond.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Moreover, an olefin resin obtained by polymerization of a monomer having an ethylenically unsaturated bond is inexpensive, has a low specific gravity and a high rigidity, exhibits good moldability and thus can be molded into a large molded article; therefore, such an olefin resin has been increasingly utilized in a variety of applications. In automobile applications, the use of such an olefin resin has been expanding to structural members and the like, examples of which include exterior parts such as bumpers; interior parts such as instrument panels and trims; engine<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> room interior components such as fan casings; and a variety of module materials.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In general, such resin compositions used in automobile interior and exterior parts such as bumpers are produced by blending, as required, for example, an olefin resin, an elastomer, an inorganic filler, a pigment such as carbon black, a light stabilizer, an ultraviolet absorber, a hindered phenol-based antioxidant, a phosphorus-based antioxidant, a sulfur-based antioxidant and a lactone-based antioxidant.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Conventionally, bumpers are generally provided as unpainted or completely painted products; however, in recent years, in accordance with design requirements, bumpers have been widely provided in a partially unpainted condition. Therefore, it is demanded not only that a resin composition for a bumper have good weathering resistance and good adhesion with a coating film, but also that the bumper and its coating film be not discolored even when exposed to heat, sunlight and the like.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In general, in order to improve the weathering resistance and photostability of a molded article of an olefin resin, a variety of additives such as an antioxidant, a hindered amine-based light stabilizer and an ultraviolet absorber are blended; however, there is a problem in that such additives blended in an olefin resin are strongly affected by heat and sunlight and diffuse, migrate or bleed out from the resin to a coating film, thereby causing yellowing of the coating film. In particular, it is known that a phenolic antioxidant is converted into quinoline after bleeding out and causes yellowing of a coating film.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In order to inhibit the above-described yellowing of a coating film, for example, a method of preventing diffusion, migration and bleeding-out of additives by overcoating the coating film with an acryl-melamine system, a two-component urethane system, a polyester-melamine system, a polyester-urethane system or the like can be employed; however, even after the overcoating, a coating color of a high brightness (L value of 60 or higher) may cause yellowing of the coating film under<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> natural environment.
