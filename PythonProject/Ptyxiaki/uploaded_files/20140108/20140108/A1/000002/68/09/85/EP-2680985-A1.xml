The present invention also relates to a method of manufacturing such improved screen panels. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Screening panel system for ore screening decks that is now widely used by the mining industry, replaced the earlier screening cloths and large wire screening frames. These screening panels are known to be either of Rubber or Polyurethane with steel reinforcements. It is also known that such panels are manufactured by hot vulcanized method or casting. The panels are adapted to be secured with the support frame of the screen machine by bolting. The panels may also be secured to the frame with an alternate method using a pin and separate lug arrangement. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The screen panels known in the art, as described aforesaid, suffer from the vital disadvantage of degradation of screening efficiency, due to low open area compared to the conventional screen desks. Of course, clogging of screen panels and absence of substantial flexibility are the other deficiencies, which are frequently encountered in the field. Research is on in this area for a considerably long period of time to substantially increase the screening efficiency, simultaneously ensuring prevention of clogging and substantial flexibility for continuous screening. However, significant breakthrough in that perspective is yet to be achieved. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly there was a long felt need to design screen panels for its application in mining and quarrying industries, which have substantially increased screening efficiency and which simultaneously ensure prevention of clogging and substantial flexibility for continuous screening.

 quarrying industries, which have external reinforcement/support with the panel fixing frame under the edge surface of the panel. This ensures substantial increase of screening efficiency of the panel. That apart, this facilitates increasing the number of apertures, whereby high open is ensured. Simultaneously, this also ensures reduction in thickness. Furthermore, due to the high open area and low thickness the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
 weight of polyurethane required to be applied for manufacturing the screen panel is less. Since there is reduction in polyurethane weight, so the cost of production goes down, which ensures its availability at a fairly reasonably low price. The screen panels in accordance with the present invention, nullifies/substantially reduces the drawbacks of the screen panels known in the art, as discussed hereinbefore under the heading "Background of the Invention". </p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The accompanying figure 1, illustrates a preferred embodiment of the screen panel according to the present invention. It shows the panel fixing frame(l) that is bolted/welded to the frame under the screen deck. Conventionally, reinforcements such as steel reinforcements are provided inside the panel. In accordance with the present invention, the reinforcement is kept externally. This increases the screening efficiency. Conventionally, the reinforcements such as but not limited to screen reinforcements, in all screen panels, are bonded to the polyurethane or rubber part chemically. As a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention, the reinforcement is mechanically fixed to the panel by button type fixing. </p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The accompanying figure 2 illustrates a sectional view of the screen panel in accordance with the present invention, along the line A-A in the accompanying figure 1. It also illustrates the external reinforcement(2) which constitutes the crux of the present invention. The accompanying figure 3 illustrates a pictorial view of a preferred embodiment of the screening area polyurethane screen panel of the present invention. </p><p id="p0040" num="0040">As illustrated in the accompanying figures 2 and 3, the edges of the screen panels according to the present invention have been reduced, the gaps between the apertures have been reduced and the central bar wide portion of internal reinforcements as given in conventional types are also reduced. These increase the open area by virtue of the increase in the number of apertures. The thickness of the panels is also as a consequence, substantially reduced. This in turn ensures reduction in mass of polyurethane that is applied to manufacture the screen panels which in turn reduces the manufacturing cost and the cost at which such screen panels are made available to its users. Reduction in cost is also facilitated by clubbing the fixing system and the reinforcement. The apertures are suitably designed to desired shape, for allowing materials of desired size to pass through. The 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
 apertures are made of suitable abrasion resistant material as will be known to persons skilled in the art. </p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The screening device in accordance with the present invention improves the screening efficiency as well as prevents clogging due to the flaring design of the hole shape. Substantial flexibility is also ensured to have continuous screening without clogging due to the absence of internal reinforcement. Thus, not only is the screening efficiency improved to a great extent but also, it provides adequate flexibility. The polyurethane helps to take the impact of the materials coming in contact with the screening surface, whereas the apertures prevent clogging due to the flaring type design. </p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The screen panel in accordance with the present invention is manufactured by hot vulcanizing or casting with rubber or polyurethane having external reinforcement/support with the panel fixing frame under the edge surface of the panel. In this arrangement, the number of apertures are increased to a great extent i.e. open area increased to the highest level compared to any other panel, for which efficiency of the screen deck is enhanced substantially. The screen panels, not being internally reinforced and being less thick weighs less and thus provide adequate flexibility. This helps to have continuous screening which further results in maximum output for the user. </p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The present invention is applicable for all desired shapes of apertures, as required in the industry. The panels may be of different sizes, i.e. - modular type (305x305 mm and 610x300 mm) and larger sizes also. For modular type snap on type fixing, like button type, pin and sleeve type may be provided for mounting on to the screen deck. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Preferably, the screening surface, other than said apertures, are made of any one of or a combination of mild steel, stainless steel, rubber and/or polyurethane with or without steel reinforcing. Preferably, the screen panel comprises of vulcanized material, rubber polyurethane, having external steel reinforcing bars under the edge surface of panel.
