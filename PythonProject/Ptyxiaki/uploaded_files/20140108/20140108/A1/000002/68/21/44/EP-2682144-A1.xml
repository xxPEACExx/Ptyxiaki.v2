Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to an autorotating retraction structure of needle seat components of a safe syringe and more particularly to such a safe syringe wherein after use, a push rod can be broken to leave a portion thereof, a rotating member, and a rotation limiting member in a cylinder so as to prevent the syringe from being used again.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally, all commercially available syringes are provided with no safety device. They can be used repeatedly. Thus, patients may be subject to contamination when inserting a used syringe into the body for blood transfusion or administering medicine. Further, a medical employee or a cleaner can be pricked by the exposed needle if sufficient care is not taken. Thus, it is desirable among people of the art to provide a safe syringe which cannot be used again after use in order to eliminate above drawback of the conventional syringe.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Conventional retractable safe syringes have a needle seat disposed at a forward opening of a head of cylinder by friction fit. Gap may exist between the needle seat and the cylinder head due to thermal expansion. For example, a quick rise of temperature may form a gap between the needle seat and the cylinder head and in turn it may cause leak in medicine dispensing. Alternatively, a quick decrease of temperature may cause jam, thereby preventing the needle and the needle seat from being retracted into the cylinder after the dispensing. As a result, the whole safe syringe is of no use and discarded.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In response to understanding these problems associated with the typical retraction safe syringes, how to develop a syringe needle seat securely positioned in<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the cylinder and increase safety of medical employees in use is desired among consumers. Hopefully, it can be developed by relevant industry and it is also the goals of the relevant art.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">For eliminating defects in the prior art, the invention provides a safe syringe needle retraction structure which significantly improves the needle seat and the cylinder between the appropriate degree of engagement, conveniently allows a retraction movement to a next step, allows an operator to safely one-handed operate, and further increases environmental quality.<br/>

Preferably, the manipulation portion 24, the snapping portion 27, the non-circular portion 28, and the front guide 29 consisting the front portion of the push rod 20 co-axially arranged with the rear portion of the push rod 20 is more suitable for large CC specifications.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">After describing above structure and mechanism, the operation of the invention will now be described as follows:
<ul><li>As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006 f0007">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, under a normal condition the limiting flanges 42 of the rotation limiting member 40 are disposed in the chamber 12 of the cylinder 10 by<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> urging against the internal rotation limit elements 13. Further, the stop element 33 adjacent to the closed end 32 is locked by to the stopper 11. Thus, the rotation limiting member 40, the rotating member 30, and the cylinder 10 are locked together.</li></ul></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The safety mechanism of the hypodermic syringe of the invention after use including operations such as mixing liquid medicines, injections, and retraction will be discussed in detail below: First, pushes the push rod 20 to an appropriate location, this location being at a location where the snapping portion 27 of the push rod 20 is not locked by the snapping element 37 of the rotating member 30. Next, inserts the needle 52 into a vial and pulls the push rod 20 to create vacuum in the vial so as to draw liquid medicine in the vial into the cylinder 10 until a required quantity is reached. Next, separates the syringe and vial. Injects the liquid medicine into a bottle filled with powder medicine if a mixture with the powder medicine is required. Next, sufficiently mixes them in the bottle. Next, pulls back the needle and replaces it with a new injection member 50 having a smaller needle 42. Next, taps the cylinder 10 and slowly pushes the push rod 20 to propel air and an excess quantity of liquid medicine out of the cylinder 10.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The replacement of the injection member 50 is made possible because, as stated above, the limiting flanges 42 of the rotation limiting member 40 are disposed in the chamber 12 of the cylinder 10 by urging against the internal rotation limit elements 13, and the stop element 33 adjacent to the closed end 32 is locked by to the stopper 11, thereby locking the rotation limiting member 40, the rotating member 30, and the cylinder 10 together.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">During the injection, the non-circular portion 28 is secured to the non-circular groove 45 and the ridges 21 are disposed in the grooved rails 61 so that the push rod 20 may move along a straight line in the cylinder 10. The manipulation element 25 is slid on the ramp-like guide 39 to push the rotating member 30 to be disposed in a predetermined angle. Thus, the open end 34 is positioned by the stopper 11 which is<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> in turn not locked by the stop element 33. Thus, the needle seat group A is capable of retracting into the cylinder 10. Further, the snapping portion 27 is pushed to secure to the snapping element 37 so that the needle seat group A can be moved for retraction by the push rod 20. Finally, the needle seat group A and the needle 52 are retracted into the cylinder 10. Also, the flange element 201 is put on the positioning slot 63 for positioning and exposing the breakable portion 22. A medical employee may break the breakable portion 22 to leave a portion thereof, the rotating member 30, and the rotation limiting member 40 in the cylinder 10 so as to prevent the syringe from being used again.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In brief, the hypodermic syringe of the invention employs an automatic rotation retraction structure of a needle seat group, a rotating member, a push rod, a cylinder, and an injection member which cooperate one another to change from a locked position to an unlocked position. After use, the push rod 20 and the needle seat group A can be quickly positioned to facilitate next retracting steps, retracting the needle 52 into the cylinder 10. Advantageously, the needle seat group A can be assembled securely in the cylinder 10 without the adverse effects of the changing ambient temperature such as a loose coupling of the needle seat and the cylinder due to quick temperature change. Further, the invention allows a convenient retraction movement to a next step, allows an operator to safely one-handed operate, and further increases environmental quality.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">While the invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modifications within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982607" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A hypodermic syringe, comprising:
