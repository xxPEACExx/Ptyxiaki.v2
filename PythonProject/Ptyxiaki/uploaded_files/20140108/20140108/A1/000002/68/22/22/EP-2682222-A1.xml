The fixation and electric connection between the electronic components and the board are mainly performed by the soldering. On such a board, ion migration (electrochemical migration) may occur in the soldered portion between the terminal of the electronic component and the electrode of the board because of such causes that any droplets are adhered to the electrodes to which direct voltage is applied.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The ion migration (hereinafter, referred to as "migration") is a phenomenon such that in the electrodes to which direct voltage is applied, metallic ions dissolved from an anode receives electron at a cathode so that resolved metal grows at the cathode to extend to the anode and by the reduced metal, both electrodes are short-circuited. Thus, when the migration occurs, the function of the board is lost because the electrodes are short-circuited.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The flux used for the soldering generally has such an efficacy that metallic oxides on the solder and a metallic surface of the subject to be soldered are chemically removed at a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> temperature in which the solder is melted and metallic elements can be shifted across a boundary of both. By using the flux, any intermetallic compounds can be formed between the solder and the metallic surface of the subject to be soldered so that they can be strongly connected.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The solder paste is a composite material that is formed by mixing the solder powder and the flux. The solder paste is applied to a portion, electrodes of the board such as a printed circuit board, terminals and the like, to be soldered by means of a printing method or a discharge method. Any components are mounted on the soldered portion thereof to which the solder paste is applied. The soldering is performed so that the board is heated in a heating furnace called as "reflow furnace" to fuse the solder.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The flux contains any components which are not dissolved nor evaporated by heating of the soldering so that they remain around a soldered portion as residue of flux after the soldering. As one of the causes of occurrence of the above-mentioned migration, a fact such that any droplets are adhered to the electrodes is mentioned. Since rosin contained in the flux as main component has water break quality, if the residue of flux containing the rosin as the main component is formed on the soldered portion, any migration does not immediately occur because the water break quality of the rosin even when any droplets are adhered to the residue of flux.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">When, however, the residue of flux is cracked, water is permeated from the cracked portion of the residue of flux into the residue of flux and this water is a cause of occurrence of the migration.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Accordingly, a measure for the migration occurring based on any droplets or the like has been taken from the past by building a structure of the board so as to have a structure for<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> avoiding adhering any droplets to a soldered surface. On the other hand, a moisture-proof coating has been performed on the soldered surface.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">On the other hand, a technology of controlling occurrence of the migration in the residue of flux and adding fatty acid ester into the flux has been proposed (For example, see Patent Document 1).</p><heading id="h0003">[DOCUMENT FOR PRIOR ART]</heading><heading id="h0004">[PATENT DOCUMENT]</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPH11077376B"><text>H11-077376</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">[SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION]</heading><heading id="h0006">[PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION]</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">When adding fatty acid ester of glycerin to the flux, it is possible to make the residue of flux ductile and it is possible to suppress occurrence of any crack in the residue of flux even when the soldered portion after the soldering is exposed to any inferior circumstances.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Even if the residue of flux is ductile, however, it is impossible to suppress occurrence of the migration based on any causes other than the permeable cause by the crack in the residue. Namely, as such other causes of the occurrence of migration, under a situation of high temperature and high humidity, a decrease of insulation resistance in the residue of flux by moisture absorption of the residue thereof and an adhesion of absorbed water to the electrodes are mentioned.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Even if the residue of flux is ductile and this prevents water from being permeated by the crack in the residue of flux, it is impossible to control the occurrence of migration based on,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> under such a situation of high temperature and high humidity, the decrease of insulation resistance in the residue of flux by moisture absorption of the residue thereof, an adhesion of absorbed water to the electrodes based on the moisture absorption of the residue of flux and the like.

They have found out a fact such that by adding the phosphoric acid ester to the flux which is mixed with the solder powder to produce the solder paste, the phosphoric acid ester is adsorbed to a surface of the metal such as solder during the soldering to form a film having any hydrophobic quality.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">This invention relates to flux which is mixed with solder powder to produce the solder paste, the flux containing an amount of phosphoric acid ester, which is adsorbed to a surface of a soldered portion on which residue of flux is formed during the soldering to form a film having hydrophobic quality.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> It is preferable that an addition amount of phosphoric acid ester is not less than 1 % through less than 30 %. It is to be noted that % is mass% unless otherwise specified. Further, it is preferable that the phosphoric acid ester is any one of (2-ethylhexyl) phosphate, monoisodecyl phosphate, monobutyl phosphate, dibutyl phosphate, monolauryl phosphate, monostearyl phosphate, monooleyl phosphate, tetracosyl phosphate or bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate.</p><heading id="h0008">[EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION]</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to the flux of the present invention, by adding the phosphoric acid ester having adsorption capacity to any metal thereto, when the flux of the present invention is mixed with the solder powder to produce the solder paste and by using the solder paste to perform the soldering, the residue of flux is formed, the phosphoric acid ester is adsorbed to a metallic surface of the soldered portion on which the residue of flux is formed so that a film having hydrophobic quality is formed.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Accordingly, the film of phosphoric acid ester having hydrophobic quality, which is absorbed to the soldered portion, prevents any droplets from being adhered to the soldered portion on which the residue of flux is formed. When the soldered portion is exposed to any inferior circumstances and the residue of flux is cracked, it is possible to prevent the droplets from being adhered to the soldered portion, which allows the occurrence of migration because of adhesion of droplets or the like to be suppressed.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Further, even when the residue of flux absorbs moisture under a circumference of high temperature and high humidity and the insulation resistance of the residue of flux is decreased or even when water is adhered because of the moisture absorption of the residue of flux, the film of phosphoric acid ester having hydrophobic quality, which is absorbed to the soldered portion, can suppress the occurrence of migration. Accordingly, the board soldered by using<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the solder paste in which the flux according to this invention is mixed and an electronic device on which this board is mounted can realize higher reliability.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Further, since the phosphoric acid ester added to the flux obtains an effect of preventing the migration from occurring, any structure of preventing droplets from being adhered and/or the moisture-proof coating, which have been previously required to the board, are unnecessary so that the costs required for assembling may be decreased.</p><heading id="h0009">[EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION]</heading><p id="p0023" num="0023">The flux according to these embodiments is mixed with the solder powder to produce a solder paste. The flux according to these embodiments contains phosphoric acid ester which adsorbs to a surface of metal such as the solder during the soldering. As the phosphoric acid ester, any one of (2-ethylhexyl) phosphate, monoisodecyl phosphate, monobutyl phosphate, dibutyl phosphate, monolauryl phosphate, monostearyl phosphate, monooleyl phosphate, tetracosyl phosphate or bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate is preferable.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The flux contains any components which are not dissolved nor evaporated by heating of the soldering so that the residue of flux is formed after the soldering so as to cover the soldered portion. Further, in the solder paste according to the embodiment in which a predetermined amount of phosphoric acid ester is added to the flux, the phosphoric acid ester is not evaporated at the heating temperature of the soldering time and adsorbs to the surface of metal such as the solder and the electrode soldered by the solder so that a film having hydrophobic quality is formed on the surface of the soldered portion.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">This film blocks any contact between the droplet and the metal, which suppresses occurrence of the migration. If the soldered portion is exposed under inferior circumstance such as circumstance in which there is a large change in temperature, circumstance in which<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> changes in temperature are repeated, circumstance in which it is shocked while the residue of flus exists on the soldered portion, it is possible to prevent water from being directly contacted to any metallic portion of the soldered portion because the surface of the soldered portion is covered by the hydrophobic film even if the residue of flux is cracked and water is permeated thereto.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Even when the residue of flux absorbs moisture under a circumference of high temperature and high humidity and the insulation resistance of the residue of flux is decreased or even when water is adhered to the electrodes because of the moisture absorption of the residue of flux, it is possible to prevent water from being directly contacted to any metallic portion of the soldered portion because the surface of the soldered portion is covered by the film having hydrophobic quality. This enables the occurrence of migration to be suppressed.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Here, based on an addition amount of phosphoric acid ester, aspects of the residue of flux vary.
