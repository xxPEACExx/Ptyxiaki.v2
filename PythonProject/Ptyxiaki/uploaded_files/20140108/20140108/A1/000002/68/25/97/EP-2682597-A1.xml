A wind turbine generator rotates wind turbine blades around its axis by wind and converts this rotation force into electric power so as to attain power output.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Power output of a wind turbine generator is expressed by a product of shaft end output (output generated by blades) and conversion efficiency (efficiencies of bearings and a generator, and the like). The shaft end output is expressed by the following formula, and a blade having high blade efficiency and a greater diameter enhances electric power generation.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mi>Shaft end output</mi><mo>=</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn><mo>×</mo><mi>Air density</mi><mo>×</mo><msup><mi>Wind speed</mi><mo>∧</mo></msup><mo>⁢</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">3</mn><mo>×</mo><mi>Blade efficiency</mi><mo>×</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">π</mi><mo>×</mo><msup><mfenced separators=""><mi>Blade diameter</mi><mo>/</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></mfenced><mo>∧</mo></msup><mo>⁢</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="156" he="17" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Blade efficiency has a logical upper limit (Betz limit = 0.593). Actually, the upper limit of blade efficiency is approximately 0.5 because of (1) efficiency loss due to swirl (rotation) of a blade wake, (2) efficiency loss due to air resistance on a blade section, and (3) efficiency loss due to a wing tip vortex. In the above (1), the loss can be reduced by setting the rotational torque to be smaller according to the law of conservation of angular momentum (i.e. by accelerating the rotational frequency). On the other hand, in the above (2), as the rotational frequency becomes higher, the loss due to air resistance tends to become greater. Therefore, there is a conflict relationship between the above (1) and the above (2), and it is difficult to cope with both.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, the above (3) can be improved by modifying the blade tip shape, so as to enhance the efficiency.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The following Patent Literature 1 discloses an improved blade tip shape.

A chord of blade may be used instead of the center line.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The CANT angle is preferably set to be 25° or more and 35° or less.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The wind turbine blade according to the first aspect of the present invention includes a tip end located on a tip side thereof, having a substantially linear blade axial line; and a bent portion located on a base end side thereof and bent relative to the adjacent portion, and the bent portion is bent gradually so as to satisfy the CANT angle.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The bent portion is configured to be bent gradually so as<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> to satisfy the CANT angle. Specifically, the winglet is formed to be bent not sharply but smoothly and continuously relative to the adjacent portion. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent great bending stress from being caused onto the bent portion.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the wind turbine blade according to the first aspect of the present invention, a CANT position that is a start position where the winglet is started to be bent relative to the adjacent portion is set to be 97.0%R or more and 98.5%R or less, where a blade diameter is set to be R when the CANT angle of the winglet is 0.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The CANT position is configured to be 97.0%R or more and 98.5%R or less, thereby enhancing the performance of the wind turbine blade and/or reducing the blade root moment.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the wind turbine blade according to the first aspect of the present invention, the winglet is bent toward a pressure side of the blade when the wind turbine blade is located on an up-wind side of a wind turbine tower.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the case of an up-wind wind turbine in which the wind turbine blade is located on the up-wind side of the wind turbine tower, the winglet is configured to be bent toward the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> pressure side of the blade. Therefore, the tip of the winglet is disposed apart from the wind turbine tower, so that the winglet can be prevented from coming into contact with the wind turbine tower, thereby enhancing the safety.

Accordingly, the tip of the winglet is disposed apart from the wind turbine tower, so that the winglet can be prevented from coming into contact with the wind turbine tower, thereby enhancing the safety. Further, since the wind turbine blade is configured to be used in a down-wind wind turbine, the weather vane effect (tracking performance to the wind direction) can be enhanced so as to reduce load caused on the wind turbine blade and the wind<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> turbine tower.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The wind turbine generator according to a second aspect of the present invention includes any one of the above described turbine blades, a rotor connected to a blade root side of the wind turbine blade and being rotated by the wind turbine blade, and a generator for converting rotation force obtained by the rotor into electric output.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The wind turbine generator is provided with the above described wind turbine blade, so that it is possible to enhance the performance and/or reduce the blade root moment of the wind turbine blade, thereby realizing enhancement of the power output and/or enhancement of the reliability.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A design method of a wind turbine blade according to a third aspect of the present invention is provided with a winglet whose tip side is bent toward a suction side of the blade or a pressure side of the blade relative to an adjacent portion adjacent on a blade root side, wherein the design method configures the winglet to have a greater blade diameter than a CANT position that is a start position where the winglet is started to be bent relative to the adjacent portion, and determines a CANT angle so as to enhance torque generated by the wind turbine blade and decrease moment caused<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> on the blade root of the wind turbine blade, compared to a reference blade having the CANT angle of 0, in which the CANT angle is defined by a blade axial line of the winglet relative to a radial extrapolation line of a blade axial line of the adjacent portion.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">If the performance is evaluated for the reference blade having the blade diameter equal to the CANT position, it is obvious that the performance is enhanced since a winglet is added to the reference blade so that the blade diameter becomes increased. In such a method, the effect achieved by the winglet cannot be accurately evaluated. Therefore, the present embodiment specifies the CANT angle at which the torque (i.e. performance) becomes increased and the blade root moment becomes decreased not relative to the reference blade having the blade diameter equal to the CANT position, but relative to the reference blade having the greater blade diameter than the CANT position. Accordingly, it is possible to accurately evaluate the effect by the winglet, and determine the appropriate CANT angle.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">As the blade diameter of the reference blade that is a greater blade diameter than the CANT position, a blade diameter R when the CANT angle of the winglet is 0 and/or a blade diameter that is a median between the blade diameter R and the CANT position may be used.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><heading id="h0008">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p0031" num="0031">According to the present invention, the CANT angle of the winglet is configured to be 15° or more and 55° or less, so that swirls on the blade tip are reduced, thereby enhancing the performance (torque generated by the wind turbine blade) and/or reducing the moment (load) caused on the blade root.</p><heading id="h0009">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0032" num="0032"><ul><li>{<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1} Fig. 1</figref> illustrates a winglet of a wind turbine blade according to one embodiment of the present invention, and is a front view seen from a blade leading edge.</li><li>{<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2} Fig. 2</figref> illustrates various tips of the wind turbine blade that were used in the studies in the present embodiment.</li><li>{<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3} Fig. 3</figref> shows a graph of the results of simulation made on each of the wind turbine blades illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>.</li><li>{<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4} Fig. 4</figref> shows a graph of the results of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> by focusing on the torques (performance).</li><li>{<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5} Fig. 5</figref> shows a graph of the results of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> by focusing on the load (blade root moment).</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">Description of Embodiment</heading><p id="p0033" num="0033"><!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> Hereinafter, descriptions will be provided on the embodiment according to the present invention with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The wind turbine blades according to the present embodiment are preferably used as blades of a wind turbine generator.
