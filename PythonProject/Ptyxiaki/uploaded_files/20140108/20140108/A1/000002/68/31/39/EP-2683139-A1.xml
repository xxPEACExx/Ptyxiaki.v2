Since in use, the battery 12 needs to be detached from the main machine 11 frequently so as to be charged, repaired or replaced, the battery 12 and the main machine 11 are movably connected. Each of the outer side of the top end and the inner side of the tail end of the main machine 11 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> has an engaging groove 111 open to a respective side face, and the main machine 11 has an opening configured to receive the bottom portion of the battery 12. When being mounted, the battery 12 is pushed forwards along an axial direction of the opening from the tail end of the main machine 11, so that the top end of the battery 12 abuts against the top end of the main machine 11. Also, each of both sides of the top end of the battery 12 has a sliding catch (not shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>) engaged with the respective engaging groove 111 at the top end of the main machine 11, and the tail end of the battery 12 also has a sliding catch 121 engaged with the respective engaging groove 111 at the tail end of the main machine 11. Then, after the sliding catch engages with the engaging groove 111, the battery 12 cannot move leftwards and rightwards or upwards and downwards relative to the main machine 11; however, the battery 12 may still exit along the axial direction of the opening from the main machine 11. Thus, a pushing button 13 is further provided. The tail end of the main machine 11 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> has a groove opened upwards, with the pushing button 13 being placed in the groove. The upper portion of the pushing button 13 has<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> a protrusion, and a spring is provided between the pushing button 13 and the bottom portion of the groove. When the spring is not pressed, the protrusion of the pushing button 13 is located above the opening of the groove. The tail end of the battery 12 is provided with a groove opened downwards at the position corresponding to the protrusion. In mounting, the pushing button 13 is pushed downwards, so that the spring is compressed and the protrusion enters within the groove, without limitation to sliding of the battery 12; and after the battery 12 slides into the opening of the main machine 11, the pushing button 13 is released, and is ejected upwards under the elastic force of the spring, so that the protrusion of the pushing button 13 is inserted into the groove of the battery 12, thereby preventing the battery 12 from exiting axially.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, in the prior art, the pushing button 13 and a spring are primarily adopted for preventing the battery 12 from exiting. Due to the elasticity of the spring, the battery 12 is likely to be loosened, resulting in a poor contact of the electrodes of the battery 12. Moreover, when the portable terminal falls off or is stricken, the spring would be compressed under the gravity of the pushing button 13 or the inertia, and as a result, the pushing button 13 fails so that the battery 12 may exit. Furthermore, in the prior art, only a small segment of sliding catch 121 is adopted, resulting in insufficient stability.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Thus, it is a technical problem to be addressed by the person skilled in the art to provide a portable terminal in which the battery and the main machine may be fixed firmly and assembled and disassembled easily.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">An object of the present application is to provide a portable terminal in which the battery and the main machine body may be fixed firmly so that the battery will not drop off even when the portable terminal encounters situations such as falling off or being stricken, and may be assembled and disassembled easily.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">For addressing the above technical problems, the present application provides a portable terminal including a main machine body and a battery. The main machine body has an opening portion for receiving the bottom portion of the battery. The main machine body is engaged with the battery in a transverse direction and a longitudinal direction. One of the main machine body and the battery is provided with a pushing button moveable in the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> longitudinal direction, with a compression spring (27) being provided therebetween. The other one of the main machine body and the battery is provided with an engaging groove extending in the longitudinal direction. The main machine body and the battery are engaged in an axial direction via the pushing button and the engaging groove. The portable terminal further includes a locking cover connected to the pushing button. A torsion spring is provided between the locking cover and the pushing button, such that the locking cover and the pushing button rotate about the axis of the spring body of the torsion spring. When the torsion spring is returned, the longitudinal distance between one end of the locking cover and the battery or the main machine body provided with the compression spring is less than the distance by which the pushing button is inserted into the engaging groove.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Preferably, the pushing button has an axial protrusion, and the locking cover is hinged with the protrusion by a rotating shaft. The rotating shaft extends transversely through the protrusion, and the spring body of the torsion spring extends throughout the rotating shaft.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Preferably, the locking cover has two clamping arms located at both sides of the protrusion respectively, and the rotating shaft extends through the two clamping arms and the protrusion. The torsion spring is a double torsion spring, and two spring arms located at a side of the double torsion spring are connected to the two clamping arms respectively.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Preferably, each of the both sides of the main machine body has a sliding groove extending axially and opened outwards, and each of the both sides of the battery has a rib engaged in the corresponding sliding groove and sliding in an axial direction of the sliding groove.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Preferably, the sliding grooves are located outside of the both sides of the main machine body, and the ribs are located inside of the both sides of the battery.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Preferably, the battery includes a cell body and a shell for loading the cell body. The shell includes a battery top shell and a battery bottom shell. The battery bottom shell is located in the opening portion, and the rib is located at each of side edges of the battery top shell, and one end of the locking cover abuts against the top portion of the tail end of the battery top shell.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">When the portable terminal according to the present application is mounted, a torque may be applied to the torsion spring, so that a force may be applied to one end of the locking<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> cover, and the locking cover may be turned relative to the pushing button. Thus, the longitudinal distance between one end of the locking cover and the battery or the main machine body does not limit the longitudinal movement of the pushing button anymore, and then the pushing button is pushed to compress the compression spring, so that the bottom portion of the battery is allowed to abut against the bottom portion of the main machine body. After the bottom portion of the battery abuts against the bottom portion of the main machine body, the pushing button and the locking cover are released. As a result, on the one hand, the pushing button stretches out under the elastic force of the compression spring to be engaged with the engaging groove of the main machine body or the battery; and on the other hand, the locking cover returns to be in the initial state under the returning action of the torsion spring. Thus, the pushing button cannot exit from the engaging groove and is in the deadlocked state, thereby achieving double axial engagement between the battery and the main machine body. Even when the portable apparatus falls off or is stricken, the pushing button will not exit entirely from the engaging groove, that is, the pushing button may still lock the battery and the main machine body reliably. In disassembling, similarly, the locking cover is returned, and the pushing button is pushed to compress the compression spring, so that the pushing button is disengaged from the engaging groove of the main machine body or the battery. Consequently, the battery may exit from the opening portion of the main machine body.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In a specific embodiment, the outer portion of the pushing button may have an axial protrusion. The locking cover is connected to the protrusion via a torsion spring. A transverse rotating shaft is provided on the protrusion, and the locking cover is hinged with the protrusion via the transverse rotating shaft. Since the protrusion extends by a certain distance in the axial direction, the locking cover is facilitated to be turned about the axis of the spring body of the torsion spring without being limited by other structures. Besides, since the locking cover is hinged with the protrusion via the transverse rotating shaft, the connection of the double torsion spring may be simplified.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In another specific embodiment, the main machine body has a sliding groove located at each of its both outer sides, with the sliding groove being opened outwards, and correspondingly, a rib is provided inside of each of the both sides of the shell of the battery. In mounting, the top end of the battery slides gradually into the opening portion from the tail end of the main machine body, till the top end of the battery and the top end of the main machine body abut against each other. Here, two sides of the battery and two sides of the main<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> machine body are respectively engaged along the whole axial length of the sliding grooves, so that the main machine body and the battery may be fixed firmly in a transverse direction and a longitudinal direction. Furthermore, the engaging groove is located at an outer side of the main machine body, which may prevent the outside dust, moisture or other foreign matters from entering the space between the battery and main machine body, so as to ensure the service performance of the portable terminal apparatus.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> is a schematic structural view of a typical portable terminal;</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> is a schematic partial enlarged view of part A in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>;</p><p id="p0019" num="0019"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> is a schematic partial enlarged view of part B in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>;</p><p id="p0020" num="0020"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref> is a schematic exploded structural view of an assembly of a specific embodiment of a portable terminal according to the present application;</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of the portable terminal shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>;</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref> is a right view showing the tail end of the portable terminal shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>;</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref> is a schematic view showing the principle of the structure in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref>;</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 8</figref> is a schematic structural view of the portable terminal shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>;</p><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 9</figref> is a schematic structural view showing the pushing button fitted with the locking cover in another specific embodiment of the portable terminal according to the present application;</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 10</figref> is a schematic view showing the battery fitted with the main machine body in still another specific embodiment of the portable terminal according to the present application; and</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 11</figref> is a schematic view taken along line C of <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 10</figref>.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --><p id="p0028" num="0028">An object of the present application is to provide a portable terminal in which the battery and the main machine body may be fixed firmly so that the battery will not drop off even when the portable terminal encounters situations such as falling off or being stricken, and may be assembled and disassembled easily.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">For those skilled in the art to understand better the technical solutions of the present application, the present application will be further described below in detail in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the specific embodiments.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003 f0004 f0005">Figures 4 to 8</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref> is a schematic exploded structural view of an assembly of a specific embodiment of a portable terminal according to the present application; <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of the portable terminal shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>; <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref> is a right view showing the tail end of the portable terminal shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>; <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref> is a schematic view showing the principle of the structure in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 6</figref>; and <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 8</figref> is a schematic structural view of the portable terminal shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">A portable terminal according to the present application includes a main machine body 21 and a battery 22.

For example, an engaging groove open to a respective side face may be machined at each of both sides of the top end and of the tail end of the main machine body 21, and a structure adapted to be inserted into the respective engaging groove may be machined at each of both sides of the top end and of the tail end of the battery 22, so that the battery 22 may be pushed into the opening portion from a rear end of the main machine body 21 and cannot move leftwards and rightwards (transversely), upwards and downwards (longitudinally) relative to the main machine body 21. After the battery 22 is placed into the opening portion, the top end of the battery 22 abuts against the top end of the main machine body 21, so that the battery 22 may exit from the tail end of the main machine body 21 only along the opening portion. The main machine body 21<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> may be provided with a pushing button 24 moving in the longitudinal direction, and a compression spring 27 is provided between the main machine body 21 and the pushing button 24. The battery 22 may be provided with an engaging groove extending in the longitudinal direction, so that the main machine body 21 is engaged with the battery 22 in the axial direction via the pushing button 24 and the engaging groove. Of course, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figures 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">6</figref>, the tail end of the battery 21 may have a pushing button 24 moving in the longitudinal direction, and a compression spring 27 may be provided between the battery 21 and the pushing button 24. The lower end of the pushing button 24 may be inserted into the engaging groove of the main machine body 21, so that the battery 22 is incapable of exiting in the axial direction of the opening portion due to the limitation of the pushing button 24. When the battery 22 is disassembled, the pushing button 24 is pushed upwards, and the compression spring 27 is compressed, so that the lower end of the pushing button 24 is disengaged from the engaging groove of the main machine body 21, thereby allowing the axial movement of the battery 22 without the limitation of the pushing button 24. In this way, the battery 22 may exit from the opening portion. In mounting, the pushing button 24 is pushed upwards until the battery 22 is mounted in the opening portion, and then is released, so that the pushing button 24 moves downwards due to the returning action of the compression spring 27 and then the lower portion of the pushing button 24 is engaged in the engaging groove of the tail end of the main machine body 21, causing that the battery 22 is incapable of exiting.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The portable terminal further includes a locking cover 25, with a torsion spring 23 being provided between the locking cover 25 and the pushing button 24. Preferably, the torsion spring 23 is provided between the outer side of the pushing button 24 and the locking cover 25. The outer side of the pushing button 24 is the portion of the pushing button 24 facing outwards after the pushing button 24 is assembled. When a torque is applied to the torsion spring 23, the pushing button 24 may rotate about the axis of the spring body of the torsion spring 23 relative to the locking cover 25; and when the torsion spring 23 is in a return state without being applied with the torque, the longitudinal distance between one end of the locking cover 25 and the battery 22 or the main machine body 21 provided with the compression spring 27 is less than the distance by which the pushing button 24 is inserted into the engaging groove. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref>, the compression spring 27 is arranged at the tail end of the battery 22, and the upper end of the locking cover 25 abuts against the tail end of the battery 22 when the torsion spring 23 is returned, so that the pushing button 24 connected<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> with the locking cover 25 cannot move upwards. Also, the lower end of the pushing button 24 abuts against the bottom portion of the engaging groove of the main machine body 21, so that the pushing button 24 cannot move downwards. Thus, the pushing button 24 is in a rigid deadlocked state. In fact, it is not necessary that the upper end of the locking cover 25 abuts against the tail end of the battery 22 when the torsion spring 23 is returned, so long as the longitudinal distance between the upper end of the locking cover 25 and the tail end of the battery 22 is less than the distance by which the pushing button 24 is inserted into the engaging groove of the main machine body 21, that is, the pushing button 24 may move upwards by a small distance, but cannot exit from the engaging groove of the main machine body 21.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In mounting, a torque may be applied to the torsion spring 23, so that a force may be applied to one end of the locking cover 25, and the locking cover 25 may be turned relative to the pushing button 24. Thus, the longitudinal distance between one end of the locking cover 25 and the battery 22 or the main machine body 21 does not limit the longitudinal movement of the pushing button 24 anymore, and then the pushing button 24 is pushed to compress the compression spring 27, so that the bottom portion of the battery 22 is allowed to abut against the bottom portion of the main machine body 21. After the bottom portion of the battery 22 abuts against the bottom portion of the main machine body 21, the pushing button 24 and the locking cover 25 are released. As a result, on the one hand, the pushing button 24 stretches out under the elastic force of the compression spring 27 to be engaged with the engaging groove of the main machine body 21 or the battery 22; and on the other hand, the locking cover 25 returns to be in the initial state under the returning action of the torsion spring 23. The locking cover 25 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref> abuts against the tail end of the battery 22 again, so that the pushing button 24 cannot move and is in the deadlocked state, thereby achieving double axial engagement between the battery 22 and the main machine body 21. Even when the portable apparatus falls off or is stricken, the pushing button 24 will not exit entirely from the engaging groove, that is, the pushing button 24 may still lock the battery 22 and the main machine body 21 reliably. In disassembling, similarly, the locking cover 25 is returned, and the pushing button 24 is pushed to compress the compression spring 27, so that the pushing button 24 is disengaged from the engaging groove of the main machine body 21 or the battery 22. Consequently, the battery 22 may exit from the opening portion of the main machine body 21.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 9, Figure 9</figref> is a schematic structural view showing the pushing<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> button fitted with the locking cover in another specific embodiment of the portable terminal according to the present application.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The outer side of the pushing button 24 may be provided with an axial protrusion 241, and the locking cover 25 is connected to the protrusion 241 via a torsion spring 23. Since the protrusion 241 extends by a certain distance in the axial direction, the locking cover 25 is facilitated to be turned about the axis of the spring body of the torsion spring 23 without being limited by other structures. A transverse rotating shaft 26 may further be arranged on the protrusion 241, and the locking cover 25 is hinged with the protrusion 241 by the transverse rotating shaft 26. The double torsion spring 23 may result in simpler connection.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 9</figref>, the locking cover 25 may have two clamping arms located at both sides of the protrusion 241 respectively, and the rotating shaft 26 passes through the two clamping arms and the protrusion 241. The torsion spring 23 is a double torsion spring. Two spring arms located at a side of the double torsion spring abut against the two clamping arms respectively, and the spring arms on the other side of the double torsion spring are connected to the pushing button 24. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>, two axial through holes arranged transversely in parallel may be machined at the middle portion of the pushing button 24, and then the transverse spring arms of the double torsion spring 23 may be located at the inner side of the pushing button 24, and the two spring arms opposing to the transverse spring arms are located at the outer side of the pushing button 24 so as to abut against the two clamping arms of the locking cover 25 located at the outer side of the pushing button 24. Furthermore, the axial through hole facilitates turning the locking cover 25, for example, the locking cover 25 is rotated anticlockwise by 90°. The two spring arms of the locking cover 25 (in the present embodiment, the two spring arms abut against the tail end of the battery 22) may be rotated into the axial through holes of the pushing button 24, and then the locking cover 25 may be pushed upwards, so as to drive the pushing button 24 to compress the compression spring 27 and thus to be disengaged from the engaging groove of the tail end of the main machine body 21. Here, the battery 22 may exit in the axial direction of the opening portion. In mounting, similarly, the locking cover 25 is rotated anticlockwise by 90° and then pushed upwards; and after the battery 22 is mounted into the opening portion, the locking cover 25 is released, so that the pushing button 24 is engaged in the engaging groove. Of course, it is not necessary to rotate the locking cover 25 by 90°. That is, the locking cover 25 may be rotated by any angle, so long as the angle of the rotation enables the locking cover 25 not to abut against the battery<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> 22 or the main machine body 21 and enables the pushing button 24 to be retracted. In the present embodiment, the locking cover 25 may rotate to a large extent, and may also act as a component for urging the pushing button 24, so that the double deadlocked process and the unlocking process may be performed continuously, resulting in easier operation. Furthermore, such a structure may be easily machined without influencing the appearance of the portable terminal.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Each of the both sides of the main machine body 21 may have a sliding groove 211 extending axially and opened outwards, and each of the both sides of the battery 22 may have a rib 2211 mated with the corresponding sliding groove 211, so that the rib 2211 may be engaged in the corresponding sliding groove 211 and may slide in the axial direction of the sliding groove 211. When the battery 22 is mounted, the top end of the battery 22 slides gradually into the opening portion from the tail end of the main machine body 21, till the top end of the battery 22 and the top end of the main machine body 21 abut against each other. Here, both sides of the battery 22 and both sides of the main machine body 21 are respectively engaged along the whole axial length of the sliding grooves 211, so that the main machine body 21 and the battery 22 may be fixed firmly in the transverse direction and the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0006">Figures 10 and 11, Figure 10</figref> is a schematic view showing the battery fitted with the main machine body in still another specific embodiment of the portable terminal according to the present application; and <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 11</figref> is a schematic view taken along line C of <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 10</figref>.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The sliding groove 211 may be located outside of the respective sides of the main machine body 21, and may be opened outwards.

Such a structure may prevent the outside dust, moisture or other foreign matters from entering the space between the battery 22 and the main machine body 21, so as to ensure the service performance of the portable terminal apparatus. Alternatively, a sliding groove 211 opened inwards may be provided inside of each of the both sides of the main machine body 21, and correspondingly, the rib 2211 may be located at outside of each of the both sides of the battery 22, thereby also achieving the object of the present application.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The battery 22 may include a cell body and a shell for loading the cell body.
