Since a visible mark is provided at a center portion of the injection part, the position of the sampling needle can be adjusted by performing a key<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> operation with reference to this mark.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>CITATION LIST</b></heading><heading id="h0004"><b>[PATENT LITERATURE]</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">[PTL 1] Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2005134217A"><text>2005-134217</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><heading id="h0006"><b>PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">With the analyzer according to Patent Literature 1 above, in a case where the place at which to perform a key operation and the location on which to perform position adjustment are away from each other, an operator cannot perform the key operation and confirmation of the position adjustment simultaneously. Accordingly, after performing the key operation, the operator has to confirm whether a relevant mechanism section is at a predetermined position, which results in troublesome adjustment work.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention is made in view of the above problem. An object of the present invention is to provide a sample analyzer and a position adjustment method for a movable unit in a sample analyzer that allow easy position adjustment of a movable unit even when the place at which to perform a key operation and the movable unit on which to perform position adjustment are away from each other.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading id="h0007"><b>SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">A first aspect of the present invention relates to a position adjustment method for a movable unit in a sample analyzer which includes: a measurement section which causes a movable unit to operate in order to measure a sample; and a communication section for performing communication with outside. The position adjustment method for the movable unit in the sample analyzer according to this aspect includes: a terminal screen displaying step of causing a portable terminal device to display a position adjustment screen for accepting an input for changing a position of the movable unit, the portable terminal device configured to be able to perform communication with the communication section; an inputting step of performing the input for changing the position onto the position adjustment screen; a transmitting step of transmitting the input for changing the position performed onto the position adjustment screen, from the terminal device to the communication section; and a movement executing step of causing the measurement section to execute a movement of the corresponding movable unit in accordance with the input for changing the position received by the communication section.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to the position adjustment method for the movable unit in the sample analyzer according to this aspect, even when the movable unit is away from the position at which to<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> operate the sample analyzer, by bringing the terminal device near the movable unit, it is possible to give instruction to change the position of the movable unit via the position adjustment screen displayed in the terminal device, while viewing the position of the movable unit. Therefore, when performing position adjustment of the movable unit, an operator need not come and go between the position at which to operate the sample analyzer and the movable unit, and can perform position adjustment of the movable unit very simply.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the position adjustment method for the movable unit in the sample analyzer according to this aspect, the sample analyzer may include a storage section in which a set value regarding the position of the movable unit is stored, and the terminal screen displaying step may include: a step of generating image data for the position adjustment screen based on the set value stored in the storage section; and a step of transmitting the generated image data from the communication section to the terminal device. Accordingly, it is sufficient that the terminal device has a function for reproducing and displaying the received screen data. Thus, the terminal device need not have a special application for position adjustment installed therein. Thus, it is possible to perform position adjustment for a movable unit by using a general-purpose computer and a terminal device that uses a general-purpose application.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In this case, the position adjustment method may further include a body screen displaying step of displaying the position adjustment screen based on the set value stored in the storage section, in a display section provided in the sample analyzer.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Further, in this case, the movement executing step may include a step of causing the measurement section to execute a movement of the corresponding movable unit, in accordance with an input for changing the set value onto the position adjustment screen displayed in the display section or the terminal device, the body screen displaying step may include a step of updating the position adjustment screen displayed in the display section, based on the movement of the movable unit, and the terminal screen displaying step may include a step of updating the position adjustment screen displayed in the terminal device such that, in synchronization with the update of the position adjustment screen displayed in the display section, the updated position adjustment screen is also displayed in the terminal device.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Further, in this case, the terminal screen displaying step may include a step of, upon accepting a change of the set value, generating image data of a region in which the changed set value is displayed, the region being a part of the position adjustment screen, and of transmitting to the terminal device the generated image data along with data designating a region to<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> be changed. Accordingly, it is sufficient that only the image data of the region regarding the change of the set value and the data designating the region may be transmitted to the terminal device. Thus, compared with a case where all of the image data of the position adjustment screen is transmitted to the terminal device when the set value is changed, the amount of the data to be transmitted to the terminal device can be significantly reduced.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Further, in the position adjustment method for the movable unit in the sample analyzer according to this aspect, the position adjustment screen may include a movement key for moving the movable unit by a predetermined movement amount, and the movement executing step may include a step of moving the movable unit by the predetermined movement amount, every time the movement key in the position adjustment screen displayed in the terminal device is pressed. Accordingly, position adjustment for the movable unit can be performed through a simple operation.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Further, in the position adjustment method for the movable unit in the sample analyzer according to this aspect, the measurement section may include a plurality of the movable units, and the terminal screen displaying step may include a step of causing the terminal device to display a selection accepting screen for accepting a selection of a movable unit targeted by position adjustment from among the plurality of the movable units, and of causing the terminal device to display the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> position adjustment screen for accepting a position adjustment instruction to the movable unit selected via the selection accepting screen. In a case where there are a plurality of movable units, it is necessary to select a movable unit on which to perform position adjustment. According to the present invention, selection of a movable unit can also be performed on the terminal device side.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In this case, the terminal screen displaying step may cause an image showing the selected movable unit to be displayed on the selection accepting screen. Accordingly, it is possible to confirm at a glance where the adjustment target movable unit is located.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Further, in the position adjustment method for the movable unit in the sample analyzer according to this aspect, the terminal screen displaying step may include a step of causing the terminal device to display an operation confirmation button for accepting an instruction for confirming an operation of the movable unit adjusted based on the input onto the position adjustment screen, and the movement executing step may include a step of causing, upon accepting an input onto the operation confirmation button, the movable unit to execute a movement from a predetermined origin position to an adjusted position. Accordingly, it is possible to confirm the adjusted state of the adjustment target movable unit.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Further, in the position adjustment method for the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> movable unit in the sample analyzer according to this aspect, the terminal device may be configured to be able to perform wireless communication with the communication section.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A second aspect of the present invention relates to a sample analyzer. The sample analyzer according to this aspect includes: a measurement section which causes a movable unit to operate in order to measure a sample; a communication section for performing communication with outside; and a controller. Here, the controller causes a portable terminal device to display a position adjustment screen for accepting an input for changing a position of the movable unit, the portable terminal device configured to be able to perform communication with the communication section, and causes, upon receiving via the communication section an input for changing the position onto the position adjustment screen, the measurement section to execute a movement of the movable unit in accordance with the input.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the sample analyzer according to this aspect, effects similar to those of the position adjustment method for a movable unit in the sample analyzer according to the first aspect above can be obtained.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The sample analyzer according to this aspect may further include a storage section in which a set value regarding the position of the movable unit is stored. Here, the controller may generate image data for the position adjustment screen based<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> on the set value stored in the storage section, and transmit the generated image data from the communication section to the terminal device. As a result, effects similar to those of the position adjustment method for the movable unit in the sample analyzer according to the first aspect above can be obtained.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In this case, the sample analyzer according to this aspect may further include a display section. Here, the controller may cause the display section to display the position adjustment screen based on the set value stored in the storage section.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Further, in this case, the controller may cause the measurement section to execute a movement of the movable unit, in accordance with an input for changing the set value onto the position adjustment screen displayed in the display section or the terminal device, may update the position adjustment screen displayed in the display section, based on the movement of the movable unit, and may update the position adjustment screen displayed in the terminal device such that, in synchronization with the update of the position adjustment screen displayed in the display section, the updated position adjustment screen is also displayed in the terminal device.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Further, in this case, upon accepting a change of the set value, the controller may generate image data of a region in which the changed set value is displayed, the region being a part of the position adjustment screen, and transmit to the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> terminal device the generated image data along with data designating a region to be changed. Accordingly, effects similar to those of the position adjustment method for the movable unit in the sample analyzer according to the first aspect above can be obtained.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Further, in the sample analyzer according to this aspect, the position adjustment screen may include a movement key for moving the movable unit by a predetermined movement amount, and the controller may move the movable unit by the predetermined movement amount, every time the movement key in the position adjustment screen displayed in the terminal device is pressed. Accordingly, effects similar to those of the position adjustment method for the movable unit in the sample analyzer according to the first aspect above can be obtained.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Further, in the sample analyzer according to this aspect, the measurement section may include a plurality of the movable units, and the controller may cause the terminal device to display a selection accepting screen for accepting a selection of a movable unit targeted by position adjustment from among the plurality of the movable units, and cause the terminal device to display the position adjustment screen for accepting a position adjustment instruction to the movable unit selected via the selection accepting screen. Accordingly, effects similar to those of the position adjustment method for the movable unit in the sample analyzer according to the first aspect above can be<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> obtained.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Here, the controller may cause an image showing the selected movable unit to be displayed on the selection accepting screen. Accordingly, effects similar to those of the position adjustment method for the movable unit in the sample analyzer according to the first aspect above can be obtained.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Further, in the sample analyzer according to this aspect, the controller may cause the terminal device to display an operation confirmation button for accepting an instruction for confirming an operation of the movable unit adjusted based on the input onto the position adjustment screen, and may move, upon accepting an input onto the operation confirmation button, the movable unit from a predetermined origin position to an adjusted position. Accordingly, effects similar to those of the position adjustment method for the movable unit in the sample analyzer according to the first aspect above can be obtained.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Further, in the sample analyzer according to this aspect, the terminal device may be configured to be able to perform wireless communication with the communication section.</p><heading id="h0008"><b>ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0029" num="0029">As described above, according to the present invention, it is possible to provide a sample analyzer and a position adjustment method for a movable unit in a sample analyzer that allow easy position adjustment of a movable unit even when the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> place at which to perform a key operation and a movable unit on which to perform position adjustment are away from each other.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The effects and the significance of the present invention will be further clarified by the description of the embodiment below.
