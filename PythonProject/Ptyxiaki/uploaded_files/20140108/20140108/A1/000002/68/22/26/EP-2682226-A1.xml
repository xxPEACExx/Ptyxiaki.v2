The suction-pad supporting units 1 are constituted by independent blocks, which can be positioned, as desired, on the working surface P, according to the original size and shape of the plate to be machined and the size and shape that it is desired to obtain. Each supporting unit 1 is provided with a bottom suction-pad member 1a and a top suction-pad member 1b The bottom suction-pad member 1a and the top suction-pad member 1b define, with the working surface P and with the surface of the plate L, respective chambers that can be set in communication with a source of vacuum S through a flexible connection hose 10 associated to each block. In this way, each suction-pad member provides for blocking of the unit 1 on the working surface P and for blocking of the plate L to be machined on the unit 1. Furthermore, for correct positioning of the plates L to be machined on the working surface P there are also available units 2 for locating the plates, against which the edges of the plates come to bear. The units 2 are equipped with retractable top locator members 2b and bottom suction-pad members 2a for blocking the units 2 on the working surface P. Also the bottom suction-pad members of the units 2 can be connected to a source of vacuum S to obtain anchorage of the units 2 to the working surface P.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The invention is designed in particular to be applied on machines M or work centres of the type comprising a workbench 3 (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>) defining the aforesaid working surface P, on which the plate to be machined L is located in position and fixed via the aforesaid units 2 and 1, and an operating head 4, which can be displaced on the workbench 3 along a number of mutually orthogonal axes (X, Y, Z) by means of respective electronically controlled motor means (not illustrated and not described in detail herein since they are in themselves known).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The main advantage of the above known solution lies in the fact that each supporting and/or locating unit can be positioned and withheld on the working<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> surface in any point thereof, since the hoses that supply the vacuum enable easy displacement of each block into the desired position.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The disadvantage of the known solution described lies, instead, mainly in the fact that the flexible hoses 10 constitute an encumbrance on the working surface P that proves at times troublesome for the operator, who has to position the suction-pad supporting units 1 and the locating units 2 between the various hoses 10.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It has already been proposed to provide a source of vacuum within each unit for supporting and withholding the plates (see the document No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2012085446A1"><text>WO 2012/085446 A1</text></patcit>) in such a way that the hoses for connection to the external source of vacuum are eliminated.

At the bottom and top ends of this body 1, two suction-pad members are present, and in particular a bottom suction pad 1a and a top suction pad 1b The suction pads 1a and 1b comprise, respectively, a first peripheral gasket 1a1 and a second peripheral gasket 1b1, which are carried by the body of the unit 1. The first gasket 1a1 defines a first closed chamber 1a2 between the bottom surface of the body 1 and the working surface P, whereas the second gasket 1b1 defines a second closed chamber 1b2 between the top surface of the body 1 and the plate to be machined L.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The two chambers 1a2 and 1b2 can be connected to a source of vacuum S1 to obtain anchorage, respectively, of the unit 1 to the working surface P and of the plate to be machined L to the unit 1.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005">Figures 3-6</figref>, the source of vacuum S1 is provided within the body of the unit 1. The source of vacuum S1 comprises a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> pump 11 driven by an electric motor 12, for example an electric motor with 24-V supply. The electric motor 12 is controlled by an electronic control unit 13, which is also provided within the body 1 of the unit. In particular, the electronic unit 13 controls turning-on and turning-off of the aforesaid electric motor 12 of the source of vacuum S1.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Once again with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>, the source of vacuum S1 is connected to the aforesaid first chamber 1a2 of the bottom suction-pad member 1a by means of a duct 14 and to a first solenoid valve 15 controlled by the electronic unit 13.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The solenoid valve 15, by opening, is able to set in communication, through the duct 14, the source of vacuum S1 with the first closed chamber 1a2.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In particular, the electronic unit 13 is programmed for causing anchorage of the supporting unit 1 to the working surface P by activating, initially, the electric motor 12 of the source S1 and by opening the first solenoid valve 15 to communicate, through the duct 14, a vacuum to the first chamber 1a2, and by closing the first solenoid valve 15 so as to isolate the first chamber 1a2 at negative pressure, so that subsequently it is possible to de-activate the electric motor 12 without causing the vacuum to cease in the first chamber 1a2.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A first advantage as compared to conventional solutions of the type illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1 and 2</figref> is represented by energy saving. In known solutions, the source of vacuum S is constantly functioning, whereas in the case illustrated the source S1 is activated for the time necessary to create the vacuum and then, once the solenoid valve 15 has been closed, the source S1 can be de-activated.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Within the body 1 of the supporting unit an electric-supply battery 16 is provided. This battery 16 is connected to the source of vacuum S1, to the solenoid valve 15, and to the electronic control unit 13. Preferably, the battery 16 is of a rechargeable type. Otherwise, in an alternative embodiment (not illustrated) the supporting unit 1 is provided with means for connection to an external electric-supply source.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the currently preferred embodiment illustrated, the supporting unit 1 comprises a single source of vacuum S1 provided in the body of the unit 1. The source of vacuum S1 is connected both to the first chamber 1a2 of the bottom suction-pad member 1a and to the second chamber 1b2 of the top suction-pad member 1b. As an alternative, it is possible to envisage providing two different sources of vacuum, the first connected to the first chamber 1a2 of the bottom<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> suction-pad member 1a and the second connected to the second chamber 1b2 of the top suction-pad member 1b</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">To return to the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>, in which a single source of vacuum S1 is present, this source S1 is connected, via the aforesaid first solenoid valve 15, to the bottom suction-pad member 1a and, via a second solenoid valve 17, to the second chamber 1b2 of the top suction-pad member 1b</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The first solenoid valve 15 and the second solenoid valve 17 are controlled independently by the electronic control unit 13 provided in the body of the unit 1.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Once again in the case of the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref>, the suction-pad supporting unit 1 moreover comprises also a sensor 18 for detecting the vacuum generated by the source of vacuum S1. The sensor 18 sends, via a communication line 18a, a signal to the electronic control unit 13 for governing start or arrest of the motor 12 of the source of vacuum S1. As soon as the degree of vacuum set is reached, the sensor will communicate to the control unit 13 this information, and the control unit will close the solenoid valves 15 and 17 and then will switch off the motor 12. The sensor 18 will be moreover able to detect a drop in the level of vacuum and to signal (once again by means of the communication line 18a) to the control unit 13 the need to re-activate the source of vacuum S1.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref>, the source of vacuum S1 may be switched to an operating mode in which it operates as pressure source in order to generate a flow of pressurized air that can be used for favouring detachment of the plate L from the top suction-pad member 1b</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In this case, also a third solenoid valve 21 is present for connecting the second closed chamber 1b2 to the source S1 in the mode where it is functioning as pressure source. The third solenoid valve 21 is connected to the pressure source S1 by means of a duct 14a interposed in which is a pressurized-air tank 20.

The pump of the source of vacuum is sensitive in regard to water and to the machining sediments. Hence, the presence of the valve 29 serves to prevent the water and sediments from entering the intake duct and reaching the pump. The valve 29 will consequently be able to discharge water and sediments that drop into the area of the second closed chamber 1b2 outside the unit 1 by means of a discharge duct, not illustrated in the figures.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 5</figref> is a schematic representation of a unit 2 according to the invention, used for locating the plate L on the working surface P of the machine M.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In the sequel of the description the parts common to the supporting unit 1 will be designated with the same reference numbers also in the locating unit 2.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The locating unit 2 comprises a top locator member 23, which is vertically mobile between a raised, operative, position and a lowered, inoperative, position.
