By fitting the key portion into the key hole, the rotor axis and the one-way clutch are combined to be integrally rotatable. However, the invention described in the Patent Document 1 does not include a device controlling the rotor axis and the one-way clutch in an axis line direction of the rotor axis, so that there is a problem that the rotor axis and the one-way clutch are separated.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention is made in view of the aforementioned problem, and an object of the present invention is to simplify and ensure a combination structure between the rotor axis and the rotary member combined with the rotor axis in the rotary damper.</p><heading id="h0007">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to obtain the aforementioned object, the present invention is a rotary damper device (1) comprising a damper housing (11) internally enclosing a viscous fluid; a rotor (12) including a rotor vane (28) rotatably received inside the damper housing, and a rotor axis (29) provided to project along a rotary axis of the rotor vane, and protruding to an outside of the damper housing; and a rotary member (3) combined with a protruding end of the rotor axis. The rotary member includes an insertion hole (43) through which the protruding end of the rotor axis passes; and a pair of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> control walls (44) provided to stand in a hole edge on a side facing the damper housing side of the insertion hole in such a way as to be mutually opposed by sandwiching the insertion hole. The protruding end of the rotor axis is heated and deformed in a state wherein the protruding end of the rotor axis has passed through the insertion hole, and protrudes in a radial direction of the rotor axis along a gap between the pair of control walls so as to be engaged with the hole edge of the insertion hole.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the configuration, when the protruding end of the rotor axis is engaged with the hole edge of the insertion hole by being heated and deformed, the pair of control walls controls a deformation direction of the protruding end of the rotor axis, so that an engagement formation between the protruding end of the rotor axis and the hole edge of the insertion hole is easily carried out. Also, instead of making the deformation (protrusion) direction all-round in the radial direction, by limiting the deformation direction to a direction of one portion, the protruding end of the rotor axis engaging with the hole edge of the insertion hole can be made thick so as to enhance rigidity of an engagement structure. Also, the protruding end of the rotor axis which has been heated and deformed can also engage with the control wall, so that the control wall can be integrally rotated with the rotor axis.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In another aspect of the present invention, the rotary member (3) includes a cylindrical outer member (36) including an internal gear (63); an inner member (35) received in the outer member concentrically and rotatably, and including two<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> concave portions (47) in an outer circumferential portion; and planetary gears (37) rotatably received in the respective concave portions, and engaged with the internal gear. When the outer member rotates in a positive direction relative to the inner member, the planetary gear rotates inside the concave portion, and the outer member rotates independently from the inner member. On the other hand, when the outer member rotates in a negative direction relative to the inner member, the rotary member (3) becomes a one-way clutch wherein the planetary gear engages with a corner portion (49) formed in one side in a circumferential direction of the concave portion, and the outer member and the inner member integrally rotate.

The damper housing 11 includes a cylindrical bottom member 14 with a bottom, and a disk-shaped lid member 15 closing an opening end of the bottom member 14; both are formed by a resin material. In a circumferential edge portion of the lid member 15, there is concaved an annular groove 17 in which the opening end of the bottom member 14 can be fitted.

The pair of projecting pieces 81 is arranged in parallel at a predetermined interval so that opposed sides of the end portion 32 mutually face.

Due to the aforementioned formation method, two convex portions 71 are formed outward in the radial direction of the rotor axis 29, and in mutually opposing directions. Each convex portion 71 engages with a circumferential edge portion of the insertion hole 43 so as to prevent the rotor axis 29 from being disengaged from the insertion hole 43.

On the other hand, when the lid 92 is closed, the outer member 36 rotates in the positive direction by the rack 96, and the inner member 35 and the rotor axis 29 do not rotate, so that the rotary damper 2 will never generate the rotational resistance.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The explanation of the specific embodiment has been completed here; however, the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiment, and can be widely modified.

In that<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> case, it is only necessary to provide the insertion hole 43 and the control wall 44 in the rotary member. Also, the shape of the control wall 44 can be appropriately changed, and may be formed in, for example, a C-shape so as to be surrounded leaving one side of the insertion hole 43. Also, for the pressing piece 80, various shapes can be used. Also, in the present embodiment, the end portion 32 of the rotor axis 29 has the quadrangular column shape, and the insertion hole 43 has the quadrangular shape.
