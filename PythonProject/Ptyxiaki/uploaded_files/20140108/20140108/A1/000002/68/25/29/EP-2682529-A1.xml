The fuel tank 17 and the operating oil tank 18 are arranged on the upper frame 7 in the front-rear direction on an outer<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> side of the right vertical plate 16 (an outer side in a width direction of the upper slewing body 2, i.e. on the right side of the right vertical plate 16). The electric storage device 19 is provided in front of the tanks 17, 18, in other words on a front portion right side of the upper frame 7, and serves as a power source for operating the generator motor 13 as a motor.

Note that the partition plate 10 and the engine room 11 shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref> have been omitted from <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A reference symbol S1 in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref> denotes an intermediate space sandwiched between the left and right vertical plates 15, 16. Further, a reference symbol S2 denotes a right<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> outside space on an outer side (the right side) of the right vertical plate 16. A reference symbol S3 denotes a left outside space on an outer side (the left side) of the left vertical plate 15.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>, the upper slewing body 2 includes an electric power cable 22 and a signal cable 23 for electrically connecting the generator motor 13 to the front portion hybrid device 21. The electric power cable 22 transmits electric power between the generator motor 13 and the front portion hybrid device 21 (the electric storage device 19). The signal cable 23 transmits signals such as a control signal and a sensor signal between the generator motor 13 and the front portion hybrid device 21 (the control device 20).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Electromagnetic wave noise is generated in the electric power cable 22 by a high voltage large current flowing through the electric power cable 22, and this electromagnetic wave noise adversely affects the signal cable 23, through which a weak current flows. As a result, signal transmission may be obstructed.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>, therefore, it is thought that the two cables 22, 23 are laid along separate routes in order to suppress the effect of the electromagnetic wave noise on the signal cable 23.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">More specifically, the electric power cable 22 is laid along a route as follows. The route starts from the intermediate space S 1 in which the generator motor 13 is disposed, passes through the right vertical plate 16 into the right outside space S2, and then passes through the right outside space S2 along the right vertical plate 16 until reaching the front portion hybrid device 21.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The signal cable 23, meanwhile, is laid along a bypass route as follows. The bypass route starts from the intermediate space S1, passes through the left vertical plate 15 into the left outside space S3, extends along the left vertical plate 15 until reaching a front portion of the left outside space S3, passes through the left vertical plate 15 into the intermediate space<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> S1, passes through the right vertical plate 16 into the right outside space S2, and then reaches the front portion hybrid device 21.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In other words, the two cables 22, 23 are laid along routes set such that the two cables 22, 23 are as far removed from each other as possible by the two vertical plates 15, 16, which are constituted by conductors (steel plates) capable of blocking electromagnetic wave noise.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to the wiring structure described above, however, the signal cable 23 is laid along a long-distance bypass route that passes through the three spaces S1 to S3. More specifically, the signal cable 23 is laid along a long-distance bypass route passing through the left outside space S3, the intermediate space S1, and then the right outside space S2 from the intermediate space S1,. The electric power cable 22 is also disposed along a comparatively long route extending from the intermediate space S1 to the right outside space S2. The respective cables 22, 23 must therefore be laid so as to avoid the devices disposed compactly on these long routes. As a result, a wiring operation becomes extremely complicated. Further, there also be a defect in which a required cost of the wiring becomes increase by increasing a required cable length.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004169465A"><text>2004-169465</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0003">Summary of the Invention</heading><p id="p0025" num="0025">An object of the present invention is to provide an upper slewing body and a hybrid construction machine including the upper slewing body, with which an electric power cable and a signal cable can be laid easily over short distances while suppressing an effect of electromagnetic wave noise on the signal cable.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">To solve the problems described above, the present invention provides an upper slewing body for a hybrid construction machine, which is provided rotatably on a lower<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> propelling body, the upper slewing body including: an upper frame;
