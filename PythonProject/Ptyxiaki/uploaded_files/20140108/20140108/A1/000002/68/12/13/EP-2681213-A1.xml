It can be used in treatment of respiratory tract diseases, particularly in COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and asthma. Tiotropium bromide is preferably administered by the inhalation route in treatment of abovementioned diseases. In addition to the administration of broncholytically active agents in the form of metered aerosols and inhalable solutions, inhalable dry powders comprising the active agent also have particular importance. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Tiotropium bromide is preferably administered by the inhalation route. It can be used in powder form as filled into appropriate capsules or blisters suitable for inhalation. Alternatively, it can also be used in inhalable aerosol form. These forms also comprise powdered inhalable aerosols comprising HFA134a, HFA227 or a combination thereof as propellant gases. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Since tiotropium bromide is highly effective, only a small amount of the pharmaceutical active agent for each dose is sufficient in order to obtain desired therapeutic effect. Therefore, it is required that the pharmaceutical active agent should be diluted with a suitable excipient in order to prepare an inhalable powder. The amount of inhalable composition in each dose should be measured precisely. Due to high excipient content, inhalable powder properties are 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 significantly affected from excipient selection. Furthermore, particle size of the pharmaceutical active agent and excipient is important in terms of emptying capacity of capsule or blister used in inhaler. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The active agent particles that shall be administered by the inhalation route should optimally meet essential requirements such as appropriate aerodynamic particle size, appropriate particle shape, uniformity of particle size distribution, low aerodynamic dispersion forces, low density, high physical and chemical stability. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Furthermore, the other physical characteristics such as water absorption and ease of grinding of the pharmaceutical active agent have also significant importance. Proper production of the compositions of the abovementioned pharmaceutical active agent which are suitable for administration by inhalation depends on many parameters related to the nature of the active agent. In pharmaceutical compositions which are used in inhalable powder or aerosol forms such as tiotropium bromide, the crystalline active agent is used in ground (micronized) form in order to prepare the formulation. Since pharmaceutical quality of the pharmaceutical formulation requires active agent to always have the same crystalline modification, the stability and characteristics of the crystalline active agent are the necessities that should be complied with from this point of view. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Furthermore, micronized powders to be taken by the inhalation route which have moisture ratio as low as possible prevent the product from agglomerating and provide it to be transmitted into the target area more effectively. Therefore, one purpose of the present invention is to develop crystalline forms which have lower moisture content and are more stable as compared to the known crystalline forms. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">One purpose of the present invention is to provide salt form of tiotropium bromide having good chemical and/or physical stability and/or processability both as active agent and in preparation of pharmaceutical compositions comprising tiotropium bromide. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Another purpose of the present invention is to provide a controlled and inexpensive production process and permanently qualified and reproducible Tiotropium bromide crystalline salts. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Tiotropium bromide has therapeutic efficiency even in very low doses as the pharmaceutical active agent and this reveals the requirement that other active agents suitable for being

 administered in the form of inhalable composition should be found. Therefore, another technical problem that the present invention relates to is to prepare useful tiotropium bromide dosage forms in inhalable composition form. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The technical problem underlying the present invention has been solved by the compound (Tiotropium bromide) figured in Formula I and having monoclinic elementary cell parameters of a = 17.82 A, b =11.38 A, c = 11.71 A, β = 120.96°. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><img id="imgf000004_0001" he="59" wi="40" file="imgf000004_0001.tif" img-format="tif" img-content="drawing" orientation="portrait" inline="no"/>
 (Formula I) </p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The crystalline compound of the present invention can be mixed with suitable excipients so as to obtain an inhalable composition. The crystalline compound can be ground in order to adjust particle size exactly. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Grinding process can be applied to the crystalline compound of the present invention singly as well as applied to the crystalline compound of the present invention which is in combination with an excipient. At this point, grinding process can be performed by using the methods of hammer mill, jet mill, blade mill etc. Grinding process can be performed before preparation of the pharmaceutical composition comprising the crystalline compound of the present invention as well as during preparation of the pharmaceutical composition or before post-production storage of the pharmaceutical composition prepared. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the case that blade mill is used, pulverization process is performed by the impact of the rotating blades in the device. In the case that hammer mill is used, pulverization is performed by the impact of the rotating hammers in the device. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the case that jet mill is used, pulverization is performed by providing collision of the particles with each other with the help of high-pressured and high-speed airstream.

The crystalline compound can be stored at 40 °C without presenting any degradation or transformation. Consequently, the crystalline compound of the present invention can be used as a drug also in the countries which generally have high temperatures. The drug does not lose its effectiveness under high temperature. </p><p id="p0021" num="0021">One characteristic feature of the present invention is the pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic and therapeutically effective amount of the crystalline form of tiotropium bromide of the present invention and preparation methods thereof.
