Firstly, a master device user selects an application for detecting one or several devices that are within a short range distance. The master device looks for each present Bluetooth enabled device by sending a request for providing the master device with a Bluetooth enabled device name and a corresponding address. When one or several Bluetooth enabled devices are detected in the vicinity, the master device sends to each found Bluetooth enabled device by using its address a service discovery request, so as to discover a capability(ies) or profile(s) offered by the Bluetooth enabled device. Each slave device sends back a list of profiles that the slave device supports. The master device displays a list of the detected Bluetooth enabled device names the ones whose profile is supported as master. Then, the master device user selects one slave device which the master device user desires to establish a Bluetooth link with. The master device may exchange data with the slave device.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, such a known solution implies that the master device is equipped with a display screen for displaying data and a keyboard for selecting a device, as Man<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Machine Interface (or MMI), in particular when the master device faces several devices without being able to select one slave device, as its interlocutor.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">There is therefore a need to establish a connection between two devices while one master device is not mandatorily equipped with any MMI without installing any additional application.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the invention:</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The invention proposes a solution for satisfying the just herein above specified need by providing a method for communicating data between a first device and a second device.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the invention, a first device includes or is connected to a Man Machine Interface. The first device supports a first profile as slave. The first device supports a second profile as master. A second device supports at least the first profile as master. The method comprises the following steps. The first device, as master, sends to the second device, as slave, data relating to an address of the first device, said first device address. The second device stores the first device address. And the second device, as master, sends to the first device, as slave, data relating to an address of the second device, said second device address, by using the first profile.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The principle of the invention consists in initiating a data exchange by a first device, as master, that accesses a MMI while transmitting its address to a second device, as slave, which then uses the address of an originator or sender of the received data, to connect back, as master, by sending its own address.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is to be noticed that the first device supports two or more profiles, one profile as master and another profile as slave while the second device may support only a single profile, namely one profile as master.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">There is no need to install any application onto the first device.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Contrary to the herein above described known solution, thanks to a retrieval of an address of its interlocutor, the second device, as master, submits automatically its address to the first device, so as to establish a connection or link with the first device, as slave.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The invention solution does not require any user intervention at the second device. The invention solution is therefore user friendly.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">There is therefore no need that the second device, as master, is equipped with an MMI, so as to establish a connection with the first device.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The first device changes, during the data exchange with the second device, its profile and its role from a master role to a slave role.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">There is no need that the second device supports another profile.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Thanks to the invention mechanism, the second device is enabled to access, amongst a possible plurality of possible devices, the first device while selecting this latter through the MMI accessible from the first device.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to a further aspect, the invention is a second device for communicating data with a first device.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to the invention, a first device includes or is connected to a Man Machine Interface. The first device comprises means for supporting a first profile as slave. The first device comprises means for supporting a second profile as master. A second device comprises means for supporting at least the first profile as master. The second device is adapted to receive, as slave, data relating to an address of the first device, said first device address. The second device is adapted to store the first device address.

The token is any electronic medium that may have different form factors. The token may be a chip, as embedded chip, soldered to a host device, like a device without any display screen and no keyboard, only one button or a few buttons.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to still a further aspect, the invention is a system for communicating data.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to the invention, the system comprises a first device and at least one second device. The first device includes or is connected to a Man Machine Interface. The first device comprises means for supporting a first profile as slave. The first device comprises means for supporting a second profile as master. The second<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> device comprises means for supporting at least the first profile as master.
