For instance, the primary operating frequency range for the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) is from 1920MHz to 2170MHz. For WiFi system under IEEE 802.11 standard, in particular the primary operating frequency range of IEEE 802.11bg standard is from 2.40GHz to 2.50GHz, the primary operating frequency range of Long Term Evaluation (LTE) standard is from 1.71GHz to 2.70GHz, and the primary operating frequency range of IEEE 802.11a standard is from 5.51GHz to 5.85GHz. Additionally, according to the Ultra Wide Band (UWB) system adopting IEEE 802.15.3a standard, the primary operating frequency range is from 3.1GHz to 4.8GHz.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The current design trend for electronic device is geared toward light-weighed, miniaturization and compact designs. Hence, in order to effectively reduce the volume of antenna, the industry integrates the antenna inside the electronic device, increases the demands for planar and hidden antenna. However, the operating frequency band for conventional planar and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> hidden antenna is relatively narrow and cannot be used for different systems at same time thereby limits the applications of the associated electronic device. For example, in practice, for receiving wireless signal having lower frequency, an exposure antenna shall be used for better reception quality.
