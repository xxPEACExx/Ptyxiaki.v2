It can also enhance women's cleavage and their breasts' perceived shape. Presently, bras are mostly having wires on cups to help the cups fit close to body and conform the breast root, to create a nice profile of breast, and to give maximum push up effect. The wire is usually made of rigid metal or plastic. However, one disadvantage of the wired bra is irritation to wearer after long hours, sometimes the ends of the wire make poke the breasts causing reddish and uncomfortable. Particularly, the wire can create pressure to the wearers' armpit or cleavage between the breasts and tendency to dig into the breast tissues, causing irritation and leaving red marks. In some serious cases, the sharp end of the wire 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 could penetrate through the fabric material and scratch the skin and possibly physical injuries. In order to prevent this problem from happening, a dense wire channel is usually used to cover the wire. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">[4] There are also non-wired varieties of brassiere in the market for users who do not like wired brassieres. While not causing irritation to the breasts, the unwired brassiere cannot uplift the cleavage like a wire bra does when it is not stiff enough or it cannot conform the curvature of the breasts and can be very uncomfortable to the wearer when it is stiff enough for the uplifting or shaping effects. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">[5] International Application No. PCT/US03/18595 disclosed an anti-roll support for brassieres. It is 2D-shaped plastic sheet material which, according the </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">specification, has sufficient stiffness to provide desired lifting or holding support while readily conforms to various body curvatures for increased wearing comfort. However, this support is required to adhere directly to the fabric comprising the body-shaping garment using a film or hot melt adhesive. Because it is 2-D sheet material and is forced to conform the 3-D shaped garment fabric by an adhesive, there is a residual torque in the combined layered materials (i.e., the garment fabric layer and the plastic support layer bended to conform the shaped garment parts by an adhesive). Perhaps, this residue torque exerted by the plastic support of certain stiffness makes it undesirable to have a single integral piece of support for shaping both wearer's breasts ("a brassiere comprising a single shaped-support for supporting both breasts may be less comfortable than a brassiere comprising independent supports, and is therefore not preferred", see lines 18-21, page 7). 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 [6] In view of the prior art, there is need for a better design of unwired brassieres. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">[7] Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide an unwired brassiere which can provide uplifting and shaping effects like what are provided by a metal or plastic wire and, at the same time, provide the lightness and comfort like an unwired brassiere. This object is achieved by using a 3-dimensional shaped support, which is an integral piece for supporting both cups of the brassiere and which are embedded in the cups but harbors no residue torque. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">[8] Another object of the present invention is to provide a cost-effective method of making comfortable unwired brassieres. This object is achieved by using a single integral piece of X-shaped support for both cups of the brassiere and by including such support into the same molding process when the cups are molded. Therefore, this process of fabricating the brassiere is simple and does not significant increase the cost. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015">[9] The various features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure.

<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 figures. </p><p id="p0026" num="0026">[19] Turning first to FIG. 1, there is shown some preferred examples of the pattern design for making the 3-dimentional brassiere support of the present invention. Additional pattern examples can be found in FIG. 2. It is understood that the examples provided on FIGs. 1 and 2 are for the purpose of illustration of the present invention, but not as the limitation of its scope. The design and selection of the pattern is an important feature in practicing the present invention, because a proper pattern provides both adequate support to the breasts and comfortable wearing experience. As it is noted from the samples provided in FIG.l and FIG.2, a proper pattern should be in a general "X" shape, which can be a single piece or can be formed from two pieces with some overlapped area as shown in patterns F-G of FIG. 2. Other variations of the X shape are possible and may also provide satisfactory results. For the purpose of this invention, the "X-shape" means a shape having four forks joined at a joint point, with two left forks supporting the left cup and two right forks supporting the right cup . The X shaped support of the present invention is preferably made of 100% EVA (Ethylene Vinyl Acetate), which can be purchased in the market as common commodities. Other materials may also be used, such as, for example compressed polyurethane, fiberfill or similar materials that can form a 3- dimentional curved shape after the process of heat or cold molding or injection molding. In the particular embodiment where the EVA sheet (which can be in a form of net or mesh) was used as the starting material, the EVA sheet is cut into a designated X shape by any cutting technology used in the art, for example, manual- 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
 cutting, die-cutting (or stamp cutting), laser-cutting or CNC (computer numerically controlled) cutting. The thickness of the X shaped support can be from 0.1 to 200 mm, measured before or after compression A person of ordinary skill in the art is capable of selecting a proper material of a proper thickness and a cutting method according to the specific circumstance, which are not limitations to the scope of the present invention. The detailed steps of making X-shape supported brassiere are described in the following. </p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Making outer and inner cup panel: </p><p id="p0028" num="0028">[20] A fabric sheet is laminated to a foam sheet to form an outer cup panel and/or inner cup panel. As an example, the fabric sheet is a 100% knitted polyester fabric and the foam sheet is 100% polyurethane foam. Of course, other materials may also provide satisfactory results as the fabric sheet and the foam sheet, the selection of which are within ordinary skill of the art. The outer cup panel and the inner cup panel may be made from the same laminated panel. Or, as shown in FIG. 3, outer cup panel A and inner cup panel B may have different fabric linings (A31, B31) and/or different foam sheets (A32, B32). The outer and inner cup laminated panel may be trimmed (by manual, CNC, or die cutting) to a suitable size and shape prior to proceeding to the next step. </p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Molding Outer Cup Panel: </p><p id="p0030" num="0030">[21] The outer cup panel is placed between the male and female of a heated aluminum mold with the temperature adjusted according to the type of material 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
 used in the panel. The male and female molding halves are then closed. After a designated time passes, the halves are opened. A pair of molded cups (which may also be made one at a time) are formed. The FIG. 4 shows that a flat laminated outer panel 41 is molded into a pair of brassier cups 42. </p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Molding X-Shaped Support between Outer and Inner Cup Panels: </p><p id="p0032" num="0032">[22] Adhesive is applied on the foam surface of molded cup of the outer cup panel made from the above step, on one or both surfaces of the X-shaped support, and on the foam surface of the inner cup panel. Next, the X-shaped support is positioned on the foam surface of the inner cup panel to form a flat assembled support-inner panel (alternatively, the X-shaped support may also be positioned on the foam surface of the outer cup panel covering part of the rim area of the molded cups thereon). Then, the molded outer cup panel is placed on the female of a heated aluminum mold, followed by positioning the assembled support-inner panel on the molded outer cup panel in a way that the X-shaped support is between the outer and inner cup panels. The male of the mold is then put in position to clamp the molded outer cup, the X shaped support and the inner cup panel together for a predetermined time to produce a finished molded cup shape. FIG.5 is a 2-D view showing the relative positioning of the X shaped support 51 on the inner cup panel 52, on which engraved lines 53 are provided for final trimming. After trimming along the engraved lines by scissors, band-knife, sewing machine or stamp cutting, finished brassiere cups are formed as shown in FIG. 6. Because of the plasticity of the material of the X-shaped support, once molded, it assumes a conforming 3- 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
 dimensional shape within the finished molded cups without exerting any residual torque. While not being bound by theory, it is believed that this makes possible that both breasts can be supported by a single integral support without causing any uncomfortable feel. FIG. 8 illustrates the brassiere with X shaped support of the present invention fitted on simulated models. It is understood that the steps described above are not necessarily performed in the order as described and variations of the order are possible which can be made by a person of ordinary skill in the art. </p><p id="p0033" num="0033">[23] Optionally, an extra filling, such as, for example, polyurethane foam, fiberfill, oil sac, gel sac, air sac or silicone sac, which may be formed into a shape shown in FIG.7, can be sandwiched between outer and inner cup panels during the molding process (of course, with proper selection of the male and female of the mold so as to provide necessary room for the extra filling. </p><p id="p0034" num="0034">[24] While there have been described and pointed out fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to a preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes, in the form and details of the embodiments illustrated, may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. The invention is not limited by the embodiments described above which are presented as examples only but can be modified in various ways within the scope of protection defined by the appended patent claims.
