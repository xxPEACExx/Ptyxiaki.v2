Minimally-invasive procedures are desirable in that they allow for quicker recovery time and shorter hospital stays as compared to open surgical procedures. Minimally-invasive procedures also leave minimal scarring (both internally and externally) and reduce patient discomfort during the recovery period. However, because the interior dimensions of the entrance openings into the body are necessarily small, only elongated, small diametered instrumentation may be used to access the internal surgical site.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">During a typical minimally-invasive surgical procedure, one or more surgical cameras and/or illumination sources, e.g., one or more endoscopes, are inserted through an access portal disposed within an opening in the body and into the internal surgical site to permit the user to visualize the internal surgical site. The surgical instrumentation used to carry out the procedure to be performed is likewise inserted through the access portal and into the internal surgical site. However, in some instances, it is desirable to space-apart the surgical camera(s) from one another, the surgical instrumentation used to perform the procedure, and/or the illumination source(s), thus necessitating the use of two or more access openings. Further, where panoramic, three-dimensional, multi-angle, or multi-camera visualization of the internal surgical site is desired, multiple surgical cameras and illumination sources are inserted into the internal surgical site through the same or additional access portals. Those inserted through the same access portal take up valuable space within the access portal, necessitating a greater amount of insertion/removal/replacement of instrumentation during the procedure, while multiple access openings are required to accommodate the separate or spaced-apart insertion of the surgical cameras and illumination sources.</p><heading id="h0005"><b><u>SUMMARY</u></b></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In accordance with the present disclosure, a surgical camera assembly is provided including a camera member and a receptacle member.

Needle-shaped portion 32 of proximal end 31a of shaft 31 facilitates penetration and advancement of shaft 31 through tissue while minimizing trauma and collateral damage. Proximal end 31a of shaft 31 is configured to be at least partially received within receiving port 22 of receptacle member 20 (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2A</figref>) to mechanically engage camera member 30 and receptacle member 30 (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2A</figref>) to one another.

Although described herein as including imaging components for providing a video image of an internal surgical site, it is envisioned that camera head 34 be alternatively be configured as an illumination source, other imaging or mapping source, or any other suitable surgical tool configured to be mounted on an interior surface of tissue while also being electrically coupled to instrumentation or devices disposed exteriorly of the tissue. With respect to camera head 34 functioning as a video imaging device, camera head 34 includes one or more optical lenses 35<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> configured to project an optical image of the field of view onto an image sensor 36. Image sensor 36 is positioned to receive the optical image projected thereon by lens 35 and is configured to convert the optical image into an electrical signal. Image sensor 36 may be a CCD image sensor, CMOS image sensor, or any other suitable image sensor. Image sensor 36 is electrically coupled to one or more wires 37 that extend from image sensor 36 proximally though shaft 31, ultimately coupling to contacts 33. As such, the electrical signals representing the optical image can be transmitted from image sensor 36, across contacts 33 and 23 (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2A</figref>), to control circuitry 25 of receptacle member 20 (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2A</figref>) for transmission to a display device.

Camera head 34 may further include one or more illumination sources 38, e.g., LED's or other suitable light sources, configured to illuminate the field of view of lens 35 so as to facilitate visualization of the field of view. Illumination sources 38 may be powered and/or controlled similarly as described above with respect to image sensor 36.

Initially, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3A</figref>, an access opening "A" is made through tissue "T" to provide access to the internal surgical site "S." Alternatively, a natural body orifice may be used as the access opening "A." Next, camera member<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> 30 of surgical camera assembly 10 is inserted through the access opening "A" lead by camera head 34 so as to avoid accidental contact of needle-shaped portion 32 of proximal end 31a of shaft 31 with tissue "T." Alternatively, an access portal "P" may be positioned within the access opening "A" prior to insertion of camera member 30, such that camera member 30 may be inserted through the access portal "P" and into the internal surgical site "S." Whether camera member 30 is inserted directly through the access opening "A" or through the access portal "P" positioned within access opening "A" may depend on the user's preference, spatial considerations, or other factors.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3B</figref>, once camera member 30 has been positioned within the internal surgical site "S," camera member 30 is oriented such that camera head 34 faces in a generally inward or distal direction, while needle-shaped portion 32 of proximal end 31a of shaft 31 faces in a generally outward or proximal direction. More specifically, camera head 34 is oriented so as to generally face the area to be visualized, e.g., such that the field of view of lens 35 covers the desired area to be viewed. With camera member 30 in position as desired, camera member 30, lead by needle-shaped portion 32, is urged proximally into contact with and, ultimately, penetrated through tissue "T." Shaft 31 is advanced proximally through tissue "T" sufficiently so as to expose contacts 33 on the external, or proximal side of tissue "T," while camera head 34 remains internally disposed within the internal surgical site "S," e.g., on a distal side of tissue "T."</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3C</figref>, with shaft 31 extending proximally from tissue "T" such that contacts 33 are exposed on the external or proximal side of tissue "T," receptacle member 20 may be engaged to shaft 31, e.g., proximal end 31a of shaft 31<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> of camera member 30 may be inserted into receiving port 22 of body 21 of receptacle member 20 to mechanically engage, e.g., via friction-fit, and electrically couple, e.g., via communication between contacts 33 and 23, camera member 30 and receptacle member 20 to one another. That is, with shaft 31 extending through tissue "T," the internally-disposed camera head 34 is mechanically and electrically coupled to the externally-disposed receptacle member 20. As can be appreciated, this configuration obviates the need for a relatively large incision that allows passage of camera head 34 and/or receptacle member 20 therethrough, the need for camera assembly 20 to occupy a portion of the access portal "P," and the need for various wires or other connections extending around and/or through the access portal "P" for interconnecting camera member 30 and receptacle member 20. If not done so already, once surgical camera assembly 10 is mounted within tissue "T," the access port "P" may be positioned within access opening "A" to facilitate the insertion of surgical instrumentation therethrough during the surgical procedure.

Image sensor 36 converts the optical image into an electrical signal and communicates the electrical signal, via wires 37, contacts 33, 23, and wires 24 to control circuitry 25 of receptacle member 20. Control circuitry 25 may be configured to process the signal, e.g., to convert the signal from an analog signal to a digital signal, from a digital signal to an analog signal, or to modulate the signal.

Surgical camera array assembly 600 includes a flexible substrate 610 defining a generally rectangular configuration (although other configurations are contemplated) and having first and second ends 612, 614. Flexible substrate 610 further includes an aperture 613, 615 defined therethrough towards each end 612, 614, respectively, thereof. A contact ring 616 surrounds each aperture 613, 615. One or more camera heads 634 (similar to camera head 34 (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2B</figref>), described above) is disposed on and positioned along flexible substrate 610 between apertures 613, 615. Alternatively or additionally, illumination sources, other imaging or mapping components, or other surgical tools may be disposed along flexible substrate 610 similarly as camera heads 634. Camera heads 634 are electrically coupled to one another and/or contact rings 616 of apertures 613, 615 via wires 636 such that power, control, and/or imaging signals may be transmitted therebetween. Camera heads 634 may further be configured for releasably engagement with flexible substrate 610 such that a desired number and/or configuration of camera heads 634 (or other components) may be installed on flexible substrate 610 as desired.<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --></p><p id="p0065" num="0065">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="f0006">Figs. 8A-8B</figref>, apertures 613, 615 of flexible substrate 610 are each configured to receive a shaft 31 of a camera member 30 of a surgical camera assembly 10 (or similar components of a connection assembly 40 (<figref idrefs="f0004 f0005">Figs. 7A-7C</figref>)). Shafts 31 each include an additional contact ring 39 that is configured to interface with the contact ring 616 of the respective aperture 613, 615 upon insertion of shaft 31 therethrough, thus establishing electrical communication between camera members 30 and camera heads 634 via wires 636, contact rings 616, and contact rings 39. The needle-shaped ends 32 of shafts 31 may then be mechanically engaged and electrically coupled to receptacle members 20 such that power, control, and/or image signals may be transmitted between receptacle members 20 and any or all of the camera heads 34, 634. As can be appreciated, this configuration of surgical camera array assembly 600 allows the use of a plurality of surgical cameras within the internal surgical site "S" without requiring the puncturing of tissue "T" for mounting each surgical camera.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Continuing with reference to <figref idrefs="f0006">Figs. 8A-8B</figref>, in conjunction with <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1-2B</figref>, the insertion and mounting of surgical camera array assembly 600 for use during a minimally-invasive surgical procedure is described. Initially, flexible substrate 610, having camera heads 634 mounted thereon, is inserted into the internal surgical site "S;" camera members 30 of surgical camera assemblies 10 are inserted into the internal surgical site "S;" and shafts 31 of camera members 30 are inserted through apertures 613, 615 defined within flexible substrate 610 such that contact rings 39 and contact rings 616 are electrically coupled to one another. The insertion of flexible substrate 610, the insertion of camera members 30, and the insertion of shafts 31 through<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> apertures 613, 615 may be performed in any order.

Shafts 31 are advanced proximally through tissue "T" sufficiently so as to expose contacts 33 on the external side of tissue "T," while camera heads 34 and flexible substrate 610, including camera heads 636, remain disposed within the internal surgical site "S."</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">With shafts 31 extending proximally from tissue "T," receptacle members 20 may be engaged to shafts 31 via insertion of shafts 31 of camera members 30 into receiving ports 22 of bodies 21 of receptacle members 20 to mechanically engage, e.g., via friction-fit, and electrically couple, e.g., via communication between contacts 33 and 23, camera members 30 and receptacle members 20 to one another. In this assembled condition, surgical camera assemblies 10 are mounted within tissue "T" and flexible substrate 610 is retained via shafts 31, camera heads 34, and tissue "T." The minimally-invasive surgical procedure to be performed may then proceed, facilitated by the visualization provided by surgical camera array assembly 600. The use of surgical camera array assembly 600 for visualizing the internal surgical site "S" is similar to that described above, with any or all of the camera heads 34, 634 operating independently of one another or in cooperation with one another to provide standard, panoramic,<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> three-dimensional, multi-angle, or multi-camera visualization of the internal surgical site "S."</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">From the foregoing and with reference to the various figure drawings, those skilled in the art will appreciate that certain modifications can also be made to the present disclosure without departing from the scope of the same.
