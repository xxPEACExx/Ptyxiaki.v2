More particularly, the present application involves an occluding catheter that has at least one balloon that is inserted into the circulatory system of the patient to block blood flow and hence emboli through the carotid arteries and if needed subclavian arteries during performance of an emboligenic procedure to prevent emboli from passing through the carotid arteries and subclavian arteries and causing stroke.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Intraoperative embolic stroke is one of the most dreadful complications of cardiac, aortic and vascular procedures, diagnosed in 1-22% of patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Even more frequently, in up to 70% of cases, patients undergoing heart, valve, coronary artery bypass and aortic surgery experience subclinical embolic events as recorded by transcranial Doppler and MRI. These embolic events lead to cognitive impairment and disability and have a significant impact on patients' recovery.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The main sources of cerebral emboli and stroke in this setting reside in the heart, heart valves, thoracic aorta, and great vessels when these structures are intervened thereon. Even simple cardiac catheterization with an endovascular catheter can induce microtrauma of the atherosclerotic thoracic aorta leading to formation of embolic particles with subsequent embolic brain injury ranging from latent ischemic foci to a massive or even fatal stroke.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Multiple devices are known that attempt to prevent embolization of the carotid arteries during endovascular and cardiac interventions. These anti-embolic devices, however, have not received wide acceptance in surgery of the heart, heart valves and thoracic aorta due to their complexity and invasive character with the risk of additional trauma to the inner vessel wall resulting in a high risk to benefit ratio. Known devices require insertion of additional hardware into the arterial system or aorta, a procedure that is known by itself to be associated with all classical risks of endovascular intervention , including aortic dissection, bleeding, thrombosis, and carotid cerebral embolization and stroke. One known intra-aortic filter device that is inserted into the ascending portion of the thoracic aorta via an aortic cannula to capture potential embolic material released from the heart and aortic wall during heart surgery was found to be quite difficult to implement and was reported to be associated with major trauma to aortic wall and acute aortic dissection.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Another such device for preventing emboli into the cerebral circulation includes a porous deflector/intra-aortic shield that captures or diverts potential emboli into the distal vasculature. A yet additional device has also been proposed for use during aortic valve surgery and is an intra-aortic filter catheter that captures emboli during this procedure. It has been established that intravascular filters are not able to capture emboli smaller than the pore size of the available devices (currently 60-140 µm) resulting in cerebral microembolization. Embolization may also occur due to poor apposition of the filter to the aortic or carotid arterial wall.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Furthermore, the placement of the filter by itself may produce cerebral emboli. For example, the mere passing of a guide wire into a carotid artery generates approximately 40,000 microemboli, with a significant percentage of small, less than 60 µm, particles that are not retained by standard filters. Therefore, in spite of multiple innovations in the field of anti-embolic devices, the problem of cerebral emboli and stroke during cardiovascular surgery is far from being resolved.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is known to use balloon occlusion catheters for the prevention of embolic stroke. In this regard, the balloon occlusion catheter is placed inside of one of the carotid arteries when a procedure, for example carotid angioplasty and stenting, is conducted on the carotid artery in question. Although capable of preventing stroke when a single carotid artery is operated upon, this device cannot work to prevent stroke during procedures on the heart and aorta, endovascular or open, and cannot provide for bilateral occlusion. This device cannot simultaneously occlude both the left and right carotid arteries to prevent flow simultaneously through both of these arteries, and thus cannot prevent stroke should emboli flow into the non-blocked carotid artery.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Further, known endovascular carotid occluding devices require a guide wire to be inserted into the carotid arterial system. This procedure by itself is known to induce carotid trauma and cause the formation of cerebral emboli and resultant stroke. Still additionally, prior endovascular carotid occluding devices are not capable of reducing arterial flow through both right and left vertebral arteries, either at the same time or individually. This deficiency may allow emboli to enter vertebrobasilar circulation and cause stroke. As such, there remains room for variation and improvement within the art.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The invention will now be further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> -->

An associated method for preventing emboli 28 from entering cerebral circulation is also provided.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, a front view of a patient is shown in which emboli 28 are transferred from the aortic arch 22 into the carotid arteries 26R, 26L. The emboli 27 that are present in the carotid arteries 26R, 26L can then be transferred into the cerebral circulation causing stroke of the patient. The emboli 27 may be fragments of atherosclerotic plaque 29 of the ascending aorta 36 that become dislodged during manipulation of the ascending thoracic aorta 36. Also shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is calcification of the aortic valve 25 and intracardiac emboli 30 of the heart 21 that can also be the origin of emboli 27 eventually present in the carotid arteries 26R, 26L. The intracardiac emboli 30 may include air, gas, thrombi and atherosclerotic materials. Although all of the various emboli in the heart 21, aortic arch 22, ascending aorta 36, and aortic valve 25 need not be present in all instances, they are all shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> for sake of example. Trauma to the heart 21, aortic valve 25 and aortic structures during placement and<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> removal of items such as aortic clamps and electrophysiological instruments, along with manipulations such as coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic and mitral valve replacement, catheter ablation, endovascular grafting of the aorta 22, balloon valvuloplasty percutaneous implantation of the aortic or mitral valves, endovascular manipulations on the aorta 22, aortic branches and the heart 21 may give rise to the presence of emboli 27 in the carotid arteries 26R, 26L. Critical moments of the aforementioned procedures (for example during the aortic cross clamp manipulation, percutaneous aortic and mitral valvuloplasty or valve implantation, coronary interventions, endovascular grafting of the aorta 22 and its branches, and endovascular procedures on the aorta 22) may cause emboli 27 to form and cause stroke and are referred to as "emboligenic" events.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> discloses an occluding catheter 37 positioned within the circulatory system of the patient. The occluding catheter 37 is introduced through a right subclavian artery 23R and has a shaft 104 with a proximal end 106 located outside of the patient, and a distal end 108 positioned within the left carotid artery 26L. The occluding catheter 37 has a proximal occluding balloon 38 located closer to the health care provider and thus closer to the proximal end 106 than a distal occluding balloon 42 which is farther away from the health care provider and thus closer to the distal end 108. The proximal occluding balloon 38 may be located within an innominate artery 41 of the patient. The occluding catheter 37 can be arranged as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> so that no portion of it is located within the right carotid artery 26R. In other exemplary embodiments, some portion of the occluding catheter 37 may be located within the right carotid artery 26R. A segment 44 of the shaft 104 that is located between the proximal and distal occluding balloons 38, 42 may be located in the aortic arch 22.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The occluding catheter 37 may be inserted into the right subclavian artery 23R via right radial, brachial, axillary or subclavian artery approach and can be advanced under fluoroscopic and arterial blood pressure guidance into the innominate artery 41, aortic arch 22 and finally into the left carotid artery 26L. The ideal position of the proximal tip of the distal occluding balloon 42 may be in the proximal segment of the left carotid artery 26L, whereas the proximal occluding balloon 38 may reach the level of the innominate artery 41.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The insertion of the occluding catheter 37 may be performed when both the proximal 38 and distal 42 occluding balloons are deflated. However, once the distal occluding balloon 42 reaches the level of the aortic arch 22 it can be inflated to facilitate<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> its advancement into the left carotid artery 26L. The inflated distal occluding balloon 42 is thus naturally propelled forward into the left carotid artery 26L by arterial blood flow. The adequacy of the position of the distal occluding balloon 42 is confirmed with fluoroscopy and, if desired, by appearance of the dampened arterial pressure recorded from the end pressure measurement channel 70 through the end pressure measurement port 50 with its distal tip opening 56 located distal from the tip of the distal occluding balloon 42 downstream from the area of occlusion of the left carotid artery 26L.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Once an adequate position of the distal occluding balloon 42 in the left carotid artery 26L is achieved it may be deflated. A normal arterial blood pressure waveform as recorded from the distal tip opening 56 should reappear to confirm adequate perfusion via the left carotid artery 26L.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Correct placement of the distal occluding balloon 42 within the left carotid artery 26L may result in correct placement of the proximal occluding balloon 38 within the innominate artery 41. This is achieved by choosing an occluding catheter 37 with the longitudinal length of segment 44 between proximal and distal occluding balloons 38, 42 to be slightly larger than the distance between the left carotid artery 26L and innominate artery 41 as estimated by preoperative CT scan. According to some measurements, an optimal length of segment 44 should be 2-6 cm longer than the distance between the innominate artery 41 and the left carotid artery 26L to allow for a smooth turn of the inter-balloon portion of the occluding catheter 37 within the aortic arch 22. Considering the fact that the average distance between the orifices of the innominate artery 41 and left carotid artery 26L in the normal aortic arch 22 configuration is from 0.5-1.0 cm, the length of segment 44 between the distal and proximal occluding balloons 38 and 42 should lie within the range between 3 and 8 cm. Therefore, in practice several different sizes of the occluding catheter 37 can be constructed where the length of the segment 44 between the proximal 38 and distal 42 occluding balloons vary from 3 to 12 cm. The diameter, volume and length of the occluding balloons 38, 42 may also vary according to the patient's anatomy with the proximal occluding balloon 38 being 50-100% longer and larger than its distal 42 counterpart. The length of segment 44 may be selected so that the proximal occluding balloon 38 is located within the innominate artery 41 at the same time that the distal occluding balloon 42 is located within the left carotid artery 26L.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The next step in the method of using the occluding catheter 37 may be the inflation of the proximal occluding balloon 38 in the lumen of the innominate artery 41 and the recording of post-occlusion pressure in the distal innominate artery 41. This<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> pressure may be recorded via an opening 54 of the shaft 104 located downstream from the proximal occluding balloon 38 in the direction of arterial blood flow. An intermediate pressure measurement channel 74 is in communication with the opening 54 and with an intermediate pressure measurement port 52 at the proximal end 106. This port 52 can be used to confirm an adequate position of the proximal occluding balloon 38 by the appearance of the dampened waveform. Once the pressure measurement indicates that the proximal occluding balloon 38 is properly positioned, the proximal occluding balloon 38 can be deflated and the occluding catheter 37 is considered ready for use. The interruption of carotid flow or pulse may be assessed by angiography, carotid Doppler, or arterial pressure and waveform patterns distal to the level of occlusion in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments. In addition, percutaneous cerebral oximetery, electroencephalography and transcranial Doppler monitoring can be applied. In other arrangements, it may not be the case that this monitoring is applied in order to confirm positioning of the proximal and distal occluding balloons 38, 42.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The proximal and distal occluding balloons 38, 42 may be inflated such that they are both inflated at the same time as shown with reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>. Simultaneous inflation may lead to temporary interruption of the carotid arterial flow, preventing all potential emboli 28, released due to manipulations on atherosclerotic calcified plaques 29 of the ascending aorta 36 (or from other such emboligenic events) from entering the cerebral circulation, and diverging them downstream from the cerebral circulation into the descending aorta 24, thus protecting the patient from embolic stroke. The occluding balloons 38, 42 may be inflated to such a pressure and be of such a resiliency that they completely block any blood flow past them and through the particular artery or arteries into which they are positioned. However, it is to be understood that other arrangements are possible in which some amount of blood may flow past the proximal occluding balloon 38 and/or the distal occluding balloon 42.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> illustrates the flow of blood in the circulatory system upon inflation of the proximal and distal occluding balloons 38 and 42. Temporary interruption of flow at the level of the proximal carotid arteries 26R, 26L leads to divergence of blood flow 35 carrying all potential cerebral emboli 28 into the descending aorta 24. Emboli 28 diverted from cerebral circulation move through the descending aorta 24. The proximal occluding balloon 38 may completely block the innominate artery 41 so that no blood flow or emboli 28 may be transferred through the right carotid artery 26L and the right subclavian artery 23R. The position of the proximal occluding balloon 38 can be made<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> so that it is right at the bifurcation of the innominate artery 41 in order to completely occlude the orifice of the right carotid 26R and right subclavian 23R arteries at the same time.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Both distal and proximal occluding balloons 38, 42 are inflated just before proceeding with the part of the procedure prone to generate cerebral emboli 27. This may be the placement or removal of an aortic cross clamp, implantation of valves, endovascular grafts and stents, or other procedures outlined above. The balloon pressure required to completely interrupt flow in carotid arteries 26R, 26L at this point of intervention is usually significantly less and rarely exceed 50 mm of mercury. This consideration is based on the fact that the physician may bring the systemic perfusion pressure of the patient to minimal levels at this particular time of the procedure that involves the emboligenic event. Therefore, the occluding balloon 38, 42 pressure required to occlude carotid arteries 26R, 16L at this short period of time can be significantly lower and less damaging to the carotid arterial walls 26R, 26L.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Inflation of the occluding balloons 38, 42 can be such that they are inflated to a pressure exceeding the patient's systemic pressure by 10-20 mm Hg or more just before proceeding with the emboligenic part of the procedure. Adequate occlusion of the carotid arteries 26R and 26L will lead to a known phenomenon of a temporary reduction of flow through vertebral arteries leading to additional divergence of blood and emboli 28 away from both vertebral arteries. This will decrease the risk of stroke in vertebrobasilar circulation. Insertion of the occluding catheter 37 through the right side and inflation of the proximal occluding balloon 38 at the level of the innominate artery 41 may preclude entrance of emboli 28 into the right subclavian artery 23R and right vertebral arterial system. Insertion of the occluding catheter 37 through the left side of the patient may cause the proximal occluding balloon 38 to be at the level of the left subclavian artery 23L to preclude entrance of emboli into the left subclavian artery 23L and left vertebral arteries, and the distal balloon 32 to be at the level of the innominate artery 41, to preclude entrance of emboli into the right carotid 26R, right subclavian 23R and right vertebral arteries, further reducing the risk of embolic stroke.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The distal and proximal occluding balloons 38, 42 may be deflated 30-90 seconds after this part of the procedure is completed to achieve complete washout of all potential emboli 28 into the descending aorta 24 and distal vasculature, while avoiding migration of emboli 28 into the carotid arteries 26R and 26L. This timing, however, can be either shortened or extended depending on multiple factors that comprise the timing<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> of embolic events, their intensity and the degree of patient's tolerance to transient interruption of cerebral flow such as the degree of hypothermia and the condition of the collateral cerebral flow as measured by EEG, transcranial Doppler, or other means.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The length of most manipulations associated with a transgression of emboli into cerebral circulation rarely exceed 1-2 minutes.

The occluding catheter 37 will be next advanced over the guide wire 100 and consequently first into the innominate artery 41, then the aortic arch 22 and finally into the left subclavian artery 23L. The occluding balloon 38 extends from the level of the innominate artery 41 to the level of the left subclavian artery 23L.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The left arm is used for insertion as shown in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 15</figref>. The occluding catheter 37 is first advanced into the left subclavian artery 23L, then the aortic arch 22, and then into the innominate artery 41 and right subclavian 23R artery. The occluding balloon 38 extends through the whole distance between the left and right subclavian arteries 23L, 23R. Inflation of the occluding balloon 38 occludes the orifices 96, 94, 92, and 98 to completely prevent the emboli 28 from entering cerebral circulation via all potential ways of arterial inflow. Pressure in the right subclavian artery 23R may be measured using the distal tip opening 56, and opening of the shaft 54 can be used to measure blood pressure in the left subclavian artery 23L.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Although the occluding balloon 38 is a single occluding balloon introduced through the left arm of the patient in <figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 15</figref>, should the occluding catheter 37 include proximal and distal occluding balloons 38, 42 and be desired for insertion through the left arm the relative occluding balloon 38, 42 sizes may be varied. For example, the distal occluding balloon 42 may be larger in diameter 112 than the diameter 110 of the proximal occluding balloon 38. The distal occluding balloon 42 when inflated may block flow through the innominate artery 41, and the proximal occluding balloon 38 would block flow through the left carotid artery 26L. The segment 44 would be between the balloons 38, 42 and would be located in the aortic arch 22. The proximal portion of the occluding catheter 37 may be located within the left subclavian artery 23L. Placement may be effected by first inflating the distal occluding balloon 42 to allow arterial blood flow to naturally pull it into the innominate artery 41. The distal occluding balloon 42 may be deflated to allow for determination of the positioning of the occluding catheter 37. The proximal occluding balloon 38 may be inflated to determine its positioning as it may block flow through both the left carotid artery 26L and the left subclavian artery 23L.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Although described as blocking flow through both of the carotid arteries 26R and 26L, it is to be understood that only one of the carotid arteries 26R or 26L may be blocked in certain arrangements and uses of the occluding catheter 37.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The size and shape of the occluding balloon 28 can vary depending on the patient's anatomy and the size of the arteries discussed herein. For this purpose it may be the case that low pressure, highly compliant occluding balloons 38 of conical and ovoid shape are used with larger central segments corresponding to the patient's innominate artery 41, and aortic arch 22, and the narrower peripheral segments corresponding to the level of right and left subclavian arteries 23R and 23L. The large segment of the occluding balloon 38 should be large enough to occlude the innominate artery 41 and the orifice 92 of the left carotid artery 23L, but not too large to compromise the lumen of the aortic arch 22. It may be made sufficiently compliant to assure slight herniation into the orifices 96, 94, 92 and 98 during inflation. Thus in some arrangements, the occluding balloon 38 may extend into any one of or all of the arteries 23R, 26R, 26L and 23L.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The diameter 120 of the aortic arch 22 is larger than the diameter 110 of the occluding balloon 38 when the occluding balloon 38 is inside of aortic arch 22 and is inflated. This arrangement will block blood flow through the carotid arteries 26R, 26L but will allow for divergence of blood flow carrying the emboli 28 into the distal aorta 24 and away from the cerebral circulation. The maximal diameter 110 of this segment of the occluding balloon 38 within the aortic arch 22 may not exceed 60-70% of the diameter 120 of the aortic arch 22. In other arrangements, the diameter 110 within the aortic arch 22 may be up to 25%, up to 35%, 50%, or up to 60% of the diameter 120.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Although described as preventing emboli 28 from flowing through the carotid arteries 26R, 26L, the occluding catheter 37 may also be used to prevent emboli 28 from flowing through the right subclavian artery 23R and/or the left subclavian artery 23L. This prevention may be in addition to or alternatively to prevention of flow through the carotid arteries 26R and/or 26L.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The occluding catheter 37 may be wireless in that it can be placed within the patient without the use of a guide wire 100. When provided with a pair of occluding balloons 38 and 42, the distal occluding balloon 42 may be referred to as a "floating" balloon to allow for wireless catherization of the aortic arch 22 branches. The distal occluding balloon 42 may be fully or partially inflated and through the size of the fully or partially distal occluding balloon 42 will be propelled into one of the branches 23L, 26L, 41 of the aortic arch 22 while the occluding catheter 37 is gently advanced or pulled back (manipulated) until it reaches the target artery. The desired location of the distal occluding balloon 42 may be the left carotid artery 26L or left subclavian artery 23L if the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> occluding catheter 37 is inserted via the right arm of the patient. The desired location of the distal occluding balloon 42 may be the right subclavian artery 23R, the innominate artery 41, or the right carotid artery 26R if the occluding balloon 42 is inserted via the left arm of the patient. In other arrangements, when a single occluding balloon 38 is used instead of a distal occluding balloon 42 and a proximal occluding balloon 38, the single occluding balloon 38 may also be drawn into one of the aforementioned branches of the aortic arch 22 via natural blood flow pulling and be a wireless placement.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The occluding balloon 38, or the proximal occluding balloon 38 and distal occluding balloon 42 when two are present, and the shaft 104 are arranged so that when inflated all of the blood into the artery in question (23L, 26L, 26R, 23R and/or 41) is blocked. In this regard, no blood flows past the inflated balloon 38 or 38, 42 or the shaft 104. Blood does not flow through any channel or any portion of the shaft 104 into any of the arteries 23L, 26L, 26R, 23R and/or 41. The arteries 23L, 26L, 26R, 23R and/or 41 may be completely prevented from having blood flowing through them as per the arrangement of all portions of the occluding catheter 37. The segment 44 may be arranged so that access to an inner channel of the shaft 104 is not possible. In this regard, the segment 44 may be solid and capable of blocking blood flow such that no blood enters segment 44 when the occluding balloons 38 and 42 are inflated and are located in the patient. The shaft 104 is arranged so that blood does not flow from the aortic arch 22 into the shaft when the occluding catheter 37 is oriented in the patient and used to reduce emboli 28 through the carotid arteries 26R, 26L.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In other arrangements, the occluding balloon 38, or proximal occluding balloon 38 and distal occluding balloon 42 when two are present, and the shaft 104 are arranged so that some blood does flow into arteries 23L, 26L, 26R, 23R and/or 41. The balloon 38 or 38, 42 can be partially inflated but not inflated all the way to seal the arterial wall. The balloon 38 or 38, 42 can be made so that even if fully inflated it is small enough not to completely block blood flow to seal the arterial wall. Some amount of blood can in fact flow past the inflated balloon 38 or 38, 42 and into the various arteries 23L, 26L, 26R, 23R and/or 41. The blood that flows past is unfiltered blood. Although emboli 28 may still flow into cerebral circulation and cause stroke, even partial reduction of flow will cause a partial reduction in the chance of stroke or the severity of stroke. The occluding catheter 37 may block from 30%-50%, from 50%-70%, from 70%-90% or up to 100% of the blood flow into the various arteries 23L, 26L, 26R, 23R and/or 41 in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments. Blood that does flow into the various arteries 23L, 26L,<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> 26R, 23R and/or 41 comes directly from the aortic arch 22 and is unfiltered. As used herein, the term "occlude" is broad enough to include complete blockage of blood flow and to include partial blockage of blood flow while still allowing some unfiltered blood to flow through. Also, as used herein when referring to a "block" of blood flow, it is to be understood that this term is broad enough to cover complete blocking of blood flow and partial blocking of blood flow such that some amount of unfiltered blood flows through.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">In use, the occluding catheter 37 may be used so that partial inflation or total inflation of the occluding balloons 38 or 38, 42 is made during a medical procedure to control the blood flow through by reducing the risk of stroke while still allowing blood to enter the cerebral circulation. When fully inflated to completely block blood flow, the occluding balloons 38 or 38, 42 are solid components and not filters and do not filter emboli 28 but rather prevent everything including blood and emboli 28 from moving therethrough. The occluding balloons 38 or 38, 42 and tube sections of the occluding catheter 37 may completely block blood and emboli 28 from moving through the particular blood vessel such that no blood or emboli 28 flows through the tube sections of the occluding catheter 37 past the occluding balloons 38 or 38, 42. The occluding balloons 38 or 38, 42 and the tubular sections of the occluding catheter 37 located at the blocked area of blood/emboli 28 flow when positioned are not porous members and do not filter any blood. However, when the occluding balloons 38 or 38, 42 are deflated, partially deflated, or fully inflated but less than the diameter of the vessel they are in allow blood and emboli 28 to flow around them through the particular blood vessel and they are not filtered in any manner, although the flow rate may be decreased due to the presence of the occluding balloons 38 or 38, 42 and tubular sections of the occluding catheter 37.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">While the present invention has been described in connection with certain preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the subject matter encompassed by way of the present invention is not to be limited to those specific embodiments.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982596" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An occluding catheter (37) for preventing stroke by occluding blood flow through a carotid artery (26R, 26L) of a patient, comprising:
