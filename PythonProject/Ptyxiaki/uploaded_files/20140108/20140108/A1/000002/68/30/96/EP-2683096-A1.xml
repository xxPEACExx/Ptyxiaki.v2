In the LTE system, an OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) scheme and a SC-FDMA (Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access) scheme are being investigated as downlink and uplink radio access schemes, respectively. See <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>3GPP TR 25.814 (V7.1.1), "Physical Layer Aspects for Evolved UTRA", September 2006</text></nplcit>, for example.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the OFDM scheme, a frequency band is segmented into multiple smaller frequency bands (subcarriers), and data is carried and transmitted over the individual frequency bands. According to the OFDM scheme, the subcarriers are densely arranged on the frequency band in such a manner that the subcarriers are partially overlapped with each other without mutual interference, resulting in fast transmission and highly efficient utilization of the frequency band.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the SC-FDMA scheme, a frequency band is segmented, and different frequency bands are used among multiple terminals for transmission, resulting in<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> reduced interference among the terminals. According to the SC-FDMA scheme, variations in transmit power are reduced, resulting in lower power consumption for the terminals and wider coverage.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Also, application of transmit diversity to the LTE system is being discussed. The transmit diversity may be advantageous to improved throughput and wider coverage for user equipment (UE) or a user apparatus having a high capacity and located at a cell boundary.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the LTE system, however, the user equipment is not required to include two RF circuits. For the transmit diversity for uplinks, that is, from the user equipment to a base station apparatus, thus, some technique of implementing the transmit diversity by means of a single RF circuit is required.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">For example, according to TSTD (Time Switched Transmit Diversity), two transmit antennas are switched between each other upon the lapse of a predefined time period for alternate uplink transmissions from the transmit antennas. The TSTD may be advantageous to channels to which no scheduling is applied, for example, to RACH (Random Access Channel).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In addition, a CL-ASTD (Closed Loop-based Antenna Switching Transmit Diversity) scheme for determining which antenna is to be used for transmission based on feedback is known. The CL-ASTS scheme is advantageous to channels where scheduling is applied. In the CL-ASTD scheme, a base station apparatus (eNB: eNodeB) measures a receive quality, such as CQI, of reference signals transmitted from antennas, selects an antenna to be used for transmissions based on the measured receive quality of reference signals, and feeds the selection to a user apparatus in an antenna selection command. See<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text> 3GPP R1-080097, "Performance Evaluation of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> Closed Loop-Based ANTENNA Switching Transmit Diversity in E-UTRA Uplinks", January 2007</text></nplcit> for example.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</u></heading><heading id="h0004">[PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION]</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">On the other hand, the above-mentioned background art may have problems as follows.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The above-mentioned CL-ASTD scheme is concept-based, and no specific arrangement of the base station apparatus and the user apparatus has been proposed.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">If the CL-ASTD scheme is applied, transmissions from two transmit antennas have to be switched under control of a single RF circuit. Also, a user apparatus has to periodically transmit pilot signals for measuring CQI from transmit antennas alternately for CL-ASTD switching depending on the CQI. Specifically, the user apparatus has to use resources assigned thereto to transmit sounding reference signals in the first subframe, for example, independently of application of the transmit diversity. For example, an antenna for transmitting the sounding reference signals is determined corresponding to an antenna assigned for data transmissions.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As one example, an exemplary case where antenna #1 is selected for data transmission in a user apparatus including two antennas #1, #2 is described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. In such a user apparatus, for example, a reference signal (sounding reference signal) is transmitted for each subframe, and the antennas for transmitting the reference signals are switched at a predefined pitch. For example, the antennas for transmitting the reference signals may be switched once in four subframes. In other words, the sounding<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> reference signals are transmitted from an antenna assigned for data transmissions in three of the four subframes but from an antenna not assigned for data transmissions in the remaining one subframe.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The sounding reference signals are used for frequency scheduling in the antenna selected for data transmissions. Thus, when the number of transmissions of the sounding reference signals from the antenna selected for data transmissions is reduced, the accuracy of the scheduling will become lower. On the other hand, when the number of transmissions of the sounding reference signals from the antenna #2 not selected for data transmissions is reduced, the number of antenna switches will be reduced. In particular, communication quality becomes lower in cases of short fading pitches and frequent antenna switches.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">For example, if the fading pitch is relatively short as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the antennas are frequently switched to one with a better receive quality. In time period (1), antenna #1 has a better receive quality. In time period (2), antenna #2 has a better receive quality. In time period (3), antenna #1 has a better receive quality. In time period (4), antenna #2 has a better receive quality. In this case, when the number of transmissions of sounding reference signals from antenna #2 not selected for data transmissions is reduced, the data transmission will be made from the selected antenna #1 even in a time period with a poor receive quality, which is not desirable.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">On the other hand, if the fading pitch is relatively long as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, an antenna with a better receive quality is infrequently switched. In time period (1), antenna #1 has a better receive quality, and in time period (2), antenna #2 has a better receive<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> quality. In this case, even if the number of transmissions of sounding reference signals from antenna #2 not selected for data transmissions is reduced, variations of the receive quality is relatively small, and the number of switches of the antennas for data transmission will be reduced, which may not cause significant problems.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The present invention addresses the above-mentioned conventional problems. One object of the present invention is to provide a base station apparatus, a user apparatus and a communication control method that can properly control antenna switch pitches of transmitting reference signals in a mobile communication system where transmit diversity is applied.</p><heading id="h0005">[MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM]</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">In order to overcome the above problems, one aspect of the present invention relates to a base station apparatus in a radio communication system where transmit diversity is applied in uplinks, wherein a user apparatus including multiple antennas switches among the antennas in accordance with an antenna switch pitch transmitted from the base station apparatus and transmits a reference signal in an uplink, the base station apparatus comprising: a reference signal measurement unit configured to measure a receive level of the reference signal;

The base station apparatus 200 is connected to an upper station such as an access gateway apparatus 300, and the access gateway apparatus 300 is connected to a core network 400.

As mentioned above, the OFDM scheme is a scheme where a frequency band is segmented into smaller frequency bands (subcarriers) and data is transferred over the individual frequency bands. The SC-FDMA is a scheme where a frequency band is segmented and segmented different frequency bands are used among multiple terminals for transmission, resulting in reduction in interference among the terminals.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Communication channels in the LTE are described below.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">For downlinks, a PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) shared among the user apparatuses 100<sub>n</sub> and a LTE downlink control channel are used.
