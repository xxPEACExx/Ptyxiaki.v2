It is possible to obtain a PVA-based resin by polymerizing a vinyl ester to yield a polymer, followed by saponifying the obtained polymer according to a conventionally well-known method. In the present invention, the saponification degree of the PVA-based resin is a value measured in accordance with JIS K6726 and is required to be 94 to 98.5 mol%. The above-described saponification degree is preferably less than 98.5 mol%, and more preferably less than 98 mol%. The PVA-based resin may be a resin having vinyl alcohol units or a poly(vinyl alcohol) resin.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021"><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> The saponification degree is a value obtained by the measurement in accordance with JIS K6726. The saponification degree indicates the ratio of the units actually converted to vinyl alcohol units by saponification among units to be converted to vinyl alcohol units by saponification. Too small degree of saponification may lead to the dissolution of PVA-based resin film during manufacturing process and the lowering of polarizing properties of the polarizing film. Too large degree of saponification results in the necessity of a long time for dyeing and incapability of increasing the productivity of the polarizing film.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">A method of adjusting the saponification degree is not particularly limited. The saponification degree can be adjusted appropriately by saponification conditions, that is, hydrolysis conditions.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As the vinyl esters, vinyl acetate, vinyl formate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butylate, vinyl pivalate, vinyl versatate, vinyl laurate, vinyl stearate, vinyl benzoate and the like may be used.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The polymer obtained by polymerizing the vinyl ester may be a copolymer of the vinyl ester with other monomers. In other words, the PVA-based resin may be formed by using a copolymer<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> of a vinyl ester with other monomers. Examples of the other monomers, that is, comonomers to be copolymerized include olefins such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, and isobutene; (meth) acrylic acid and salts thereof; (meth) acrylic acid esters such as methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, n-propyl (meth)acrylate, i-propyl (meth)acrylate, n-butyl (meth)acrylate, and 2-ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate; (meth)acrylamide derivatives such as acrylamide, n-methylacrylamide, N-ethylacrylamide, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, (meth)acrylamidopropane sulfonic acid and salts thereof; N-vinyl amides such as N-vinylpyrrolidone; vinyl ethers such as methyl vinyl ether, ethyl vinyl ether, n-propyl vinyl ether, i-propyl vinyl ether, and n-butyl vinyl ether; nitriles such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile; vinyl halides such as vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride; allyl compounds such as allyl acetate and allyl chloride; maleic acid and salts thereof or esters thereof; itaconic acid and salts thereof or esters thereof; vinyl silyl compounds such as vinyl trimethoxysilane; iso-propyl acetate; and the like.

In other words, structure units derived from the vinyl ester are preferably 85 mol% or more, and more preferably 95 mol% or more, and structure units derived from the other monomers are preferably 15 mol% or less, and more preferably 5 mol% or less in 100 mol% of the total of the structure units derived from the vinyl ester and the structure units derived from the other monomers in the modified PVA. Herein, modified poly(vinyl alcohol) (modified PVA) is included in poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Examples of polymerization catalysts used in the polymerization of the vinyl ester include 2-ethylhexyl peroxydicarbonate (trade name "Trigonox EHP" made by Tianjin McEIT Co., Ltd.), 2,2'-azobis-isobutylonitrile (AIBN), t-butyl peroxyneodecanoate, bis(4-t-butylcyclohexyl)peroxydicarbonate, di-n-propyl peroxydicarbonate, di-n-butyl peroxydicarbonate, di-cetyl peroxydicarbonate, di-s-butyl peroxydicarbonate and the like. The polymerization catalysts may be used alone or in combination of two kinds or more of them.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The PVA-based resin is required to have a polymerization degree of 2500 to 3000. If the polymerization degree is in the above-described range, the PVA-based resin film is hard to be deformed in the treatment of dyeing in a solution, at the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> exposure to high temperature and high humidity, and at a contact with water. Thus, the resistance of the obtained polarizing film to water can be enhanced and the yield in the manufacturing process can be improved, and the productivity of polarizing films can be increased. A polymerization degree of the PVA-based resin is preferably more than 2500, more preferably 2550 or more, and even more preferably 2600 or more. If the polymerization degree of the PVA-based resin exceeds the above-described lower limit, or the polymerization degree is the lower limit or more, the dissolution of the PVA-based resin in a solution can be prevented when treated with a solution for dyeing. A polymerization degree of the PVA-based resin is preferably less than 3000, more preferably 2950 or less, and even more preferably 2900 or less. If the polymerization degree of the PVA-based resin is less than the above-described upper limit, or the polymerization degree is the upper limit or less, the time for dyeing can be shortened, and the productivity of polarizing films can be further increased.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">If the polymerization degree is too low, the solubility of the PVA-based resin to a solvent becomes high, resulting in a reduction in strength of the polarizing film. Further, deformation and dyeing unevenness occur in the dyeing process. Hence, if the polymerization degree is too low, polarizing films are extremely hard to be manufactured with high productivity<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> in spite of the adjustment of saponification degree from the viewpoint of shortening dyeing time. If the polymerization degree is too high, the solubility of the PVA-based resin to a solvent becomes low, resulting in the difficulty of the film formation by solution casting.
