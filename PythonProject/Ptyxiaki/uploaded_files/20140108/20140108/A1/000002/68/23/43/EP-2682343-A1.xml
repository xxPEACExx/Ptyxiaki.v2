The known apparatus is provided with a plurality of transport units that are coupled to each other and which follow a predefined track. Each of the transport units comprises a pushing member for pushing a product from the support tray at a pre-selected discharge station. The displacement of the pushing member is mechanically coupled to the displacement of the transport unit in the transporting direction when the actuator contacts the guide.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus which is suitable for transporting and controlled discharging of relatively heavy products at relatively high speed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In order to achieve this object the apparatus is adapted according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The apparatus according to the invention provides the opportunity to transport relatively heavy products and/or products at relatively high speed without unacceptable high collision forces when the actuator contacts the guide or when the pushing portion contacts a product on the support tray. In practice a product may be positioned on the support tray at a distance from the initial rest position of the pushing portion such that the pushing portion has already a certain speed upon contacting the product. Due to the resiliency the mentioned contacts occur in a smooth way, whereas the relatively low damping factor causes an additional force on the product during the pushing action which surprisingly appears to improve the discharging process of a product from the support tray. In fact the resiliency serves to absorb the collision energy upon initially contacting the product and returns the energy during pushing the product from the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> support tray. Although in practice all mass-spring systems have a certain degree of damping, the damping factor may be substantially zero. An increasing damping factor will delay and reduce the additional force on the product.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Preferably, the damping factor of the resilient connection has such a low value that the process of compression and expansion of the resiliency substantially occurs within a period of contact of the actuator and the guide. In this case the returning energy of the resiliency to discharge the product is used optimally. Of course, the speed of the pushing member, the spring constant of the resiliency and the damping factor may be adjusted with respect to each other. Their mutual relationship may also depend on weight of the pushing member and the type of products to be transported.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In a practical embodiment the resiliency is provided between the pushing portion and the guide. Preferably the resiliency is present as close to the actuator as possible in order to maximize the suspended portion of the pushing member. This reduces the collision forces when the actuator hits the guide. Furthermore, if the resiliency is close to the pushing portion, for example adjacent to the pushing portion at the upper side of the support tray this will take space at the upper side of the support tray which requires relatively wide trays.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In a specific embodiment the actuator itself is resilient so as to form the resiliency. For example, the actuator comprises a wheel that is provided with a tyre or curved spokes.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Alternatively the actuator may be connected to the pushing portion through an arm which is rotatably and resiliently coupled to the pushing portion or the actuator may be connected to the pushing portion through a linear spring. In the latter case the linear spring preferably extends parallel to the direction of displacement of the pushing portion with respect to the support tray.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In a specific embodiment the pushing member forms a substantially closed construction that surrounds the support tray in a plane extending transversely with respect to the direction of displacement of the pushing member with respect to the support tray. This creates a rigid structure of the pushing member such that deformation thereof under operating conditions is minimized.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The transport unit may be provided with a pushing member guide along which the pushing member is mainly guided in the direction of displacement of the pushing member under operating conditions, wherein the pushing member guide may extend at the underside of the support tray. This means that the pushing member above the support tray and/or the side edges thereof may be substantially free from contact with the support tray. Nevertheless, one or more support elements may be present, for example between the pushing member and the support tray, in order to avoid tilting of the pushing member about the pushing member guide.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In a preferred embodiment the pushing member guide extends substantially at the centre of the support tray as seen in the transport direction. This provides an even distribution of forces at opposite sides of the pushing member guide under operating conditions which minimizes frictional forces between the pushing member and the pushing member guide.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The invention will hereafter be elucidated with reference to the very schematic drawings showing embodiments of the invention by way of example.

The apparatus 1 is suitable for transport and controlled discharge of products 2. The apparatus 1 comprises a plurality of transport units 3 and driving means (not shown) for transporting the transport units 3 in a transporting direction X. The transport units 3 may be coupled to each other via a chain or belt which may serve as a driving means, as well. In the embodiment as shown the transport units 3 follow a curved path as seen from above. Additionally, the path may also vary in vertical direction. Each transport unit 3 includes a support tray 4 which is suitable for supporting at least a product 2. In practice the support trays 4 and the products 2 have such dimensions that the width of a support tray 3 in the transport direction X is larger than that of the product 2.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> also shows a row of discharge stations 5 where under operating conditions the products 2 are removed from the support trays 4.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Each transport unit 3 is provided with a pushing member 6 which is displaceable with respect to the support tray 4 transversely with respect to the transporting direction X. This means that the pushing member 6 is able to push a product 2 laterally from the support tray 4 when the transport unit 3 passes the row of discharge stations 5. The pushing members 6 of the transport units 3 are activated by guides 7 which guide actuators 8 of the pushing members 6. The guides 7 extend obliquely with respect to the transporting direction X and are mounted to a frame (not shown) of the apparatus 1 below the transport units 3. The<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> actuators 8 are also located at the underside of the support trays 4. Guide actuators 9 determine whether an actuator 8 will follow the corresponding guide 7 or not. If the guide actuator 9 is activated the passing actuator 8 of the pushing member 6 is directed to the corresponding guide 7 and the pushing member 6 is displaced in transverse direction. If a product 2 is present on the support tray 4 it will be pushed from the support tray 4 to one of the discharge stations 5. In this case the actuators 8 are wheels, but alternative types of actuators 8 are conceivable. After the transport units 3 have left the discharge stations 5 the actuators 8 are returned to their initial positions by return guides (not shown). This means that the pushing members 6 are also returned to their initial position.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> shows the functioning of the apparatus 1 in more detail. In the situation as shown the guide actuator 9a is not activated which means that the passing actuator 8a of the corresponding transport unit 3a is not directed to the guide 7a. As a consequence the pushing member 6a is not displaced and the product 2a remains on the support tray 4a. The guide actuator 9b is activated by turning it anti-clockwise such that the passing actuator 8b of the corresponding transport unit 3b contacts the guide actuator 9b and is directed to the guide 7b. The pushing member 6b will now be displaced and the product 2b will be pushed from the support tray 4b. This process has already happened with the transport unit 3c, corresponding actuator 8c and pushing member 6c, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3a-f </figref>show the transport unit 3 in different conditions in more detail as seen from below. The support tray 4 supports a product 2 and is provided with a pushing member 6. The transport unit 3 is transported in the transporting direction X. According to the invention the pushing member 6 is provided with a pushing portion 10 and the actuator 8. In this case the pushing portion 10 is formed by a frontal part of the pushing member 6 at the upper side of the support tray 4 and contacts the product 2 upon pushing<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the product 2 from the support tray 4. The pushing member 6 is formed by a pushing member frame that surrounds the support tray 4. The pushing portion 10 is present above the support tray 4 and the actuator 8 below the support tray 4. The frame-shaped pushing member 6 provides a rigid structure and can be built relatively compact and light with respect to conventional pushing members which do not form a closed frame about the support tray. On the contrary, known pushing members typically are U-shaped, wherein the upper leg of the U-shaped pushing member functions as the pushing portion and the lower leg comprises the actuator.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As described hereinbefore the actuator 8 is guidable along the guide 7 such that under operating conditions the pushing portion 10 is displaced with respect to the support tray 4 upon moving the transport unit 3 in the transporting direction X when the actuator 8 contacts the guide 7.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the embodiment as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3a-f</figref> the pushing member 6 is guidable along a pushing member guide 11 which is present at the underside of the transport unit 3. Due to the frame-shaped pushing member 6 as described hereinbefore the torque about an upwardly directed axis that is exerted by the pushing member 6 on the pushing member guide 11 upon pushing a product 2 is relatively low.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Furthermore, the actuator 8 is rotatably connected to the remainder of the pushing member 6, or in this case the pushing portion 10, via an arm 12. The arm 12 is also resiliently connected to the remainder of the pushing member 6 by means of a spring 13. This means that the pushing portion 10 is resiliently connected to the actuator 8. In a broader definition the pushing portion 10 is resiliently connected to the frame (not shown) of the apparatus 1 when the actuator 8 contacts the guide 7. It is noted that in this case the guide 7 is fixed to the frame, but it is also possible that the guide 7 is resiliently mounted to the frame.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3a</figref> illustrates a condition in which the guide actuator 9 is already activated but in which the actuator 8 does not contact the guide actuator 9 yet. In the condition as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3b</figref> the actuator 8 contacts the guide actuator 9 and the pushing member 6 starts to move in transverse direction indicated by arrow Y. It can be seen that due to the contact between the actuator 8 and the guide actuator 9 the arm 12 first turns anti-clockwise while the pushing portion 10 accelerates in transverse direction Y. In a next condition as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3c</figref> the spring 13 forces the pushing portion 10 back to the original position with respect to the actuator 8; the relative position of the arm 12 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3c</figref> is now substantially similar to the initial condition as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3a</figref>.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">After a certain displacement of the pushing member 6 in transverse direction Y the pushing portion 10 will contact the product 2 on the support tray 4. This condition is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3d</figref>. The pushing portion 10 tends to decelerate upon hitting the product 2 which is possible by the presence of the spring 13. However, the movement of the transport unit 3 in the transport direction X continues. As a rersult the arm 12 has turned anti-clockwise when comparing the conditions as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3d and Fig. 3c</figref>. The angle of rotation of the arm 12 will be larger when the speed of the pushing member 6 in transverse direction Y is higher and/or the product 2 is heavier. Of course, the spring constant and damping factor may be of influence. It will be clear that due to the spring 13 a collision between the pushing portion 10 and the product 2 is smoothened.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In a next condition as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3e</figref> the spring 13 forces the pushing portion 10 back to the original position with respect to the actuator 8. The relative position of the arm 12 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3e</figref> is now substantially similar to the condition as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3c</figref>. An additional advantage of the spring effect is that due to the spring force the product 2 will be accelerated which improves the discharge of the product 2 from the transport<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> tray 4. <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3f</figref> shows a condition in which the pushing member 6 has reached a final position and the product 2 has been pushed away from the support tray 4.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">According to the invention the damping factor of the resilient connection between the pushing portion 10 and the frame of the apparatus 1 has such a low value that the process of compression and expansion of the resiliency at least partly occurs within a period of contact of the actuator 8 and the guide 7. In practice, this means that the arm 12 of the embodiment as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3a-f </figref>may rotate clockwise upon contacting a product 2 and immediately back within the period of contact of the actuator 8 and the guide 7. This provides the opportunity to use the spring force to accelerate the product 2 within the final phase of the discharging process, as described hereinbefore. The damping factor may be close to zero, although in practice there will always be a certain degree of damping. In any case, the damping factor is smaller than a highly energy absorbing material like a shape memory foam. A practical coefficient of the spring 13 is 1-1.5 N per degree angle of rotation of the arm 12, but higher or lower coefficients are possible.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4a-c</figref> show an alternative embodiment of a transport unit 3, in which a linear spring 14 is applied.

In the condition as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4b</figref> the pushing portion 10 and the linear spring 14 are in a rest condition. <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4c</figref> shows a condition in which the actuator 8 contacts the guide 7; due to the inertia of the pushing portion 10 the linear spring 14 is compressed. In a next condition (not shown) the linear spring 14 will expand until a product 2 on the support tray 4 is hit. Upon contacting the product 2 the linear spring 14 will be compressed again. In this embodiment the linear spring 14 extends parallel to the pushing member guide 11. The centre lines of the linear spring 14, the pushing member guide 11<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> and the actuator 8 extend substantially in the same upwardly directed plane.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Figs. 5a-f </figref>shows different views of an alternative embodiment of a transport unit 3. <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5a</figref> is a plan view of the transport unit 3 and <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5b</figref> is a sectional view thereof as seen along the line Vb-Vb in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5a.

In the embodiment as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Figs. 5a-f </figref>the arm 12 and spring 13 are shown, as well. The transport tray 4 has an upper surface 15, which is substantial flat in this embodiment.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In the embodiment as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Figs. 5a-f</figref> the structure of the pushing member 6 is shown in more detail. The pushing member 6 forms a substantially closed construction that surrounds the support tray 4 in a plane extending transversely with respect to the direction of displacement of the pushing member 6. In the embodiment as shown the pushing member 6 comprises a horizontally oriented upper element 6a' which extends above the support tray 4, a lower element 6b' which extend below the support tray 4 and two opposite side elements 6c', 6d' which each join end portions of the upper and lower elements 6a', 6b'. Preferably, the elements 6a'-d' are substantially free from the support tray 4 in order to minimize friction during displacement of the pushing member 6 along the support tray 4. Due to these features the pushing member 6 appears to be a rigid construction. This allows to create only a small distance between the upper element 6a' and the upper surface 15 without hitting each other due to deformation of the pushing member 6 under operating conditions. It is also advantageous when the side elements 6c' and 6d' are plate-shaped since this minimizes the width of the transport units 3 in the transporting direction X.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The lower element 6b' of the pushing member 6 is mounted to the pushing member guide 11. The pushing member<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> guide 11 extends at the underside of the support tray 4 and may be a straight rod, having a rectangular cross section for example. In this case the pushing member guide 11 extends substantially at the centre of the support tray 4 as seen in the transport direction. Furthermore, the actuator 8 is positioned such that a force from the guide 7 on the pushing member 6 substantially engages at the pushing member guide 11. Since the pushing member guide 11 of the embodiment as shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 5f</figref> has a rectangular cross-section a tilting movement of the pushing member 6 about the centre line of the pushing member guide 11 is avoided. <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> shows an alternative embodiment in which the pushing member guide 11 has a circular cross-section. Since in this case the pushing member 6 tends to tilt about the centre line of the pushing member guide 11 the pushing member 6 is provided with rollers 16. It is noted that under operating conditions the pushing member 6 is mainly guided by the pushing member guide 11 in the displacement direction of the pushing member 6, whereas the rollers 16 only avoid a rotational movement of the pushing member 6 about the pushing member guide 11.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In general terms, the pushing member guide 11 supports the pushing member 6 at least in a direction parallel to the transporting direction X, and additionally also upwardly and/or downwardly. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> the pushing member 6 is supported downwardly entirely by the pushing member guide 11 and upwardly mainly by the pushing member guide 11 and only partly by the upper surface 15 of the support tray 4. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 5f</figref> the pushing member 6 is supported upwardly and downwardly entirely by the pushing member guide 11.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">It is noted that the embodiment as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Figs.5a-f </figref>is not necessarily associated to the features related to the spring effect as described hereinbefore.
