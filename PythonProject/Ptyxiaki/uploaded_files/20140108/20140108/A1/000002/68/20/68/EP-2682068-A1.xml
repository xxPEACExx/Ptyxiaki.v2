As capabilities of computers and software improve, practitioners of dentofacial surgery increasingly use computer-aided dentofacial imaging tools in order to model dentofacial features of patients, diagnose diseases, injuries, and defects, plan dentofacial surgical procedures and other treatments, and educate patients regarding diagnoses and treatments.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, to educate a patient regarding a potential change in physical appearance resulting from dentofacial treatment, a practitioner may desire to present the patient with a "before" image of the patient prior to treatment, an "after" image depicting the patient following treatment, and an animation or "morph" between the before and after images. Traditionally, morphing is accomplished by manually marking key features on a first image, such as the contour of the nose or location of an eye, and manually mark where these same points existed on the second image, creating multiple pairs of line segments. Software would then create an animation whereby the first image would slowly distort to have the features of the second image at the same time that it cross-faded between the two images. However, such manual marking of features may be time-consuming and thus, undesirable.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As another example, to plan and simulate a dentofacial surgery, a practitioner may, with the aid of a computer-aided<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> tool, virtually modify various bones or bone segments of the patient via a user interface of a computer. Such computer-aided planning and simulation may allow a practitioner to simulate effect of various surgical adjustments on a patient, including effects on a patient's aesthetic appearance.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><u>SUMMARY</u></heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure, disadvantages and problems associated with traditional approaches to surgical planning using dentofacial imaging may be substantially reduced or eliminated.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, a method for generating an animated morph between a first image and a second image is provided.

For example, the computer-aided surgical planning tool may read a radiograph or other image and based on the content of such image, generate one or more portions of a cephalometric tracing and/or identify one or more cephalometric landmarks. Alternatively or in addition, the computer-aided surgical planning tool may display a radiograph or other image and a practitioner may, via a user interface of the surgical planning tool, use the image as a guide to construct the cephalometric tracing of the bony and soft tissue features<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> and/or identify one or more cephalometric landmarks.

In some embodiments, the surgical planning tool may be configured to detect and align corresponding features of image 202 and cephalometric tracing 100 and align image 202. In other embodiments, the surgical planning tool may be configured to permit a user via a user interface to adjust image 202 and/or cephalometric tracing 100 in order to align features. Once image 202 and cephalometric tracing 100 are aligned as desired, various cephalometric landmarks (e.g., landmarks 102-130) may be stored as part of profile image 202 (e.g., as metadata in a digital file of profile image 202).</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Planned post-surgical cephalometric tracing 206 may be created from pre-surgical cephalometric tracing 100 by a<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> practitioner interacting with the computer-aided surgical planning tool to modify (e.g., with a mouse or other similar user input device) cephalometric tracing 100 and/or locations of cephalometric landmarks to obtain desired post-surgical characteristics. For example, computer-aided surgical planning tool may warp cephalometric tracing 100 in response to user input, according to well-known methods. The computer-aided surgical planning tool may store (e.g., to a computer-readable medium) planned post-surgical cephalometric tracing 206 and its associated cephalometric landmarks (as modified).</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Planned post-surgical image 204 may be created from pre-surgical image 202 based on differences between planned post-surgical cephalometric tracing 206 and pre-surgical cephalometric tracing 100. For example, based on differences of locations of elements of cephalometric tracings 100 and 206 and/or differences in locations of cephalometric landmarks, computer-aided surgical planning tool may warp image 202 according to well-known methods to align corresponding features of planned post-surgical image 204 and planned post-surgical cephalometric tracing 206. After creation of planned post-surgical image, the computer-aided surgical planning tool may store (e.g., to a computer-readable medium) modified cephalometric landmarks as part of planned post-surgical image 204 (e.g., as metadata in a digital file of planned post-surgical image 204).</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURES 3A</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">3B</figref> illustrate another example user interface screen 300 of a computer-aided surgical planning tool, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURE 3A</figref>, user interface screen 300 may include three panes displaying pre-surgical image 202, planned post-surgical image 204, and animation mid-point<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> frame image 302. Also as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIGURE 3A</figref>, the computer-aided surgical planning tool may also load and display on each of pre-surgical image 202 and planned post-surgical image 204 various cephalometric landmarks 102-130 and line segments 304 between adjacent cephalometric landmarks. Accordingly, each line segment 304 of image 202 has a corresponding line segment 304 in image 204 (e.g., line segment 304 between soft tissue glabella 102 and soft tissue nasion 104 of image 202 corresponds to line segment 304 between soft tissue glabella 102 and soft tissue nasion 104 of image 204, and so on).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As is known in the art, metamorphosis from one image to another (e.g., creating a "morph") typically includes creation of an animation that gradually cross-dissolves between the first image and the second image, while at the same time warping the first image into the second image. Thus, often the middle frame of the animation is an average of the first image distorted and cross-faded halfway towards the second image and the second image distorted and cross-faded halfway towards the first image.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As is known in the art, warping from one image to another may include establishing one or more line segments on the first image each associated with a particular feature, and a corresponding line segment in the second image for each line segment of the first image. Each intermediate frame of the animation may defined by creating a new set of line segments by interpolating the line segments from their positions in the first image to their positions in the second image. Both images are distorted toward the position of the line segments in each intermediate frame, and the two resulting images are cross-dissolved throughout the animation. Each pixel of the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> images may be distorted by a rotation, translation, and/or a scale based on its distance and relationship to each of the line segments.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">To facilitate creation of an animation between pre-surgical image 202 and planned post-surgical image 204, the computer-aided surgical planning tool may, as described above, generate a plurality of line segments 304 for pre-surgical image 202 and a plurality of corresponding line segments 304 for post-surgical image 204 based on cephalometric landmarks and display such line segments 304. In addition, the computer-aided surgical planning tool may allow a user to define and display additional pairs of line segments for other features (e.g., an ear, hairline, clothing neckline, etc.) to further enhance the quality of the animation.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In addition, as described above, the computer-aided surgical planning tool may display animation mid-point frame image 302. Mid-point frame image 302 may represent the middle frame of the animation between image 202 and image 204 using the corresponding pairs of line segments 304 generated by the computer-aided surgical planning tool and any corresponding pairs of line segments defined by a user. Such mid-point frame image 302 may provide a visual guide to the user, potentially identifying features for which a user may desire to define associated line segments in order to create a higher-quality animation. For example, mid-point frame image 302 may indicate areas of non-overlap or ghosting of the halfway-distorted pre-surgical image 202 and halfway-distorted planned post-surgical image 204 for which a user may define additional pairs of line segments.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Generation of line segments 304 by the computer-aided surgical planning tool may reduce the effort required by a<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> user to generate an animation, as it may reduce or eliminate the need for a user to define numerous line segments required for a quality metamorphosis between images. This advantage may be seen by reference to <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGURE 3B</figref>, which depicts mid-point frame image 302 in the absence of line segment 304 pairs in images 202 and 204. As evident from <figref idrefs="f0004">FIGURE 3B</figref>, the absence of line segment 304 pairs in images 202 and 204 may lead to significant areas of non-overlap or ghosting of the halfway-distorted pre-surgical image 202 and halfway-distorted planned post-surgical image 204, requiring a user to manually define many line segment pairs in order to create a quality animation.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIGURE 4</figref> depicts a block diagram of an example computing system 1200, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure.
