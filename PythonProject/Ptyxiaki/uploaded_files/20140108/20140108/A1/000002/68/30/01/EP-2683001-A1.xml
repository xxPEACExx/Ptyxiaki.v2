The lithium ion secondary battery 1000 includes a cap assembly 100 and a can 80. The can 80 is substantially cylindrical and made of metal. The can 80 is hollow and a lower end of the can 80 is enclosed and an upper end of the can 80 defines an opening. The can 80 is configured for containing a rolled electrode assembly and electrolyte. The cap assembly 100 is mounted to the upper end of the can 80 to enclose the opening of the can 80.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The cap assembly 100 includes a cap cover 10, a leakproof film 20, a cap plate 30, and an outer gasket 40.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The cap cover 10 is made of metal such as copper or aluminum by a stamping process. The cap cover 10 is substantially circular and includes a base portion 11, two inclination portions 12, and a top portion 13. The base portion 11 is an annular plate. Each inclination portion 12 is in a strip shape and extends from an inner periphery of the base portion 11. Each inclination portion 12 is slant to the base portion 11 and extends toward the other inclination portion 12. The top portion 13 is also in a strip shape and is connected between the inclination portions 12. The top portion 13 is parallel to the base portion 11. The cap cover 10 defines two cover through holes 14 symmetrically distributed at two sides of the top portion 13. An outer periphery of the base portion 11 is rough and includes a plurality of burrs.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The leakproof film 20 is circular. A diameter of the leakproof film 20 substantially corresponds to an outer diameter of the base portion 11 of the cap cover 10. The leakproof film 20 is made of rubber with high temperature resistance, elasticity, and anti-aging properties.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The cap plate 30 is made from an aluminum sheet by stamping. The cap plate 30 includes a supporting portion 31 and a safety film 32. The supporting portion 31 is substantially annular in shape, which is similar to the shape of the base portion 11. The safety film 32 is circular and positioned in the center of the supporting portion 31. In the embodiment, the supporting portion 31 and the safety film 32 are integrally formed. The security film 31 defines two circular safety grooves 33. The safety grooves 33 are coaxial with each other and an outer safety groove 33 is formed between the supporting portion 31 and the safety film 32. The cap<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> plate 30 also includes a cylindrical side wall 34 extends from an outer periphery of the supporting portion 31. The safety film 32 is substantially dome-shaped and convex to a direction opposite to a direction that the side wall 34 extending.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The outer gasket 40 is made of poly ethylene-propylene with high temperature resistance and insulative properties. The poly ethylene-propylene is one kind of material that well known in the art. The outer gasket 40 is generally a hollow cylinder and includes a circular enclosure end 41 and a circular mounting end 42 opposite to the enclosure end 41. A diameter of the enclosure end 41 is greater than a diameter of the mounting end 42. The outer gasket 40 defines a stepped through hole 43 passing through the enclosure end 41 and the mounting end 42. A diameter of the stepped through hole 43 adjacent to the enclosure end 41 corresponds to an outer diameter of the base portion 11. The outer gasket 40 also includes an annular lug 44 extending radically inwardly from the enclosure end 41.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The cap assembly 100 also includes a holding plate 50 and an inner gasket 60. The holding plate 50 is circular and defines three air passing holes 51. The inner gasket 60 is made of polytetrafluoroethylene. The polytetrafluoroethylene is one kind of material that well known in the art and with high temperature resistance property and does not deform under a high temperature at about 350 centigrade degrees.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The cap assembly 100 also includes an enhancing plate 70. The enhancing plate 70 is annular and defines a passage hole 71. An outer diameter of the enhancing plate 70 corresponds to an outer diameter of the cap plate 30. A diameter of the passage hole 71 corresponds to a diameter of the safety film 32.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">When assembling the lithium ion secondary battery 1000, the enhancing plate 70 is received in the side wall 34 and attached to the supporting portion 31 to enhance to the supporting portion 31. The enhance plate 70 presses on the supporting portion 31 and surrounds the safety film 32. The leakproof film 20 is received in the side wall 34 and is attached on the enhancing plate 70, namely the enhancing plate 70 is clamped between cap plate 30 and the leakproof film 20. The cap cover 10 is received in the side wall 34 with the burrs of the cap cover 10 compactly contacting an inner surface of the side wall 34. A height of the burrs is about 0.1 millimeter. As the burrs can make the cap 10 more compactly contact with the side wall 33, it prevents the cap cover 10, the security film 20, and the enhancing plate 70 from falling off from the cap plate 30. Then a periphery of the side wall 34 is welded to the a surface of the base<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> portion 11 opposite to the safety film 20 by an ultrasonic welding process. The ultrasonic welding process is well known in the art. The cap plate 30 is received in the outer gasket 40 with the supporting portion 31 being attached on the annular lug 44 of the outer gasket 40. The holding plate 50 is assembled to the rolled electrode assembly. The inner gasket 60 is received in the annular lug 44 of the outer gasket 40 and is mounted on the holding plate 50. The inner gasket 60 presses on the holding plate 50. The outer gasket 40 is received in the opening of the can 80. The inner gasket 60 is positioned between the holding plate 50 and the cap plate 30 to isolate the holding plate 50 and the cap plate 30. The cap plate 30 encloses the can 80. Electrode tabs of the rolled electrode assembly pass through the air passing holes 51 and are welded to a vertex of the safety film 31.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, in use, when an accident such as a short circuit or a collision occurs to the lithium ion secondary battery 1000, it results in the temperature of the electrolyte rapidly rising to about 100 to 200 centigrade degrees, the electrolyte is evaporated, and the internal pressure of the lithium ion secondary battery 1000 rising to a certain limitation. Because the safety film 32 made of aluminum is very soft, the safety film 32 will break down along the safety grooves 33. Therefore, an electrical circuitry formed by the lithium ion secondary battery 1000 is cut off. Because the leakproof film 20 is made of rubber with high temperature resistance, anti-aging, and elasticity properties. The leakproof film 20 won't break. The leakproof film 20 deforms to form two balloon portions 21 protruding out the cap cover 10 from the cover through holes 14 for receiving evaporated electrolyte. Therefore, it can prevent the electrolyte leak out from the can 80. When the temperature of the electrolyte drops, the leakproof film recovers to an initial state, and the evaporated electrolyte is liquefied and drops into the can 80 again.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In alternative embodiments, the leakproof film 20 is not limited to rubber but can be other material with high temperature resistance, elasticity, and anti-aging properties.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> show a lithium ion secondary battery 2000, according to a second embodiment.
