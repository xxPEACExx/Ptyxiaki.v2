Each of the two halves are collected by two cups, which face and compress them against two squeezing balls, from which the peels fall into a collection tray once the squeezing is complete.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Although they allow the two halves to be juiced at the same time, these machines present the disadvantage of being relatively large because they have two cups and two juicing balls, which prevents them from being installed in establishments where there is little space available.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Description of the invention</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">The object of the present invention is a fruit juice machine, of the variety initially mentioned, which is small in size in relation to the size of traditional machines, thus facilitating its installation in establishments with less available space.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The machine, object of the invention, is of the variety comprising a fruit feed chute, fruit cutting and squeezing means and a collection cup for the peel.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The fruit cutting and squeezing means comprise a single fruit reception cup and a single squeezing ball.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The fruit reception cup is located below the fruit feed chute and is related to means which initiate its rotation between a vertical fruit reception position and an inverted position. The cutting means also include a horizontal tilting blade that faces the rotating trajectory of the cup, to cut the fruit in an upper and lower half. The upper half of the two halves is intercepted by a retaining stop, whilst the lower half is dragged by the cup during its rotation from the vertical position to the inverted position, resting and being conducted by a ramp located below the cup. The squeezing ball is located below the cup, the machine also including means to vertically displace the cup in an inverted position and the ramp upon which the fruit rests, in a synchronized manner, from the upper inverted position of said cup to a lower position wherein the lower half of the fruit housed in said cup is pressed against the squeezing ball.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The means to initiate the rotation of the cup comprise a horizontal rotating axis, on which said cup is mounted, a pinion joined together with said axis and a vertical rack which can be vertically displaced, to which the pinion is geared. The means to vertically displace the cup are formed by a rail bearing the axis of the cup which can be vertically displaced along vertical guides between upper and lower limit positions, wherein the cup is found, respectively, in the upper and lower inverted positions. The rail is pushed towards the upper position by means of a spring.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The aforementioned vertical rack is part of a vertical plate mounted between vertical guides and related to a motor mechanism. This vertical plate may be displaced along the aforementioned guides along the length of a vertical trajectory which comprises an upper section, along which it initiates the rotation of the cup, between the upper vertical and inverted positions and a lower section, along the length of which it drags the rail and the cup between the upper and lower inverted positions of said cup.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The fruit feed chute is composed of a fruit conducting channel and a fruit supplying platform. The platform is supported by a vertical piston rod which rests on a magnet joined with the plate of the rack by means of a bent arm when said rack is at the highest point of its vertical trajectory. The fruit feed chute is synchronized in such a way that it feeds an orange every other time the cup travels, corresponding to the squeezing of the two halves of an orange.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The blade designed to cut the fruit is mounted onto a horizontal axis, upon which it may tilt transversally between minimum and maximum inclination positions. This axis bears a probe which is retained, with the blade in the minimum inclination position, through a releasable rear stop and is also propelled by means of a spring towards the minimum inclination position of the blade. The probe receives the action of the plate of the rack when this plate reaches the highest point of its vertical trajectory, in order to initiate the tilting of the blade from the maximum inclination position to the minimum inclination position.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The synchronization mechanism of the platform with the blade is composed of an auxiliary wheel 30 and is mounted onto a horizontal axis bearing a toothed wheel upon which a ratchet acts, mounted onto the plate of the vertical rack, when said plate reaches the highest point of its vertical trajectory.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">A horizontal rail bearing the rear stop of the probe is mounted onto the axis bearing the auxiliary wheel 30 and may be displaced longitudinally between the front and rear positions. The front position defines a front stop for the bent arm just as the rear stop for the probe, when the plate of the rack is displaced from the highest position<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> of its vertical trajectory. The rail may be displaced from its rear position towards the front position by means of the toothed wheel and ratchet whilst it may be displaced in the opposite direction by means of a spring.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The ramp supporting the lower half of the fruit dragged by the cup is mounted onto a skid which may be displaced between vertical guides; a bearing is located on this skid through which it rests on the periphery of a vertical plate, rotating around a horizontal axis, presenting a contour which determines the vertical displacement of the bearing.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>Brief description of the drawings</b></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">The attached drawings are a non-limiting example of a machine built according to the invention:

A fruit reception cup 3, a horizontal tilting blade 4 to cut the fruits collected by the cup 3 into an upper and lower half, a retaining stop 5 of the upper half of the fruit cut by the blade 4, a squeezing ball for the fruit halves cut by the blade 4 and a ramp 7 to conduct the fruit halves cut by the blade 4 towards the squeezing ball 6 are arranged below the fruit feed chute. Lastly, the machine has a tray 8 to collect the peel.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The various squeezing steps will be presented below, with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006">figure 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As shown in position "a" of a previous step, an orange 38 is placed in the cup 3, whilst other oranges 39 are located in channel 1, retained by platform 2.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The activation of the action motor by means the rod 16 and crank 17 set, as presented below, will initiate the rotation of the cup 3 towards the right, position "b", whilst the blade 4 remains in a fixed position. As a result, the orange rests on and is displaced onto the blade and is cut in two halves, an upper half 40 and a lower half 41. The stop 5 retains the upper half 40 of the orange and allows the passage of the lower half 41, dragged by the cup 3.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In position "c", the stop 5 retains the upper half orange 40, whilst the lower half 41 continues its displacement, resting on ramp 7, which prevents it from falling from the cup 3, until this cup reaches the inverted position, with the lower half orange 41 resting on ramp 7, step "c". Next, the cup 3 and the ramp 7 descend simultaneously until they rest on and compress the lower half orange 41 against the squeezing ball 6, step "e". Once squeezing is complete, the cup 3 ascends, step "f" and leaves the peel 41' on the squeezing ball 6, whilst the ramp 7 remains still. The rotation of the cup 3 then begins, step "g" towards the initial vertical position, whilst the ramp 7 begins to ascend, step "h" and extracts the peel 41', steps "i" and "j", in the second of which the cup 3 has reached its upper position. Next, the cup 3 and the blade 4 rotate in a synchronized manner, step "k" and the upper half orange 40 is released from the stop 5 and falls inside the cup 3. The platform 2 has descended and the following orange 39 is placed in the feed position.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Next, the half orange 40 is placed in the cup 3 and the aforementioned process begins once more, acting as a cycle, step "I", dragging the peel 41', which finally comes out, step "m", towards the tray 8 sliding along ramp 7, when the cup reaches the inverted position.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Next, the squeezing process is repeated, the cup 3 descends "n", and compresses the half orange 40 against the squeezing ball 6 and from this moment, the cup 3 ascends, step "o" and leaves the peel on ramp 7. Position "p" shows how the cup initiates the rotation continuing with steps "q" and "r", in the second of which the extraction of the peel begins. When reaching the position "s", the cup receives a new fruit, in order to begin the process from the initial position "a".</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The entire process described above is carried out by means of the mechanism shown in <figref idrefs="f0007 f0008 f0009 f0010">figures 3 to 6</figref>, which will be described below.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The fruit reception cup 3 is mounted onto a first horizontal rotating axis 9, which is joined together with a pinion 10 geared to a vertical rack 11 carved in a vertical plate 12. The first axis 9 of the cup is also mounted onto a rail 13. The vertical plate 12 and the rail 13 are mounted between railing guides 14. The rail 13 may be displaced on the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> vertical guides 14 between upper and lower limit positions, propelled towards the first by means of a spring 15.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The vertical plate 12 is related to a motor mechanism, not shown, by means of a rod 16 and crank 17 set, <figref idrefs="f0008">figure 4</figref>, with which the displacement of the plate 12 along the length of a vertical trajectory comprising an upper section is achieved, wherein the gearing between the rack 11 and the pinion 10 takes place and initiates the rotation of the cup 3 between the vertical and inverted positions and a lower section, along which the rail 13 is dragged, and with it the cup 3 in the inverted position, between the upper and lower inverted positions.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">figure 3</figref>, the platform 2 of the fruit feed chute is supported by a vertical piston rod 18 that rests on a magnet 20 joined to the plate 12 by means of a bent arm 19 when said rack is at the highest point of its vertical trajectory.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The horizontal tilting blade 4 is mounted onto a second horizontal axis 21, with which said blade may be tilted transversally between the positions of minimum and maximum inclination. The second axis 21 of this blade bears a probe 22 that is retained when the blade is in the minimum inclination position, by means of a releasable upper stop 23, and is propelled by means of a first spring 24 towards the maximum inclination position of the blade. The probe 22 receives the action of the plate 12, <figref idrefs="f0007">figure 3</figref>, when said plate reaches the highest point of its vertical trajectory.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The synchronization mechanism of the platform with the blade is composed of an auxiliary wheel 30, <figref idrefs="f0008">figures 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">5</figref>, which bears a toothed wheel 26 on which a ratchet 27, mounted onto the vertical plate 12, acts, when said plate reaches the highest point of its vertical trajectory, as better shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">figure 6</figref>. In addition, a horizontal rail 28 is mounted onto a third axis 25, which bears the rear stop 23 for the probe 22. This rail may be displaced longitudinally between the front and rear positions. In the front position, shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">figure 3</figref>, the rear stop 23 acts against the probe 22 and defines a front stop 29 for the bent arm 19 when the vertical plate 12 does not occupy its upper position, <figref idrefs="f0008">figures 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0009">5</figref>.

When the vertical plate 12 descends once again, the platform 2 and the blade 4 also descend.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Whilst the vertical plate 12 is descending, the probe 22 and the blade are inclined because the horizontal rail 28 does not prevent said inclination and because the spring 24 causes the traction of the probe 22. The platform 2 descends. There is a moment wherein the blade makes contact and does not descend any more. The platform 2 also descends until its limit.

When the pinion 10, <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006">figure 2</figref>, has rotated 180°, the cup 3 is in the inverted position, step d of <figref idrefs="f0007">figure 3</figref>, thus initiating the simultaneous descent of the cup 3 and skid 7, pressing the lower half of the orange 41 against the squeezing ball 6, step e of <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006">figure 2</figref>.

As represented in step h, the cup continues its ascending path and the ramp 7 begins to ascend, extracting the peel of the squeezed lower half. As shown in step i, the cup 3 continues its ascending path and the ramp 7 begins to ascend, completing the extraction of the peel from the lower half of the squeezed orange. In step j, the cup 3 has completed its ascent and the peel of the squeezed lower half of the orange is on the ramp 7. In step k, the cup 3 and blade 4 rotate in a synchronized manner. The upper half orange 40 which was immobilized by the retaining stop 5 is released and falls in the cup 3, the moment in which feed platform 2 will has descended and the following orange has been placed in the feed position.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The upper half of the orange 40 has been placed inside the cup 3, step 1 and as said cup continues its rotation until reaching the inverted position of step m, it pushes the peel of the previously squeezed half orange towards the reception tray 8.

In step o, the cup ascends vertically and leaves the peel on the ball, the ramp 7 remaining in its lower position. In step p, the cup 3 returns to its initial position, whilst the rest of the elements remain still. In step q, the cup continues its ascending path and the ramp 7 begins to ascend, extracting the peel of the squeezed half of the fruit. In step r, the cup continues to ascend and the ramp 7 also begins to ascend, extracting the peel of the squeezed half of the fruit. The blade 4 rotates upwards, in synchronization with the cup 3 and the platform 2 begins to ascend in such a way that the next orange, which is on said platform, ends up falling on the cup as shown in step s, to begin a new cycle.
