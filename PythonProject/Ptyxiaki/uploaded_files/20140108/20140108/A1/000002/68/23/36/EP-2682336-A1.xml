On a point of each of the aforementioned vertical bevel edges is situated an anchored perforated projection or a connection ring. The four projections of a same cube can be anchored on the same height as their corresponding edge, or can be situated on slightly different heights in order to facilitate the coupling among the cubes.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The dock is formed by the coupling of the mentioned elementary cubes, or base-cubes. When four elementary cubes are coupled, forming an upper square surface, thanks to their bevel the four shared edges present a hole in which are accommodated the four corresponding projections to the confronting edges with their aligned perforation and the upper vertexes of the confronting vertexes forming a complete countersink. In this way it can be introduced the shank of a central bolt in the hole left for the four confronting beveled edges which anchors in the perforation of the aligned projections inside the aforementioned hole. The head of the aforementioned bolt remains accommodated in the above mentioned complete countersink. In this way, the four jointed cubes are kept.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In order to improve the coupling of elementary cubes, their vertical walls present vertical recesses and<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> projections, presenting two consecutive lateral faces, a contrary order among them of the recessed zones and the projection zones. In this way, the recesses of one face of the cube fit into the projections of the contact face with another adjacent cube providing a greater firmness.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The lower face of the elementary cube, which is the one submerged in water, presents in its lower surface a cross-shaped recess with arms which allow the drainage of the water creating a constant recirculation of water without raising resistance to the water, not having a plane lower surface of the cube. Thanks to this configuration better buoyancy and less buckling (vertical movement) is managed, obtaining great stability.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Illuminating-cubes, which add a bright spotlight, can be incorporated in the assembled dock on the basis of elementary cubes. These illuminating-cubes also present at least one of their four vertical bevel edges, the given beveled edge also including a quarter of countersink on its upper vertex and a perforated lateral projection on a point of the mentioned vertical bevel edge. These perforated projections can be hooked to any of the accessible holed projections of the elementary cubes of the dock. The vertical walls of the illuminating-cube can present vertical projections and recesses for attaching themselves to the vertical walls of the elementary cubes of the dock.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">On the dock, assembled on the basis of elementary cubes (base-cubes), some illuminating-cubes without a colour pigment can be incorporated, with a semi-translucent<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> tone which incorporates a band of LED. This band of LED settles in the semi-translucent base-cube by a valve which can be connected to a transformer and directly to the electric grid. As an alternative, a solar panel can be installed which, going to the unpigmented base-cube, captures the UV rays and generates light by means of the same previously mentioned system of band of LED. These illuminating-cubes can present the same geometry or a configuration of the base-cubes.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A part with the form of a receptor cot of embarkation can be incorporated, which serves as a dock for scooters and light boats and which functions by actuation of the boat itself in order to have a dry docking in line (nose/tale), avoiding contact with the water. The mentioned part consists of an anchorage-cube (or a "slider") with a recess on its upper surface similar in form to the hull of the type of boats which it is expected to receive, with four vertical bevel edges and, in addition to the mentioned anchorage-cube, including a lateral perforated projection on a point of each of the mentioned vertical bevel edges above the lower point of the mentioned recess, being able to be the point of anchorage of the perforated projections of the same side of the recess on different heights. The perforated lateral projections of this anchorage-cube can be hooked by means of bolts to the free perforated lateral projections of elementary cubes.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Therefore, docks can be formed that can allow docking of all types of boats in a dry dock turning to a system of impulse which is something new for the technology of dikes or floating docks. Therefore, this system, with an<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> evolutionary concept, avoids from the necessity of fixed structures which turn to heavy motorization for the elevation of scooters (watercraft), jets, boats of the type "outboard" or "sterndrive"</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The ideal combination of elementary cubes and anchorage-cubes ("sliders") meets all the requirements of such heavy equipment as motors, gears, cables, etc. for the elevation of any type of boat.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Therefore, the docks, object of the present invention, are set up by a simple assembly of modular cubes without any type of mobile part, supporting all types of boats in a secure way, allowing easy manoeuvres of arrival and departure of the boats, ensuring a simple and easy dock.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In order to have movement of the whole set of the dock on the water, with the help of a boat, an auxiliary element with solid moorings in a winch with a traction system can be incorporated. Additionally or alternatively, a crosstree with a headboard of reinforced moorings can be included.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A modular floating dock or structure, irrespective of its structural design, will be able to be anchored by means of piles, like the traditional piers of aluminium or wood. This system of piles serves as a guide for the ascent and descent of the sea. In order to allow this, the elementary cubes can be hooked through free perforated projections to an auxiliary fitting which is anchored to a pile. The mentioned auxiliary fitting presents typically a ring-shaped quadrangular body with at least one perforated projection in each of its four<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> edges, and a horizontal roller anchored on each of the four sides of the square formed in its internal hole. These rollers will roll on the surface of the piles. The geometry of the rollers will be chosen in accordance with the geometry of the piles.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Elements of lateral defence of the dock can be incorporated, which present a slightly arched form with a perforated projection in each of their two ends which allows their coupling with the perforated projections of other cubes that are present on the dock.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">An auxiliary plate can be incorporated in the structure, which include; principal body-plate the width of which is a multiple of the width of the vertical walls of the base-cube and at least one perforated laminar projection in each of its vertical sides, the surface of the mentioned perforated laminar projection being on a perpendicular plane to the principal body-plate, and with a complementary inclination to that of the bevel of the vertical edges of the mentioned principal bodies.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The perforations of different projections, which remain accessible, can accommodate a bolt-ring that can glide. This type of bolt-ring can also be utilized for its anchorage from a plurality of perforated rings of different elements when the extraction of the same is possible.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The cubes can be made with the refined compound HDPE (polyethylene with high density) forming modular cubes, light but with a highest resistance, stiff and lasting, they provide a totally new experience also thanks to<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> their resistance to UV radiation, their being inflammable and having an antistatic treatment. This allows that the characteristics in the open part of the cubes permit that this system of docks be able to be left in the water during the whole winter, including conditions of ice, being prepared to overcome maritime states of high agitation. The HDPE provides a strong resistance to the salt residue, oils and other pollutants, as well as to the corrosion of acids. Its use in salty or sweet water does not result in alteration of the colours of the cubes.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">All the constituent elements of the dock, especially the elementary cubes, present rounded and smooth edges.
