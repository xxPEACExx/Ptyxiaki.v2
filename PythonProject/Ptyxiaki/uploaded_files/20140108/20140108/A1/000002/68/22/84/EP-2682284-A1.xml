It is essential that the sipes 13 formed in the blocks 3b1, 3b2 be inclined with respect to the tire width direction, and that an inclination angle θ13 with respect to the tire width direction be from 0° to 30°.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The following describes the operations and effects of the present invention.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Forming sipes throughout the land portions allows for enhancement of on-snow performance and on-ice performance. Specifically, the sipes achieve an edge effect on a snowy surface and achieve both an edge effect and a water layer removal effect on an icy surface.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Forming the central land portion 1 as a rib can increase the circumferential direction rigidity as compared to when the central land portion 1 is formed as blocks.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Forming the blocks 3b of each intermediate land portion 3 to be vertically long can increase the circumferential direction rigidity as compared to when the blocks 3b are horizontally long.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The circumferential direction rigidity of the central land portion 1 and each intermediate land portion 3 can thus be increased, yet the width direction rigidity is low. Therefore, by forming the central sipes 11 of the central land portion 1 to extend linearly along the tire width direction and forming the intermediate sipes 13 of the intermediate land portions 3 to be inclined with respect to the tire width direction at a relatively small angle of 0° to 30°, the reduction in the width direction rigidity of the land portions is suppressed to a minimum, thereby preventing a loss of steering stability.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Furthermore, since the central sipes 11 extending linearly in the tire width direction and the intermediate sipes 13 inclined at a small angle with respect to the tire width direction increase the edge component with respect to the tire circumferential direction, both on-snow braking performance and<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> on-snow acceleration performance can be ensured.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Forming the blocks 5b of each outer land portion 5 to be horizontally long can increase the width direction rigidity as compared to when the blocks 5b are vertically long. Since the width direction rigidity of the blocks 5b in the outer land portions 5 is thus increased, the necessary width direction rigidity can be maintained even when the outer sipes 15 in the outer land portions 5 extend obliquely with respect to the tire circumferential direction by being formed along the outer inclined grooves 7 that extend obliquely with respect to the tire circumferential direction.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Furthermore, since the outer sipes 15 that extend obliquely with respect to the tire circumferential direction increase the sipe edge density in the tire width direction, steering stability can be ensured.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In summary, the central land portion 1 and the intermediate land portions 3 increase the circumferential direction rigidity and the edge effect, and the outer land portions 5 ensure width direction rigidity and edge density, thereby making it possible to achieve both dry performance and on-snow performance.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, by forming the groove walls of the central land portion 1 to extend in the tire circumferential direction in a zigzag manner, the edge component in the circumferential direction can be increased and snow column shear force can be enhanced as compared to the structure in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, thus allowing for enhancement of both on-snow braking performance and on-snow acceleration performance. The reason is that by connecting the central circumferential grooves 2 and the intermediate inclined grooves 6, which have approximately equal groove widths, the on-snow braking/driving performance is enhanced. Furthermore, by providing the intermediate inclined narrow groove 8, the drainage performance can be increased as compared to the structure in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. In order to enhance the on-snow steering stability, an inclination angle θ8 of the intermediate inclined narrow groove 8 with respect to the tire width direction is preferably from 15° to 85°.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In order to ensure the on-snow steering stability, an inclination angle 96 of the intermediate inclined grooves 6 with respect to the tire width direction is preferably from 5° to 85°.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">When the inclination angle θ6 is less than 5° or greater than 85°, the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> edge effect achieved by the blocks 3b in each intermediate land portion 3 may be insufficient. Additionally, if the inclination angle θ6 is less than 5°, greater tire noise and worse on-ice performance become cause for concern. On the other hand, if the inclination angle θ6 is greater than 85°, the blocks 3b may suffer uneven wear.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In order to ensure the on-snow steering stability, an inclination angle θ7 of the outer inclined grooves 7 with respect to the tire width direction is preferably from 5° to 45°.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">If the inclination angle θ7 is less than 5°, the edge effect achieved by the blocks 5b in each outer land portion 5 may be insufficient, and greater tire noise and worse on-ice performance also become cause for concern.
