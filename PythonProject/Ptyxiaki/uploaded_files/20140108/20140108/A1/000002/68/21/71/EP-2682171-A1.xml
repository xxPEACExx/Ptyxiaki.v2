Generally, the press filter comprises a plurality of filter plates arranged in parallel from one another for the separation of solids from liquids, a frame on which the plurality of filter plates are supported, a pressure mechanism for pressing the plurality of filter plates together during the filtration cycle, and a cake discharge mechanism. Each of the filter plates comprises a supporting plate which is recessed on both sides and filter elements such as filter cloth covered on both sides of the supporting plate. Once pressed together, the plurality of filter plates form a series of chambers.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Generally, the supporting plates have a central through hole that passes through the entire length of the press filter so that all the chambers of the filter plates are connected together, and the slurry or the suspension is fed through the central through hole into the chambers. The filtrate permeates the filter cloth and flows downward along the wall of the supporting plate.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Four corner ports are provided on each supporting plate to connect all the plates, wherein the top two corner ports are to introduce washing liquid or compressed air, and the bottom two corner pots are to collect the filtrates that permeate the filter cloth towards outlets and then are drained away. The cakes are formed on the face of the filter cloth and fill the chambers. The cakes are compressed and dewatered during the filtration cycle and the cake thickness increases over time. Once the optimum combination of chamber filling and cake dryness is achieved, the filtration<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> is stopped, the pressure is relieved and the cakes are discharged by the cake discharge mechanism. A new filtration cycle starts.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Presently, the basic design to install the filter cloth on both sides of the supporting plate is to sew the filter cloth into a sack into which the supporting plate is inserted, or to stretch out two pieces of filter cloth over two sides of the supporting plate. The filter cloth has a hole positioned to correspond to the central through hole of the supporting plate, and the two pieces of the filter cloth are pressed against each other by a connecting means which is either sewn or bonded to the edges of the cloth holes and then is mounted on the central through hole of the supporting plate. To install the filter cloth on the supporting plate, it is necessary to align the central through hole of the supporting plate and the cloth hole, and the connecting means are connected with the filter cloth and with the central through hole of the supporting plate in a leak-proof manner. If the central through hole and the cloth hole are not aligned, the operation of the press filter would be less effective, and leakage may occur and result in low filtration rate. Further, it is often that damage to the filter cloth may take place when the connecting means connects the filter cloth and the filter cloth is mounted on the central through hole of the supporting plate, which makes the cloth unusable. As can be seen, the current methods of installing the filter cloth on the supporting plate are very labor intensive with a high risk of leakage and damage to the cloth.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Various efforts have been made in order to solve the problems associated with filter cloth installation and filter cloth leakage. For example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20100200518A1"><text>US patent application no. 2010/0200518A1</text></patcit> provides a filter element for a press filter, comprising first and second filtering means, first and second connecting means and a securing ring. Each of the first and second connecting means comprises a flange porting and a tubular portion, wherein the flange portion of the first connecting means is fixedly attached to the first filtering means and the flange portion of the second connecting means is fixedly attached to the second filtering means, and wherein the tubular portion of the first connecting means is insertable into the tubular portion of the second connecting means. The securing ring is insertable into the tubular portion of the first connecting means and is adapted to exert a radial force on the tubular portion of the first connecting means, pressing the tubular portion of the first connecting means against the tubular portion of the second connecting means, thereby to realize the purpose of robustness and leak resistance. It is to be noted that the securing ring is needed for pressing the first filtering means against the second filtering means, which results in complicated replacement of the filter cloths. Moreover, when the securing ring is damaged or when the securing ring is installed<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> in a manner that the first and second connecting means cannot be locked in place by the securing ring, the leakage phenomenon would take place.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Nonwoven fabric is a cloth that is neither woven nor knitted. The nonwoven fabric exhibits good filterability, permeability and absorption, and therefore is suitable to be used as a filter medium.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The international application under <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="CN2011071371FILEDW"><text>PCT/CN2011/071371 filed by the applicant on 28 February 2011</text></patcit> discloses a nonwoven fabric, a method for producing the fabric, and a filter formed with the fabric. The nonwoven fabric is made of at least one low-melting-point short fiber and at least one high-melting-point short fiber, and characterized in that the low-melting-point fiber is a solidifiable material, particularly is capable of solidifying after it is heated to melt, whereby the obtained felt fabric has the ability of self-sustaining and shape maintenance. The felt fabric disclosed in this patent application can also be molded into various shapes according to the actual needs and has a characteristic of being persistently retaining in those shapes after it is molded. Therefore, the fabric exhibits excellent hardness and stiffness, remarkable moldability, and high compressive strength, in addition to the conventional properties of good filterability, permeability and absorption.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Another international application under <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="CN2011084323W"><text>PCT/CN2011/084323 filed by the applicant on 21 December 2011</text></patcit> discloses a novel nonwoven fabric, a method for producing the fabric, and a filter formed with the fabric. This nonwoven fabric is made of one short fiber of same type, or two or more types of short fiber which have a substantially same melting point, and characterized in that about 30% to 80% of the short fiber is heated to melt and then solidifies so as to form a single melting point nonwoven fabric. It was tested that the single melting point nonwoven fabric obtained as such is also stiff to have the ability of self-sustaining and shape maintenance, and exhibits excellent hardness and stiffness, remarkable moldability, and high compressive strength, in addition to the conventional properties of good filterability, permeability and absorption.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In light of the unique characteristics of the non-woven fabric discussed above, especially the self-sustaining and shape maintenance, remarkable moldability and excellent filterability, the non-woven fabric may be molded into various elements used in the different types of filters. The molded elements not only make it possible that the labor intensity of the installing and assembling the elements is greatly reduced, but also the connection of the various molded elements from one another is more intimate and robust.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is an object of the present invention to provide a connector assembly for fastening filter elements onto a supporting plate of a press filter at low cost, which permits an easy assembly and mounting without causing damage to the filter cloth and also avoids the leakage of the filter cloth.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Another object of the present invention is to provide a filter element comprising the above connector assembly for the press filter, said filter element and said connector assembly being molded as one piece, which eliminates the process of feeding, connecting and stretching out the filter cloth and also eliminates the need for caulking the edge of the cloth, sewing up the cord and hammering it into the groove of the supporting plate, thereby greatly reducing the labor intensity and costs for mounting and changing the filter cloth. The problems associated with the leakage and damage to the cloth are completely prevented because the filter element and the connector assembly are molded integrally.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">To attain the aforesaid objects, the invention provides a connector assembly for fastening filter elements onto a supporting plate of a press filter, comprising

The nonwoven felt fabric further exhibits remarkable moldability and dimension stability, therefore the felt fabric can be molded into various shapes and has a characteristic of being persistently retaining in those shapes after it is<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> molded. Moreover, the nonwoven felt fabric has a high compressive strength and thus can withstand repeated pulsing of the cleaning air or fluids and the impact from the cleaning air or fluids.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The invention is based on the above finding to provide a filter element and connector assembly thereof, which require simplified installation, assembly and maintenance. The filter element and the connector assembly are both molded as one piece from the nonwoven fabric (for example those felt fabric disclosed in the above two co-pending applications) which is stiff enough to be self-sustaining, has the ability of shape maintenance, and is moldable. The filter element and the connector assembly formed as such eliminates the need for the labor intensive operation of mounting the filter cloth, and effectively prevents the leakage phenomenon induced by misalignment of the central through hole and the cloth hole. In addition, damage to the filter cloth when the cloth is mounted onto the supporting plate is avoided.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">Figs. 1 to 4</figref>, there is illustrated a connector assembly 30 constructed according to a specific embodiment of the invention, the connector assembly 30 is adapted for fastening a filter element such as filter cloth onto a supporting plate of a press filter. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the connector assembly 30 comprises a first hollow cylindrical core 31 and a first flange 32 extending outward circumferentially and vertically from one end of the first cylindrical core 31. The connector assembly 30 further comprises a second hollow cylindrical core 33 and a second flange 34 extending outward circumferentially and vertically from one end of the second cylindrical core 33. The first cylindrical core 31 and the first flange 32 are molded as one piece from the non-woven fabric which is stiff enough to be self-sustaining, has the ability of shape maintenance, and is moldable. The second cylindrical core 33 and the second flange 34 are molded as one piece from the same non-woven fabric.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The first cylindrical core 31 is shaped and dimensioned such that this core snugly passes through and is meshed with the central through hole of the supporting plate (not shown) of the press filter; and the second cylindrical core 33 is shaped and dimensioned such that this cylindrical core snugly passes through and is meshed with the first cylindrical core 31. In particular, the first hollow cylindrical core 31 has a diameter smaller slightly than a diameter of the central through hole of the supporting plate, such that the first cylindrical core 31 snugly passes through and is intimately engaged with the central through hole of the supporting plate; and the second hollow cylindrical core 33 has a diameter smaller slightly than the diameter<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> of the first cylindrical core 31, such that the second cylindrical core 33 snugly passes through and is intimately engaged with the first cylindrical core 31. The connector assembly in assembled state is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">When the filter element (i.e. filter cloth) is not moldable, the first flange 32 and the second flange 34 may be coupled to the filter element by adhesive or stitching or any method known in the art, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>. If the filter element is moldable, then the first flange 32 or the second flange 34 may be molded integrally with the respective filter element.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In order to provide the water proof property to the connector assembly 30 of the invention, the connector assembly is made from a plurality of layers of short fibers. A water proof material 35 like water proof plastic is disposed between two layers of the short fibers during the manufacture of the nonwoven fabric. Therefore, the connector assembly molded from the nonwoven fabric comprising the water proof material would exhibit definitely the good water proof property.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As discussed above, the nonwoven felt fabric exhibits excellent rigidity and hardness as well as remarkable moldability, the connector assembly 30 molded from the felt fabric can stably retain its shape. To assemble the connector assembly 30, it is only required to pass the first cylindrical core 31 from one side of the supporting plate through the central through hole, and then pass the second cylindrical core 33 from the other side of the supporting plate through the central through hole and the first cylindrical core 31 in a manner that the second cylindrical core 33 is meshing inside the first cylindrical core 31 to form a barrel neck. In order to increase the anti-leakage of the connector assembly 30, silicon rubber may be applied to the edges of the connector assembly 30 for the purpose of preventing any potential gap.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As can be seen, the use of the connector assembly of the invention simplifies the mounting and changing of the filter cloth for the press filter, which not only eliminates the need for pressing the edge of the cloth hole against the through hole of the supporting plate, but also prevents the cloth damage and the cloth leakage. Therefore, the labor intensity and costs for implementing, assembling and changing the filter element are greatly reduced.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035"><figref idrefs="f0005 f0006">Figs. 5 to 7</figref> illustrate a filter plate for the CGR type press filter according to the invention.

However, the extended hollow cylindrical core of the second filter element 54 has a diameter smaller slightly than a diameter of the extended hollow cylindrical core of the first filter element 52, such that the cylindrical core of the second filter element 54 snugly passes through and is meshed with the cylindrical core of the first filter element 52. The recessed areas of two adjacent supporting plates 56 define a chamber after the supporting plates 56 are pressed together.

Then, the cylindrical core 53 of the second filter element 54 is allowed to pass from the other side of the supporting plate 56 through the central through hole 57 and the cylindrical core of the first filter element 52 in a manner that the cylindrical core of the second filter element 54 is meshing inside the cylindrical core of the first filter<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> element 52 to form a barrel neck.
