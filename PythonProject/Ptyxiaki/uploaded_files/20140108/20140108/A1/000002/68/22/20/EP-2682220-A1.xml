By using the flux, any intermetallic compounds can be formed between the solder and the metallic surface of the subject to be soldered so that they can be strongly connected.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The solder paste is a composite material that is formed by mixing the solder powder and the flux. The solder paste is applied to a portion, electrodes, terminals and the like, to be soldered of a board such as a printed circuit board by means of a printing method or a discharge method. Any components are mounted on the soldered portion thereof to which the solder paste is applied.

The flux according to these embodiments contains methacrylate polymer as thixotropic agent to suppress sedimentation of the solder powder. As the methacrylate polymer, polyalkyl methacrylate having an alkyl group is preferable. An alloy composition of the solder powder to be mixed is not specifically limited.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the solder paste in which the flux to which polyalkyl methacrylate is added and the solder powder are mixed, sedimentation of the solder powder is suppressed at a normal temperature range such as room temperature and a separation of the solder powder and the flux is controlled.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Polyalkyl methacrylate dissolves at a heating temperature on the time of the soldering to vaporize. Thus, in the solder paste in which the flux to which polyalkyl methacrylate is added and the solder powder are mixed, polyalkyl methacrylate dissolves during a heating course at the time of the soldering in the reflow furnace so that the flux does not substantially remain after the soldering to realize no residue.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">During a heating course at the time of the soldering, a period of time it takes for polyalkyl methacrylate to dissolve is changed on the basis of the addition amount of polyalkyl methacrylate. Accordingly, by taking into consideration the period of time it takes for<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> polyalkyl methacrylate to dissolve during the heating course at the time of the soldering, an addition amount of polyalkyl methacrylate preferably is not less than 0.1 % through less than 1.0 %.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Further, it is preferable that the flux according to this embodiment, by taking wettability of the solder into consideration, contains a solvent having at least three OH groups. The addition of polyalkyl methacrylate suppresses sedimentation of the solder powder as described above. On the other hand, this does not block any wettability of the solder.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Thus, the flux according to this embodiment contains the polyalkyl methacrylate as the thixotropic agent which suppresses sedimentation of the solder powder when it is mixed with the solder powder and is pyrolyzed by heating at the time of the soldering. As other components of the flux, a solvent having at least three OH groups is contained.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The solder paste according to this embodiment is produced by mixing the above-mentioned flux and the solder powder.

Since, in the actual board production, a period of time for the solder to fuse is about 60 seconds based on a heat-resisting property of the board or device, it does not meet any actual reflow conditions to extend a period of heating time with the object of realizing no residue.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Based on the above results, in order to show the effect of suppression of sedimentation of the solder powder by the addition of polyalkyl methacrylate to the flux and allow no residue to be realized at the time of the reflow, it is understood that not less than 0.1% through less than 1.0% of polyalkyl methacrylate is preferably added.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Thus, when a predetermined amount of polyalkyl methacrylate is added to the flux as the thixotropic agent, the effect of suppression of sedimentation of the solder powder is obtained at a normal temperature range, the wettability of the solder is not blocked at the time of soldering and after the soldering, no residue of flux remain.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Accordingly, it is possible to realize no residue without washing out the residue of flux after the soldering and when performing any resin coating, it is unnecessary to select resin coating materials and in a step of applying /curing the resin coating materials after the soldering, curing inhibition of the resin coating materials does not arise so that the reliability can be improved.
