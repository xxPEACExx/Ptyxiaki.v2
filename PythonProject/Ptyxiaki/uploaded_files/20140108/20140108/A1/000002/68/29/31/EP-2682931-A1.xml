The wireless communication unit 210 includes an RF transmitter for up-converting and amplifying the frequency of a signal to be transmitted and an RF receiver for low-noise amplifying and down-converting the frequency of a received signal. Further, the wireless communication unit 210 outputs data that is received through a wireless<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> communication channel to the control unit 260 and transmits data that is output by the control unit 260 through the wireless communication channel.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The audio processing unit 220 is configured with a data codec for processing packet data and an audio codec for processing an audio signal such as a voice. The audio processing unit 220 converts a digital audio signal to an analog audio signal through the audio codec and outputs the analog audio signal through a speaker. An analog audio signal input from a microphone is converted to a digital audio signal through the audio codec.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The key input unit 230 receives a user's key input for the control of the mobile terminal 200 and generates an input signal to transmit to the control unit 260. The key input unit 230 may be configured with a keypad including numeric keys and direction keys, and function keys may be formed at a surface of the mobile terminal 200. In a mobile terminal having a touch screen 240 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the operation of the key input unit 230 may be performed using the touch screen 240, and thereby the key input unit 230 may be omitted.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The touch screen 240 includes a touch sensor 241 and a display unit 242. The touch sensor 241 detects a user's touch input. The touch sensor 241 may be configured with a touch sensor such as a capacitive overlay sensor, a pressure sensitive sensor, a resistive overlay sensor, and an infrared beam detecting sensor. Besides the above sensors, any type of sensor detecting contact or pressure of an object can be used as the touch sensor 241 according to the present invention. The touch sensor 241 detects a user's touch input and generates a detection signal to transmit to the control unit 260. The detection signal includes coordinate data of a location touched by the user. If the user moves a touch location, the touch sensor 241 generates a detection signal including coordinate data of a path of the touch movement to transmit to the control unit 260.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">More particularly, the touch sensor 241 detects a user input for recording or playing contents of an electronic book according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Such a user input may be, for example, a touch (including a multi-touch) or a drag.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The display unit 242 may be formed with a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs),or Active Matrix Organic Light<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> Emitting Diodes (AMOLEDs), and provide the user with a variety of visual information such as a menu, input data, function setting information of the mobile terminal 200, and the like. The display unit 242 performs a function of outputting a booting screen, a waiting screen, a menu screen, a telecommunication screen, and other application screens of the mobile terminal 200.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The mobile terminal 200 may be configured with a touch screen as described above. However the mobile terminal 200 is not limited to the touch screen. In exemplary implementations, if a mobile terminal not having a touch screen is applied, the touch screen 240 shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> may be modified to perform only the function of the display unit 242.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The storage unit 250 may be divided into a program area and a data area, and performs a role of storing programs and data required for the operation of the mobile terminal 200. The program area stores a program for controlling general operations of the mobile terminal 200, an Operating System (OS) for booting the mobile terminal 200, an application program required for playing multimedia contents, and application programs required for optional functions of the mobile terminal 200, such as a camera function, a sound play function, a play function of a still or moving image, and the like. The data area stores data generated according to the use of the mobile terminal 200, such as a still image, a moving image, a phone book, audio data, and the like.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">According to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the storage unit 250 stores user voice files recorded in each page of an electronic book and synchronization files synchronized with the user voice files in each page. Further, the storage unit 250 stores the user voice files recorded by phoneme in a database to perform an auto complete function of Text To Speech (TTS) recording for contents of the electronic book.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The control unit 260 controls general operations of components of the mobile terminal 200.
