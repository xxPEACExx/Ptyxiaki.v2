Accordingly, in order to appropriately control or stabilize the charge amount of the toner, a charge control agent having a positive or negative charge-granting property has often added to the toner.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As a conventional charge control agent that has been practically used and grants a negative charge to the toner, metal complex salt dyes of monoazo compounds, metal salts or metal complexes of aromatic hydroxycarboxylic acids such as alkyl salicylic acid, etc., can be exemplified. Among them, many of the metal complexes having a structure of azo dyes which have been used as charge control agents have generally a poor stability. For example, they could be decomposed or deteriorated so that their<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> charge control characteristics could be easily impaired due to mechanical friction or shock, electrical impact, exposure to light, or changes in temperature or humidity conditions. In addition, even if charge control agents have a practical level in terms of charge granting property, many of those agents cannot be used as the charge control agents for color toner because they have unsatisfying charge stability or they have a color.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The conventional charge control agents which are colorless or have a white color or light color can be applicable to color toner in terms of color, but almost all agents has problems in terms of performance. They have such disadvantages that high light uniformity has not yet achieved and there is a change in density of images in the durability test. Further, some charge control agents have such drawbacks as difficulty in taking a balance between image densities and fogging, difficulty in obtaining a sufficient image density in a high humidity environment, poor dispersibility to the resin, adverse effects on the storage stability and fixability, etc.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As a charge control agent that applies (grants) a negative charge and can contribute to further improve the performance of copiers, printers, etc., in which color toner is used, for example, calix n arene (a cyclic condensates obtained from an aldehyde and phenol) (Patent Document 1), metal complexes of resorcinol n arene or calix n arene (Patent Document 2), specific dimeric condensates obtained from an aldehyde and a phenol (Patent Document 3), phenol derivative compounds which contain no heavy metals (Patent Document 4), etc. have been known so far.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">These cyclic condensation products have high melting points, are strong due to its cyclic structure and have very low solubility in organic solvents. Therefore, when they are added into the toner as the charge control agents, a high charge amount can be achieved, but it is difficult to disperse them in the toner. In particular, in the case of using a low viscosity resin for the color toner, dispersion becomes difficult, and toner scattering is liable to become deteriorated. Further, more efficient electron transfer is essential for improving the charge amount.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">To improve the electron transferring, it is advantageous to increase an electronic bias by substituting the para position of the phenyl group, which is an opposite position with respect to the phenolic hydroxyl group (an electron-donating group), with an<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> electron-withdrawing group. However, in cyclic compounds, it is not easy to synthesize electron-withdrawing group-substituted compounds. Accordingly, compounds which are other than the cyclic compounds such as calix n arene, resorcinol n arene, etc., and which have a favorable charging characteristics equivalent to the same effects as that of the cyclic compounds, have been desired.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to solve these problems, modification of chain compounds has been considered to be more practical.</p><heading id="h0003">[PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS]</heading><heading id="h0004">[Patent Documents]</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010"><ul><li>[Patent document 1] Japanese Patent Application Publication <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPH2201378A"><text>H2-201378 A1</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent document 2] Japanese Patent Application Publication <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2000162825A"><text>2000-162825 A1</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent document 3] Japanese Patent Application Publication <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JPH1130880A"><text>H11-30880 A1</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent document 4] Japanese Patent Application Publication <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JPH10153884A"><text>H10-153884 A1</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">Objects of the present invention are to solve the aforementioned problems and to provide charge control agents that give toner a practical level of negative chargeability, are colorless or a light color and can be used in color toner, and have an electrostatic charge originated from charging of a resin powder such as the toner used, which is stable against environmental changes and has the characteristics of: excellent temporal stability of charge control characteristics, i.e., storage stability; excellent stability of charge control characteristics when repeatedly used a number of times when used in the toner, i.e. durability; and high stability with containing no toxic heavy metals, i.e. high safety; and to provide electrostatic charge image developing toner containing the charge control agent.</p><heading id="h0007">MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">Inventors of the present invention conducted intensive studies and found that when a charge control agent comprising a phenol multimer represented by the following<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> chemical formula (1) is used as a toner, the toner exhibits excellent charging characteristics.

Further, m is an integer of 0 - 2, respectively. For example, when m = 0, x becomes a number of 7 - 13, and the phenol multimer becomes 18 - 30-mers. When m = 1, x becomes a number of 4 - 8 and the phenol multimer becomes 18 - 30-mers. When m = 2, x becomes a number of 3 - 5, the phenol multimer is 20 - 28-mers. According to these combinations, the phenol multimeric mixture contains several multimers of 18 - 30-mers of chlorophenol, and an average degree of polymerization of the phenol multimeric mixture is 18 - 30.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">As an alkyl group, methyl group, ethyl group, n-propyl, and iso-propyl can be exemplified.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0034" num="0034">This phenol multimeric mixture has a peak at the Bragg angle (2θ ± 0.2 °) of at least 20.4° in an X-ray diffraction spectrum, preferably has peaks at 9.9°, 18.2°, 20.4°, and 24.1°, with a sharp peak at 20.4°.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Further, the phenol multimeric mixture can be purified by dissolving the phenol multimeric mixture in an organic solvent, and then subjected to reprecipitation.

Substituting some hydrogen atoms (H) of phenol multimer's hydroxyl groups of the phenol multimeric mixture with alkali metals at the time the phenol multimeric mixture is re-precipitated under an alkaline condition can improve charging characteristics of the phenol multimeric mixture when it is used as an electrostatic charge image developing toner.

When a nitro group or carboxyl group is used as an electron-withdrawing substituent, the obtained compound tends to have too high polarity, so that the compound becomes too familiar with the toner resin having a polar group, and the phenol multimer is likely to disperse uniformly throughout the resin. When such phenol multimers are used together with polymerized toners which are the important use of the charge control agents, such phenol multimers are familiar with resins, so that the charge control agents are easily incorporated into the resin particles. Accordingly, it is difficult for the charge control agent to come out on the surface of the toner particles, and sufficient charging effect cannot be achieved.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Thus, if a compound has a substituent such as a halogen atom that is an electron-withdrawing group but has low polarity as possible, the compound does not familiar with a resin having high polarity.

Accordingly, in the case of polymerized toner, the phenol multimer also tends to become uniformly dispersed in the resin so that it is difficult to exhibit proper charging characteristics. Therefore, the degree of polymerization is made higher to some extent to lower the solubility in the solvent. Thus, the charge control agent having chlorine groups and having phenol multimers whose degree of polymerization are adjusted to maintain a particle state, is likely to exhibit charging characteristics.
