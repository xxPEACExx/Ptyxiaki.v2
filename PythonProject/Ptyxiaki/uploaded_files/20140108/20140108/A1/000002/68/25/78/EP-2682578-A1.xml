In addition, there has been known a technique in which a peak value of an output of an air fuel ratio sensor is obtained at the time of rich burn combustion, a NOx storage capacity of the NOx catalyst is estimated based on the peak value, and the deterioration of the NOx catalyst is detected based on the NOx storage capacity thus estimated (for example, refer to a first patent document).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, in cases where lower HC such as gasoline is supplied as the reducing agent, the deterioration of the NOx catalyst can be detected according to the above-mentioned technique, but in cases where higher HC such as light oil is supplied as the reducing agent, a detected value of the air fuel ratio sensor may deviate from its actual value, and hence, there will be a fear that the detection accuracy of the deterioration of the NOx catalyst may become low.</p><heading id="h0003">[PRIOR ART REFERENCES]</heading><heading id="h0004">[PATENT DOCUMENTS]</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">[First Patent Document] Japanese patent application laid-open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2000034946A"><text>2000-034946</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">[SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION]</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><heading id="h0006">[PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION]</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention has been made in view of the problem as referred to above, and has for its object to provide a technique of performing the determination of deterioration of a NOx storage reduction catalyst in a more accurate manner.</p><heading id="h0007">[MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS]</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, a catalyst deterioration determination system according to the present invention resides in a catalyst deterioration determination system which determines a deterioration of a NOx storage reduction catalyst which is arranged in an exhaust passage of an internal combustion engine in such a manner that it stores NOx and reduces the NOx stored therein by the supply of a reducing agent, said system comprising:
<ul><li>a supply device that supplies the reducing agent to said NOx storage reduction catalyst thereby to change an air fuel ratio of an exhaust gas passing through said NOx storage reduction catalyst;</li><li>a detection device that detects NH<sub>3</sub> in the exhaust gas at the downstream side of said NOx storage reduction catalyst;</li><li>a control device that performs a first supply of the reducing agent and a second supply of the reducing agent in a sequential manner by adjusting an amount of the reducing agent in such a manner that the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas becomes a rich air fuel ratio at the time of supplying the reducing agent from said supply device; and</li><li>a determination device that determines based on the detected value of said detection device whether said NOx storage reduction catalyst has deteriorated, after a predetermined period of time has elapsed from the start of said first supply of the reducing agent, and after the start of said second supply of the reducing agent.</li></ul></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The NOx storage reduction catalyst stores NOx when the air fuel ratio<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> of the exhaust gas is lean, and reduces the NOx having been stored therein when the reducing agent exists. The supply device can supply the reducing agent to the NOx storage reduction catalyst. The reducing agent may be supplied into the exhaust gas flowing through the exhaust passage, or may be caused to discharge from the internal combustion engine. Then, the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is made lower by supplying the reducing agent.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Here, when the reducing agent is supplied to the NOx storage reduction catalyst thereby to provide a rich air fuel ratio, NOx released from the catalyst and NOx in the exhaust gas flowing into the catalyst react with H<sub>2</sub> and HC thereby to generate NH<sub>3</sub>. In the case where the NOx storage reduction catalyst is a new article, the reduction ability thereof is high, so at the beginning of starting the supply of the reducing agent, the NOx stored in the NOx storage reduction catalyst is reduced to N<sub>2</sub>, and hence an amount of generation of NH<sub>3</sub> is small. On the other hand, as the deterioration of the NOx storage reduction catalyst progresses, the reduction ability thereof to N<sub>2</sub> decreases, so the amount of generation of NH<sub>3</sub> increases.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Then, when the deterioration of the NOx storage reduction catalyst further progresses, the NOx reduction ability thereof decreases to a remarkable extent, so the amount of generation of NH<sub>3</sub> also decreases. In that case, a difference in the amount of generation of NH<sub>3</sub> between when the NOx storage reduction catalyst is new and when it has deteriorated becomes small, so that it becomes difficult to make the deterioration determination based on the amount of generation of NH<sub>3</sub>.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However, when the reducing agent is further supplied to provide a rich fuel ratio after the NOx stored in the NOx storage reduction catalyst has been reduced to N<sub>2</sub>, there will be a difference in the amount of generation of NH<sub>3</sub> between when the NOx storage reduction catalyst is new and when it has deteriorated.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011"><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> That is, when the reducing agent is supplied in a state where the NOx has not been stored in the NOx storage reduction catalyst, a surplus of the reducing agent will occur. This reducing agent reacts with NOx in the exhaust gas to generate NH<sub>3</sub>. In the case of the catalyst being new, a large amount of NH<sub>3</sub> will be generated, but in the case of the catalyst having deteriorated, it becomes difficult for the reducing agent and NOx to react with each other, so the amount of generation of NH<sub>3</sub> becomes small.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Therefore, after the NOx stored in the NOx storage reduction catalyst has been reduced by the first supply of the reducing agent, it is possible to determine the deterioration of the NOx storage reduction catalyst on the basis of the detected value of the detection device at the time of the second supply of the reducing agent. That is, the first supply of the reducing agent is carried out in order to decrease the amount of NOx stored in the NOx storage reduction catalyst. On the other hand, the second supply of the reducing agent is carried out mainly for the purpose of causing the NOx in the exhaust gas and the reducing agent to react with each other thereby to generate NH<sub>3</sub>.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Here, note that the predetermined period of time can be set as a period of time which is taken for the amount of NH<sub>3</sub> generated when the reducing agent is supplied to reach a value corresponding to the extent of the deterioration of the catalyst. In addition, the predetermined period of time may also be set as a period of time in which the amounts of NH<sub>3</sub> generated by the new catalyst and by the normal catalyst, respectively, become substantially the same level. Moreover, note that at the time of the start of the second supply of the reducing agent, NOx may not have been stored in the NOx storage reduction catalyst, but instead, a certain amount of NOx may also have been stored therein. That is, the NOx stored in the NOx storage reduction catalyst is reduced also by the second supply of the reducing agent, and hence, when the NOx storage reduction catalyst becomes a state in which NOx is not stored therein after the start of the second supply of the reducing agent, NH<sub>3</sub> will be generated thereafter, even in the case of the new catalyst.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Here, note that in the present invention, said control device can adjust the amount of reducing agent in such a manner that the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas at the time of said second supply of the reducing agent becomes leaner than at the time of said first supply of the reducing agent and richer than a stoichiometric air fuel ratio.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">That is, because the degree of richness becomes larger at the time of the first supply of the reducing agent than at the time of the second supply of the reducing agent, it is possible to decrease the amount of the NOx stored in the NOx storage reduction catalyst in a quick manner. As a result, it is possible to quickly determine the deterioration of the NOx storage reduction catalyst. Moreover, at the time of the second supply of the reducing agent, NH<sub>3</sub> can be generated due to the rich air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas, but the amount of consumption of the reducing agent can be reduced by decreasing the degree of richness. Here, note that at the time of the second supply of the reducing agent, a necessary minimum amount of reducing agent only sufficient to react with the NOx in the exhaust gas may be supplied.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In addition, in the present invention, said control device supplies the reducing agent a plurality of times at the time of the second supply of the reducing agent so that the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is caused to vary between a rich state and a lean state, and makes a period of time in which the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas becomes a rich air fuel ratio per one time at the time of said second supply of the reducing agent shorter than a period of time in which the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas becomes a rich air fuel ratio at the time of said first supply of the reducing agent.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">That is, the amount of the NOx stored in the NOx storage reduction catalyst can be decreased at the time of the first supply of the reducing agent. Even if NOx remains in the NOx catalyst at the time of the end of the first supply of the reducing agent, the amount of NOx stored in the NOx catalyst<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> becomes zero by repeating a lean state and a rich state at the time of the second supply of the reducing agent. After that, with the new NOx catalyst, the reducing agent and NOx flowing into the NOx catalyst react with each other thereby to generate NH<sub>3</sub>. That is, the amount of generation of NH<sub>3</sub> at the time of the supply of the reducing agent when a certain period of time has passed after the first supply of the reducing agent is started is comparatively large in the case of the normal NOx catalyst including the new NOx catalyst, but is comparatively small in the case of the deteriorated NOx catalyst. Accordingly, the deterioration of the NOx storage reduction catalyst can be determined on the basis of the detected value of the detection device at this time.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In the present invention, when the detected value of said detection device is equal to or more than a threshold value, said determination device can determine that said NOx storage reduction catalyst is normal.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Moreover, in the present invention, when the detected value of said detection device is less than the threshold value, said determination device can determine that said NOx storage reduction catalyst has deteriorated.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">At the time of supplying the reducing agent after the certain period of time has passed from the start of the first supply of the reducing agent, in the normal NOx catalyst including the new NOx catalyst, the amount of generation of NH<sub>3</sub> becomes comparatively large, whereas in the deterioration NOx catalyst, the amount of generation of NH<sub>3</sub> becomes comparatively small. In the normal NOx catalyst, by setting as the threshold value a lower limit value of the detected value detected by the detection device, it is possible to determine whether the NOx catalyst is normal or has deteriorated.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the present invention, said detection device may be a NOx sensor that detects NOx and NH<sub>3</sub> in the exhaust gas.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The NOx sensor detects NH<sub>3</sub> as well as NOx. Therefore, it is<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> impossible to distinguish whether the detected value of the NOx sensor is a concentration of NOx or a concentration of NH<sub>3</sub>. However, when the reducing agent is supplied until the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas becomes a rich air fuel ratio, almost no NOx will be contained in the exhaust gas at the downstream side of the NOx storage reduction catalyst. For this reason, the detected value of the NOx sensor will indicate the concentration of NH<sub>3</sub>. Accordingly, NH<sub>3</sub> can be detected by the use of the NOx sensor. As a result, the number of sensors to be installed can be decreased, thus making it possible to suppress an increase in the cost.</p><heading id="h0008">[EFFECT OF THE INVENTION]</heading><p id="p0023" num="0023">According to the present invention, it is possible to carry out the determination of deterioration of a NOx storage reduction catalyst in a more accurate manner.</p><heading id="h0009">[BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS]</heading><p id="p0024" num="0024"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>] is a view showing the schematic construction of an internal combustion engine and its exhaust system according to embodiments of the present invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>] is a view for explaining a NOx storage or adsorption function in a NOx catalyst.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>] is a view for explaining a NOx reduction function in the NOx catalyst.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>] is a view showing the relation between an air fuel ratio and a concentration of NH<sub>3</sub> at the downstream side of the NOx catalyst, at the time of supplying a reducing agent.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref>] is a view showing the relation between an air fuel ratio and a concentration of NH<sub>3</sub> at the downstream side of the NOx catalyst, at the time of rich spike control according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>] is a flow chart showing a flow for the determination of deterioration of the NOx catalyst according to the first embodiment of the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 7</figref>] is a view showing the relation between an air fuel ratio and a concentration of NH<sub>3</sub> at the downstream side of the NOx catalyst, at the time of rich spike control according to a second embodiment of the present invention.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 8</figref>] is a flow chart showing a flow for the determination of deterioration of the NOx catalyst according to the second embodiment of the present invention.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">[MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION]</heading><p id="p0025" num="0025">Hereinafter, reference will be made to specific embodiments of a catalyst deterioration determination system according to the present invention based on the attached drawings.</p><heading id="h0011">[First Embodiment]</heading><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a view showing the schematic construction of an internal combustion engine and its exhaust system according to this first embodiment of the present invention.

The injection valve 5 is opened by means of a signal from an ECU 10 which will be described later, so that it injects the reducing agent into the exhaust gas. For the reducing agent, there is used, for example, fuel (light oil) in the internal combustion engine 1, but it is not limited to this.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The fuel injected from the injection valve 5 into the exhaust passage 2 decreases the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas which has flowed from an upstream side of the exhaust passage 2. Then, at the time of reducing the NOx stored in the NOx catalyst 4, so-called rich spike control is carried out in which the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing into the NOx catalyst 4 is caused to decrease in a relatively short period or cycle by injecting fuel from the injection valve 5. The amount of the reducing agent to be injected from the injection valve 5 is decided based, for example, on an operating state (the number of engine revolutions per unit time and the amount of fuel injection) of the internal combustion engine 1. The relation among the amount of reducing agent, the number of engine revolutions per unit time and the engine load can be mapped in advance. In addition, an air fuel ratio sensor may be mounted on the exhaust passage 2, and feedback control may be performed on the amount of the reducing agent in such a manner that the air fuel ratio detected by the air fuel ratio sensor becomes a target value.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Here, note that in this embodiment, the injection valve 5 corresponds to a supply device in the present invention. In addition, the reducing agent can also be supplied by causing unburnt fuel to be discharged or delivered from the internal combustion engine 1. That is, provision can be made for a cylinder injection valve which serves to inject fuel into a cylinder, so that a gas containing a large amount of reducing agent can also be caused to discharge or deliver from the internal combustion engine 1, by performing auxiliary injection (post injection) in which fuel is once again injected during an<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> expansion stroke or an exhaust stroke after main injection has been carried out from the cylinder injection valve, or by retarding the timing of fuel injection from the cylinder injection valve.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In addition, an upstream side NOx sensor 7 for measuring the concentration of NOx in the exhaust gas is mounted on the exhaust passage 2 at a location upstream of the injection valve 5.

On the other hand, in the case where the NOx catalyst 4 is the above-mentioned deteriorated catalyst, the reduction ability thereof becomes low due to the decreased surface area of Pt, so that the amount of NH<sub>3</sub> to be generated decreases.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">In addition, in the case where the NOx catalyst 4 is the new catalyst, when the NOx stored in the NOx catalyst 4 is exhausted, the reducing agent becomes an excessive state. This reducing agent reacts with NOx freshly flowing into the NOx catalyst 4, so that NH<sub>3</sub> is thereby generated. In the second rich spike control, the supply of the reducing agent is carried out a plurality of times, and hence, after the NOx stored in the NOx catalyst 4 has been exhausted, NH<sub>3</sub> is generated each time the reducing agent is supplied to<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> the new catalyst. Then, when the supply of the reducing agent is carried out in a repeated manner, the amount of NH<sub>3</sub> flowing to the downstream side of the NOx catalyst 4 will be reversed between the new catalyst and the deteriorated catalyst.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">In that case, at the time of the first rich spike control, it is difficult to carry out the determination of deterioration of the NOx catalyst 4 based on the concentration of NH<sub>3</sub>, but at the time of the second rich spike control, the amount of NH<sub>3</sub> generated in the new catalyst increases, so that it becomes possible to carry out the determination of deterioration of the NOx catalyst 4 based on the concentration of NH<sub>3</sub>.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">For example, when the maximum value of the concentration of NH<sub>3</sub> detected by the downstream side NOx sensor 8 at the time of the execution of the second spike control is equal to or greater than the threshold value, the NOx catalyst 4 can be determined to be normal, whereas when it is less than the threshold value, the NOx catalyst 4 can be determined to have deteriorated. The threshold value can be set to the maximum value of the concentration of NH<sub>3</sub> which is detected at the time when the NOx catalyst 4 is on the boundary of whether it is normal or it has deteriorated</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">Moreover, in the second rich spike control, the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is caused to change between a rich state and a lean state in a repeated manner, so that the detection of NH<sub>3</sub> can be carried out a plurality of times. Thus, by detecting NH<sub>3</sub> a plurality of times, it is possible to enhance the accuracy of the determination of deterioration of the NOx catalyst 4.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">For instance, after the predetermined time has elapsed from the point in time at which the first rich spike control has been started, the second rich spike control is started, and the local maximum value of the concentration of NH<sub>3</sub> detected by the downstream side NOx sensor 8 is stored each time the reducing agent is supplied at the time of the execution of the second rich spike<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> control, wherein when the number of times (frequency) in which the local maximum value becomes equal to or more than the threshold value is equal to or more than a predetermined number of times, a determination can be made that the NOx catalyst 4 is normal. On the other hand, when the number of times in which the local maximum value of the concentration of NH<sub>3</sub> becomes equal to or greater than the threshold value is less than the predetermined number of times, a determination can be made that the NOx catalyst 4 has deteriorated. The predetermined period of time at this time is a period of time required to recover the occlusion or storage capacity of the NOx catalyst 4, and it may be a period of time required for ordinary rich spike control which is ordinarily carried out for reducing the NOx stored in the NOx catalyst 4.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">In this manner, by detecting the concentration of NH<sub>3</sub> flowing out from the NOx catalyst 4 at the time of the second rich spike control by means of the downstream side NOx sensor 8, it is possible to determine the deterioration of the NOx catalyst 4.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078"><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 8</figref> is a flow chart showing a flow for the determination of deterioration of the NOx catalyst 4 according to this embodiment. This routine is carried out in a repeated manner at each predetermined time interval. Here, note that whole for those steps in which the same processing as in the above-mentioned flow is carried out, the same symbols are attached, and the explanation thereof is omitted.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">In step S201, the first rich spike control is executed. In this step, the reducing agent is supplied in order to decrease the amount of the NOx stored in the NOx catalyst 4.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">In step S202, it is determined whether an estimated value of the amount of NOx (hereinafter, also referred to as an estimated storage amount of NOx) stored in the NOx catalyst 4 is equal to or less than a predetermined value. In this step, it is determined whether the amount of NOx stored in the<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> NOx catalyst 4 has decreased to a sufficient extent. The actual amount of NOx stored in the NOx catalyst 4 decreases according to the period of time elapsed after the first rich spike control has been started, and hence the relation between the elapsed period of time and the estimated storage amount of NOx has been mapped, and stored in the ECU 10. Here, note that when the period of time elapsed after the first rich spike control has been started is equal to or greater than a predetermined period of time, a determination may be made that the estimated storage amount of NOx is equal to or less than the predetermined value. Moreover, the estimated storage amount of NOx can also be obtained by means of well-known techniques.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">In cases where an affirmative determination is made in step S202, the routine goes to step S203, whereas in cases where a negative determination is made, a return to step S201 is carried out.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">In step S203, the second rich spike control is executed. That is, the supply of the reducing agent for a period of time shorter than that in the first rich spike control is repeatedly carried out a plurality of times. An optimum value for the number of times to be repeated can be obtained in advance through experiments, etc.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">In step S204, it is determined whether the number of times in which the local maximum value of the detected value of the downstream side NOx sensor 8 becomes equal to or greater than the threshold value is equal to or more than the predetermined number of times. The threshold value and the predetermined number of times are values which become boundaries of whether the NOx catalyst 4 has deteriorated, and these values have been obtained in advance through experiments, et al. The local maximum value of the detected value of the downstream side NOx sensor 8 is stored each time the supply of the reducing agent is carried out a plurality of times. Here, note that as the deterioration of the NOx catalyst progresses, a maximum value among the local maximum values detected the plurality of times becomes<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> smaller, and the number of times in which the above-mentioned local maximum value becomes equal to or greater than the threshold value also decreases. For this reason, the above-mentioned maximum value at the time when the NOx catalyst 4 is on the boundary of whether or not it has deteriorated may be set as a threshold value, so that a determination may be made as to whether the maximum value of the detected value of the downstream side NOx sensor 8 is equal to or greater than this threshold value.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">In cases where an affirmative determination is made in step S204, the routine advances to step S105, in which a determination is made that the NOx catalyst 4 is normal. On the other hand, in cases where a negative determination is made in step S204, the routine advances to step S106, in which a determination is made that the NOx catalyst 4 has deteriorated. Here, note that in this embodiment, the ECU 10, which carries out the processing of step S201 through step S106, corresponds to the determination device in the present invention.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">As described above, according to this second embodiment, it is possible to carry out the determination of deterioration of the NOx catalyst 4 based on the concentration of NH<sub>3</sub> after the NOx stored in the NOx catalyst 4 has been reduced. In addition, by decreasing the NOx stored in the NOx catalyst 4 in the first rich spike control, the determination of deterioration of the NOx catalyst 4 becomes possible in a short time after the start of the second rich spike control. Moreover, by causing the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas to vary between a rich state and a lean state a plurality of times in the second rich spike control, it is possible to enhance the accuracy of the determination of deterioration of the NOx catalyst 4.</p><heading id="h0013">[EXPLANATION OF REFERENCE NUMERALS AND CHARACTERS]</heading><p id="p0086" num="0086"><dl id="dl0001"><dt>1</dt><dd>internal combustion engine</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>exhaust passage</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>NOx storage reduction catalyst<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --></dd><dt>5</dt><dd>injection valve</dd><dt>7</dt><dd>upstream side NOx sensor</dd><dt>8</dt><dd>downstream side NOx sensor</dd><dt>9</dt><dd>temperature sensor</dd><dt>10</dt><dd>ECU</dd><dt>11</dt><dd>accelerator pedal</dd><dt>12</dt><dd>accelerator opening sensor</dd><dt>13</dt><dd>crank position sensor</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982548" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A catalyst deterioration determination system which determines deterioration of a NOx storage reduction catalyst which is arranged in an exhaust passage of an internal combustion engine in such a manner that it stores NOx and reduces the NOx stored therein by the supply of a reducing agent, said system comprising:
