An image pickup apparatus includes, for example, an illumination optical system 101 and an image pickup optical system 103, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>. A light source 102, such as an LED, irradiates a subject 106 with irradiation light, and an image sensor 105 provided on the image side of an image pickup lens 104 detects regular reflection light and scattered light which are both incident via the subject 106 (e.g., a palm or a sheet on which a barcode is printed). Thereby, an image pickup apparatus 100 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> reads information of the subject 106.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the meantime, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, both regular reflection light (solid lines in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) and scattered light (dashed lines in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) having a lower light intensity than the regular reflection light are generated from each point on the surface of the subject 106 irradiated with irradiation light, but not all of the regular reflection light rays generated from the points in the field of view of the image pickup optical system 103 enter the image sensor 105. Thus, even when a point from which regular reflection light to be detected by the image sensor 105 is emitted (point B in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) and a point from which regular reflection light not to be detected by the image sensor 105 is emitted (points A and C in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>) are illuminated at the same illuminance, the amount of detected light becomes different between these two points.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Such a difference in the amount of light caused by<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> regular reflection light (hereinafter referred to as "regular-reflection noise") is one factor that deteriorates the reading precision of the image pickup apparatus. Thus, in the field of image pickup apparatuses, a technology has been pursued for limiting regular-reflection noise so as to improve the reading precision of the image pickup apparatuses.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In order to improve the reading precision of the image pickup apparatus by limiting regular-reflection noise, it is necessary to prevent high-luminance regions from being locally generated on a subject, but simply equalizing illuminance is insufficient. The directivity of illumination light needs to be controlled to appropriately guide light generated from a subject to the image-pickup optical system. As a technology for controlling the directivity of light, a technology is known wherein the direction in which light is emitted is controlled using a prism plate, and such a technology is disclosed by, for example, patent document 1.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> illustrate controlling the direction in which light is emitted by a prism plate in accordance with a prior art. <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a relationship between incident light and outgoing light on an XZ cross-section of a prism plate. <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a relationship on an XZ cross-section of the prism plate between outgoing light and the light perpendicularly incident onto the prism plate. <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a relationship on a YZ cross-section taken on line AA' in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> between outgoing light and the light perpendicularly incident onto the prism plate. <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a relationship between incident light and outgoing light with the prism plate illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> being viewed from above.

The prism plate 200 allows incident light that enters from the prism-surface-201 side to be deflected by refraction at the prism surface 201 and the plane surface 203 so as to control the outgoing direction, with the result that the directivity of the outgoing light can be controlled.</p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT DOCUMENT</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">Patent document 1: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004171192A"><text>2004-171192</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The prism plate 200 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> cannot emit outgoing light in a Y direction that is parallel to the ridge line 202 (hereinafter referred to as a "ridge-line direction") . In particular, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, the light perpendicularly incident on the prism plate 200 (to be exact, incident light that does not have a Y-direction component; see the solid lines in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>) is deflected only in an X direction that is orthogonal to the ridge line 202. Thus, the outgoing light is not emitted in the ridge-line direction that is parallel to the ridge line 202. Similarly, incident light that is not incident on the prism plate 200 (to be exact, incident light that has a Y-direction component; see the dashed lines in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>) is deflected by the prism surface 201 in an X direction. Thus, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, outgoing light has a Y-direction component in accordance with the Y-direction component of incident light but is not emitted in the ridge-line direction that is parallel to the ridge line 202.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As described above, technologies that use a conventional prism plate such as those disclosed by cited document 1 do not allow light to be emitted in the ridge-line direction, so the directivity of light cannot be arbitrarily controlled.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">To improve the control, a method may possibly be used wherein blasting is applied to the outgoing surface of a prism plate so as to diffuse outgoing light. <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> prism plate that includes an outgoing surface formed as a blasted surface. <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>, and <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> illustrate controlling the direction in which outgoing light is emitted by the prism plate illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a relationship between outgoing light and incident light that enters the prism plate perpendicularly on an XZ cross-section of the prism plate illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a relationship on a YZ cross-section taken on line BB' in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> between outgoing light and the light incident perpendicularly onto the prism plate. <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the directivity of outgoing light with the prism plate illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref> being viewed from above.

With reference to the prism plate 300, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 8</figref>, incident light deflected in the X direction by the prism surface 301 is diffused by the blasted surface 303, so outgoing light is also emitted in the ridge-line direction that is parallel to the ridge line 302.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">However, the light incident on the blasted surface 303 has a strong X-direction directivity due to deflection by the prism surface 301. Thus, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG. 9</figref>, the distribution of the amount of outgoing light emitted from the blasted surface 303 in various directions (hereinafter referred to as a "directivity distribution") is shaped like an ellipse having a short axis extending in the ridge-line direction (the Y direction), thereby disadvantageously maintaining a strong X-direction directivity even after diffusion by the blasted surface 303.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Accordingly, the prism plate 300 having the blasted surface 303 as an outgoing surface can control light directivities only in a limited way, so the light directivities<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> cannot be arbitrarily controlled.

Accordingly, the illumination optical system in accordance with the present embodiment also allows a balance to be arbitrarily controlled between the amount of illumination light emitted in the positive ridge-line direction (Y+) and the amount of illumination light emitted in the negative ridge-line direction (Y-). Such an adjustment may be made in accordance with, for example, the distance from the outgoing surface 18 to the object 21. As with the flat portion 16, the outgoing surface 18 is basically parallel to the line-up direction but does not necessarily need to be parallel to the ridge-line direction.

As a method for determining a designed value of a blast intensity, a method may possibly be adopted that uses a trial-manufacture experiment wherein blasting is applied at different blast intensities to materials similar to the material for an actual prism plate, e.g., plastic materials, and then these materials are compared with each other. However, applying blasting to a prism-plate mold at a blast intensity determined using such a method does not lead to an expectation that a prism plate formed by the mold will have a performance similar to the performance of the material used in the trial-manufacture experiment. This is because conditions such as hardness are completely different between the material used in the trial-manufacture experiment and the material for the mold. Thus, in order to determine a blast intensity that achieves a desired performance, it is necessary to apply blasting to molds themselves at different blast intensities and to compare these molds with each other,<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> thereby causing a great burden in terms of both time and cost. By contrast, unlike the prism plate 300 in accordance with the prior art illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG.5</figref>, the prism plate 14 does not include a blasted surface. Accordingly, the illumination optical system in accordance with the present embodiment that includes the prism plate 14 allows a desired directivity to be easily achieved at a low cost. Moreover, without relying on an indirect index such as a blast intensity, the prism plate may be designed by designating the shape of the prism plate 14 in accordance with, for example, the width and the angle of the inclined portion 15 and the flat portion 16. Thus, the design may be represented on a drawing, and, as a result, designed performances may be achieved with a high reproducibility.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In addition, the illumination optical system in accordance with the present embodiment may downsize the entirety of the image pickup apparatus.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The illumination optical system in accordance with the prior art cannot emit illumination light in the ridge-line direction, so making the illumination optical system loop-shaped to surround an image pickup optical system disables illumination light emitted from a light source from being effectively utilized.

Thus, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>, the illumination optical system may be shaped like a rectangular loop in such a manner that the image pickup optical system is located inside the rectangular loop, and hence the illumination optical system in accordance with the present embodiment may downsize the entirety of the image pickup apparatus while maintaining the efficiency for utilization of illumination light.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In the following, descriptions will be given of various variations of the prism plate included in the illumination optical system in accordance with the present embodiment.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 17</figref> is a perspective view of a variation of the prism plate included in the illumination optical system illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0018">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates a relationship between outgoing light and the light incident on the prism plate illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 17</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0019">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates a relationship between outgoing light and the light incident on a prism plate including a flat portion that occupies a higher proportion of a prism surface than the flat portion of the prism plate illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 17</figref> does. <figref idrefs="f0020">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates a relationship between outgoing light and the light incident on another variation of the prism plate included in the illumination optical system illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0021">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates a relationship between outgoing light and the light incident on still another variation of the prism plate included in the illumination optical system illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG. 10</figref>.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">A prism plate 22 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0017">FIG. 17</figref> is different from the prism plate 14 in the sense that a prism surface 25 on a side facing a light guide includes: inclined portions 23 that correspond to the slopes of a peak formed by each of the plurality of prism columns and that are inclined with respect to the line-up direction; and flat portions 24 that correspond to troughs formed between the plurality of prism columns and that are parallel to the line-up direction.
