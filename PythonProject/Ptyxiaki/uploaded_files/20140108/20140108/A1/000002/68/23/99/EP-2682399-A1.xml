In recent years, the inventors have found that a compound represented by the formula (IIIa) out of the derivatives exhibits remarkably strong antibacterial actions against pathogens of bacterial respiratory tract infections in livestock animals such as cattle and swine. The inventors have also found that a compound represented by the formula (IIIb) using josamycin as a lead scaffold has remarkably strong antibacterial activities against main pathogens of bacterial respiratory tract infections in livestock animals such as cattle and swine.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The inventors of the present invention produce the derivatives in accordance with the following method. That is, the above-mentioned compound as one of the derivatives is produced through the following series of steps of: (A) selectively epoxidizing a protected product modified with an appropriate protective group at the C-12 and C-13 olefm positions; (B) cleaving the epoxy moiety with an azide; (C) reducing the resultant azide product to afford an amino alcohol; (D) introducing a desired side chain by a Borch reductive amination reaction (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Borch, R. F.et al. J. Org. Chem, (1972), 37, 1673</text></nplcit>.); and (E) finally performing deprotection.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">This production method has problems such as a decrease in yield and a complicated operation in purification, which are caused by formation of a by-product having two side chains introduced in the Borch reductive amination reaction in the step (D). In general, in<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the case where an aldehyde to be introduced is bulky to some extent, the Borch reductive amination reaction preferentially gives a monoalkyl product owing to steric hindrance of the aldehyde. However, when the production method was employed for the above-mentioned compound, a dialkyl product was formed as a by-product because of high substrate dependency. In addition, picoline borane is known as a reducing agent capable of suppressing the formation of the dialkyl product as the by-product. However, in the Borch reduction into the above-mentioned compound with the reducing agent as well, preferential formation of the monoalkyl product was not observed.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Further, in methylation of an amino group, it is very difficult to obtain a monomethyl product, and a dimethyl product is generally formed. In actuality, when the methylation was employed for the above-mentioned compound, only the dimethyl product was formed.

As a result, the inventors have solved the problems by avoiding reductive alkylation from an amino group, which leads to a decrease in yield. That is, the inventors have succeeded in producing a monoalkylamino intermediate (I) of interest by directly reducing an aza wittig-type intermediate formed by an azide group and a phosphine in an azide obtained by ring-opening of an epoxide. In particular, when a method of producing a compound represented by the formula (III) via an intermediate (II) having a monomethylated amino group is employed, it is possible to produce a compound of interest by using a minimum amount of an aldehyde corresponding to a desired side chain used in subsequent Borch reduction. As a result, the inventors have achieved a decrease in reagent amount, an improvement in yield, and facilitation of purification, and the present invention has been completed as an efficient and novel production method.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present invention provides a method of efficiently producing a compound represented by the formula (III) exhibiting excellent antibacterial activities against bacterial infections in animals, and novel intermediates (I) and (II).</p><heading id="h0006">ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">The monoalkylated amino product (I) obtained in the production method according to the present invention is an extremely useful synthetic intermediate. Specifically, when the compound represented by the formula (III) is synthesized via the monomethylated amino<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> product (II), the reagent amount of an aldehyde corresponding to a side chain to be subsequently added can be reduced to an almost theoretical equivalent. Therefore, this has allowed a production method for the compound represented by the formula (III), which is inexpensive and facilitates purification, to be provided.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The compound represented by the formula (III) provided by the production method of the present invention is effective not only for Gram-positive bacteria, mycoplasmae, chlamydiae, and rickettsiae in the same manner as general macrolides but also for Gram-negative bacteria problematic in infections in animals. Further, the compound produced in the present invention can exhibit excellent antibacterial effects against pathogens of respiratory tract infections in animals such as cattle and swine. In addition, the use of the compound produced in the present invention allows infections in animals, such as lung infection, mastitis, bacteremia, septicemia, and diarrhea, to be treated or prevented effectively.</p><heading id="h0007">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The inventors of the present invention have succeeded for the first time in producing a compound represented by the formula (I) or a salt thereof, and have been able to find a novel method of producing an excellent animal antibacterial compound represented by the formula (III) in good yield via the compound represented by the formula (I).</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">That is, the present invention relates to, for example, the following items:
