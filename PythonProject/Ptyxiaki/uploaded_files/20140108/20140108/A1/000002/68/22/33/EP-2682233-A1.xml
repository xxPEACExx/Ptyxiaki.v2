As is well-known, although clamping tools for clamping pipes of a variety of specifications have appeared on the market presently, they're only suitable for the clamping operation of small-sized pipes. When they are used for clamping and connecting of large-sized pipes, it is not only very laborious and time-consuming, which reduces the efficiency of construction, but also brings a lot of inconvenience to constructors.

<ul><li>As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004">FIGs. 1-4</figref>, a clamping tool capable of changing a clamp handle angle comprises a working head 1, a clamp handle 2 and an adjustment structure 3. The working head 1 is formed by connecting a clamp head 1-1 and a positioning shaft 1-3 through a cover plate 1-2, and a replaceable opening mould 1-4 is installed on the clamp head; the clamp handle 2 comprises a left clamp handle 2-1 and a right clamp handle 2-2. A ratchet retaining mechanism 4 and a clamp handle angle adjustment mechanism 5 are installed on the clamp handle; the right clamp handle 2-2 comprises the upper clamp handle 2-2a and a lower clamp handle<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> 2-2b movably connected to the upper clamp handle 2-2a through a rotating shaft 6. The ratchet retaining mechanism 4 comprises: a ratchet plate 4-2 installed at an upper clamp handle 2-2a of the right clamp handle and a ratchet 4-1 installed on the left clamp handle. A clamp handle angle adjustment mechanism 5 is installed on the right clamp handle. The clamp handle angle adjustment mechanism comprises: a slider component, a guide pin shaft 5-2, a compression spring 5-3 and a positioning pin shaft 5-4 used for the adjustment of dominant angle of the right clamp handle. The slider component consists of a main slider 5-1, a steel wire rope 5-6, and a handle slider 5-5. The slider component, which is movably connected to the lower clamp handle through the guide pin shaft, is disposed within a U-shaped slot of the lower clamp handle of the right clamp handle; the positioning pin shaft is installed on the upper clamp handle of the right clamp handle; the compression spring is nested inside the steel wire rope, with one end of the compression spring connected to the main slider, and the other end abutting the spring plank 5-7.</li></ul></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The main slider 5-1 and the handle slider 5-5 are in the shape of a following-the-right-clamp-handle type and installed within the right clamp handle. A guide groove 5-1a is formed on the main slider and the handle slider, through which the main slider and the handle slider slide under the action of the guide pin shaft. An adjustment handle 5-1b<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> suitable for being pulled by the human hand is formed on the lower part of the outer end of the handle slider, and a groove 5-1c facilitating the adjustment of the angle of the right clamp handle is formed on the upper part of the main slider.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The lower end of the upper clamp handle of the right clamp handle is made into a bend stop part 2-3 to prevent the clamp handle from opening with a too large angle.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A circular arc groove 2-4 is formed on the side of the lower clamp handle of the right clamp handle to avoid an acting force produced by the guide pin shaft. An outward bending part is formed on the lower clamp handle of the right clamp handle.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The working principle of the present invention is:
<ul><li>As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, when the clamping tool is in the initial opening state (<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>), as the opening angle of the clamp handle 2 is too large, without the angle adjustment mechanism, a significant amount of force must be exerted by the hands holding the clamp handle to close the clamp handle. At this time, pushing the adjustment handle 5-1b and pulling down the handle slider 5-5, the main slider 5-1 driven by the steel wire rope 5-6 is detached from the side contact with the positioning pin shaft 5-4, which just falls at the groove on the right clamp handle and the main slider. Then through rotating the right clamp handle, the opening angle thereof can be decreased (<figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>). At this point, a force<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> can then be easily applied to the clamp handle that has rotated with an angle to close the clamp handle through a step-by-step action of the ratchet. When the clamp handle is closed to a position where the two hands are about to touch each other (<figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, position A), the right clamp handle is rotated outwardly. At this time, under the action of the compression spring 5-3, the main slider springs upwardly and the positioning pin shaft contacts the side of the main slider, which in turn makes the clamp handle open with a certain angle (<figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref>, position B). The force application is again continued, and the fastener 8 under the clamping force makes the pipe joint 10 and pipe 9 be tightly coupled, then a connection operation may be completed. The present clamping tool is simple to operate and time-and-labor saving, which improves the efficiency of installation and construction.</li></ul></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56983082" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A manual clamping tool capable of changing a clamp handle angle comprising a working head, a clamp handle and an adjustment structure; the working head being formed by connecting a clamp head and a positioning shaft through a cover plate, a replaceable opening mould being installed on the clamp head, the clamp handle comprising a left clamp handle and a right clamp handle, wherein a ratchet retaining mechanism is installed on the clamp handle, and the ratchet retaining mechanism comprises: a ratchet plate installed at an upper clamp handle of the right clamp handle and a ratchet installed on the left clamp handle; the right clamp handle comprises the upper clamp handle and a lower clamp handle movably connected to the upper clamp handle through a rotating shaft, and a clamp handle angle adjustment mechanism is installed on the right clamp handle.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0002" num="0002"><claim-text>The manual clamping tool capable of changing a clamp handle angle according to claim 1, wherein the clamp handle angle adjustment mechanism comprises: a slider component, a guide pin shaft, a compression spring and a positioning pin shaft used for the adjustment of dominant angle of the right clamp handle; the slider component consists of a main slider, a steel wire rope and a handle slider; the slider component, which is movably connected to the lower clamp handle through the guide pin shaft, is disposed within a U-shaped slot of the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> lower clamp handle of the right clamp handle; the positioning pin shaft is installed on the upper clamp handle of the right clamp handle; the compression spring is nested inside the steel wire rope, with one end of the compression spring connected to the main slider, and the other end abutting the spring plank.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0003" num="0003"><claim-text>The manual clamping tool capable of changing a clamp handle angle according to claim 2, wherein the main slider and the handle slider are in the shape of a following-the-right-clamp-handle type and installed within the right clamp handle, a guide groove is formed on the main slider and the handle slider, through which the main slider and the handle slider slide under the action of the guide pin shaft, an adjustment handle suitable for being pulled by the human hand is formed on the lower part of the outer end of the handle slider, and a groove facilitating the adjustment of the angle of the right clamp handle is formed on the upper part of the main slider.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0004" num="0004"><claim-text>The manual clamping tool capable of changing a clamp handle angle according to claim 1, wherein the lower end of the upper clamp handle of the right clamp handle is made into a bend stop part to prevent the clamp handle from opening with a too large angle.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0005" num="0005"><claim-text>The manual clamping tool capable of changing a clamp handle angle according to claim 4, wherein a circular arc groove is formed on the side of the lower clamp handle of the right clamp handle to avoid an<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> acting force produced by the guide pin shaft.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0006" num="0006"><claim-text>The manual clamping tool capable of changing a clamp handle angle according to claim 5, wherein an outward bending part is formed on the lower clamp handle of the right clamp handle.</claim-text></claim></claims><drawings mxw-id="PDW16671384" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --><figure id="f0001" num="1"><img id="if0001" file="imgf0001.tif" wi="124" he="233" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --><figure id="f0002" num="2"><img id="if0002" file="imgf0002.tif" wi="95" he="233" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --><figure id="f0003" num="3"><img id="if0003" file="imgf0003.tif" wi="118" he="233" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --><figure id="f0004" num="4"><img id="if0004" file="imgf0004.tif" wi="149" he="233" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><search-report-data><doc-page id="srep0001" file="srep0001.tif" wi="165" he="233" type="tif"/><doc-page id="srep0002" file="srep0002.tif" wi="165" he="227" type="tif"/><doc-page id="srep0003" file="srep0003.tif" wi="165" he="227" type="tif"/><doc-page id="srep0004" file="srep0004.tif" wi="165" he="232" type="tif"/></search-report-data><copyright>User acknowledges that Fairview Research LLC and its third party providers retain all right, title and interest in and to this xml under applicable copyright laws.
