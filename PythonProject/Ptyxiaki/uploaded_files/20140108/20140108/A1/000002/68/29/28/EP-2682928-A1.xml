The signal is generated visually using a warning lamp or any kind of display and/or acoustically.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Further, it is known to provide means for setting user preferences for the signals. In car navigation systems the user preferences may e.g. include language settings, the selection of the voice giving the navigation instructions (e.g. male voice or female voice), loudness levels for the sound or brightness levels for the visual warning signal.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Despite of these possibilities, drivers get used to the warning signals and are likely not to pay sufficient attention to the signals, in particular when the drivers are getting tired. One of the reasons is that the preset signals are not emotionally touching to a sufficient degree.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Despite of the improved security technology, the number of deadly accidents is still high and could be reduced if only the drivers would reliably observe the statutory speed limits.
