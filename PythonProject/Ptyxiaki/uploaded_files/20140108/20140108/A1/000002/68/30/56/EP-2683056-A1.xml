The natural energy is also referred to as green energy or renewable energy. Because an amount of power generation of natural energy power usually depends upon the weather, a power transmission scheme using stably supplied commercial power regardless of the weather in combination with natural energy power is commonly used in power transmission.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, a charging apparatus that performs charging by commercial power until a remaining capacity of a secondary battery reaches a constant amount when the secondary battery is charged, and performs charging by a solar battery after the remaining capacity reaches the constant amount has been proposed (see Patent Literature 1). This charging apparatus estimates the remaining capacity from a battery voltage or a charging time in charging control.

In addition, the processor 761 reads the metadata stored in the battery pack 703, generates data for displaying the content representing the metadata, and outputs the generated data to the display section 770 via a signal line 881.</p><p id="p0126" num="0126">The memory 762 is a main storage apparatus directly accessible by the processor 761.

Fig. 29</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the configuration example of the charging circuit 506 of the modified example. The charging circuit 506 is different from the charging circuit 500 of the first embodiment in that a control section 606 is included instead of the control section 600. The control section 606 is different from the control section 600 of the first embodiment in that a switch 651 is included instead of the switch 650.</p><p id="p0130" num="0130">The switch 651 includes two input terminals and one output terminal. One input terminal of the switch 651 is connected to a diode 320, and the other input terminal is connected to an AC adapter 330. The output terminal of the switch 651 is connected to a switch 660. A power transmission control section 630 switches an input destination of the switch 651 to the diode 320 when a predicted time Tg is earlier than a completion time Ts, and switches the input destination of the switch 651 to the AC adapter 330 when the predicted time Tg is the completion time Ts or later. Thereby, a battery 710 is charged with only AC power when the predicted time Tg is the completion time Ts or later. According to this configuration, because only one of natural energy power and power from an AC power supply is supplied, overcharging is less likely to occur as compared to the charger system of the first embodiment in which both are supplied.</p><p id="p0131" num="0131">The above-described embodiments are examples for embodying the present<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> technology, and matters in the embodiments each have a corresponding relationship with invention-specific matters in the claims.
