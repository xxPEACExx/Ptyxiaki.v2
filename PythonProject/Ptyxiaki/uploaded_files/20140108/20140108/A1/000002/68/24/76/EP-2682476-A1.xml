Therefore, HDL cholesterol is also called the reverse cholesterol transport system. High-density lipoprotein is known to have negative correlation with arteriosclerotic diseases such as coronary arteriosclerosis. Accordingly, an HDL value lower than a predetermined lower limit is regarded as an indication of hyperlipidemia, and the value is known to be useful as an index of arteriosclerosis.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">HDL is constituted by apoprotein, phospholipid, cholesterol and neutral fat. HDL has a density of d=1.063 to 1.210 g/mL, and can be divided into two fractions, that is, HDL2, wherein d=1.063 to 1.125g/mL, and HDL3, wherein d=1.125 to 1.210 g/mL. A notch is found at the portion of d=1.125 g/mL in the distribution curve of lipoprotein, and the part having higher densities in the curve corresponds to HDL3. Alternatively, HDL can be divided into subfractions based on the content of<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> apolipoprotein E among the apoproteins in HDL, and HDLs having higher contents of apoE are defined as apoE-rich HDLs.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Conventionally, HDL is known to function not only as a whole but also as the individual HDL2 and HDL3 subfractions having different functions. HDL2 is known to have an antiatherogenic action. It is clinically known that CETP deficiency prevents metabolism of HDL to LDL or IDL, leading to an increase in the HDL cholesterol level. It is also said that the HDL increased by CETP deficiency is HDL2. Further, it is also said that CETP deficiency causes an increase in apoE-rich HDL, and that, since Apo-E-rich HDL has a strong cholesterol-efflux ability and antiplatelet action, it is a better HDL among HDLs. Further, a decrease in the hepatic lipase activity prevents conversion of HDL3 to HDL2, resulting in an increase in HDL3. That is, the ratios of subtractions of HDL may vary depending on the clinical condition, and measurement of HDL alone hardly allows detection of such changes. In view of such tendencies, it is expected that measurement of each of the HDL subfractions may contribute to judgment of whether or not a patient is suffering from a disease such as arteriosclerosis or hyperlipidemia, and of the cause of the disease. Further, at present, in view of these functions of HDL subfractions, manufacturers are developing therapeutic agents that inhibit the function of CETP, decrease the LDL cholesterol level, and increase the HDL cholesterol level.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Establishment of a simple method for measuring the HDL subfractions may lead to detailed elucidation of their functions, and to their therapeutic effects in the future.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Examples of the methods for measuring HDL subfractions that are known at present include ultracentrifugation, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> HDL3 precipitation (Patent Document 1) and NMR.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In ultracentrifugation, fractionation is carried out utilizing the difference in the density of lipoprotein. This method has drawbacks in that the operation requires a skill; the method takes many days; and the cost is high. In the method by Okazaki et al. wherein HPLC is used for separating HDL2 and HDL3, the operation takes a long time, and special equipment is required. HDL3 precipitation is a method wherein a reagent containing a divalent metal ion and dextran sulfate is used to aggregate lipoproteins other than HDL3, and HDL3 in the supernatant portion is recovered by centrifugation and measured using an automatic analyzer. This method is not widely used since the method has drawbacks in that the operation of this method also requires a skill; the method is a manual method; the method requires an operation of sample pretreatment; and a certain length of time is required before measurement. Further, NMR, which is a method wherein the number of particles of lipoprotein is measured by nuclear magnetic resonance, is not commonly employed since the method requires special equipment.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">There is a method for analyzing HDL subfractions (Patent Document 2). Although this method enables measurement with a general purpose automatic apparatus, the method employs a method wherein a surfactant is used to prevent an enzyme from acting on lipoproteins other than HDL3. By measuring HDL3 and subtracting the value of HDL3 from total HDL, HDL2 can be measured, but the method does not directly measure HDL2.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Thus, as an alternative to the above methods, a reagent that enables simple and more selective quantification of cholesterol in HDL2 needs to be invented.</p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --><heading id="h0004">[Patent Documents]</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010"><ul><li>[Patent Document 1] <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2009207463A"><text>JP 2009-207463 A</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 2] <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2001346598A"><text>JP 2001-346598 A</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">An object of the present invention is to provide a method for quantifying HDL2 cholesterol in a test sample without requiring laborious operations.</p><heading id="h0006">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">An object of the present invention is to provide a method for quantifying HDL2 cholesterol in a test sample without requiring laborious operations.

This was then experimentally confirmed to be realizable, to complete the present invention.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">That is, the present invention provides a method for quantifying cholesterol of HDL2, which method comprises allowing phospholipase to act on HDL and quantifying cholesterol. Further, the present invention provides a kit for quantifying cholesterol in high-density lipoprotein 2 by the above method of the present invention, which kit comprises phospholipase. Further, the present invention<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> provides a method for quantifying high-density lipoprotein 2 cholesterol in a test sample, which method comprises: a first step of transferring cholesterols other than high-density lipoproteins in a test sample to the outside of the reaction system; and a second step of quantifying high-density lipoprotein 2 cholesterol among the high-density lipoproteins remaining in the reaction system; wherein the second step is carried out by the above method of the present invention.</p><heading id="h0008">EFFECT OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">By the present invention, HDL2 cholesterol in a test sample can be specifically quantified with an automatic analyzer without requirement of laborious operations such as ultracentrifugation or pretreatment. Further, quantification of the HDL3 cholesterol level can also be carried out by subtracting the HDL2 cholesterol level from the total HDL cholesterol level obtained by a conventional method for quantifying the total HDL cholesterol in a test sample.</p><heading id="h0009">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">As described above, the method for quantifying HDL2 cholesterol of the present invention comprises allowing phospholipase to act on HDL and then quantifying cholesterol. By applying this quantification method to a sample prepared by separating a test sample from a living body and then preliminarily removing cholesterol in lipoproteins other than HDLs therefrom, HDL2 cholesterol in the test sample can be quantified. That is, HDL2 cholesterol in a test sample can be quantified by application of the above-described method of the present invention as the second step of a method for quantifying HDL2 cholesterol in a test sample, which method for quantifying HDL2 cholesterol comprises: a first step of transferring cholesterols other than HDLs in a test sample to the outside of the reaction system; and a second step of quantifying HDL 2 cholesterol among the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> HDLs remaining in the reaction system. This two-step method is described below. It should be noted that, although the two-step method is described below, the second step of this two-step method is the method of the present invention (however, the two-step method itself is also the method of the present invention). Further, the first step described below is not necessarily required for carrying out the method of the present invention, and HDL2 cholesterol in a test sample can also be quantified by separating a test sample from a living body and removing only HDLs therefrom by another known method such as ultracentrifugation, followed by application of the method of the present invention to the HDLs (the second step described below). However, in this case, cholesterol oxidase and cholesterol esterase, which are required for quantification of cholesterol, need to be further supplied (in the two-step method described below, the cholesterol oxidase and cholesterol esterase used in the first step can be continuously used in the second step).</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The test sample to be subjected to the method of the present invention is not limited as long as HDL2 cholesterol in the sample is to be quantified. The sample is preferably serum or blood plasma, or a dilution thereof. Serum or a dilution thereof is especially preferred.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The HDL2 to be measured by the present invention corresponds to larger HDL particles among the HDLs, such as the portion having densities of d=1.063 to 1.125 g/mL or particle sizes of 12.1 to 16 nm. However, these definitions are merely distinctions among HDLs, which have a continuous distribution, and the above-described values do not clearly limit the clinical significance. Since some general reports also use different distinctions in terms of the density, the HDLs in the large-particle side roughly within the above-described range are regarded as HDL2. In the large-particle side, apoE-rich HDLs and the like are also included in the range<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> of measurement of the present invention.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the first step of the present invention, a cholesterol-reactive enzyme(s) such as cholesterol esterase, cholesterol oxidase and/or cholesterol dehydrogenase, in addition to phospholipase, lipoprotein lipase and/or the like are added to the test sample to allow the reaction to proceed. Each of the phospholipase and lipoprotein lipase may be added either as a single enzyme or as a mixture of 2 or more types of the enzyme. In addition, a surfactant(s) may be used in the first step, and the above-mentioned enzymes and the surfactant(s) may be used in combination.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the first step of the method of the present invention, cholesterol of the lipoproteins other than HDLs are transferred to the outside of the reaction system by the action of cholesterol esterase and/or the like. The term "transferred to the outside of the reaction system" herein means that cholesterol and esters thereof are eliminated or protected such that the cholesterol and esters thereof are not involved in the later steps.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The term "eliminate" herein means that cholesterol of lipoprotein in the test sample is degraded such that the cholesterol does not act on the reaction for measurement of cholesterol in a later step. Examples of the method for eliminating lipoprotein cholesterol include a method wherein cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase are allowed to act on the cholesterol, followed by dissociation of the produced hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen using catalase. Alternatively, a hydrogen donor may be reacted with the produced hydrogen peroxide using peroxidase to cause conversion to a colorless quinone. The method for eliminating lipoprotein cholesterol is not limited to these. The method of eliminating cholesterol <i>per se</i> is well-known in the art.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The term "protection" means to protect lipoprotein in the test sample such that the lipoprotein does not react upon cholesterol measurement in a later step. Examples of the method of protection of lipoprotein include, but are not limited to, a method wherein a surfactant is used to specifically protect each lipoprotein such that cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase do not act on the lipoprotein.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the first step, by preliminarily adding, individually or at the same time, an enzyme system and a surfactant for transferring the cholesterol to the outside of the reaction system, both steps can be carried out at the same time as a single step.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the first step, in cases where cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase are used, the concentration (the concentration means the final concentration unless otherwise specified in the present specification) of cholesterol esterase is preferably about 0.1 to 10.0 U/mL, more preferably about 0.2 to 2.0 U/mL. The concentration of cholesterol oxidase is preferably about 0.05 to 10.0 U/mL, more preferably about 0.1 to 1.0 U/mL. The cholesterol esterase is not restricted as long as it acts on ester-type cholesterol, and examples of the cholesterol esterase which may be used include commercially available products such as cholesterol esterase (CEBP, CEN) manufactured by Asahi Kasei Corporation, cholesterol esterase (COE-311, COE-313) manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd., and cholesterol esterase (CHE-XE) manufactured by Kikkoman Co., Ltd. The cholesterol oxidase is not restricted as long as it acts on free cholesterol, and examples of the cholesterol oxidase which may be used include commercially available products such as cholesterol oxidase (CONII) manufactured by Asahi Kasei Corporation, cholesterol oxidase (COO-311, COO-321, COO-331) manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd., and cholesterol oxidase (CHO-CE, CHO-PEWL, CHO-BS) manufactured by Kikkoman Co., Ltd.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In cases where cholesterol dehydrogenase is used, it is used at a concentration of preferably 0.01 to 200 U/mL, more preferably 0.1 to 100 U/mL. The cholesterol dehydrogenase is not restricted as long as it is an enzyme having an ability to oxidize cholesterol and to reduce an oxidized coenzyme. Examples of the cholesterol dehydrogenase that may be used include commercially available products such as cholesterol dehydrogenase (CHDH-5) manufactured by Amano Enzyme Inc.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Phospholipase and/or lipoprotein lipase may be further added, and, in such a case, the enzyme is used at a concentration of preferably about 0.01 to 0.5 U/mL, more preferably 0.02 to 0.5 U/mL. Examples of the lipoprotein lipase or phospholipase that may be used include commercially available products such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL-311 and LPL-314) manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd., lipoprotein lipase (LPL-3 and the like) manufactured by Amano Enzyme Inc., and lipoprotein lipase (LPBP, LP and the like) manufactured by Asahi Kasei Corporation. Examples of the phospholipase that may be used include sphingomyelinase (SPC), and phospholipase A2 (PLA2L), phospholipase D (PLD or PLDP or PLDPV) and phospholipase C (PLC), which are phospholipases, manufactured by Asahi Kasei Corporation. However, in cases where sphingomyelinase is used, the final concentration of sphingomyelinase is preferably about 0.05 to 50 U/mL, more preferably 0.1 to 30 U/mL. The sphingomyelinase is not limited as long as it acts on sphingomyelin, and may also have activities on components constituting phospholipids other than sphingomyelin, such as phosphatidyl inositol. Since phospholipase has only a small influence on HDL2 but can act on lipoproteins other than HDLs under the conditions in the first step including the phospholipase concentration, it allows easy transfer of lipoproteins other than HDLs to the outside of the reaction system.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In cases where a surfactant is added, it is added at a concentration of preferably 0.001 to 5.0% by weight, more preferably 0.002 to 3.0% by weight.
