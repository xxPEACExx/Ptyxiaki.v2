The tripod type constant velocity universal joint includes, for example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 15</figref>, an outer joint member 1, a tripod member 2 serving as the inner joint member, and torque transmission members (roller members) 3.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The outer joint member 1 includes a cup-like mouth portion 4 opened at one end thereof. In an inner peripheral surface of the mouth portion 4, there are formed three track grooves 6 extending in an axial direction of the outer joint member. In side walls facing to each other in a circumferential direction of each of track grooves 6, there are formed roller guide surfaces (roller sliding surfaces) 7a, 7a.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The tripod member 2 includes a boss 8 and leg shafts 9. The boss 8 is provided with spline hole or serration hole 11 which is coupled to a shaft (not shown) to be allowed to transmit torque. The leg shafts 9 each protrude in a radial direction from positions trisecting the boss 8 in the circumferential direction.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Further, each of the torque transmission members 3 includes: a roller 12 including a ring-like body including a radially-outer surface 13 formed into a convex spherical surface; and a ring 15 fitted into the roller 12 through intermediation of a plurality of rollers 16. That is, the roller 12 and the ring 15 are unitized through intermediation of the plurality of rollers 16. Those members and the like constitute a roller assembly. In this case, the roller 12 can be called an outer roller, and the ring 15 can be called an inner roller.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">By the way, the outer joint member 1 includes: the mouth portion 4 including the track grooves 6; and a stem portion (not shown) provided to protrude from a bottom wall of the mouth portion 4. Further, a radially-inner surface of the mouth portion 4 exhibits a shape of a three-petal corolla of a flower, in which smaller radially-inner portions 7b and larger radially-inner portions 7c are alternately connected together through intermediation of the roller guide surfaces 7a in the circumferential direction. That is, in the outer joint member 1, the roller guide surfaces 7a facing to each other in the circumferential direction and the track grooves 6 including the larger radially-inner portions 7c each provided<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> between both of the roller guide surfaces 7a, 7a are formed at three positions in an inner periphery of the outer joint member.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The tripod type constant velocity universal joint illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 15</figref> uses so-called double-roller type roller members each including the inner roller and the outer roller. However, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 16 and Fig. 17</figref>, the tripod type constant velocity universal joint may use so-called single-roller type roller members each including a roller fitted onto a cylindrical outer peripheral surface of the leg shaft through a plurality of needle rollers in such a manner that the roller is rotatable. In this case, each of the leg shafts 9 includes a cylindrical outer peripheral surface 74, and an annular ring groove 76 formed in vicinity of an end of each of the leg shafts. A roller 80 is fitted onto an outer periphery of each of the leg shaft 9 through a plurality of needle rollers 82 in such a manner that the roller 80 is rotatable. The cylindrical outer peripheral surface 74 of each of the leg shafts 9 provides an inner raceway surface for the plurality of needle rollers 82. The roller 80 includes a cylindrical inner peripheral surface to provide an outer raceway surface for the plurality of needle rollers 82.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The plurality of needle rollers 82 are held in contact with an outer washer 84 on outer end surfaces of the plurality of needle rollers, and with an inner washer 88 on end surfaces opposite to the outer end surfaces of the plurality of needle rollers, when viewed from a radial direction of the leg shaft 9. The outer washer<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> 84 is regulated from moving in the axial direction by a circlip 86 mounted into the ring groove 76. As a result, the plurality of needle rollers 82 are also regulated from moving in the axial direction.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Generally, the roller guide surfaces 7a of the outer joint member 1 are subjected to heat hardening treatment. As the heat hardening treatment, there is induction quenching. The induction quenching is mainly divided into a one-shot quenching method of performing heat treatment at a fixed position (Patent Literature 1), and a mobile quenching method in which the coil is moved relative to the outer joint member (Patent Literature 2).</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the one-shot quenching, there is used, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 10</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 11</figref>, a high-frequency heating apparatus including a high-frequency induction heating coil 17. In this case, the high-frequency induction heating coil 17 includes heating portions 17a, 17a, 17a respectively fitted into the three track grooves 6 of the outer joint member 1. Therefore, it is possible to both heat and rapidly cool the roller guide surfaces 7a over an axial entire region of the joint at one time. Further, in Patent Literature 1 described above, in order to prevent hardened layers from being formed in inner surfaces of the larger radially-inner portions 7c, non-conductive ferrite cores are fitted in an induction coil. Therefore, by using the above-mentioned high-frequency induction heating apparatus, there are formed hardened layers S only in surface layers of the roller guide surfaces 7a as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 11</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Further, in the mobile quenching method, another high-frequency induction heating apparatus illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008 f0009 f0010">Fig. 12 to Fig. 14</figref> is used. The high-frequency induction heating apparatus includes: a coil 18 wound to have a three-leaf clover shape; and a cooling jacket 19 attached to the coil 18. The coil 18 includes heating portions 18a, 18a, 18a each having substantially triangle shape and being provided at about 120° pitches in a circumferential direction of the coil. Each of the heating portions 18a includes: curved portions 20a, 20a respectively opposed to the roller guide surfaces 7a; and a straight portion 20b opposed to the larger radially-inner portion 7c. Note that, the cooling jacket 19 has a three-leaf clover shape similarly to the coil 18.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the mobile quenching method, the coil 18 and the cooling jacket 19 are moved along an axial direction in the mouth portion 4 of the outer joint member 1. Along with the above-mentioned movement, heated surfaces (roller guide surfaces 7a and larger radially-inner portions 7c) are heated. Following the above-mentioned heating, the heated surfaces are rapidly cooled with cooling water injected through the cooling jacket 19. Thus, the roller guide surfaces 7a and the larger radially-inner portions 7c are subjected to the heat hardening treatment. In this manner, the hardened layers S are formed.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature:</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul><li>[PTL 1] Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPSHO6134481B"><text>Sho 61-34481</text></patcit></li><li>[PTL 2] Japanese Examined Utility Model Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JPHEI0326335B"><text>Hei 03-26335</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problems</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the general one-shot quenching, temporal heating and temporal cooling are conducted, and hence there is a demerit in that distortion is easy to occur in a thin-walled portion and the like.

The mouth portion 24 has a non-cylindrical shape in which larger-diameter portions 24a and smaller-diameter portions 24b are alternately arranged when viewed in a cross-section. That is, the mouth portion 24 forms the larger-diameter portions 24a and the smaller-diameter portions 24b.

Further, a radially-inner surface exhibits a shape of a three-petal corolla of a flower, in which smaller radially-inner portions 45 and larger radially-inner portions 46 are alternately connected together through intermediation of the roller guide surfaces 27 in the circumferential direction. That is, in the outer joint member 21, the roller guide surfaces 27 and track grooves 6 are formed at three<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> positions in an inner periphery of the outer joint member.

That is, the roller 32 and the ring 35 are unitized through intermediation of the plurality of rollers 36. Those members and the like constitute a roller assembly (roller member).

The needle rollers 36 are incorporated under a so-called full state, in which a large number of the rollers are provided as much as possible and a retainer is not used.

In this case, in each of the larger radially-inner portions 46, there is formed an unquenched portion 50. Note that, in the illustrated example, the unquenched portion 50 is not formed in the entire larger radially-inner portion 46, and the hardened layers S are formed in circumferential ends of the larger radially-inner portion 46.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">For formation of the hardened layers S, there is used a high-frequency heating apparatus 52 including a high-frequency induction heating coil 51 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>. The high-frequency induction heating coil 51 includes three heating portions 51A, 51B, 51C having substantially triangular shapes, which are arranged to have a three-leaf clover shape. Each of the heating portions 51A, 51B, 51C includes: curved portions 53, 53 to face<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> with respect to the roller guide surfaces 27; and straight portions 54 to face to the larger radially-inner portions 46.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Further, heating-suppressing portions for the larger radially-inner portions 46 are provided in positions of the high-frequency induction heating coil 56, the positions being respectively opposed to the larger radially-inner portions 46. Specifically, the heating-suppressing portions include magnetic field line cut-out bodies A. In this case, a recessed portion 55 is provided in a center portion of a surface of each of the straight portions 54, the surface being opposed to each of the larger radially-inner portions. In the recessed portion 55, the magnetic field line cut-out body A including the ferromagnetic core 56 is arranged. A longitudinal length L of the ferromagnetic core 56 is set to be smaller than a longitudinal length L1 of the recessed portion 55. A lateral length W of the ferromagnetic core 56 is set to be substantially the same as a lateral length W1 of the recessed portion 55. Therefore, upper surfaces of the heating portions 51A, 51B, 51C and upper surfaces of the ferromagnetic core 56 are arranged to be flush with each other. Lower surfaces of the heating portions 51A, 51B, 51C and lower surfaces of the ferromagnetic core 56 are arranged to be flush with each other. Further, between side surfaces of the recessed portion 55 and corresponding side surfaces of the ferromagnetic core 56, there are respectively formed gaps 60. Note that, a thickness dimension T of the ferromagnetic core 56 is set to be larger than a depth dimension T1 of the recessed portion 55.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> An outer surface 56a of the ferromagnetic core 56 protrudes slightly to a side of the larger radially-inner portion with respect to an outer surface (surface opposed to the larger radially-inner portion) 54a of the straight line 54 of the heating portion 51A (51B, 51C).</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Note that, though not illustrated, a cooling jacket as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 12</figref> or the like is attached to a lower portion of the high-frequency induction heating coil 51. The cooling jacket includes a cooling piping in which cooling water flows, and has a shape substantially corresponding to a shape of the high-frequency induction heating coil 51.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The high-frequency induction heating coil 51 is supplied with high-frequency current from a high-frequency power source (not shown). In this case, the high-frequency current flows through the heating portion 51A, the heating portion 51B, and the heating portion 51C in this order. As described above, when the high-frequency current flows, an induced electromotive force is generated due to an electromagnetic induction effect. Due to the electromagnetic induction effect, Joule heat is generated. As a result, the roller guide surfaces 27 and the like of the outer joint member 21 can be heated.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Under the above-mentioned state, the high-frequency induction heating coil 51 is continuously moved from a side of an opening portion of the mouth portion to a deep side of the mouth portion. In this manner, the roller guide surfaces 27 and the like are heated from the side of the opening portion to the deep side.<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> Further, along with the above-mentioned movement of the high-frequency induction heating coil 51, the cooling jacket is moved. Thus, a cooling fluid (cooling water) is injected from the cooling jacket to a heated portion of the outer joint member 21, to thereby cool the heated portion. That is, correspondingly to a relative movement of the high-frequency induction heating coil 51, the roller guide surfaces 27 and the like are subsequently heated. Then, following the above-mentioned heating operation, the heated portion is rapidly cooled with the cooling fluid. In this way, induction quenching is performed.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">By the way, in each of the heating portions 51A, 51B, 51C of the high-frequency induction heating coil 51, the ferromagnetic core 56 is provided. Therefore, the ferromagnetic core 56 cuts out magnetic field lines generated through the high-frequency induction heating coil 51. That is, the ferromagnetic core is made of amaterial having high magnetic permeability and is provided to the coil, and hence the ferromagnetic core has an effect of amplifying power through concentrating the magnetic field lines to a work. At the same time, the ferromagnetic core is used for cutting out the magnetic field lines and for preventing undesired heating. Therefore, as in the present invention, if the ferromagnetic core is used for heat hardening treatment for the radially-inner surface of the outer joint member 21 of the tripod type constant velocity universal joint, the unquenched portions 50 can be formed in the larger radially-inner portions 46. That cannot be performed by conventional mobile<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> quenching. Therefore, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, in each of the larger radially-inner portions 46 to which the ferromagnetic core 56 faces, the unquenched portion 50 in which the hardened layers S are prevented from being formed is formed.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In the heat treatment method of the present invention, without forming the hardened layers S in the larger radially-inner portions 46 of the outer joint member 21, the hardened layers S can be formed in the roller guide surfaces 27, 27.

In addition, the mobile quenching is employed as a quenching method, and hence distortion is difficult to occur, and a thickness of the quenched and hardened layers can be uniformed.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">As long as the magnetic field line cut-out bodies A include the ferromagnetic cores 56, it is possible to stably form the unquenched portions 50.

Therefore, the tripod type constant velocity universal joint uses the outer j oint member treated by the heat treatment method, and hence becomes a high-quality tripod type constant velocity universal joint excellent in the durability. In addition, a degree of freedom for designing, for example, downsizing of the joint increases.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Further, in the tripod type constant velocity universal joint as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">Fig. 4 to Fig. 6</figref> or the like, each of the torque transmission members (roller members) 23 is allowed to be tilted in the track groove 26. Thus, tilting of the roller is capable of absorbing tilting of the leg shaft when torque is transmitted under a state in which the joint forms an operating angle. Therefore, that contributes to a reduction of a sliding resistance, and therefore, a reduction of an induced thrust. Therefore, the constant velocity universal joint of the present invention can contributes, when applied in particular to a drive shaft in an automobile, optimization of noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) performance of the automobile associated with the magnitude of the sliding resistance and the induced thrust. Further, a degree of freedom for a design of an under body of the automobile.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">By the way, in the embodiment, the unquenched portion 50 is formed along the axial direction in the center portion in the circumferential direction of the larger radially-inner portion 46.

That is, the hardened layer S may be formed on the joint deep side of the larger radially-inner portion 46 except for the opening portion (entrance portion) side corresponding to the boot mounting portion 44 and for a portion thereof situated at a regularly used position. That is because, even if the hardened layer is formed on the joint deep side of the larger radially-inner portion 46, an effect against the strength of the outer joint member is small. Further, regarding the smaller radially-inner portion 45, the hardened layer S may be formed or may not be formed. The hardened layer S may be formed only in the roller guide surface 27. Therefore, without deteriorating a function as the outer joint member 21, it is possible to form the hardened layer S in an optimum range.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Next, <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref> illustrates an outer joint member 21 of another embodiment.

An inner surface of the larger radially-inner portion 46 is set to be the unquenched portion 50. Further, the hardened layers S are formed also with respect to the inner surfaces of the flange portions 61. The roller member 23 is brought into contact with the flange portions 61, and hence the hardened layers S are formed in the flange portions 61. Even in this case, the hardened layer S may be formed on the joint deep side of the larger radially-inner portion 46 except for the opening portion (entrance portion) side corresponding to the boot<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> mounting portion 44 and for a portion thereof situated at a regularly used position.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Even in a case of the outer joint member 21 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 7</figref>, the high-frequency heating apparatus illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002">Fig. 1 to Fig. 3</figref> or the like can be used to form the hardened layers S.

That is, the high-frequency induction heating coil 51 includes retracted positions to be prevented from coming close to the larger radially-inner portions 46. Therefore, without providing the magnetic field line cut-out bodies A including the ferromagnetic cores 56 or the like, it is possible to prevent the larger radially-inner portions 46 from being heated.
