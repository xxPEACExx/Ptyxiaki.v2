ART]</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In recent years, consciousness of pickiness etc. about safety and production districts of agricultural, forest and fishery products, and the like has been increased in customers and retailers. However, with regard to the production districts, the producers and the wholesalers that ship the agricultural, forest and fishery products to be put on shops of the retailers, the customers and retailers have no means of knowing them.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Namely, in the conventional distribution system of the agricultural, forest and fishery product, many intermediate customers (multiple wholesales etc.) stand between the producers and the customers. Due to the fact that many intermediate customers stand between the producers and the customers in such a manner, when the agricultural, forest and fishery product is delivered to the customers, it is difficult that individual product information (the production district, a producer name, a variety, a cultivation method, a harvest day, quality information, and the like of the above agricultural, forest and fishery product) of the above agricultural, forest and fishery product is precisely conveyed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Thereupon, the individual product information acquisition system of agricultural products that enables the customer etc. to easily know individual product information of the agricultural products has been proposed (for example, Patent literature 1).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the technology of the Patent literature 1, affixing an ID number, being an identifier, to the agricultural product such as a melon allows persons (for example, customers) other than persons involved in producing these melons (producing farmers or agricultural cooperatives) to<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> freely acquire individual product information related to the above melon based on the above-mentioned ID number. For this, a label (seal or sticker) having the ID number described therein is affixed to the agricultural product.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Further, the technology of the Patent literature 1 causes a computer system installed in a separately-installed neutral engine (for example, a database agency) to store the individual product information related to the agriculture product together with the above-mentioned ID number, and structures a database. The producer transmits the above-mentioned ID number to this computer system, and together with it, transmits the production district, the producer name, the variety, the cultivation method, the harvest day and the quality information (a sugar content etc.) each of which is the individual product information of the above agriculture product.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">At least one computer is installed in the shop of the retailer and the home of the customer, and together with it, the computer is connected to the above-mentioned computer system via a general public circuit in a manner of free communication. And the shop of the retailer and the customer transmit the ID number described in the label affixed to the agriculture product to the computer system, thereby making it possible to acquire the individual product information related to the agriculture product to be specified by the above ID number.</p><heading id="h0003">[CITATION LIST]</heading><heading id="h0004">[PATENT LITERATURE]</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">PTL 1: Japanese Patent No.<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP3355366B"><text>3355366</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">[SUMMARRY OF INVENTION]</heading><heading id="h0006">[TECHNICAL PROBLEM]</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, with the case of the method of identifying an individual product by affixing the label (seal or sticker) to the agricultural, forest and fishery product as is the case with the Patent literature 1, or by a packing material etc., when the label (hereinafter, what is referred to as the label includes not only the label but also the packing material) is intentionally peeled off from the agricultural, forest and fishery products, or the label is duplicated/imitated and affixed to other similar agricultural, forest and fishery products, camouflage of the shipping source of the agricultural, forest and fishery products and the like cannot be prevented.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Further, it is also thinkable to burry an IC tag or something like it into the agricultural, forest and fishery product instead of the appendix like the label; however, a commodity value declines due to damaging to the agricultural, forest and fishery product and the like. Further, there is a problem that employing the IC tag leads to a high cost as an entirety of the system.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Thereupon, the present invention has been accomplished in consideration of the above-mentioned problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a distribution management system and a distribution management method that make it possible to perform the distribution management of the agricultural, forest and fishery product without necessitating a special device such as the IC tag, and a device, a label and a program used by them.</p><heading id="h0007">[SOLUTION TO PROBLEM]</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention is a distribution management system of an agricultural, forest and fishery product, comprising: a first imaging means that images an epidermal pattern in a predetermined collation area of the agricultural, forest and fishery product to be produced or shipped by a producer or a distributor;

Thus, the agricultural, forest and fishery product for which the present invention is applied is not particularly limited so far as the epidermal pattern of the agricultural, forest and fishery product is distinctive, and as the agricultural, forest and fishery product of which the epidermal pattern is distinctive, there exist, for example, a melon, a strawberry, an apple, a lemon, a pear, a mandarin, a flesh flower, fishery products, wood, and the like. Further, as the epidermal pattern of the agricultural, forest and fishery product, for example, a surface pattern of the melon, a grain of a seed of the surface of the strawberry, a leaf vein of the flesh flower, a scale of the fish, a grain and annual ring of the wood, and the like. Additionally, in the following, the melon is exemplified as the agricultural, forest and fishery product for explanation.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Further, the so-called producer or distributor is a concept including persons who are engaged in the production (producing farmers or agricultural cooperatives), persons who perform the quality management of the agricultural, forest and fishery product in the distribution stage, and the like.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Further, the so-called collation area is an area of one part of the epidermal of the agricultural, forest and fishery product that is used for performing the collation of the agricultural, forest and fishery product. A position of the collation area does not matter; however, it is preferable to define an area adjacent to a thing that becomes a reference for a position and a direction of the image, as the collation area, in consideration of a load etc. of a collation process to be later described.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As an example of a setting the position of the collation area, there exists the method of setting the collation area with the label (for example, the label having a local organization brand described therein, the label indicative of the producer, and the like) to be affixed to the agricultural, forest and fishery product taken as a reference. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, with a label 10 affixed to the melon taken as a reference, the collation area of which the size is equal to that of the label 10 is set in a position below it. Setting the collation area in such a manner makes it possible to surely identify the position (upper, lower, left, and right) of the collation area by taking the label 10 as a reference because the same type of the label is normally used as the label 10. Additionally, the above-mentioned example is one example, and the method of setting the collation area is not limited hereto. For example, a scope that is a multiple in length and breadth of the size of the brand label 10 can be defined as the collation area in some cases,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> and the setting can be made in such a manner that the setting position of the collation area is a center of the label 10 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> in some cases. Besides, in addition to directly affixing the label to the agricultural, forest and fishery product, in a situation in which the agricultural, forest and fishery product is packed with a transparent package, the label affixed to the above package may be taken as a reference.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Further, as another method of setting the collation area, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, it is also possible to mount a transparent portion 11 through which the epidermal pattern can be seen onto the label, and define a scope of the above transparent portion 11 as the collation area. Additionally, the transparent portion 11 may be positioned in the upper side or the lower side of the area in which characters etc. are described. Further, instead of the transparent portion 11, the opening portion may be used. In addition, with regard to the strawberry etc., the strawberry etc. may be crammed in a pack with a window that is partially transparent or partially opened, to set the portion of the window that is transparent or opened as the collation area.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The above-described position of the collation area has been set with the label etc. taken as a reference; however, a thing that becomes a reference may be set for the agricultural, forest and fishery product itself to define a predetermined scope with this taken as a reference as the collation area. For example, "operculum", "navel", "plant stem" and the like of the agricultural, forest and fishery product are listed. An example of setting the collation area with the operculum taken as a reference is shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Next, a configuration of each unit will be explained.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The imaging unit 1, which exists in the side of persons who are engaged in the production (producing farmers or agricultural cooperatives), and persons who perform the quality management of the agricultural, forest and fishery product in the distribution stage, performs the imaging of the collation area of the agricultural, forest and fishery product that is performed by the producer etc. A special device for imaging the collation area of the agricultural, forest and fishery product may be installed onto the imaging unit 1; however, a digital camera, a mobile telephone and the like provided with CCD, CMOS and the like may be used. Further, any file format of the imaged image may be used, and JPEG and the like may be used.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The image characteristic extraction unit 2 extracts the image characteristic of the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> epidermal pattern in the collation area from the image imaged by the imaging unit 1. For the extraction of the image characteristics, the extraction technology of a fingerprint such as a luminance value of the image, a characteristic point thereof, an inflection point of a line of binary images, an intersection point thereof, an endpoint thereof, and a center point thereof can be used. The image characteristics extracted in such a manner are stored in the storage unit 3.

Herein, with regard to the collation method of the image characteristic, for example, the endpoint, the intersection point and an angle of a line of the epidermal pattern are defined as a characteristic point (with the case of the epidermal pattern of the strawberry, the center of a spot of the epidermal is defined as a characteristic point), the collation is performed for an arrangement of the characteristic points, and the image characteristic is determined to be identical when the number of sets of the characteristic points existing in an identical position (a range within a certain threshold) is equal<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> to more than to a constant number. The existing technology of the fingerprint collation can be used for such a collation technology.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">As mentioned above, this exemplary embodiment makes it possible to determine genuineness or spuriousness of the agricultural, forest and fishery product without necessitating a special tag, to perform the distribution management of the agricultural, forest and fishery product that is formally shipped from the producer and the wholesaler of the agricultural, forest and fishery product, and to prevent the camouflage such as replacement.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Further, storing the image of the epidermal pattern of the agricultural, forest and fishery product correspondingly to production information such as the production district, the producer name, the variety, the cultivation method, the harvest day, the quality information (the sugar content etc.) and readiness to eat of the above agricultural, forest and fishery product, distribution information such as the shipping location and the shipping date, and the like enables the consumer side to know the history information as well of the above agricultural, forest and fishery product.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Hereinafter, a specific example of the distribution management system in the above-described exemplary embodiment will be described.
