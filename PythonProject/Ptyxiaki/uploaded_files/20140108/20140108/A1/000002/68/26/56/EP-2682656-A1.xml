<ul><li>an annular clip body with an opening for attaching the pipe clip around the pipe, which opening is delimited by a first and a second end of the clip body, a first and second flange being monolithically formed with the clip body at the first and second end respectively and extending in a radial direction,</li><li>a male fastening element comprising a head and a shank, the shank being associated with the first end and the head engaging the second end of the clip body for tightening the first and second end of the clip body together in a mounted state, and</li><li>a washer with an opening for the shank of the male fastening element,</li></ul>
wherein the second flange is provided with an opening adapted to allow the head of the male fastening element to pass through, and<br/>
wherein said washer in a mounted state of the pipe clip engages on one side the second flange in an area surrounding said opening in the second flange and engages on an opposite side the head of the male fastening element.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP1933072A2"><text>EP 1 933 072 A2</text></patcit> a pipe clip is disclosed which has a swivelling retaining plate with a slot open on one end. The head of the male fastening element pushes against an underside of the swivelling plate which makes it swivel. When the head has passed the edge of the retaining plate, the shank of the male fastening element is introduced in the open slot and the plate grips behind the head, whereby the head cannot be withdrawn anymore through the opening in the flange.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is an object of the invention to provide an alternative solution.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">This object is achieved according to one aspect of the invention by a pipe clip of the type mentioned in the preamble, wherein in an open state of the pipe clip the washer is pre-mounted as a collar surrounding the shank adjacent the head of the male fastening element, the washer being a resilient part adapted to be subjected to a reduction of its outer diameter upon passing through the opening in the second flange with the head of the male fastening element and adapted to expand again after it has passed through said opening so as to engage the area surrounding said opening upon tightening together of the first and second end of the clip body.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">This aspect of the invention provides a washer mounted to the male fastening element which provides on the one hand a retaining means for retaining the pipe clip in a preliminary closed state after the head of the male fastening element is pushed through. On<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the other hand, when the ends of the pipe clip body are tightened towards each other by means of the male fastening element, the washer provides a spring washer that prevents loosening of the male fastening element e.g. by vibrations.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In a practical embodiment the pipe clip body is made of metal. It is however also possible to have a pipe clip body made of another suitable material, e.g. plastic.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In a possible embodiment the washer may comprise a base ring and resilient lips extending from said base ring. In a further embodiment, the lips form a flaring collar.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The washer may be attached to the male fastening element in several ways. For example, the shank of the male fastening element may have a male thread and the base ring may be provided with an inner thread adapted to cooperate with the male thread on the shank. In this way the washer can be screwed on the shank of the male fastening element.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Another option is to clamp the base ring portion around the shank of the male fastening element.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Yet another option is that the shank of the male fastening element has a portion with a male thread and a non-threaded portion extending between the head and the threaded portion, wherein the base ring in use is extending coaxially with said non-threaded portion. In such an embodiment the base ring portion may be slided over the shank of the male fastening element, before the thread is made. Thus, the base ring portion is slided over a smooth surface towards the head. When the washer is in place adjacent the head, the shank portion not covered by the base ring can be provided with the thread. The thread gives the shank a slightly larger diameter, whereby the base ring portion is retained in its position adjacent the head.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is also conceivable to attach the washer to the shank by other suitable means, e.g. by using an adhesive or welding.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The washer may be made of any suitable material which provides the resiliency and the strength for the retaining function. Preferably, the washer is made from metal. However, it is also conceivable to make the washer from plastic. In particular it is conceivable to make the washer as a composite part of metal and plastic I the latter case metal elements may be embedded in a plastic part made by injection moulding, wherein the plastic parts provided the necessary resiliency and the metal elements provide the necessary strength.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Another aspect of the invention proposes a pipe clip of the type mentioned in the preamble, wherein<br/>

It is however also possible to have a pipe clip body made of another suitable material, e.g. plastic.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In a possible further embodiment the washer may comprise a base ring and resilient lips extending from said base ring. The base ring is used to mount the washer to the second flange, and the resilient lips define with their ends an opening which is expanded when the the head of the male fastening element is pushed through it. In a possible embodiment the resilient lips are flaring inwardly from the base ring.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In a possible embodiment the resilient lips form a segmented conical ring, which has a concave side which is turned to the second flange and which in use is engaged by the head of the male fastening element when said head is passing through the opening in the second flange and through the washer.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The washer may be attached in several ways to the second flange.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In one embodiment the washer is attached to an edge of the opening in the second flange. To that end the base ring may have a portion that extends through the opening in the second flange. The opening in the second flange may for example be provided with an inner thread, and said base ring portion of the washer may be provided with a male thread adapted to cooperate with said inner thread.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Another possibility is to provide the base ring portion with one or more outwardly extending lugs which engage behind the edge of the opening in the second flange when the base ring portion is inserted in said opening, e.g. by a snap fit, so as to secure the base ring in said opening.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">It is also possible that the base ring portion has an outer diameter which snuggly fits in the opening in the second flange.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In another embodiment the base ring, preferably plate shaped, may be attached to an edge of the flange instead of the opening in the flange. To this end the base ring may be<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> provided with gripping formations which grip around one or more edges of the flange. The edge of the flange may be provided with recesses to receive such gripping formations.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In yet another aspect of the invention proposes a pipe clip of the type mentioned in the preamble, wherein<br/>
the washer is a portion of the second flange monolithically formed therewith,<br/>
the washer in the mounted state of the pipe clip surrounds the shank of the male fastening element, and<br/>
the washer has a resilient portion having an opening, adapted to resiliently expand from an original dimension to a dimension which allows the head of the male fastening element to pass through and adapted to resiliently return to the original dimension again such that the washer engages behind said head when the head has passed through.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">This aspect of the invention provides an integrally formed washer on the second flange of the pipe clip body which provides on the one hand a retaining means for retaining the pipe clip in a preliminary closed state after the head of the male fastening element is pushed through said washer. On the other hand, when the ends of the pipe clip body are tightened towards each other by means of the male fastening element, the washer engages the head of the male fastening element and forms a spring washer that prevents loosening of the male fastening element e.g. by vibrations.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In a possible embodiment the washer comprises a plate, wherein resilient lips are formed which extend radially inward, wherein the free ends of said lips define the opening in the washer for the shank of the male fastening element. Preferably, the plate is an extension of the second flange which is folded over the second flange, such that the opening in the washer and the opening in the second flange are aligned.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In a practical embodiment the pipe clip body is made of metal.

The first clip half 2 is provided at both ends with an integral radial outwardly extending flange 4 and 5 respectively. The second clip half 3 is formed with at both ends an integral radial outwardly extending flange 6 and 7 respectively.

The male fastening element 13 is preferably a screw with a head 13b and a male thread on its shank 13a.The hole 19 in the first flange 7 is preferably provided with an inner thread which cooperates with the thread on the shank 13a of the screw 13.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The second flange 5 is provided with an opening 16. The opening 16 has a diameter such that the head 13b of the screw 13 can pass through it.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Adjacent the head 13b a washer 20 is arranged around the shank 13a as a sort of collar. In the drawing the washer is located below the head 13b. The washer 20 comprises in the shown embodiment a base ring 21 and a plurality of resilient lips 22 which extend radially outward. The lips 22 extend under a sharp angle with the centre axis of the base ring 21. When the washer 20 is arranged around the shank 13a of the screw 13, the free end of the resilient lips 22 is facing away from the head 13b of the screw 13. The lips 22 thus form a flaring collar below the head 13b. The circumference of the collar of lips 22 at its end remote from the head 13b has a diameter which is larger than the diameter of the head 13b and larger than the diameter of the opening 16 in the second flange 5.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">When the pipe clip 1 is brought from an open state (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>) to a closed state (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>), the head 13b is moved through the opening 16. At some point the lips 22 of the collar will engage the edge of the opening 16. Due to the pressure subjected by said edge to the lips 22, the lips 22 will resiliently flex inward to a smaller diameter, such that the collar of lips 22 can pass through the opening 16. When the lips 22 have passed the opening 16, they will resiliently flex back to their original position and the ends of the diametrical opposite lips 22 will have a larger mutual distance than the diameter of the opening 16. Thereby the lips 22 cannot be moved back through the opening 16 and thus the pipe clip is retained in a pre-mounting closed state (see <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>). From this state the screw 13 can be tightened and thereby the pipe clip 1 can be tightened around the pipe (not shown).

Thereto it is possible to give the base ring an inner diameter which corresponds to the outer diameter of the shank. The base ring may in this embodiment be provided with an axially extending slit, such that the base ring 21 may be expanded to slide it over the shank 13a towards the head 13b. Another possibility is to slide the ring over the shank 13a, before the thread is made. Thus, the base ring 21 is slided over a smooth surface towards the head 13b. When the washer is in place adjacent the head 13b, the shank portion not covered by the base ring 21 can be provided with the thread. The thread gives the shank 13a a slightly larger diameter, whereby the base ring 21 is retained in its position adjacent the head 13b.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">It is also conceivable to attach the washer to the shank 13a by using an adhesive, welding or another suitable method.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The washer 20 may be made from metal, for example punched and formed out of metal strip material as is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig 3b</figref>.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">It is also possible to make the washer 20 from plastics material, e.g. by injection moulding. Another possibility is to make the washer 20 by injection moulding from plastic with metal elements embedded in the plastic. It is for example conceivable to provide the lips 22 with metal inserts, which ensure that the head 13b of the male fastening element 13 cannot be retracted through the opening 16, even if the plastic would be damaged.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref> is shown a pipe clip 101 having an annular pipe clip body.

In the mounted state of the pipe clip the washer 120 surrounds the shank 113a of the male fastening element 113. When the head 113b of the male fastening element is pushed through the washer 120, the opening 127 is resiliently expanded from its original dimension, shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref>, to a dimension which allows the head 113b of the male fastening 113 to pass through.
