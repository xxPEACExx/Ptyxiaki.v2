As explained below, in the image pickup apparatus 10, the semiconductor chip 20 and the transparent flat plate section 40 are joined via the spacer 30. The reinforcing member 50 is disposed not only to reinforce joining strength of the joining performed via the spacer 30 but also to improve reliability, in particular, prevent penetration of moisture into a light receiving section 21.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The semiconductor chip 20 is a solid-state image pickup device chip including a solid-state image pickup section, which is a functional section, i.e., the light receiving section 21 disposed near the center and a plurality of micro-lenses 22 disposed on the light receiving section 21. The spacer 30 having a frame-like shape is arranged on the semiconductor chip 20 to surround the light receiving section 21.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> The transparent flat plate section 40 is arranged on the semiconductor chip 20 via the spacer 30.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In the image pickup apparatus 10, the semiconductor chip 20 is made of silicon. The light receiving section 21 configured by a CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) image pickup device or the like and a plurality of electrode pads 23 electrically connected to the light receiving section 21 via a wire (not shown in the figure) are formed on a first principal plane 24 by a publicly-known semiconductor process. Further, the micro-lenses 22 are formed on the light receiving section 21.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">For the spacer 30, a material that can be processed into a desired shape and has desired mechanical strength is used. For example, silicon or other crystals, ceramics, metal, or Teflon (registered trademark) or other plastics, or the like is used. In particular, a photosensitive adhesive film is desirable because the photosensitive adhesive film is easily processed into a desired shape and can be joined to the transparent flat plate section 40 and the semiconductor chip 20 without using an adhesive or the like.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The material of the transparent flat plate section 40 only has to be transparent in a wavelength band of light for image pickup. For example, glass such as borosilicate glass, quartz glass, sapphire, resin, or other materials can be used.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">For the material of the reinforcing member 50, thermosetting resin that is solidified by heating or ultraviolet curing resin that is solidified by ultraviolet ray irradiation is used as a reinforcing member solution in a liquid state. For improvement of the reliability of the image pickup apparatus 10, the reinforcing member 50 is required to have low moisture permeability. Therefore, as the reinforcing member 50, amorphous fluorocarbon resin is preferable and, in particular, perfluoro cyclo amorphous polymer having oxygen atoms, for example, Cytop (registered trademark) is preferable.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A plan view dimension of the transparent flat plate section 40 is larger than a plan view dimension of the spacer 30 and smaller than a plan view dimension of the semiconductor chip 20.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The plan view dimension means dimensions in an X direction and a Y direction of an outer peripheral section of the image pickup apparatus 10 observed from the upper surface (a Z direction in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>). That is, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, when the plan view dimension of the semiconductor chip 20 is represented as X20, Y20, the plan view dimension of the spacer 30 is represented as X30, Y30, and the plan view dimension of the transparent flat plate section 40 is represented as X40, Y40, X20&gt;X40&gt;X30 and Y20&gt;Y40&gt;Y30. In the image pickup apparatus 10, for example, X30=Y30, Δ40=(X40-X30)=100 to 500µm, and Δ20=(X20-X40)=300 to 500µm.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The reinforcing member 50 fills a gap between the semiconductor chip 20 and the transparent flat plate section 40 on the outer side of the spacer 30. A part of the reinforcing member 50 spreads over the semiconductor chip 20 as well. Therefore, a plan view dimension X50, Y50 of the reinforcing member 50 is larger than the plan view dimension of the transparent flat plate section 40 and smaller than the plan view dimension of the semiconductor chip 20. That is, X20&gt;X50&gt;X40 and Y20&gt;Y50&gt;Y40.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Thickness d of the spacer 30, which is the thickness of the reinforcing member 50, is set to a value exceeding the height of the micro-lenses 22 to prevent the micro-lenses 22 provided on the light receiving section 21 and the transparent flat plate section 40 from coming into contact with each other. Note that the thickness d is preferably small in order to prevent moisture penetration into a sealed space surrounded by the transparent flat plate section 40, the spacer 30, and the semiconductor chip 20.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the image pickup apparatus 10, as the reinforcing member 50, a reinforcing member solution is solidified after being filled in the gap between the semiconductor chip 20 and the transparent flat plate section 40 by the capillary phenomenon. That is, when the reinforcing member solution is dropped on the outer periphery of the transparent flat plate section 40, the reinforcing member solution fills the gap according to the capillary phenomenon. Therefore, the reinforcing member surely fills the gap without leaving air bubbles. In order to fill the reinforcing member<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> solution in the gap according to the capillary phenomenon, the thickness d of the gap is preferably equal to or smaller than 50 µm.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Further, when humidity resistance is taken into account, the gap preferably has the thickness d of 10 to 50 µm and depth Δ40 of 100 to 500 µm.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">That is, if the thickness d is equal to or larger than the range lower limit, normal micro-lenses 22 having height smaller than 10 µm can be housed. If the thickness d is equal to or smaller than the range upper limit and the depth Δ40 is within the range, the gap can be filled by the capillary phenomenon and desired reliability can be secured.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As the reinforcing member solution, a low viscosity solution is selected to be satisfactorily filled in the gap between the transparent flat plate section 40 and the semiconductor chip 20 by the capillary phenomenon. The viscosity coefficient of the reinforcing member solution is preferably 10<sup>1</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup> mPa·s and particularly preferably 10<sup>1</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup> mPa·s.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Note that, in an image pickup apparatus in which the plan view dimensions of the transparent flat plate section 40 and the semiconductor chip 20 are the same, in other words, end faces thereof are aligned, the image pickup apparatus is arranged such that the gap to be filled is placed on the upper surface. Further, rotating operation is also necessary in order to apply the low viscosity solution to four side surfaces. Therefore, it is not easy to apply the low viscosity solution to the side surfaces.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">On the other hand, in the image pickup apparatus 10 in which the plan view dimension of the semiconductor chip 20 is larger than the plan view dimension of the transparent flat plate section 40, it is possible to easily fill the low viscosity solution in the gap by applying the low viscosity solution to the semiconductor chip 20 in the outer periphery of the transparent flat plate section 40. Since an excess solution spreads to be held on the semiconductor chip 20, it is easy to apply the low viscosity solution.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Since the gap between the semiconductor chip 20 and the transparent flat plate section 40 can be easily and surely sealed, the image pickup apparatus 10 has<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> high airtightness/water tightness and has high reliability of the apparatus itself, in particular, moisture proof reliability/water proof reliability.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In the publicly-known image pickup apparatus in which the semiconductor chip and the transparent flat plate section have the same plan view dimension, in order to mount the image pickup apparatus on a wiring board, it is necessary to manufacture a through-wire piercing through the semiconductor chip and manufacture rear surface electrode pads on a second principal plane (a rear surface) 25.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">On the other hand, in the image pickup apparatus 10, the plan view dimension of the transparent flat plate section 40 is larger than the plan view dimension of the spacer 30 and smaller than the plan view dimension of the semiconductor chip 20.
