A carriage mounted in this ink jet recording apparatus is provided with a color ink recording head, a clear ink recording head, and an ultraviolet-ray irradiation device, in which the ultraviolet-ray irradiation device is disposed further toward the downstream side in a transfer direction of a recording medium than the color ink recording head, and the ultraviolet-ray irradiation device is also disposed further toward the downstream side in the transfer direction of the recording medium than the clear ink recording head. In addition, an amount of light to be applied by the ultraviolet-ray irradiation device is controlled depending on image quality, and the ultraviolet-ray irradiation device is located between a recording head which<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> ejects an ink earlier of the color ink recording head and the clear ink recording head and a recording head which ejects an ink later.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">[PTL 1] <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2005199563A"><text>JP-A-2005-199563</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, in the ink jet recording apparatus disclosed in PTL 1, since ejection of a clear ink and irradiation of ultraviolet rays are performed in a single movement (scanning) of the carriage, ink droplets of the clear ink are irradiated with ultraviolet rays immediately after being landed on a recording medium. As a result, since the clear ink is cured before being smoothed (leveled), there is a problem in that a surface of a cured object which is generated through the curing may be uneven, and thus sufficient glossiness cannot be obtained.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Here, the present inventors have carried out earnest research into image quality of printed matters in an ink jet<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> recording apparatus using an ultraviolet-ray curable ink, and have obtained findings in which there is a difference in image quality of printed matters depending on curing conditions of the ultraviolet-ray curable ink, and, particularly, in a case where image quality of an image is desired to be gloss in recording using a clear ink, the clear ink is not immediately cured after ink droplets are landed on a medium but the clear ink is required to be cured after a predetermined time has elapsed.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, in a case where the predetermined time has elapsed after the ink droplets are landed on the medium until the clear ink is cured, there may be a problem in that dust is attached to surfaces of the ink droplets and thus image quality of glossy printing deteriorates.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an ink jet recording apparatus capable of performing recording with sufficient glossiness based on these findings.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">An ink jet recording apparatus related to the present invention includes a carriage that can be reciprocated in a main scanning direction; ink ejection means mounted on the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> carriage and including a plurality of ink nozzles which eject ultraviolet-ray curable inks on a recording medium and are formed in a sub-scanning direction; ultraviolet-ray irradiation means mounted on the carriage, for irradiating the recording medium with ultraviolet rays; and a control unit that controls the ink ejection means and the ultraviolet-ray irradiation means, in which the carriage or the recording medium is moved in the sub-scanning direction perpendicular to the main scanning direction, in which the ink jet recording apparatus further includes air sucking means for sucking air on the recording medium side or blowing means for blowing a gas toward the recording medium side, in which the ink nozzles are provided with a plurality of pass areas which can record a plurality of bands, in which the ultraviolet-ray irradiation means includes a plurality of light sources applying ultraviolet rays so as to respectively correspond to the plurality of bands, and in which the control unit controls turning-on and turning-off of the light source for each pass area for ejecting the ultraviolet-ray curable inks.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the ink jet recording apparatus related to the present invention, since the light sources of the ultraviolet-ray irradiation means are provided so as to respectively correspond to a plurality of bands, it is possible to control whether or not to apply ultraviolet rays for each<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> band. For this reason, a light source is turned off which irradiates the band where a pass area for ejecting ink droplets is located with ultraviolet rays, and thus ink droplets ejected from the corresponding pass area are not cured immediately after being landed on the recording medium but rather are smoothed. Thus, it is possible to perform recording with sufficient glossiness. On the other hand, a light source is turned on which irradiates the band where a pass area for ejecting ink droplets is located with ultraviolet rays, and thus ink droplets ejected from the corresponding pass area are cured immediately after being landed on the recording medium, thereby forming an image with matte image quality.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In addition, it is possible to prevent printing image quality from deteriorating due to attachment of dust to surfaces of ink droplets after ink droplets of ultraviolet-ray curable inks are landed on a recording medium until the ultraviolet-ray curable inks are cured, by operating the air sucking means or the blowing means. As a result, it is possible to maintain the high quality printing image.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In this case, the air sucking means is preferably disposed at a front end or a rear end of the carriage in the scanning direction.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According thereto, it is possible to remove dust by scanning the carriage in the scanning direction.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In addition, preferably, the blowing means is disposed at a front end or a rear end of the carriage in the scanning direction and blows a gas in a direction perpendicular to the scanning direction.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According thereto, since a gas is blown in a direction perpendicular to the scanning direction, and thus the blown gas does not directly contact with the ink droplets which are ejected and are not landed, it is possible to suppress the so-called curved flying of the ink droplets.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Alternatively, the blowing means may be disposed at a front end of the carriage in the scanning direction and blow a gas toward a front side in the scanning direction.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According thereto, it is possible to remove dust by blowing a gas toward the front side in the scanning direction.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In addition, preferably, when ultraviolet-ray curable inks are ejected from a pass area located on a downstream side in the sub-scanning direction among a plurality of pass areas so as to record a band, a light source irradiating the band with ultraviolet rays is turned off, and ultraviolet-ray curable inks are not ejected from a pass area located on an upstream side in the sub-scanning direction among the plurality of pass areas but a light source which irradiates a band<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> recorded by the pass area with ultraviolet rays is turned on; and the carriage is moved in the main scanning direction. Therefore, leveling of ultraviolet-ray curable inks is possible by turning off the light source immediately after the ultraviolet-ray curable inks are recorded. In addition, since all printing areas are not cured after being printed using the ultraviolet-ray curable inks but the recording and the curing are performed with time lag of about one scanning, the ultraviolet-ray curable inks are appropriately wettedly spread as compared with a case where the ultraviolet-ray curable inks are cured in a separate step after recording the ultraviolet-ray curable inks, and thus it is difficult for smearing or extrusion from a printing range to occur. Further, curing can be performed without wasting time, and thus it is possible to minimize influence of dust.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In addition, in a case where colored ultraviolet-ray curable inks are formed in a lower layer, light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks are formed in an upper layer, and the color ultraviolet-ray curable inks and the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks are recorded on a recording medium, the control unit preferably turns on a light source which irradiates a band where a pass area for ejecting the colored ultraviolet-ray curable inks is located with ultraviolet rays, and turns off a light source which<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> irradiates a band where a pass area for ejecting the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks is located with ultraviolet rays. Thus, the colored ultraviolet-ray curable inks are cured immediately after ink droplets ejected from the pass area are landed on the recording medium, and thus it is possible to form a clear color image without smearing of the inks. On the other hand, since the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks are not cured immediately after ink droplets ejected from the pass area are landed on the recording medium but are smoothed, it is possible to give sufficient glossiness to an image or the like formed in the lower layer.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In addition, preferably, the control unit makes light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks ejected from a pass area disposed on a downstream side of the carriage or the recording medium in the sub-scanning direction, turns off a light source which irradiates a band where the pass area for ejecting the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks is located with ultraviolet rays, and turns on a light source which irradiates a band disposed on an upstream side in the sub-scanning direction of the pass area for ejecting the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks with ultraviolet rays. Therefore, when scanning is performed while moving the carriage or the recording medium in one direction,<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> ink droplets of the ultraviolet-ray curable inks ejected from the pass area are not cured immediately after being landed on the recording medium but are smoothed, and are irradiated with ultraviolet rays so as to be cured in subsequent scannings. Thus, since the ultraviolet-ray curable inks can be cured in a state of being sufficiently smoothed without changing movement directions of the carriage or the recording medium, it is possible to efficiently perform glossy recording. For this reason, for example, an image may be formed using colored ultraviolet-ray curable inks in a first layer, and the image may be coated with light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks in a second layer so as to have glossiness. In addition, in a recording medium on which an image has already been formed, the image may be coated with light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks as a first layer so as to have glossiness.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In this case, the ultraviolet-ray irradiation means has a plurality of light sources corresponding to a plurality of bands where respective pass areas are located. In addition, preferably, the control unit turns on light sources which irradiate a band disposed on an upstream side in the sub-scanning direction of the pass area for ejecting the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks with ultraviolet rays, and makes a light amount of the light sources<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> on the downstream side in the sub-scanning direction smaller than a light amount of the light sources on the upstream side in the sub-scanning direction among the turned-on light sources. Therefore, since an initial light amount of ultraviolet rays applied to the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks is reduced and a light amount of ultraviolet rays applied to the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks can be increased in stages for each scanning, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of bending due to rapid curing of the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks and to reliably cure the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks. In addition, since curing speed of the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks is reduced, in a case where other ultraviolet-ray curable inks are recorded on a lower layer of the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks, it is possible to improve adhesiveness with the ultraviolet-ray curable inks on the lower layer.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In addition, the control unit may make colored ultraviolet-ray curable inks ejected from a pass area disposed on a downstream side of the carriage or the recording medium in the sub-scanning direction, and turn on a light source which irradiates a band where the pass area for ejecting the colored ultraviolet-ray curable inks is located with ultraviolet rays so as to record the colored ultraviolet-ray curable inks on<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the recording medium; make light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks ejected from a pass area disposed on a downstream side of the carriage or the recording medium in the sub-scanning direction and turn on a light source which irradiates a band disposed on an upstream side in the sub-scanning direction of the pass area for ejecting the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks with ultraviolet rays; and turn off a light source which irradiates a band where the pass area for ejecting the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks is located with ultraviolet rays, and record the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks on the upper layer of the colored ultraviolet-ray curable inks recorded on the recording medium.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According thereto, first, the colored ultraviolet-ray curable inks are recorded on the recording medium, but the colored ultraviolet-ray curable inks are irradiated with ultraviolet rays immediately after being landed on the recording medium and are thus cured in a state in which granular feeling of ink droplets remains. In addition, although the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks are recorded on the upper layer of the colored ultraviolet-ray curable inks which have been cured, the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks are not immediately irradiated with ultraviolet rays even if the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> inks are landed on the recording medium, and are thus gradually wettedly spread so as to decrease the thickness and to smooth out uneven surfaces without being cured.

Next, although the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks are further recorded on the upper layer of the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks, the ultraviolet-ray curable inks are light-transmissive and are also cured immediately after ink droplets are landed. Therefore, visibility of the image recorded on the recording medium is maintained, and the thickness of the ultraviolet-ray curable inks increases. In addition, although the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks are further recorded on the upper layer of the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks, the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks are not immediately irradiated with ultraviolet rays even if the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks are landed on the recording medium, and are thus gradually wettedly spread so as to decrease the thickness and to smooth out uneven surfaces without being cured. Thus, it is possible to secure visibility of a recorded image, increase thickness of ultraviolet-ray curable inks, and give sufficient glossiness thereto.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In addition, the control unit preferably turns on a light source which irradiates a band where a pass area for ejecting ultraviolet-ray curable inks recorded in a lower layer is<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> located with ultraviolet rays, and turns off a light source which irradiates a band where a pass area for ejecting ultraviolet-ray curable inks stored in an upper layer is located with ultraviolet rays. According thereto, since the ultraviolet-ray curable inks recorded in the lower layer are granularly cured, the ultraviolet-ray curable inks recorded in the upper layer are pervaded between the granularly cured ultraviolet-ray curable inks in the lower layer, and are combined with the adjacent ink droplets, thereby promoting leveling. Therefore, it is possible to perform recording with more sufficient glossiness.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A printing method using any one of the above-described ink jet recording apparatuses, in which the light source irradiating the band where the pass area for ejecting light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks is located with ultraviolet rays is turned off, and the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks are recorded on a recording medium, the method including a step of turning on the light source irradiating the band where a pass area disposed further toward an upstream side of the carriage or the recording medium in the sub-scanning direction than the pass area for ejecting the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks is located with ultraviolet rays, so as to cure the ultraviolet-ray curable inks recorded on the recording medium in subsequent<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> scannings; and a step of sucking air on the recording medium side by operating the air sucking means or a step of blowing a gas toward the recording medium side by operating the blowing means before, when, or after the ultraviolet-ray curable inks are ejected.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">According to the printing method related to the present invention, ink droplets of the ultraviolet-ray curable inks ejected from the pass area are not cured immediately after being landed on the recording medium but are smoothed, and are irradiated with ultraviolet rays so as to be cured in subsequent scannings. Therefore, it is possible to perform recording with sufficient glossiness. Further, since movement directions of the carriage or the recording medium are not required to be changed, it is possible to efficiently perform glossy recording.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In addition, it is possible to prevent printing image quality from deteriorating due to attachment of dust to surfaces of ink droplets after ink droplets of ultraviolet-ray curable inks are landed on a recording medium until the ultraviolet-ray curable inks are cured, by operating the air sucking means or the blowing means. As a result, it is possible to maintain printing image quality in high quality.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In this case, preferably, the light source is turned on<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> which irradiates the band where a pass area disposed on an upstream side in the sub-scanning direction so as to be adjacent to the pass area for ejecting the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks is located with ultraviolet rays such that the ultraviolet-ray curable inks are irradiated with ultraviolet rays, and a light amount of ultraviolet rays applied from the light source disposed on a downstream side in the sub-scanning direction is smaller than a light amount of ultraviolet rays applied from the light source disposed on an upstream side in the sub-scanning direction. Therefore, since an initial light amount of ultraviolet rays applied to the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks is reduced and a light amount of ultraviolet rays applied to the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks can be increased in stages for each scanning, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of bending due to rapid curing of the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks and to reliably cure the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks. In addition, since curing speed of the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks is reduced, in a case where other ultraviolet-ray curable inks are recorded on a lower layer of the light-transmissive ultraviolet-ray curable inks, it is possible to improve adhesiveness with the ultraviolet-ray curable inks on the lower layer.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><heading

For this reason, by installing the partition plates 64 in the recess 62, the space between the recess 62 and the partition plates 64 is closed without gaps, and thus a structure is formed in which ultraviolet rays cannot leak out of the space between the recess 62 and the partition plates 64, which functions as a shield portion. In addition, the partition plates 64 are preferably maximally extended to the opening side of the recess 62 in a range without impeding fitting the cover 65 into the opening of the recess 62, and, for example, there may be a dimension in which the partition plates 64 exactly comes into contact with the cover 65 when the cover 65 is fitted into the opening of the recess 62.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The partition plates 64 are disposed between the adjacent UVLEDs 63 and are installed so as to be individually inserted into and removed from the ultraviolet-ray irradiation device 6.

Therefore, the medium M is irradiated with ultraviolet rays only by the UVLEDs 63 disposed vertically upward and is not irradiated with the ultraviolet rays by the UVLEDs 63 disposed so as to be adjacent on the front and rear sides in the sub-scanning direction F.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The control unit 7 controls the Y bar 3, the carriage 4, the ink jet heads 5, the ultraviolet-ray irradiation devices 6, and the like, so as to perform printing control for recording an image or the like on the medium M placed on the flat bed 2.

As above, since an image can be formed and be given glossiness through a single reciprocation of the Y bar 3, it is possible to efficiently perform recording an image with glossiness.</p><p id="p0187" num="0187">In addition, since air sucking means or blowing means is operated, it is possible to prevent dust from being attached to surfaces of ink droplets of clear inks until the clear inks are irradiated with ultraviolet rays and are cured and to thereby realize high gloss image quality with sufficient glossiness.</p><p id="p0188" num="0188"><!-- EPO <DP n="116"> --> In addition, in the thickness heaping quality mode, as described above, since the thickness-heaping layers of the clear inks having thickness are laminated on the upper layer of an image recorded on the medium M, and the smoothed clear inks are recorded thereon, it is possible to secure visibility of the image, to make the clear inks have thickness, and to give glossiness to the image.</p><p id="p0189" num="0189">Further, since the ultraviolet-ray irradiation devices 6 are disposed on the front side and the rear side of the first ejection area A1 and the second ejection area A2 in the main scanning direction S, it is possible to cure all ink droplets ejected from ink nozzles through a single scanning in which the carriage is reciprocated in the main scanning direction.</p><p id="p0190" num="0190">Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described above, the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment. For example, the number or an arrangement of the UVLEDs 63 installed in the ultraviolet-ray irradiation device 6, the number or an arrangement of the partition plates 64 installed in the ultraviolet-ray irradiation device 6, turning-on control of each UVLED 63, and the like are appropriately set depending on a desired illuminance distribution, a desired image quality of an image, or the like.<!-- EPO <DP n="117"> --></p><p id="p0191" num="0191">In addition, although, in the above-described embodiment, a case where three partition plates 64 are installed in the ultraviolet-ray irradiation device 6 has been described as description of the printing process method, any number of partition plates 64 may be installed, and seven partition plates 64 may be installed as shown in <figref idrefs="f0019">Fig. 20</figref>. In this case, in the coating steps α2 of the gloss quality mode, the UVLEDs 63a to 63c are turned on, and the UVLEDs 63d to 63h are turned off, thereby achieving an effect equivalent to a case of reducing an amount of light emitted from the UVLEDs 63 disposed in the area B2.</p><p id="p0192" num="0192">Further, although, in the above-described embodiment, a description has been made that ink droplets are ejected only in the forward path of the carriage 4 moving in the main scanning direction S in the description of the printing control method, ink droplets may be ejected in both of forward path and return path of the carriage 4 moving in the main scanning direction S.</p><p id="p0193" num="0193">In addition, although, in the above-described embodiment, a description has been made that all the UVLEDs 63 are turned on in the image recording steps α1 of the gloss quality mode, for example, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0021">Fig. 22</figref>, the UVLEDs 63 disposed in<!-- EPO <DP n="118"> --> the area B3 and the area B4 may be turned off in order to suppress color inks from being excessively cured. Thus, since the color inks are not irradiated with ultraviolet rays until the coating steps α2 after being irradiated with the ultraviolet rays during the second pass recording, the color inks are suppressed from being much cured, thereby increasing adhesiveness of the color inks and the clear inks.</p><p id="p0194" num="0194">In addition, although, in the above-described embodiment, a description has been made that three kinds of steps including the image recording and the coating steps β1, the thickness heaping steps β2, and the gloss process steps β3 are performed as the thickness heaping quality mode, the thickness heaping steps β2 are not necessarily required to be performed, and, for example, two kinds of steps including the image recording and the coating steps β1 and the gloss process steps β3 may be performed as the thickness heaping quality mode.</p><p id="p0195" num="0195">Further, although, in the above-described embodiment, operations of inserting and removing the partition plates 64 into and from the ultraviolet-ray irradiation device 6 have not been described in detail, for example, the partition plates 64 may be inserted and removed into and from the opening of the recess 62 after detaching the cover 65, and, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0020">Fig. 21</figref>, the partition plates 64 are configured to be withdrawn<!-- EPO <DP n="119"> --> to inside of the main body 61, and the partition plates 64 may be moved between the main body 61 and the recess 62. In this case, movement of each of the partition plates 64 may be performed through control using an actuator, a lead screw, or the like, or may be performed by projecting a knob physically fixed to each of the partition plates 64 from the main body 61 and operating this knob.</p><p id="p0196" num="0196">In addition, although, in the above-described embodiment, a description has been made that the partition plate 64 is formed in a trapezoidal plate shape, any shape may be employed as long as ultraviolet rays in the sub-scanning direction F can be shielded.</p><p id="p0197" num="0197">Further, although, in the above-described embodiment, a description has been made that the partition plates 64 are provided in the ultraviolet-ray irradiation device 6 so as to control proceeding of ultraviolet rays emitted from the UVLEDs 63 in the sub-scanning direction F, the partition plates 64 are not essential constituent elements, and irradiation illuminance of ultraviolet rays applied to ultraviolet-ray curable inks may be changed in the sub-scanning direction F by individually controlling turning-on of each UVLED 63. For example, as shown in an ultraviolet-ray irradiation device 6A of <figref idrefs="f0022">Fig. 23A</figref>, shield means 66a to 66h may be provided on the<!-- EPO <DP n="120"> --> vertical lower sides of the respective UVLEDs 63a to 63h, and ultraviolet rays emitted from the adjacent UVLEDs 63 may be suppressed from being applied to the vertical lower sides of the turned-on UVLEDs 63, thereby changing irradiation illuminance of the ultraviolet rays in the sub-scanning direction F. In addition, as shown in an ultraviolet-ray irradiation device 6B of <figref idrefs="f0022">Fig. 23B</figref>, respective UVLEDs 63a to 63h may be disposed at the bottom of the ultraviolet-ray irradiation device 63 without forming a recess, and ultraviolet rays emitted from the adjacent UVLEDs 63 may be suppressed from being applied to the vertical lower sides of the turned-on UVLEDs 63, thereby changing irradiation illuminance of the ultraviolet rays in the sub-scanning direction F.</p><p id="p0198" num="0198">In addition, although, in the above-described embodiment, a description has been made that the ultraviolet-ray irradiation devices 6 are disposed on both the front side and the rear side of the ink jet heads 5 in the main scanning direction S, the ultraviolet-ray irradiation devices may be disposed on either the front side or the rear side of the ink jet heads 5 in the main scanning direction S.</p><p id="p0199" num="0199">Further, although, in the above-described embodiment, a description has been made that the ultraviolet-ray irradiation device 6a has the same configuration as the<!-- EPO <DP n="121"> --> ultraviolet-ray irradiation device 6b, both of the two do not necessarily have the same configuration, and may appropriately have different configurations within the scope without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</p><p id="p0200" num="0200">In addition, although, in the above-described embodiment, a description has been made that areas for ejecting ink droplets are specified in the ink nozzles 8 formed in each of the ink jet heads 5 such that a band in which color inks are recorded and a band in which clear inks are recorded are shifted in the sub-scanning direction F, an ink jet head ejecting color inks and an ink jet head ejecting clear inks may be physically shifted in the sub-scanning direction F such that a band in which color inks are recorded and a band in which clear inks are recorded are shifted in the sub-scanning direction F.</p><p id="p0201" num="0201">Further, although, in the above-described embodiment, a description has been made that a nozzle string of the ink nozzles 8 forming each band is arranged in a line in the sub-scanning direction F, a nozzle string of the ink nozzles 8 may be shifted in the main scanning direction S for each band or a plurality of bands by arranging a plurality of ink jet heads 5 in the main scanning direction S, or the like. In addition, although, in the above-described embodiment, a description has been made that the ink nozzles 8 ejecting color<!-- EPO <DP n="122"> --> inks and the ink nozzles 8 ejecting clear inks are shifted in the main scanning direction S and are arranged, these ink nozzles may be arranged in a line in the sub-scanning direction F. In this case, ink nozzles ejecting color inks and ink nozzles ejecting clear inks may be formed in different ink jet heads, or may be formed in the same ink jet head.</p><p id="p0202" num="0202">Further, although, in the above-described embodiment, the UVLED 63 is used as a light source of the ultraviolet-ray irradiation device 6, any means such as a UV lamp may be used as long as it can emit ultraviolet rays.</p><p id="p0203" num="0203">Further, although, in the above-described embodiment, a description has been made that the ink jet heads 5 and the medium M are relatively moved in the sub-scanning direction F by moving the ink jet heads 5 through transport of the Y bar 3, either of the ink jet heads 5 and the medium M may be practically moved, or both of the two may be moved.
