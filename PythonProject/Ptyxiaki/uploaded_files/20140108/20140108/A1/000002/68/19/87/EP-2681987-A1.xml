The outer shell housing 11 has a rear portion integrally provided with a handle 11c to be held with one hand of<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> an operator. A chip guard 13 is fixed to the front portion of shell housing 11 at the front side of a front grip handle 12 to protect the operator from shrubs, tree branches splashed by cutting. The outer shell housing 11 is formed at its upper and side walls with openings 11d∼ 11f for introducing outside air into an air intake opening 20a of the motor housing 20. A downward opening 11g is formed at the front bottom of shell housing 11 for mounting a blade assembly 40 within the motor housing 20 and for causing the downward flow of air from an exhaust opening 20b of motor housing 20.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the motor housing 20 is formed to contain therein the electric motor 21 together with the cooling fan 22 and crank mechanism 23 as described above.

As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the electric motor 21 is mounted upright within the motor housing 20. The cooling fan 22 is mounted on the output shaft 21a of motor 21 to be driven for introducing outside air into the air intake opening 20a of motor housing 20 and for passing the introduced air through the periphery of motor 21 and blowing out the air radially downward from the exhaust opening 20b.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0004">4</figref>, the crank mechanism 23 is assembled within the lower portion of motor housing 20 to convert rotation of the motor 21 to relatively reciprocating movement of the shear blades 41, 42. The crank mechanism 23 includes a speed- reduction gear 31 in mesh with a pinion gear 21b fixed to a distal end of drive shaft 21a of motor 21 and a crank-cam 34 fixedly mounted to a bottom surface of speed- reduction gear 31 by means of two connecting pins 35, 35 through a washer 33.

The mounting holes 32, 32 each are in the form of a stepped hole having a small diameter portion for insertion of the connecting pin 35 and a large diameter portion for containing the bushing 36 coupled with the connecting pin 35. When the crank-cam 34 is applied with radial load, the connecting pins 36 each are engaged at their distal ends with the small diameter portion of each mounting hole 32 to prevent the elastic bushing 36 from being collapsed by pushing pressure against the inner peripheral surface of the mounting hole.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, the crank-cam 34 is in the form of overlapped two disk plates 34a, 34b which are eccentrically mounted on the support shaft 31a and opposed across the support shaft 31a in a phase difference of 180° .

The stopper 37 is slightly smaller in diameter than the outer diameter of resilient bushing 36 to prevent the bushing 36 from being collapsed by radial heavy load applied thereto. When the crank-cam 34 is applied with heavy load in a radial direction, the stoppers 37, 37 are brought into engagement with the inner surface of mounting holes 32 before the bushings 36, 36 are collapsed by pressure between the connecting pins 35, 35 and mounting holes 32, 32.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figs. 3</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0004">4 and 6</figref>, the shear blade assembly 40 is detachably mounted to the bottom surface of motor housing 20. The blade assembly 40 is composed of a pair of shear blades 41, 42 supported in face-to-face contact by means of a pair of guide plates 43, 44 in such a manner to permit reciprocal rectilinear movement of them in a fore-and-aft direction. The shear blades 41, 42 each are formed with a series of cutter teeth along its edges. The disk plates 34a, 34b of crank-cam 34 are coupled with cam follower slots 41a, 42a formed in each proximal portion of shear blades 41, 42 to be movable in a lengthwise direction.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">When the electric motor 24 is activated in operation of the hedge trimmer 10, the shear blades 41, 42 are reciprocally driven through the crank mechanism 30. Specifically, the speed reduction gear 31 in mesh with the pinion gear 21b is driven by rotation of the drive shaft 21a of electric motor 20 to eccentrically rotate the disk plates 34a, 34b of crank-cam 34. The eccentric rotation of the disk plates 34a, 34b in the cam follower slots 41a, 42a causes reciprocal rectilinear movement of the shear blades 41, 42. When the hedge trimmer is manipulated by an operator holding the handles with his both hands for trimming plant growth such as hedges, shrubs, tree branches and the like, the plant growth is trimmed by the shear blades 41, 42.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">When the crank-cam 34 is detachably assembled with the speed-reduction gear 31, the connecting pins 35, 35 are fixedly connected at their one ends to the disk plates 34a, 34b and engaged at their other ends with the inner surface of mounting holes 32, 32 through the elastic bushings 36, 36. Thus, each elastic bushing 32 is interposed between the outer surface of connecting pin 35 and the inner surface of mounting hole 32 to restrain the occurrence of noise caused by direct contact of the connecting pin 35 with the speed-reduction gear 31 and to restrain vibration transmitted to the speed- reduction gear 31 from the shear blade assembly.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The cylindrical stoppers 37, 37 of stain-less steel smaller in diameter than the elastic resilient bushings 36 are coupled with the connecting pins 32 in the mounting holes 32, 32. If hard tree branches or fine stones are caught in the shear blades 41, 42 during trimming operation, the disk plates 34a, 34b of<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> crank-cam 34 are applied with heavy load from the shear blades. In such an instance, the elastic bushings 36, 36 are pressed by radial movement of the connecting pins 35, 35 against the inner surface of mounting hole 32, while the cylindrical stoppers 37, 37 are brought into engagement with the inner surface of mounting hole 32 or the distal end of connecting pin 35 is brought into engagement with the inner surface of the small diameter portion 32a of mounting hole 32. This is effective to restrain deformation of the elastic bushing 36 and to prevent the elastic resilient bushing 36 from being collapsed by the heavy load.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In a practical embodiment, the small diameter portion 32a of mounting hole 32 may be eliminated as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5 (b)</figref> or the stopper 37 may be removed as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5 (c)</figref>.
