The change of the parameters of the regulating rod 12 can change the relative distance between the induction IC sensor 21 and the magnetic component 22. Then, the change of the relative distance between the induction IC sensor 21 and the magnetic component 22 can change the magnetic flux between the induction IC sensor21 and the magnetic component 22. Afterwards the induction IC sensor 21 detects the change of magnetic flux between the induction IC sensor 21 and the magnetic component 22 and generates a voltage value. The change of magnetic flux and the voltage value are recorded.
