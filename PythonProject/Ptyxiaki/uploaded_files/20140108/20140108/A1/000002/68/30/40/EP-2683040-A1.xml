In most cases, generally a battery and an inverter circuit are connected by two power lines, and an inverter circuit and a motor or power generator are connected by three power lines. In order to prevent excessive heating in power lines due to a large current, it is necessary to employ power lines having a large cross section area and excellent heat dissipation.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example, Patent Literature 1 discloses a wire harness having a plurality of round wires disposed in parallel and a flat cylindrical corrugated tube covering the round wires. When a plurality of wires are disposed in parallel, a surface area of an outline portion of the entire wire bundle increases, compared to a case where a plurality of wires are bundled in a state of being stacked in vertical and horizontal directions, thus increasing heat dissipation performance of the entire wire bundle.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Meanwhile, a bus bar composed of a plate-shaped conductive body is often employed as a power line mounted in a vehicle. In a bus bar, which has a flat shape, a conductive body portion has a large surface area compared to a round wire having a round strand of the same cross section area, and thus has high heat dissipation performance.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In order to prevent hazards and short-circuiting with another power line, however, a power line to which a high power voltage is applied needs to be covered by an insulating body, such as a resin, except for terminal portions on two ends to which mating terminals that form a power transmission path are connected before and after the line.</p><heading id="h0003">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT LITERATURE</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2010047033A"><text>2010-47033</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><p id="p0007" num="0007">As Patent Literature 1 discloses, in a case where a power line is formed of a wire bundle including a plurality of covered wires disposed in parallel, terminals are provided to two ends of the wire bundle to bundle end portions of strands of the plurality of covered wires and make an electrical connection.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, the plurality of wires, which are separately provided, are likely to have gaps among the strands in the end portions. When a terminal is attached to the end strand portion of the bundled wires, some strands are not sufficiently electrically connected to the terminal, and are thus likely to cause a connection failure between the strands and the terminal. Such a connection failure between the strands and the terminal leads to excessive heating of wires.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Meanwhile, in a case where one power line is formed of one covered wire or one bus bar, such a power line is difficult to bend due to its hardness, and is thus inferior in workability in mounting. In particular, the shorter the power line of one covered wire or one bus bar is, the more notable the problem in bending is.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In addition, one transmission path is formed of at least two or three power lines. Conventional power lines, however, are provided separately one by one, thus requiring cumbersome mounting work involving handling of many components.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">An object of the present invention is to provide a bus bar set excellent in heat dissipation and mounting workability and capable of preventing excessive heat due to an electrical connection failure, even when a cross section area of a conductive body for power line use is large.</p><heading id="h0007">SOLUTION TO PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">A bus bar set according to the present invention has the following elements:
<ol><li>(1) A first element is a plurality of multilayer bus bars each including an intermediate portion that has a plurality of layered plate-shaped conductive bodies and terminal portions that include conductive bodies extending from two ends of the intermediate portion and that are connected to other members. The term plate-shaped conductive body in the present specification is used to refer to, for example, a conductive body having a thickness of approximately 0.1 mm or a much thinner foil conductive body.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></li><li>(2) A second element is an insulating member that includes a flexible insulating body having a flat external shape and that covers and integrally connects the intermediate portions of the multilayer bus bars aligned in parallel with gaps therebetween on one plane.</li></ol></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the bus bar set according to the present invention, the insulating member is preferably a member composed of an elastomer.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the bus bar set according to the present invention, the multilayer bus bar may have a structure in which a plurality of thin members including plate-shaped conductive bodies thinner than the multilayer bus bar are layered and two end portions of each of the thin members are joined. In this case, joined portions on the two ends and a portion between the joined portions are provided as the terminal portions and the intermediate portion, respectively, of the multilayer bus bar.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In the bus bar set according to the present invention, the multilayer bus bar may have a structure in which one plate-shaped conductive body having a thickness identical to that of the multilayer bus bar has at least one slit passing through in a width direction thereof in an intermediate area excluding two end areas. In this case, the intermediate area having the slit and two end portions thereof are provided as the intermediate portion and the terminal portions, respectively, of the multilayer bus bar.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Furthermore, the present invention may be a method of producing the bus bar set according to the present invention. Specifically, a method of producing the bus bar set according to a first aspect includes the following processes:
<ul><li>(1-1) a first process, which is a first resin molding process in which an insulating first resin member is molded, the first resin member having a flat shape and integrally covering first sides of the intermediate portions of the plurality of multilayer bus bars aligned in parallel with gaps therebetween on one plane; and</li><li>(1-2) a second process, which is a second resin molding process in which an insulating second resin member is molded by injecting a resin to second sides opposite to the first sides of the intermediate portions of the plurality of multilayer bus bars having the first sides covered by the first resin member, the second resin member having a flat shape and integrally covering the second sides of the intermediate portions of the plurality of multilayer bus bars.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the method of producing the bus bar set according to the present invention, the second resin molding process preferably includes a process in which the resin is injected to the second sides of the intermediate portions of the plurality of multilayer bus bars through a film gate provided in an entire longitudinal direction of each of the intermediate portions of the plurality of multilayer bus bars.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A method of producing the bus bar set according to a second aspect includes the following processes:
<ul><li>(2-1) a first process in which an insulating first resin member, the plurality of multilayer bus bars, and an insulating second resin member are layered, the insulating first resin member having a flat shape and integrally covering first sides of the intermediate portions of the plurality of multilayer bus bars, the multilayer bus bars being aligned in parallel with gaps therebetween on one plane, the insulating second resin member having a flat shape and integrally covering second sides opposite to the first sides of the intermediate portions of the plurality of multilayer bus bars; and</li><li>(2-2) a second process in which the first resin member and the second resin member layered on the two sides of the plurality of multilayer bus bars are joined.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0008">ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the present invention, the multilayer bus bar, which is formed into a flat shape, has a higher surface area ratio relative to a cross section area, thus increasing heat dissipation performance. In addition, in the present invention, the intermediate portion of the multilayer bus bar has a structure in which the plurality of thin plate-shaped conductive bodies are layered. Thus, even when the intermediate portion is relatively short, the intermediate portion has flexibility in its thickness direction, specifically, in a direction in which the plurality of plate-shaped conductive bodies are layered. Furthermore, the intermediate portions of the multilayer bus bars are covered by the flexible insulating member. Thus, even when the cross section area of each of the multilayer bus bars is large, the intermediate portions of the multilayer bus bars covered by the insulating member have flexibility.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In addition, in the present invention, the plurality of multilayer bus bars each assigned to a phase of a power transmission path are integrally connected by the insulating member, and thus are provided as one component. Accordingly, the bus bar set of the present invention has<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> a limited number of components to be handled in mounting of the plurality of multilayer bus bars, and thus increases work efficiency.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Furthermore, the terminal portions on the two ends of the multilayer bus bar are portions extending from the plurality of plate-shaped conductive bodies layered in the intermediate portion. The terminal portions are provided as, for instance, portions where the plurality of layered plate-shaped conductive bodies are integrally welded or portions originally extending from the plurality of conductive bodies of the intermediate portion. Thus, an electrical connection failure is unlikely to occur in the terminal portions of the multilayer bus bar.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Accordingly, the present invention can provide the bus bar set that has excellent heat dissipation performance and mounting workability and that also prevents excessive heat generation due to an electrical connection failure, even in a case where the cross section area of the conductive body for power line use is large.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the bus bar set of the present invention, the insulating member is preferably composed of an elastomer material having excellent flexibility so that the flexibility of the intermediate portion of the multilayer bus bar is not inhibited.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In the bus bar set of the present invention, the multilayer bus bar having the structure in which the two end portions of the plurality of layered thin members are joined is preferred in that the multilayer bus bar is readily produced.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the bus bar set of the present invention, the multilayer bus bar having the structure in which one plate-shaped conductive body has a slit in the intermediate is preferred in that an electrical connection failure can be completely prevented in the two end terminal portions.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Incidentally, when a resin is injected simultaneously from two sides of the intermediate portion to mold the insulating member that covers the intermediate portion of the multilayer bus bar, the insulating member is likely to be molded in a state where the intermediate portion is bent toward one side. In the method of producing the bus bar set according to the first aspect, however, the insulating member is molded separately from the first resin member and the second resin member, the first resin member covering the first sides of the intermediate portions of the plurality of multilayer bus bars, the second resin member covering the second sides of the intermediate portions. This prevents production defects, such as the intermediate portion of the multilayer bus bar being held in a state of being bent<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> toward one side and what is commonly-called a short shot due to such a state.

A bus bar set 1 according to the embodiment of the present invention is a bus bar<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> set used, for example, as a power line that connects an inverter circuit and a motor or power generator in an electric vehicle or as a power line that connects a battery and an inverter circuit.</p><heading id="h0011">&lt;Embodiment of Bus Bar Set&gt;</heading><p id="p0031" num="0031">First, a configuration of the bus bar set 1 according to the embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 to 3</figref>. With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the bus bar set 1 has a plurality of multilayer bus bars 10 and an insulating member 20 partially covering and integrally connecting the plurality of multilayer bus bars 10.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">With reference to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 to 3</figref>, the multilayer bus bar 10 is a conductive member composed of a metal such as a copper, for example, and has an intermediate portion 11 and terminal portions 12 on two ends. Each multilayer bus bar 10 is mounted as a portion of a power transmission path to each phase of a power generator, such as a three-phase motor, for example.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In an example shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the bus bar set 1 has three multilayer bus bars 10 which are connected to respective phases of a three-phase power generator or circuit. However, the number of the multilayer bus bars 10 is not limited to three. For instance, the bus bar set 1 may have two multilayer bus bars 10 which are connected to a battery; the bus bar set 1 may have multilayer bus bars 10 in a multiple of two which are connected to batteries in a plurality of systems; and the bus bar set 1 may have multilayer bus bars 10 in a multiple of three which are connected to three-phase generators in a plurality of systems.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The intermediate portion 11 of the multilayer bus bar 10 has a structure in which a plurality of plate-shaped conductive bodies 11A are layered. The terminal portions 12 are conductive bodies extending from two ends of the intermediate portion 11 and are connected to other members. The terminal portions 12 have terminal holes 12A to be connected by fixtures, such as bolts, to front and rear connection ends of a power transmission path.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The insulating member 20 covers and integrally connects the intermediate portions 11 of the plurality of multilayer bus bars 10 aligned in parallel with gaps therebetween on one plane. The insulating member 20, which is composed of a flexible insulating body, has a flat external shape along an alignment direction of the plurality of multilayer bus bars 10, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The insulating member 20 may be an insulating elastic member composed of a rubber or an elastomer (elastic polymer), which is a rubber material, for example. The elastomer<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> includes a vulcanized rubber, such as a natural rubber and synthetic rubber; a urethane rubber; a silicone rubber; and a fluorine-containing rubber. Generally, a thermoset resin elastomer is used as a material for an elastomer insulating member. Furthermore, the insulating member 20 may be composed of a resin, such as polyamide (PA), polypropylene (PP), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), ABS resin, or polyethylene (PE).</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The bus bar set 1 is used in a state where the insulating member 20 is covered by a shielding member, such as braided wires (not shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figs. 1 to 3</figref>). The bus bar set 1 may also be used in a state where the insulating member 20 is covered by the shielding member, such as braided wires, and an exterior thereof is further covered by an insulating outer member, such as a protection tube or tape composed of a flexible resin.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> is a side view of the bus bar set 1 during a process of being attached to front and rear terminal bases 9 of a power transmission path. In an example of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, a stud bolt 91 provided in the terminal base 9 is inserted into the terminal hole 12A of the terminal portion 12 of the multilayer bus bar 10, and then a nut 8 is mounted to the stud bolt 91. Thus, the terminal portion 12 is fixated to the terminal base 9 as well as electrically connected to the terminal base 9.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The multilayer bus bar 10, which is formed into a flat shape, has a higher surface area ratio relative to a cross section area, thus increasing heat dissipation performance.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The intermediate portion 11 of the multilayer bus bar 10 has a structure in which the plurality of thin plate-shaped conductive bodies 11A are layered. Thus, even when the intermediate portion 11 is relatively short, the intermediate portion 11 has flexibility in its thickness direction, specifically, in a direction in which the plurality of plate-shaped conductive bodies 11A are layered. Furthermore, the intermediate portions 11 of the plurality of multilayer bus bars 10 are covered by the flexible insulating member 20. Thus, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, even when the cross section area of each of the multilayer bus bars 10 is large, the intermediate portions 11 of the multilayer bus bars 10 covered by the insulating member 20 have flexibility.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In addition, the bus bar set 1 is provided as one component in which the plurality of multilayer bus bars 10 each assigned to a phase of a power transmission path are integrally connected by the insulating member 20. Accordingly, the bus bar set 1 of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> invention has a limited number of components to be handled in mounting of the plurality of multilayer bus bars 10, and thus increases work efficiency.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Furthermore, the terminal portions 12 on the two ends of the multilayer bus bar 10 are portions extending from the plurality of plate-shaped conductive bodies 11A layered in the intermediate portion 11. The terminal portions 12 are provided as, for instance, portions where the plurality of layered plate-shaped conductive bodies are integrally welded or portions originally extending from the plurality of conductive bodies of the intermediate portion 11. Thus, an electrical connection failure is unlikely to occur in the terminal portions 12 of the multilayer bus bar 10.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">As described above, even in a case where the cross section area of each of the multilayer bus bars 10 for power line use is large, the bus bar set 1 has excellent heat dissipation performance and mounting workability, and also prevents excessive heat generation due to an electrical connection failure. The insulating member 20 composed of an elastomer material having excellent flexibility, in particular, is preferred so that the flexibility of the intermediate portion 11 of the multilayer bus bar 10 is not inhibited.</p><heading id="h0012">&lt;First Exemplary Method of Producing Multilayer Bus Bar 10&gt;</heading><p id="p0044" num="0044">A first exemplary method of producing the multilayer bus bar 10 is described below with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 4</figref>.
