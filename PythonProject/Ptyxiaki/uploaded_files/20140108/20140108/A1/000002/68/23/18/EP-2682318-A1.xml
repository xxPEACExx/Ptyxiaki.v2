These systems are usually arranged to monitor the surroundings of a hosting vehicle and alert a driver thereof of potentially dangerous traffic situations. In order to provide a collision warning a sufficient time ahead of a detected potentially dangerous traffic situation these systems usually rely on a pre-set driver reaction time, i.e. a pre-set time during which an average alert driver would be able to react to an upcoming threat. Thus, a warning is issued this pre-set time ahead of e.g. a predicted collision impact.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, a driver of a vehicle may from time to time become distracted and thus unfocused. This may be due to a number of different reasons. One such reason may be that the driver is out of an appropriate driving position. The reason here fore may be that the driver is picking something, e.g. sunglasses, from a glove compartment, from the floor or from door pockets etc. The driver may also be attempting to check on or reach something placed in a rear seat or similar. Other reasons include the driver monitoring or caring for an infant or child placed in a child seat somewhere in the vehicle. Thus, all of the above reasons may cause a driver to stop putting full attention to monitoring the road and traffic situation ahead.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Such inattentiveness may, as a fairly secure traffic situation can worsen quite rapidly, cause a driver to be caught off-guard when a warning is issued. Consequently a situation which could have been handled quite comfortably by an average alert driver may turn into a potentially challenging situation for the distracted driver.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A previous attempt at including a state of mind of a vehicle occupant in a motor vehicle collision detection, warning, and countermeasure system is illustrated by document <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US2006271258A1"><text>US 2006271258 A1</text></patcit>. A controller therein performs a safety countermeasure in response to a determined state of mind of the vehicle occupant. A voice sensor is used to detect voice signals from the vehicle occupant. An occupant classifier is used to determine a state of mind of the vehicle occupant based on the voice signals, and a controller is arranged to perform the safety countermeasure in response to the determined state of mind. The safety countermeasure comprises transmitting the determined state of mind to at least one target vehicle.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary</b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Embodiments herein aim to provide an improved motor vehicle collision warning system which allows for a certain degree of driver distraction whilst still allowing the driver to handle potentially dangerous situations in a controlled manner.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">This is provided by a motor vehicle collision warning system comprising means for providing a collision warning ahead of a potentially dangerous traffic situation based on a pre-set driver reaction time, which further comprises means for determining driver distraction through analyzing an unwound amount of a driver safety belt, and means for adding an additional distracted reaction time to the pre-set driver reaction time based on the analysis of the unwound amount of the driver safety belt such that a warning is provided earlier in case a driver is determined as being distracted.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The provision of means for determining driver distraction through analyzing an unwound amount of a driver safety belt enables cost efficient determination of driver distraction.

It is to be understood, however, that the drawings are designed solely for purposes of illustration and not as a definition of the limits hereof, for which reference should be made to the appended claims. It should be further understood that the drawings are not necessarily<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> drawn to scale and that, unless otherwise indicated, they are merely intended to conceptually illustrate the structures and procedures described herein.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>Description of embodiments</b></heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">In overview, embodiments herein, as shown schematically in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>, relate to a motor vehicle collision warning system 1. Operations of the motor vehicle collision warning system 1 include providing a driver 3 of the vehicle knowledge and awareness of vehicles and objects that are within a close proximity of the host vehicle to prevent colliding with those vehicles and objects. Thus, the motor vehicle collision warning system 1 is able to sense a vehicle or an object within a close proximity of the host vehicle and warn the driver 3 of the host vehicle, such that the driver 3 can take precautionary steps to prevent or mitigate a collision or injury.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">One or more collision sensors 12 are arranged to detect a high probability of a collision and send a signal to the motor vehicle collision warning system 1. The collision sensors may be based on technologies well known to the person skilled in the art, such as Radio Detection And Ranging (RADAR), Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (LASER), Laser Detection and Ranging (LADAR) etc.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The motor vehicle collision warning system 1 comprises means 2 for providing a collision warning ahead of a potentially dangerous traffic situation based on a pre-set driver 3 reaction time. The pre-set driver 3 reaction time may be based on statistical data of vehicle driver reaction times. Although the term driver reaction time is used herein it is emphasized that this driver reaction time also may be selected such as to include sufficient driver action time, i.e. sufficient time for a vehicle driver to take measures, such as applying the brakes or steering, to handle a potentially critical situation following an issued warning. The means 2 for providing a collision warning may be arranged to perform an acoustic and/or optical warning, such as sounding a warning signal and/or flashing a warning light or symbol.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The motor vehicle collision warning system 1 comprises means 4, 6 for determining driver distraction through analyzing an unwound amount of a driver 3 safety belt 5. The means 4 may include seat belt status sensors (not shown) for determining a current unwound amount of a driver 3 safety belt 5 within the vehicle. The analysis of the unwound amount of a driver 3 safety belt 5 determined by the seat belt status sensors may be distributed between the seat belt status sensors and a processing unit 6.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Further, the processing unit 6 of the motor vehicle collision warning system 1 comprises means for adding an additional distracted reaction time to the pre-set driver 3 reaction time based on the analysis of the unwound amount of the driver 3 safety belt 5 such that a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> warning is provided earlier in case the driver 3 is determined as being distracted. The processing unit 6 may e.g. be arranged to calculate the pre-set driver 3 reaction time through calculating a nominal reaction time for the driver 3 and then adding some extra time, e.g. 300 ms, to allow for driver 3 reaction and action.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> illustrates the motor vehicle collision warning system 1 with a distracted driver 3. Distraction of the driver 3 being detectable as the driver 3 is seated in a position which has caused the driver 3 safety belt 5 to become substantially more unwound than when the driver 3 is seated in a normal attentive position in the driver seat 9.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In embodiments hereof the means 4, 6 for determining driver 3 distraction are arranged to perform a calibration for the determination based on a pre-determined time period of driver 3 safety belt 5 usage. The pre-determined time period is suitably an initial time period of driver 3 safety belt 5 usage during a new driving session of sufficient duration for performing a reliable calibration. The necessary duration may differ between installations and thus may need to be adapted to the specific type of installation.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">According to further embodiments hereof the means 4, 6 for determining driver 3 distraction are arranged to perform a calibration for the determination through setting a driver 3 safety belt 5 unwinding threshold based on driver 3 safety belt 5 unwinding during a pre-determined time period of driver 3 safety belt 5 usage. Setting a driver 3 safety belt 5 unwinding threshold as described above provides a simple and effective way to separate between a driver 3 being seated normally and most likely undistracted in a driver seat 9 of the vehicle and a driver reaching towards some object or the like placed in a remote area of the vehicle interior, and thus probably distracted thereby.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">According to still further alternative embodiments hereof the means 4, 6 for determining driver 3 distraction are arranged to perform a calibration for the determination through setting a driver 3 safety belt 5 unwinding threshold based on driver 3 safety belt 5 unwinding during a pre-determined time period of driver 3 safety belt 5 usage with driver 3 hands detected on a steering wheel 7 of the vehicle. Detection that the hands of a driver 3 are placed on the steering wheel 7 of the vehicle may be performed by sensors (not shown) e.g. arranged integrally at the steering wheel 7 or one or more sensors arranged to sense the torque at a steering column associated with the steering wheel 7. These hands-on sensors are arranged in communication with the processing unit 6 of the motor vehicle collision warning system 1. A driver 3 detected in a hands-on the steering wheel 7 seating position during the pre-determined time period of driver 3 safety belt 5 usage will be classified as un-distracted.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In yet further alternative embodiments hereof the means 4, 6 for determining driver 3 distraction are arranged to perform a calibration for the determination through setting a driver 3 safety belt 5 unwinding threshold based on driver 3 safety belt 5 unwinding during a pre-determined time period of driver 3 safety belt 5 usage with a driver 3 detected as seated in a normal position using a driver monitoring camera 8. Use of a driver monitoring camera 8 for the calibration process provides for a cost-efficient option in vehicles where such a driver monitoring camera 8 is already provided for other purposes. A driver 3 detected in a certain pre-determined seating position during the pre-determined time period of driver 3 safety belt 5 usage will be classified as un-distracted. The driver monitoring camera 8 is arranged in communication with the processing unit 6 of the motor vehicle collision warning system 1.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In yet still further alternative embodiments hereof the means 4, 6 for determining driver 3 distraction are arranged to perform a calibration for the determination through setting a driver 3 safety belt 5 unwinding threshold based on driver 3 safety belt 5 unwinding during a pre-determined time period of driver 3 safety belt 5 usage with a driver 3 detected as seated in a normal position using driver seat 9 integrated weight sensors 10. A driver 3 detected in a certain pre-determined seating position during the pre-determined time period of driver 3 safety belt 5 usage will be classified as un-distracted. The driver seat 9 integrated weight sensors 10 are arranged in communication with the processing unit 6 of the motor vehicle collision warning system 1. Any number of weight sensors 10 may be used, all of which may be located at various locations at the driver seat 9.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">All the above embodiments may further comprise means, integral to the processing unit 6 or distributed, for determining additional driver 3 distraction through analyzing driver 3 operation of a one or more on board infotainment systems (not shown) and means, integral to the processing unit 6 or distributed, for adding a further additional distracted reaction time to the pre-set driver 3 reaction time. Hereby it is enabled that a warning is provided still earlier in case a driver 3 is determined as being distracted and determined as operating one or more on board infotainment systems. The driver 3 may e.g. be inserting a disc in a CD player or entering a destination in a navigation system or similar, and thus having a primary focus on that task. A driver 3 distracted in this way will benefit from the extra time provided by an earlier warning when it comes to the ability to handle a potentially dangerous traffic situation.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Additionally, all of the above embodiments may further comprise means 11 for performing automatic braking of the vehicle when a warning is provided, such that a driver 3 determined as being distracted is provided still further time to handle an upcoming potentially dangerous traffic situation. The means 11 for performing automatic braking of the vehicle may be integral to a braking system of the vehicle or arranged in communication therewith. The<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> reduction of vehicle velocity provided through automatic braking of the vehicle will prolong an estimated "time-to-impact" of the motor vehicle collision warning system 1 and thus allow the driver some extra time to handle the upcoming potentially dangerous traffic situation.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The embodiments described above may further comprise means, integral to the processing unit 6 or distributed, for re-activating the means 2 for providing the warning of the motor vehicle collision warning system if these have been de-activated and the driver 3 is determined as being distracted. A driver 3 of the vehicle may in certain situations wish to deactivate the acoustic and/or optical warning provided by the means 2. However, as a traffic situation may worsen quite rapidly a distracted driver may benefit from a re-activated acoustic and/or optical warning in order to be able to better handle an upcoming potentially dangerous traffic situation of which the driver 3 was previously unaware.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In accordance with the present application is also envisaged an automotive vehicle comprising a motor vehicle collision warning system 1 as described above.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The above-described embodiments may be varied within the scope of the following claims.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Thus, while there have been shown and described and pointed out fundamental novel features of the embodiments herein, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of the devices illustrated, and in their operation, may be made by those skilled in the art.
