The diameter of an acoustic insulating shell is considerably larger than that of the hail cannon, whereas the height of such a shell is larger than that of the hail cannon.

Moreover, such a silencer can be easily applied on mobile hail cannons.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">To this aim, a silencer is mounted between said outlet opening and said outlet comprising at least two compartments which are mutually connected via a central opening, whereby a first compartment with an inlet opening connects to said outlet opening of the combustion chamber, whereas a second compartment connects to said outlet via an output opening.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Advantageously, this shock wave generator has a central axis extending through said outlet opening, said inlet opening, said central opening and said output opening.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to a preferred embodiment of the shock wave generator according to the invention, said silencer has a bottom wall in which said inlet opening is provided and which bottom wall defines said first compartment.

That is why such a shock wave generator is also called an anti-hail cannon.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In order to prevent the formation of hail, preferably successive explosions are generated in a combustion chamber of the shock wave generator which each time generate a shock wave which is guided via an outlet opening to the air layers concerned in order to create a disturbance zone in these air layers. The explosions are generated for example by making a gaseous fuel explode in the combustion chamber. A supply pipe for gaseous fuel and an ignition element lead to said combustion chamber in order to make it possible to generate said explosions.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">These explosions and the accompanying shock waves have a relatively high noise level, however, as a result of which the use of such a shock wave generator may cause noise nuisance.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">However, it was found that low-frequency sound vibrations are mainly responsible for the functioning of the anti-hail cannon and thus prevent hail being formed in the upper air layers, while high-frequency sounds carry farther and thus are the main cause of noise nuisance. More specifically, it can be said that sound<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> with a frequency which is higher than, for example, 160 Hz contributes in particular to this noise nuisance.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The invention thus concerns a shock wave generator provided with a silencer in order to reduce any possible noise nuisance.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1 and 2</figref> represent a first embodiment of such a shock wave generator 1 provided with a silencer 2 according to the invention.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">This shock wave generator 1 has a cylindrical combustion chamber 3 whose bottom side 4 is spherical, while its upper end 5 is conical and leads to an outlet opening 6. The combustion chamber 3 has a central axis 7.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Further, the shock wave generator 1 is provided with an outlet 8 formed of a conical funnel whose opening with the largest diameter opens freely and is directed towards the upper air layers.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Said silencer 2 is mounted between said outlet opening 6 of the combustion chamber 3 and the outlet 8. This silencer 2 contains two compartments 9 and 10 which are mutually connected via a central opening 11. A first compartment 9 connects with an inlet opening 12 to said outlet opening 6 of the combustion chamber 3, while the second compartment 10 connects via an output opening 13 to said outlet 8.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Said central axis 7 of the combustion chamber 3 hereby preferably extends centrally through the outlet opening 6, the inlet opening 12, the central opening 11 and the output opening 13. Thus, gases formed as a result of an explosion which is generated in the combustion chamber 3 can be led practically unhindered through these successive openings 6, 12, 11 and 13 and the outlet 8 to the surroundings.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The silencer 2 has a bottom or bottom wall 14 in which said inlet opening 12 is provided. This bottom wall 14 thus confines the first compartment 9 on its bottom side. Further, the top side of the silencer 2 has a top wall 15 provided with the corresponding output opening 13 and which thus defines the second compartment 10.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Between the bottom and top wall 14 and 15 extends a side wall 16 which connects to these walls 14 and 15 so as to form a closed volume. This side wall 16 extends in particular over the entire circumference of the silencer 2. Between both compartments 9 and 10 extends a partition 17 which is provided with said central<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> opening 11 and thus separates these compartments 9 and 10 from one another. This partition 17 preferably connects to the side wall 16. The bottom and top wall 14 and 15 and the partition 17 hereby preferably extend practically parallel to one another.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The side wall 16 thus forms a cylindrical casing of the silencer 2, while the bottom and top wall 14 and 15 and the partition 17 are almost primarily formed of an annular disc.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Further, the central opening 11, the inlet opening 12 and the output opening 13 are preferably circular, and advantageously have practically the same diameter.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the present embodiment, the central opening 11 is delimited by a cylindrical tube 18 whose axis coincides with said central axis 7. This cylindrical tube 18 connects at substantially half the height thereof to said partition 17, such that this tube 18 extends over the same distance on either side of the partition 17.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Between the cylindrical tube 18 and the bottom wall 14 as well as the top wall 15 there is a free space 19. The height of this free space 19 according to the direction of the central axis 7 amounts to for example almost three times half the height of the cylindrical tube 18.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In general, this tube 18 extends for example on either side of the partition 17 over a height according to the direction of said central axis 7, which amounts to 1/6th to 2/5ths of the distance between the partition 17 and the respective bottom or top wall 14 and 15. This height is preferably situated between 1/5th and 1/3rd of the distance between the partition 17 and the respective bottom or top wall 14 and 15.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 3</figref> schematically represents a silencer 2 according to the invention, whereby the bottom and top wall 14 and 15 are omitted.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In the above-described embodiment of the shock wave generator, the combustion chamber 3 has a height of some 1.9 m, while its largest diameter is in the order of magnitude of 0.45 m. The conical funnel with the outlet 8 has a height of some 3.55 m. The height of the side wall 16 of the silencer amounts to some 0.2 m.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The principle of the shock wave generator, which thus forms an anti-hail cannon, aims to direct a shock wave vertically upward. The energy at the very low frequencies hereby mainly forms the useful element to prevent the formation of hail. The spread of mid and high frequencies, also generated by the shock wave, can<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> be regarded as a disturbing side effect due to the strong contribution to the A-weighted level of the immission sound.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">By adding a silencer to the shock wave generator, the emission of noise is reduced without harming the efficiency of the anti-hail cannon. The silencer according to the invention lets the low-frequency noise of the shock wave pass unhindered, while the middle and high tones are muted. As already described above, this silencer 2 is provided between the combustion chamber 3 and the outlet 8.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 4</figref> represents the frequency spectrum of the immission sound as measured at a distance of 200 m for a shock wave generator in which said silencer 2 is not provided, as a dotted line. The A-weighted sound level of the explosion which takes place in the combustion chamber 3 amounts to 76.7 dB here.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The second curve, represented as a continuous line in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 4</figref>, is a forecast of the immission sound at a distance of 200 m after the silencer 2 according to the invention has been mounted on the shock wave generator. The A-weighted sound level of the explosion is thus reduced to 71.7 dB by the silencer, which is a reduction of 5 dB at the overall level.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Thus, the introduction of this silencer 2 in the anti-hail cannon makes sure that the emission sound of the explosion in the middle and high tones (above 160 Hz) is considerably reduced, such that a reduction of 5 dB in the overall sound pressure level is achieved.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 5</figref> is a more detailed longitudinal cross section of a mounted silencer 2 according to a variant embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In this embodiment, a cylindrical tube 22 with an inner diameter of some 194 mm, an outer diameter of some 222 mm and a height of for example 100 mm connects to the top wall 15 of the silencer 2. The conical funnel forming the outlet 8 is slid with its narrow end over this tube 22 in an almost fitting manner. In this example, the inner diameter of the tube 22 is equal to the diameter of said output opening 13.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Further, this narrow end of the outlet 8 is provided with an annular flange 23 extending substantially perpendicular to said central axis 7. Between the outer wall of the outlet 8 and said flange 23 extend reinforcement ribs 24, distributed along the periphery of the outlet 8.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The outlet 8 is thus placed with the flange 23 against said top wall 15, whereby the tube 22 extends centrally in the lower end of the outlet 8. On the top wall 15, fixed to the latter, are provided threaded rods or bolts 25 which extend through bores in the flange 23 provided to that end. The outlet 8 is thus secured with the flange 23 against the top wall 15 of the silencer 2 by nuts 26 which cooperate with said threaded rods or bolts 25.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The bottom side of the silencer 2 is also provided with an annular tube 27 which is coaxial with the inlet opening 12 and provided against the bottom wall 14. This tube 27 has a height of 20 mm, an inner diameter of 235 mm and an outer diameter of 248 mm.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 5</figref>, the upper end 5 fits in this tube 27 with the outlet opening 6 of the combustion chamber 3. Near this outlet opening 6, the combustion chamber 3 is provided with an external flange 28 in which bore holes are provided through which a threaded rod or bolt 25 extends each time. A far end of these threaded rods of bolts 25 is secured to the bottom wall 14 of the silencer 2. By means of a nut 26, the combustion chamber 3 is thus secured against the bottom wall 14.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Naturally, the invention is not restricted to the embodiments of the shock wave generator and the silencer described above. It goes without saying that several variant embodiments may be considered within the scope of the invention. Thus, alternative ways can be provided for those skilled in the art to connect and secure the silencer to the outlet 8 and to the combustion chamber 3.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The dimensions
