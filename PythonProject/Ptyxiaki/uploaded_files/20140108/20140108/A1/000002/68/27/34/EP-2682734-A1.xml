As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the tire testing machine 100 has a bottom frame 20, a pair of vertical frames 30a, 30b, which is attached to the bottom frame 20, a beam 40, which is laid between the vertical frames 30a, 30b and is able to move in the vertical direction, a bottom spindle 27, which is disposed above the bottom frame 20, and a top spindle 47, which is disposed below the beam 40.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The bottom frame 20 is made of, for example, a member obtained by welding and bonding steel sheets, or steel materials such as H-steel or I-steel, and extends in the horizontal direction. The vertical frames 30a, 30b is made of, for example, a member obtained by welding and bonding steel sheets, or a square-shaped steel pipe, and is fixed to an upper surface of the bottom frame 20 by a bolt, a nut or the like. The vertical frames 30a, 30b extend from the bottom frame 20 upward in the vertical direction. To a side surface of the vertical frame 30a facing the vertical frame 30b a linear motion guide 34a is attached, and to a side surface of the vertical frame 30b facing the vertical frame 30a a linear motion guide 34b is attached. Moreover, on the vertical frames 30a, 30b, ball screws 31a, 31b are provided<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> respectively. The ball screw 31a extends in the vertical direction within an interior space of the vertical frame 30a, and the ball screw 31b extends in the vertical direction within an interior space of the vertical frame 30b.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The beam 40 is made of, for example, a member obtained by welding and bonding steel sheets, or steel materials such as H-steel or I-steel. One end of the beam 40 is connected to a nut of the ball screw 31a, and the other end of the beam 40 is connected to a nut of the ball screw 31b. The beam 40 is supported by the pair of vertical frames 30a, 30b through the ball screws 31a, 31b and the linear motion guides 34a, 34b. The beam 40 moves upward or downward in the vertical direction while being guided by the linear motion guides 34a, 34b along with the rotation of the ball screws 31a, 31b. When the beam 40 moves upward and downward, its posture is maintained in the horizontal direction between the vertical frames 30a, 30b.

Moreover, to the upper end of the bottom spindle 27, a disk-shaped bottom rim 2 is detachably attached. The bottom spindle 27 rotates around a central axis A in the vertical direction by driving a motor (not shown).</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The plunger 28 is able to rotate around the central axis A in the vertical direction with the bottom spindle 27. The plunger 28 is able to expand and contract in the vertical direction by driving air cylinders 28a, 28b. When the plunger 28 expands and contracts, it relatively moves in the vertical direction with respect to the bottom spindle 27 which does not expand and contract. The plunger 28 is an elongated rod member in the vertical direction, and its upper end 28p has a tapered protruding section. In the protruding section, its outside surface includes an inclined surface inclined with respect to the vertical direction.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Moreover, within the plunger 28, an air supply hole 28x is formed over from the bottom end to the vicinity of the upper end 28p along the vertical direction. The air supply hole 28x is connected to a rotary joint 28y which is arranged at the bottom end of the plunger 28. Through the air supply hole 28x, the compressed air is supplied to an interior space of a tire 10. A bottom rim 2 is arranged so as to surround the upper end of the bottom spindle 27, and is able to rotate around the central axis A in the vertical direction with the bottom spindle 27.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The top spindle 47 is arranged within a top housing 46 which is fixed<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> to the center in the longitudinal direction of the beam 40.

Thereby, it is not necessary to separately provide a path for supplying the air introduced into the space inside the radial direction of the convex-sided member into the tire.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Moreover, on the bottom rim, a tapered section, which is able to engage with a tapered section formed at the upper end of the bottom spindle and including the central axis at the center thereof, may be formed, and on the top rim, a tapered section, which is able to engage with a tapered section formed at the bottom end of the top spindle and including the central axis at the center thereof, may be formed. According to the configuration, by engaging the tapered section of the bottom rim with the tapered section formed at the upper end of the bottom spindle and engaging the tapered section of the top rim with the tapered section formed at the bottom end of the top spindle, highly precise centering between the rim and the spindle can be easily performed.<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --></p><heading id="h0021">(Modification of Present Embodiment)</heading><p id="p0068" num="0068">Although the embodiments of the present invention have been described hereinbefore, these embodiments are merely exemplified as specific examples, and do not limit the present invention in particular, and specific configurations or the like can be appropriately changed in design.
