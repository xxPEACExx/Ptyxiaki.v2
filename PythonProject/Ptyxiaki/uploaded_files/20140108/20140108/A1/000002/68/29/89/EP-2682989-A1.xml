<ol><li>1. In the steady on-state of the thyristor, the current from one terminal to another terminal of the device increases sharply with the increasing of the external voltage applied across the two terminals starting from a very low voltage; but with further<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> increasing of the external voltage, the current tends to be saturated. Such saturated current varies with the change of the voltage of the signal, which controls the conduction of the device.</li><li>2. In the stage from the off-state to the on-state of the device, there is no current crowding effect during the switching time.</li><li>3. In the stage from the on-state to off-state of the device, there is no current crowding effect during the switching time.</li><li>4. During turning-off, the decrease of both types of carriers in the voltage-sustaining region is realized by eliminating the injection of both types of carriers into the voltage-sustaining region (drift region).

The difference between <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 4(a)</figref> lies in the addition of an N-buffer layer 103. This region has a heavier doping concentration than the N-region 110 and a small thickness. A structure of anode shorted is shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4(c)</figref>, wherein the electrode A is connected with the P-region 101 and the voltage-sustaining region 110 through an N-region 102. Sometimes, in order to achieve a better effect of anode shorted, an N-region 103 beneath the N-region 110 with a heavier doping concentration than the N-region 110 is needed, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4(d)</figref>. In the structure shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4(e)</figref>, the N-voltage-sustaining region 110, the base region, is connected to the outer through the N-region 102. <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4(f)</figref> shows the structure based on <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4(e)</figref>, wherein the N-region 103 with a heavier doping concentration is set on the P-region 101 as well as on the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> N-region102 to achieve a better effect of an anode-short. Both of the structures shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4(e) and Fig. 4(f)</figref> are used for fast turn-off and the specific application of them will be described later.

When the n-voltage-sustaining region 110 is used as base region by being connected to the outer through an n-region 102 , the method shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4(e)</figref> is utilized in the following figures, <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4(f)</figref> can also be used.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The current sources 200 and 300 in the <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2(a)</figref> can be externally connected to the chip, but also can be integrated in the same chip with the thyristor. <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5(a)</figref> shows a cell with the current sources implemented inside the chip. Here, the P-region 120 is divided into three individual P-regions: 121, 122, and 123. The N-region 130 is set in the P-region 121 and the N-region 131 is set in the P-region 123. The current sources are set in a P-region 140 which is surrounded by an N-region 132, which is connected with the P-region 122 by floating ohmic contacts (FOC) on the first main surface (the top surface). As the source substrate region for two n-MIS's, the P-region 140 is connected with the source regions 202 and 302 of two n-MIS's at surface through a conductor. The drain regions of the two n-MIS's are N<sup>+</sup>-regions 201 and 301, which are connected through conductors to an electrode D<sub>1</sub> on the N-region 130 and D<sub>2</sub> on the N-region 131, respectively. There are two insulators 260 and 360 covering on the source substrate region from a part of the source region to a part of the drain region of the two n-MIS's, respectively. The conductors covering on the insulators are the gates G1 and G2 of the two n-MISs, respectively. The currents of the two n-MIS's are controlled by the external voltages of G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>, thereby the currents flowing through 130 and 131 can be controlled. In practice, the dose of doping concentration of the P-region 121 can be much smaller than that of the N-region 130 which is surrounded by 121. As a result, the current flowing through 130 is a current with electrons flow downward dominantly. On the contrary, the dose of doping concentration of the P-region 123 is much larger than that of the N-region 131 which is surrounded by 123. As a result, the current flowing through 130 is dominantly a hole current with<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> hole flows upward. Since both of the forward voltages making the P-N junctions composed of 130 and 121 and the junction composed of 123 and 131 turning on are about 0.7V (for Si), When the two n-MISs are implemented completely the same, if the currents flowing through those n-MIS are not equal, the voltage drop across those n-MISs would not be equal and the side with larger current has higher voltage drop, resulting the voltage drop across the P-N junction on this side decrease. By using the principle of such negative feedback, the requirement that electron current should be equal or approximately equal to hole current is easily realized.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5(b)</figref> shows the simple equivalent circuit of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5(a)</figref>.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">For the purpose of implementing the two current sources 200 and 300 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, it is not necessary to divide the P-region 120 in this figure into three individual sections, but can connect these sections together, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6(a)</figref>.
