Usually in the cigarette burning process, some organics with spicy taste will be generated. If some flavor is added into the cigarette, the spicy taste produced in the cigarette burning process will be concealed. Currently used tobacco flavor is mostly a direct extract in form of liquid, extractum or essential oil, which easily leads to the volatilization loss of fragrance.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In the cigarette manufacturing process, in order to improve the fragrance of cigarette, it's necessary to add tobacco flavor into cigarette raw materials artificially. A current method for adding flavor is to spray tobacco flavoring essence, which is dissolved in some solvents such as water, ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, etc., onto the cigarette raw materials. The disadvantage of such method is that some tobacco flavor with bad solubility cannot be uniformly dissolved in the solvent; therefore the tobacco flavor cannot be sprayed and added to the cigarette raw materials uniformly. Furthermore, since the tobacco flavor is liquid, the loss or change of fragrance is easily to be caused by volatilization. Atomized liquid for electronic cigarette is usually a liquid, so it is also easy to cause volatilization loss of fragrance. In current related technologies, there is few report on preparing tobacco flavor into gel state.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">Based on the above, it is an object of the present invention to overcome the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> drawbacks of the prior technologies by providing a method for making water-soluble tobacco flavor into gel state, which can significantly improve fragrance retention of the tobacco flavor, and greatly reduce volatilization loss.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">According to one aspect of the invention, a method for preparing a water-soluble tobacco flavor in gel state includes: mixing food thickener with glycerol in a mass ratio of 1:50 to 1:5, mixing to uniform, heating to a temperature of 80°C to 100°C and keep stirring till dissolve thoroughly, homogenizing for 5 to 15 minutes, cooling to a temperature of 30°C to 50°C, then adding water-soluble tobacco flavor, mixing to uniform, and placing at least 12 hours at a temperature of 1 to 30°C to obtain final product.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Preferably, the food thickener is sodium polyacrylate.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The significant advantages of preparing water-soluble tobacco flavor into gel state are as follows:
<ol><li>(1) The water-soluble tobacco flavor is prepared into gel state in the present invention, which makes its use be easier and its package, shipping and store be more flexible.</li><li>(2) The water-soluble tobacco flavor is prepared into gel state in the present invention, which greatly improves the heat resistance, light resistance and oxygen resistance abilities of the tobacco flavor, and therefore avoids discoloration and fragrance change caused by outside influences like direct light, heat, etc.</li><li>(3) The water-soluble tobacco flavor is prepared into gel state in the present invention, which greatly inhibits the volatilization of the tobacco flavor, completely preserves the fragrance, and reduces the loss caused by some volatile components.</li><li>(4) The water-soluble tobacco flavor is prepared into gel state in the present invention, which improves the quality of the product, and increases the fragrance retention.</li><li>(5) The water-soluble tobacco flavor is prepared into gel state in the present<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> invention, therefore the prepared product does not include water, and can be kept at a low temperature of -20°C without freezing.</li><li>(6) The present invention can be carried out with low cost, can easily obtain raw materials and relatively simple production process which is convenient to be actually implemented.</li></ol></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In addition, sodium polyacrylate can be dissolved in glycerol to form a very viscous and transparent liquid, of which the viscosity is due to ionic phenomenons of many anionic groups making molecular chain increase, and making apparent viscosity increase, so as to produce a high viscous solution, which, when stored for a long time, has a viscosity minimally changing over time.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b></heading><heading id="h0005"><b>Example 1 - Preparation of strawberry tobacco flavor in gel state</b></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">85g glycerol and 5g sodium polyacrylate were mixed and stirred uniformly, heated to a temperature of 80°C to dissolve thoroughly, homogenized for 5 minutes to make the system more uniform.
